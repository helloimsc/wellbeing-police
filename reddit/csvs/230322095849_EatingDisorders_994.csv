I know I need to eat more, but it's not that easy. I just can't seem to make myself do it. I'm worried because track season is coming up and I don't know if I'll have enough energy to get through the day. And I'm terrified of gaining weight

This progressed to bulimia a couple of years after anorexia and still currently struggle with both. 
I have had 3 inpatient admissions as a teen which was  meal plan and weight gain based as was to unwell and low in body weight to receive therapy.After I turned 18 I fell through the system and haven’t  got any MH team involvement I’m really scared and feel so consumed that I’m really struggling to see myself getting better. Partly due to my eating disorder as well as other health issues I also have gastroparesis and intestinal failure so it does make what I can eat  more difficult as for a gastroparesis diet it’s mainly low fat and low fibre for ED recovery it’s very  much the opposite. The physical pain I get after eating makes my anoretic voices a lot louder and the urge to be sick stronger also as well as naturally feeling so nauseous and vomiting without making myself after meals. When I had my inpatient admissions I don’t feel I was in the right mind set to recover I fought against the system as well as possibly not the right approach for someone with health issues as was in agony from the large meal plans and even through NG feeding was struggling to gain weight.  when I was discharged a lot of MH services found it difficult to advise me due to health issues and vice versa so I feel like it’s really hard to get a meal plan or something that is a bit more tailored to those who suffer with both. I guess I’m just asking if any body has any advice  for recovery or any services anyone has found helpful or if people can recover after having a eating disorder for so long? At this point I’m willing to try anything even inpatient. 
I had been so miserable with it for years and I finally met my ex partner who was really supportive with it all eventually though after two years it became too difficult for him to manage and was understandably too much for him. The nature of eating disorders can be deceitful and manipulative and whilst I didn’t intend to hurt him I often must have through telling lies to cover up eating issues or manipulating without even realising I was doing it 😓
I knew things were becoming strained between us and tried really hard to work on my eating disorder but it was too little too late he broke up with me a few weeks ago. He was not just my partner but my best friend and I feel so lost without him really struggling. Even though I despise having a eating disorder  I feel so consumed.

11,Healthy workout routine,1,11xv3ky,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/11xv3ky/healthy_workout_routine/,1,"Hey! I’ve developed an ED 10 years ago. First, I was bolemic afterwards anorexic and after a friend died of anorexia, I decided to get help. 

Afterwards, I had several fallbacks and have been exercising religiously 3-7 days a week (mostly, weights). My longest break was 3 month maximum. 

I’ve recently discovered, I am celiac, so - I went gluten-free, take supplements and balanced out more hormones. I still calculate my daily kcal though - as I did for the past 7 years. 

Now, I didn’t workout since four month. I don’t know why but I was so sick of going to the gym and making my life all about working out. I know it’s also healthy but I wanted really for once sit with my feelings, feelings of boredom and eating without forcing myself to the gym after. Can’t lie, it feels great. Eating, enjoying it without punishment.

However, I do miss the health benefits from working out but I don’t want to overdo it again. I really sought most of my self-confidence from fitness and that started to feel so empty. A Barrys class, is not making me a better human. 

I was wondering, whether someone has healthy suggestions for a good way to handle this. I feel like many ED survivors, really put all their mismanaged emotions into fitness - and I don’t want to live that way. I want to do fitness because I enjoy it (well, I always did) but I don’t know what a healthy maximum amount is. 

Most fitness gurus are working out five times a week etc., but I feel like it’s too much. Idk. I want to develop a new routine with yoga, pilates and maybe some weights & cardio - but how to not overdo it? How to not feel shame from skipping a class? Any thought welcome.

Oh and I have a healthy weight right now. I would say, optimal weight (fat percentage etc.) for health but I know, I need to incorporate some fitness to keep my body happy and healthy :)",1679433799.0

I have struggled with atypical anorexia for 10+ years. I was always big as a kid and yo yo dieted. When I hit my late teens my weight was out if control so I took charge, I started to cook for myself and exercise and some weight came off. 

With each plateu in weight loss I would restrict my food more and more untill i was barely eating anything. I managed to lose allot of weight on my own and keep it off for over 10 years through pure starvation and excercise.

I didn't know I had a problem, I thought starving was normal and I would be so confused when people around me would eat, I didn't understand why it was necessary.

For years I chased weight loss constantly fretting over my body and obsessing over every single thing that went into my mouth. Even at rock bottom my weight never really dropped too low, i was always on the slightly bigger side. I definitely didn't look like I had an eating disorder.

When I fell pregnant my eating disorder was brought to my attention by a psyc that was managing my anxieties and I was told to seek treatment after my baby was born which I did.

Its now been 1 and a half years of seeing a dietician and a psyc and my weight is out of control. I have gained allot of weight and still unable to lose the weight I gained when I was pregnant. 

I've been told I need to eat regularly and with time and consistency my body will trust me and regulate to let some of the weight go but I have so many doubts.

I have relapsed more times than I can count out of fear but I keep going out of hope to one day live a normal life. 

Has anyone had a positive experience where they stuck with the eating and eventually the weight gain stopped? 

Any positive experiences would be so appreciated because I have lost hope.

My name is Judy Crandall, and I am a senior at a Maryland high school. I am currently enrolled in a course titled Intern/Mentor, in which students conduct independent research while also participating in an internship. My internship and research are concerned with eating disorders, more specifically how eating disorder treatment could more effectively address sociocultural factors.

As part of my research process, I am distributing a completely anonymous survey to people who have been diagnosed with and have received treatment for an eating disorder (do not have to be recovered). Through this short survey, I am hoping to learn about the role of sociocultural factors in the development of participants’ eating disorders as well as their treatment experiences. 

My survey has been reviewed by two registered dietitians so as to ensure that the questions are not triggering, and the entire survey should take less than four minutes. If you would be willing to contribute to my research, please see the link below. Your help is greatly appreciated!

I grew up battling anorexia as well as 2 other eating disorders. Recently I have been trying my best to eat enough in a day but struggle due to lack of appetite, not craving snacks between meals, as well as a busy work schedule in the morning.

Since I work in a trade I have to be out the door by 5:30am and dont have time to make a decent meal. Most days my breakfast is a to go protein shake. When I get home ill eat a meal prep for lunch and another for dinner each. I use myfitnesspal and eat protein with every meal hit my macros, but I still struggle with eating enough calories.

I want to maintain my weight, which means I would have to eat much more than I currently am. Since it is extremely easy for me to continue losing weight due to my lack of appetite as well as the fact the eating disorder thoughts never really go away, I have to battle them but its hard to.

I dont crave snacks between meals, so I am just wondering if it is bad to not eat snacks nd eat 3 larger meals instead.

I don’t know how to help her … it was so rough when it was at the worst and she was evil towards us trying to help at times (which she admits and has apologized a lot) she knows we support her but she can get very defensive if you try to talk about it. I just don’t give into her rambling about cals or comments about how she can fit old clothes… it makes me so sad to see her falling into old habits. She won’t go to therapy btw :/ and she takes adderall which isn’t a great mix.

I sadly been struggling with my ed for 6 years now. Some months will be better, others not so much. 
Almost two years ago I started dating. My first ever boyfriend, before him I was always scared to commit. At first I was very anxious because I just meet him when I was in a very bad phase of my ed. With time I manage to feel better and confortable with him.
 The things is that I gained so much weight because I tend to eat with him, or eat what he eats (which may be not that healthy) 
So I started overthinking about my weight, binge eating and all. But I manage to ""control it"" doing fasting diet and going swimming(I also know it's not the best bc sometimes I don't eat for long periods of time) 
I truly felt so much better, but when I have a bad day where I eat two or three times, I get super anxious and feel horrible. To the point where I wanna hide, not talk with my boyfriend or go outside. 

What should I do? Continue with the fasting or not?  
I can't differentiate if it's the same as counting calories or binge eating and then purging",1679341602.0

I have an eating disorder. It’s kind of hard to explain because it’s not one of the “usual” EDs, but basically I have a huge problem eating in front of other people. I avoid any kind of vacations, weekend trips, restaurants, even the cafeterias at university. I can’t visit my friends without a huge amount of stress and anxiety. It has been like this for years, I have been in therapy before but it didn’t help, and it has been getting worse again lately.

He’s amazing - he’s so understanding and patient, especially regarding my mental health problems even though he doesn’t have any experience himself. He knows about my ED and respects me but I know it can’t go on like this. I’d love to be in an official relationship with him but I get really bad anxiety even thinking about the commitment. I don’t know if I can handle the stress of constantly being afraid of eating with him. And the thought that scares me the most: what am I going to do about the whole meeting-the-parents-thing?

She will be discharged this week, and she and her kids will live with her parents. Fran is still far from OK, she will need to have a chaperone with her every moment, will have to cover mirrors and keep bathrooms locked, she still can't eat in front of others, etc. She has a long way ahead of her. 
With my group of friends (we are 10 friends), we have been very present for Fran, her family and kids while she's been hospitalized, calling, sending her letters and photos, visiting when the clinic permitted, taking her kids to the park so Fran's parents can rest, etc. 
Now that she is going out, as friends we have several doubts about how to support her in her recovery in the way that SHE needs to be helped. 
We have doubts about how to talk and behave around her so she doesn't get triggered. Using common sense, we will avoid talking about bodies, how our clothes fit, if someone looks pretty, ugly, etc. But we have several other doubts. 
How to respond if she says she looks fat? Do we cange the subject or tell her to stop? What to do or say if she makes comments about someone else's body? Should we avoid eating in front of her or do we normalize it? What activities can we do, that don't revolve around food? If our group of friends wants to get together for dinner, or lunch, should we invite her? Should we avoid talking about food? For example if someone says that they want to try a new recipe or visit a new restaurant? Should we avoid talking about vacation because she may think about the beach, bikinis, showing your body...? 
Those are only a few examples. We don't want to say or do anything that may set her back in her process (even though we know that setbacks are part of it).

I will just give you a brief summary of my background so you guys can understand me and my struggles a bit better. 
I have had an eating disorder since I was around 9-10 (27 years old now) it’s been restricting, purging, orthorexia, yeah very much just disorder thinking in general when it comes to food. 
Right now I am in recovery and trying to have a more normal relationship with food. 

My acne journey and how it correlates with my ED: 

I stopped with birth control pills September 2021 and boy… I never understood how both my ED and my very stressful life in general and very severe bad mental health had impacted me until I stopped with birth control, I started with BCP when I was around 15/16 and been on and off since 2021. 

At first it was just pimples but in the beginning of 2022 I started to feel that it was not just pimples it was cysts all over my face and I got prescribed epiduo in September 2021 as well when I just had a couple of pimples.. yes I also started with the ordinary products in 2021 as well that also contributed to my skin just gotten worse and worse.. epiduo did the same and yes I did stick with it but it was not for me . 

My cystic acne got worse for about 6 months then it slowly started to be a cysts here and there but it was still not healed.

In November 2022 it was ok but then December came and I was traveling for almost a month and after that my skin has just been going crazy bc when I got home I realized that I need to recover fully from my ED and not being in a state of quasi recovery all my life. 
So I just started to eat whatever I want and mostly sweets bc that’s what I always restrict now I have been doing that for a while and I can see the affects sugar have on my face… I want to recover but I realize that I also eat sugar for emotional healing bc I have restricted it so much.. and now I feel that it’s time for me to have a more normal relationship with sugar that also helps me but I don’t won’t to cut it out entirely bc that’s what stresses me out when I realize that sugar makes my acne worse tbh or at least how I eat it and in those quantities, my relationship with other foods are much better it’s really just sugar I have such a toxic relationship with right now .. just thinking about not ever eating sugar makes me super anxious! I want to be able to eat it here and there like normal people do :( and not constantly thinking about it… 


can someone give me tips on how to think bc yeah I am so fed up about all the acne tips that says: quit sugar quit diary etc etc and then we have all full on recovery people who are like: eat whatever you want and no harm will be done. 
I feel I am in the middle right now and even though I appreciate full on recovery and that I have done it I also start to feel that I am healthy enough in my mindset that full on recovery starts to feel more unhealthy for me than healthy … I hope that makes sense…",1679299260.0

I was diagnosed with anorexia at the beginning of the pandemic. I’ve gone through different periods of recovery, but I eventually got into good habits with my health.

Last summer, I was diagnosed with ADHD. I was quite shocked, but it made a lot ‘click’ for me, and I’m really happy I got a diagnosis. I’ve been prescribed stimulants which have helped me immensely in ways I can’t convey over text. My productivity, my mental health, etc. have been uplifted a great deal. This is the happiest I’ve been regarding my general well being my entire life.

However, there is one issue…like all stimulants, my medication curbs my appetite. Back when my ED was out of control, I often used caffeine from coffee or tea as a way to get by without feeling hungry. I feel like my medication is doing the same thing with me. I push myself to eat 1, maybe 2 small meals a day, but the “feeling” of having my hunger managed is bringing me back into the mindset before my ED diagnosis. I’m happy on my medication, but I feel like I have to look out for myself here in the long run.

My question is: are there people here like me who manage an ED and ADHD? Especially if you choose to take medication, how do you strike a balance? I really don’t want to change my meds after I found one that works brilliantly, but I would love to hear strategies in better taking care of myself with 2 conflicting issues.

However we are a very religious family. So my parents dont think it's a psychological issue or anything to do with an eating disorder, they believe that my sibling is possessed which... is a load of rubbish in my opinion.

More info of being an ex Muslim on my posts in the ex Muslim sub.

As for my question. I had no idea people would watch fat people. Also, no hate to people who are big or fat, I'm using these words to describe exactly what my sibling said. I myself am chubby and in the past almost began a horrid journey of not eating to lose my excess weight. However I am happy with how I am because I am quite fit, able to exercise a good amount before I need a break.

My sibling however doesnt shut up about it. No hate to people who wanna be thinner or lose weight. But my sibling keeps telling mg family we all should lose weight and that it's good for us. Whilst yes it may be, my family come from a part of the world where it's pretty normal to have thicker bones and other specific traits which make us appear larger or have more mass in general.

I'm hating my siblings rubbish talk and want to confirm I'm not insane. This behaviour IS related to an eating disorder right??? It cant be possession. And all they talk of is themselves how much they know food and other stuff when in reality they dont know much more than the average person. Literally all you here my sibling say is ohhh my clothes are big and so loose ohh I got energy from this orange ohhh I cant eat this because I have coeliac ohh I that's bad stop eating bread and carbs it's so bad for you oh you cant eat carbs humans are designed to only eat this and that and ohhh I cant tidy or broom the floor I'm too shaky. Yeah, I wonder WHYYY. ITS BECAUSE YOU DONT EAT DAMMIT.

I'm not mad at people who have eating disorders. I'm mad at my sibling for sharing the negative stuff to my other younger siblings. I'm mad at my sibling for thinking she is right.

I'm probably in no right to feel mad. But... it's frustrating when you cant even have a normal conversation. It's all about food. Even if I talk of other things or ask other things to get a break from it... it's like they are obsessed. So... i simply stay a little away from them.

From ages 12-18 I flirted with bulimia and overexercise and then again from 20-31 I had severe bulimia. I’ve been recovered for 4+ years now, and by the grace of God, without inpatient. I am happily married, have since given birth to two young boys, and have a healthier relationship with food. Still working on my body image and not over exercising. I still have nightmares of the ED, so of course it still impacts me. 

My sister and I are entirely different people. I was always athletic, she was uninterested in physical activity. I’m religious, she’s not. I like talking about feelings and am passionate, she disengages with talks about feelings. She likes to pretend things are always perfect. When I was sick, she didn’t really talk about it or talk to me about being concerned; she was mostly (or so it seemed) wrapped up in herself. She never treated me very nicely, but I of course love her - she is my blood. So, we aren’t very close due to not having much in common, aside from her having a young daughter and me having kids. We do visit every 2 months or so since she lives by our parents and our kids like to play. 

She is very obsessed with her looks; she gets filler and Botox like crazy and photoshops pics. She generally seems unhappy. She has always been willing to go to extremes by taking diet pills etc but ultimately she never seemed to be consumed by her size. Now she is absolutely. She has lost way too much weight, won’t eat, we suspect has done Ozempic injections, and is drinking ketone drinks. My parents are very worried about her and my mother told me she can tell she “has a severe eating disorder.” People are telling her she is disappearing but I know (from experience) that only satisfies her. 

I don’t know how I feel. I guess I feel like she has never seemed entirely happy to me, even before this, so I don’t know that it’s robbing her of joy. I do fear for her life to an extent. It just kind of triggers me in a weird way. I don’t think I’m jealous, although maybe it bothers me since I was always the thinner sister. Basically, do I talk to her about how dangerous this is?

This put in motion my weight loss journey and about a year and a half later I felt that I had reached my goal, or so I thought. 

My mom told me that I wasn't allowed to lose any more weight and I promised her that I wouldn't, but in the back of my head I felt just a bit dissatisfied with my body, especially my waistline and so I tried to continue to lose weight in secret but it was slow and in the end I didn't make much more progress.

The thing is, I started out losing weight by just eating a little less and setting aside certain days of the week where I could eat candy or have some soda or whatever, but eventually I hit a plateau so I started looking online for help and then I found out about calories. 

Ever since then, I've become obsessed with calories and I find it extremely difficult to eat something if I don't know its caloric content. I get cravings that are hard to resist and eventually I just end up binging without purging and then I feel awful, guilty and painfully bloated afterwards. 

Just this last Thursday I ate a whole loaf of bread that I had intentionally put outside in the trunk of my car and it made me so distressed that I panicked and threw away all the food in my apartment and then I locked my credit card inside my locker at work so that I wouldn't be able to eat anything this weekend. 

I don't know what's wrong with me. No matter how much I lose I always feel like I'm still that fat kid that I always was. Sometimes I feel thin only to five minutes later do a body check specifically on my waistline to be devastated by how ungodly fat and disgusting I am. 

I don't know, maybe I'm just overreacting and maybe this isn't a real problem, what if I am just a nonfunctional member of society who can't take his responsibilities in life and who hasn't grown up yet?",1679248524.0

My partner and I both struggle with our mental health. She is binge eating disorder and childhood trauma related PTSD. I’m anxiety/depression/polysubstance abuse. 

We’re both in much better places than when we first met. However she still has periods of bingeing, perpetual body dysmorphia and everything that comes with it. 

I am always trying to give advice or reframe how she thinks. I try and guide her back to psychology and she’s finally found a psych who is decent but not revolutionary. I get stuck in ‘fix it mode’ because that’s my default. It doesn’t really help but then I feel like I’m not doing enough. 

I was wondering if anybody has any suggestions for how best to support her when this happens. I am happy to listen but it feels inadequate. With my issues there’s a clearer path forwards. Sobriety. Having to eat every day but not overeat is exhausting for her. 

I’m just want to give her the support she needs but I don’t know what it is. Is listening enough? Patience, prompting reassurance don’t seem to induce her to explore other potential options but I feel like I’m then just patting her on the back.

At first they just wanted to lose some weight, they’ve always struggled a lot with their weight and how they see themselves. I support their weight loss journey as I went through something similar after I got bullied for being fat. I suggested that they do a lot of cardio and clean eating, you know a lot of vegetables and protein. They started running so much and started to eat more vegetables, they are vegetarian so they were already eating a lot of vegetables. But they became very discouraged when they weren’t losing weight fast enough. About 2 or so months into their diet they started to throw up their meals which I tried my best to tell them that they didn’t need to forcefully throw up in order to lose weight. They continued to throw up and soon developed anorexia. They’ll go a day without eating or drinking water and then the next day they’ll maybe eat a small breakfast. Any time the idea of getting food is brought up they become very anxious and reserved. They also work out constantly, work 8 hour shifts and go to school. There body is constantly running on empty. They’ve made progress though and even started meal prepping in order to feel less stressed about food and eating. I’m just not sure how to help. Anytime I suggest we eat out they either become very tense and pressured to eat or they become annoyed and closed off. When I try to talk about their problems and possible solutions they just dismiss them or they don’t want to talk about it. I don’t want to pressure them into eating or talking about such a hard subject for them. But I love them so much and I hate to see the person who I find so amazing battle something so hard.

My history involves compulsive exercise and binge eating. I'm still learning how to incorporate exercise into my life as my HP guides me along each day. You see I go to extremes not only with food, but also exercise. This may sound odd, but when i was exercising hard core, it got to the point that my muscles in my legs would crave exercise and I got a real high off it, much like binging would do at times. At my worst, I would exercise for hours at the gym and do extra at home. Where did this extreme exercise lead me? It threw my body off hormonally, I stopped having a menstral cycle and i later discovered it caused a tear in my abdominal muscle wall (abdominal hernia). I discovered this by accident one day lying on floor & went to sit up and felt my insides push out past my abdominal wall. I immediately pushed that hernia back in - ouch and scary! 

On my own, my mind can't be trusted to set forth healthy guidelines for exercise because it will always push for more and the results I want. Now recovered, my HP does want me to do some exercise because taking care of my body is important to keeping it useful to my HP. I recently joined a gym. First day i went rather than pause and ask my HP what weight machines i should do or how reps I thought i could just wing it. Boy, was i wrong. My self-will crept in, I did way too much and my body hurt bad for many days. I learned!! I start each day with step 11 and ask how i can help those still sick with complusive eating. I also ask if my HP wants me to exercise today. When i do go to the gym or exercise at home, now I get quiet and ask - what exercises to do, how much/how long.  That is all i do AND when done I feel fine with that. What's the difference from what i did in that past when in my illness? First, I'm asking now that i am recovered and having worked the steps, second I'm pausing asking for direction from my HP, third my motives are not ""exercise to get to xyz weight, body or sculpt muscles/body to look in a certain way."" My motives are what would my HP have me do to keep my body healthy. Big difference! I'm grateful I don't have to figure anything out, I just defer to my higher power and I will get the direction. As you can see I'm not perfect at this, but i have to be willing to learn and grow and and work towards my HP's ideal for my health & wellbeing. I get that clear direction only if I work steps 10-12 like my life depends on it and put this program first. That helps to keep my self-will at bay so i can follow the guidance of a much more powerful and wise source - my HP! I'm happy to chat more if anyone would like. Feel free to DM me.",1679159096.0

You always talk about step down with your team bc you never know when insurance is going to cut you. I had planned to step down with them, even though I saw 8 people step back up within a 2 week period, I was going to try and live in their duplexes. 

When my insurance cut me, my therapist brought in the head director and they told me that I was unable to live in the duplex. If I wanted to continue treatment I would have to find my own housing. In 3 days. In San Diego county. Lol. I told them I would leave.

in 2020 i had a huge relapse and hit rock bottom. i was a very low weight, had issues with sleeping and was still under-eating quite a bit. i also used the drug 4mmc at the time, which is an upper. 

me and my friends went to an event called rampage, in sportpaleis, belgium. the lights and strobes kept triggering me and i was laughing about it the whole time. until i lost my vision, fell down, heard people scream my name and seeing flashes of the people who were trying to get my up. after that, i was gone for about an hour. 

(while i was gone)
my boyfriend drag/lifted me to the bar to desperately ask where the ER was at the venue. he got me there and and they pit me on a table. when they woke me the splashed water in my face, and it worked.

i was super spacey and they asked me what drug i used and i just told them. they did diagnosed it as an epileptic seizure. i never thought id be the one experiencing this kind of thing. they tried to find my heartbeat and they could eventually (i was wearing nail polish). they also did a little blood thingy on my index finger to check on stuff i guess.

they let me and my bf go and i was shocked. my sister and a few of my friends were waiting for me outside of the ER. cuz they would only let my bf go with me.


now since this moment ive experienced these triggers almost every day, and i can only just handle lights at parties. i got diagnosed with epilepsy triggered by flashing lights last month. and i just want to know. is it possible that my anorexia has made my epilepsy more severe than it used to be?

i can't find any articles that say so. so im asking to share your experience if you feel the same way.

i last night figured out that my epilepsy is way more in the foreground when i use ketamine, while when i do coke, it helps me deal with the lights.

I saw several things that I wanted. They are junk food from childhood. I am in the habit of always saying no to such things. I feel a sense of sadness that I don’t let myself get them but I also feel like it’s justified because there are processed. I wanted to eat these things as a child and I was not allowed because of a restrictive parent. As an adult who falls into the overweight category and is focused on health I am looking for tips and ways to look at these situations that allow me to heal. Like if my inner child is dying for a treat what would be the best thing to do? I feel a bit of anguish and overwhelm at the grocery store and eating around other people so I think it would be helpful for me to work on this inner conflict.

87,Finally getting help and waiting to get treatment but now what?,1,11ufob1,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/11ufob1/finally_getting_help_and_waiting_to_get_treatment/,0,"I am wondering if anyone can share their experience with ""waiting"" for treatment. 

I have suffered with Bulimia and Binge Eating Disorder for around 12 years now. I went through a 12 week CBT treatment program 3 years ago as an out patient and it was incredibly helpful. The clinic was 2 hours away, as we dont have anything local so had to be weekly visits. I saw some huge changes in my thoughts, behaviours and mood. I fell pregnant around the 10th week and decided pull out of the treatment and continue seeing my Psychologist locally and she was willing to continue the treatment as best she could. 

Everything was going incredibly well and I finally felt like I could finally be normal again. But then my Psychologist closed her clinic out of the blue. I learned a month later that she is having serious health issues and needs to step away to focus on her own recovery. Which is perfectly fine, and I also want the best for her, and want her to recover and be healthy. But it felt like a stab in the heart, almost like a break up. And I didn't know what to do, I was seeing her for 5 plus years, and she was the first and only Psychologist I had ever seen. 

Fast forward to about 2 months ago, I noticed that my ED had gotten to the worst it has ever been, so I went to my Dr and she referred my to a new Psychologist, and I am extremely happy with her, but I still felt like I was getting worse and not better. 

For the 10 plus years I have suffered with an eating disorder, I have never experienced any physical symptoms besides very sensitive teeth from purging. But 2 weeks ago I noticed my hair was starting fall out, and my nails are very brittle, and one just fell off! I started panicking and went to my Dr and Psychologist and asked if I could please get help as soon as possible. My Psychologist suggested a 2 week in patient program, I told her I don't know if my husband would be OK to be with our 2.5 year old on his own for that long, or if my work will be OK without me. I finally got the courage to ask my boss (step mum) and she was completely OK with me taking time off, and after chatting with my husband he was also 100% all for it. So with this assurance I felt very great about finally getting help. 

But now what... I have to wait for the clinic to call me and give me an idea of how long I have to wait or how long the wait list is, or if they will even accept me. I called them after 1 week of waiting as they hadn't contacted me at all, and they hadn't even recieved the referral, so I started anxiously calling my Dr and getting them to send it through again. And now the clinic said they will get back to me in a week with more information... but I am losing the confidence I had a week ago because everything is now unknown. 

Has anybody else got to this stage and had to wait a long time to get in? What did you do while you waited? Could you keep the positive mindset? How do I do that? I know I should be calling the clinic again, but my anxiety is through the roof right now. Any advice or coping strategies would be amazing, or some similar stories. 

Thank you to anyone that read through all of this.",1679118122.0

yet instead of simply eating said food and moving past it, i've fallen into a couple of big binges today, because for some reason my thought process is ""well i already messed up today and i feel bad about it so i'm just going to eat whatever else i want to eat in order to console myself and then tomorrow i'll start fresh.""

My gf of 1 1/2 years has anorexia and I can tell it's getting worse. Not just physically but through her posts on her private twt account and through things she has said to me. She restricts what she eats some but the main thing she does is at the end of every day, she walks around her room until she burns off pretty much all the calories she's eaten that day. She also measures her body with a measuring tape often. She has bad dysmorphia too and has told me before that it's the not knowing that stresses her out the most, thats why she measures + wants to get a scale. But she also wants to be skinnier even though she is already underweight. She gets excited about eating yummy food and it makes me so happy but then she will feel bad about it later. Some days or weeks will be good and we will eat good meals and stuff but then a bad day will come around and she will start restricting again because she is mad at herself for eating ""so much"" lately. She also checks calories of pretty much anything we get at the store and I can tell pretty much every day there is anxiety about ""what am I going to eat tomorrow?""

She has BPD as well and her parents are not understanding at all, I don't think they're even aware she has anxiety, so she is nervous about going to therapy or something and them getting a bill bc she is under their insurance.

She also does want to recover! Like sometimes she will say she wants to recover and then on bad days she will say she doesnt care about recovery. But she knows it's bad. She's like aware of how bad it is but also still unable to do anything to stop the anxiety. She wants to be on anxiety medicine but most of the ones suggested by her doctor have the side effect of weight gain, so it's like what is another affordable way to get treatment in college. She also kind of thinks treatment like therapy is pointless but acknowledges that it could help.

So basically what I am coming to reddit for is two things:

One, what are ways I can help her? I want to reassure her but I don't always know how to reassure her. I can usually help her with stress or comfort but I feel at a loss a lot of times when stuff about her ED comes up. And is there a way I can encourage her? If its okay to do so I don't want to just be a source of comfort and reassurance but also an encouragement when she does make progress in getting better.

Also, is stuff like her measuring herself okay? It scares me but it kinda seems like a way for her to help her dysmorphia by reassuring her that she is not gaining. I feel like it is only worsening her fear of gaining but I am not sure if that reassurance is there also. Is it okay for me to cross out calories on stuff I buy for her or is that kind of thing triggering?

And two, What are some accessible ways to get treatment? Esp. for a college student on a budget and with limited access to health insurance because her parents would not understand the need for therapy.

The headache continued the whole night. I tried to eat granola and fries, but I had no appetite and was in fact repulsed by food. I was able to eat it this morning.

I have been using laxatives (dulcolax) almost daily for half a year now and for a while I was fine physically but now the side effects are starting to catch up with me and I'm paying the price. 
I feel constantly bloated and there's lots of gas, it doesn't matter if I've taken a pill or not. On days when I skip my dose, the bloatedness gets so much worse and I have trouble eating anything because food only seems to make it worse... 
Another issue is that when I do take it, the next day my stomach and insides hurt so so much for the WHOLE DAY. And yet I keep taking it. 
I need to stop. I know that now. 
I was wondering whether anyone has undergone the same or a similar experience? And if so, how did you stop using? Would I need to reduce the dose and the frequency at which I'm taking the pills or do I just stop altogether, cold turkey? Because doing that scares me but if that is the better option then that's what I'm going to do.

Eating every other day, but only a few bites and ultimately purging anything that went into my body.
Recently I have decided I want to join the military, and in the last couple months I have lost a significant amount of weight.
I became obsessed with losing any and all stomach, face, and leg fat (knowing you really can’t spot lose weight). I am underweight to join the military and lost the only parts of my body I was comfortable with. It may sound silly, but it took a long time to become comfortable with at least some aspects with my body.
I need to gain weight, but my mind won’t allow me to put on any weight that I’ve lost although I know I need to.
Any tips to recovering? I had my first actual meal a week ago after several months. I deny I need support, but deep down I wish somebody would notice and at least be there to support without making me feel stupid.
it doesn’t help that my boyfriend will make jokes after eating a meal like making gagging references and things like that, and I deny that it triggers me but deep down it hurts so bad.",1678941561.0

128,A little frustrated,1,11sc8tx,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/11sc8tx/a_little_frustrated/,0,"So I have a long history of disordered eating, actually starting back to when I was a tiny kid (age 3 or 4) and I would restrict and not eat until I was starving. Lots of family issues I think because obviously at that age it wasn’t a very conscious thing. Didn’t really eat normally until age 12 or so and then had a huge growth spurt. Then I was anorexic age 16, bulimic age 17-23. Then just restriction when my numbers would fluctuate. Gained a lot of weight in college from drinking and stopped drinking, started exercising and happily settled in to a healthy weight. There were years I was really accepting 
I used
To be able to tolerate a normal healthy weight.
Now I feel like I have to be just a bit underweight. 

I am now 55 and getting divorced. I met him when I was 20. He is an alcoholic/ addict and never got help and refuses help now and it made me realize as I strive to keep my body barely underweight I never got formal treatment for my disordered eating. I kind of feel like it’s just never going to change and I also understand as I age this could become more harmful. 

Anyway I did decide to talk to my LCSW therapist about it. She has
Me doing intuitive eating, but I don’t feel like I align with so much in the book. I feel like if anything it makes me feel like things aren’t that bad. I don’t obsess about food. I don’t binge. I do tend to eat whatever I want, my bigger thing is I don’t know what hungry is unless it’s starving. 

Then I have a somatic coach, and she thought I should consider a full outpatient program. The nearest one is over an hour away and I have two teen girls that I am the only support for. She thinks I exercise too much even though I cut back about 30% of what I was doing, and I still compete in races and I don’t want to give that up.

Then I see a Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner who helps me with meds. Today I met with her and they wanted to weigh me. I haven’t weighed in about a 6 weeks and I asked them not to tell me.

So I had a long talk with my PMHNP and she said it’s great that I am aware and communicating about it. She agreed with me when I said I think I may never be fully free of the eating DO. Basically I restrict because I am not hungry and I am busy so I don’t think about eating. 

She said she’s not worried about my weight right now, but that I had lost some weight. So here I am doing the Intuitive eating,’cutting back on mileage,
Eating earlier in the day, trying not to let myself to get
To starving stage before I eat, and still I lost weight. 

And I know you all will understand this, it makes me want to get on the scale. It makes me want to eat less. 

She did refer me to a nutritional therapist;’they are a nutritionist but they focus on getting into the relationship with food. I am actually pretty intrigued by that.

I’ve struggled with an ED since I was 16, and I am now 26 years old. 
I had two major relapses, the last one being in 2019, when I almost went inpatient, got diagnosed with an (though I never thought I was thin enough to fit the diagnosis criteria) and started recovery. I had “recovered” before, but by myself, so the ED behaviors didn’t truly ever stop. 

I gave recovery a fair shot. The best shot I could. I was miserable and all I wanted was to be happy. 

And I was, for years. I claimed to be recovered and healed and I didn’t think I had a bad relationship with food. I preached about self love and loving your body no matter what.

But it was only “easy” to do so because I was still in a normal-thin body. 

Now I gained just a little bit more weight than I’m comfortable with and I feel awful. Not only because I don’t like my body anymore (i guess that goes without saying, being over the weight I’m comfortable with triggers me a whole lot), but because i feel like I was never truly recovered.

My recovery was fake and I could only fake it because I was still skinny. 

All those doctors, all that time, all that suffering, all that therapy, all that money just for all of it to go down the drain? 

I’m not even overweight, but food thoughts consumed my mind again. Suddenly the voice that was quiet for three years yells at me every second of the day and I’m trying, I’m really trying to fight it off. 

It would be far easier to just relapse than to just fight these urges all day, every day. 

But I don’t, because of my family, who supported me so much during my recovery (and paid for all of it), because of my partner, who is a very caring man that I do not want to worry or sadden in any way. 

The voice in my head came back stronger than ever. It never leaves. 

But the thing that scares me the most is the thought that this is it. This is life, for the rest of my life. It’s either relapse or a constant battle with myself. It’ll never get better and I’ll have to feel guilty about having normal meals for the rest of my life. 

Is it like that? Please, tell me. Because it seems like such an awful life. I don’t want to spend the rest of my life fighting with myself every day. I don’t want to keep on living only to wish for every day to be over as soon as it starts. I won’t ever be able to enjoy life again unless I regain the body I thought “acceptable”. And that is NOT recovery. At this rate, I won’t be able to get pregnant and be a mother because I’m completely terrified of my body going through those changes. 

Please, if someone also recovered in adulthood and is navigating life as recovered, please give me some advice. Please tell me it gets better. Please tell me it’s not like this forever. Because right now a whole life of this just doesn’t seem worth it.",1678759550.0

For the past few months I have been really struggling with binging followed by making myself sick. The binges kept getting bigger and bigger while the purges became more and more frequent, and I just cannot go on like this.

There are so many benefits to recovering and I know it will be worth it but I am panicking.

My mind is going crazy because I am super bloated and my scale weight went up (not telling exact numbers, but was “healthy” when sick, now slightly overweight). It seemed like B/P was a shortcut to weight loss and I thought I could get away with it, but now that I’ve stopped I feel like all of the “progress” is gone (I still need to lean down a bit, but I must do so in a healthy way, and I recognize this can wait until I am recovered). Back to the weight I was at before I started this nasty habit, and I am frustrated and angry even though I didn’t do any work to lose the weight in the first place.

This has been going on for a long time now, I fear the day won't be far away where I'll be sick admitted in the hospital cuz obv consuming all this packaged food on a daily basis isn't good for my body. 

I want to stop. And I do motivate myself, I tell myself I'll eat one last thing and start a healthy diet tom onwards, but tom never comes. Whenever I feel sad (which is quite often), there's this void in my heart which I need to fill so desperately, and im lonely and i feel like i have no one, so i turn to food. It only feels good while im eating tho, as soon as im done, i feel empty once again. And once i've messed up once, the whole thing feels pointless. 

On a few occasions after i felt guilty or felt sick cuz of overeating, i try to vomit out my food. I can't even make myself gag anymore using my fingers tho.

A few days ago I sent a pic of myself to my friend, she replied w 'aww golu' meaning chubby. Today my neighbour told me i was becoming a fatty and mentioned that i'd put on weight. I feel horrible.

Therapy isn't an option rn. How do i get out of this? Please help. Please i'm desperate",1678640006.0

A few months ago (four), I was pretty fat. Well, not fat, but chubby. I have been chubby for most of my life, and I finally wanted to turn it around once I entered college. I have struggled with binge eating disorder and I finally got enough strength to stop. So, for four entire months, I basically went on the strictest diet plan ever. I did not eat any chocolate, any fast food, any foods that I love, NOTHING. On top of that, I was eating around 900-1000 cals per day, for FOUR months. I was constantly exhausted, and I ended up with depression because of this. I also lost 40 pounds in the four months. As I said before, I was chubby, so I was proud of this figure (still am). However, five days ago, for the first time in months, I allowed myself to get some snacks (I got Oreos, pringles, and twix). And, from that day on, I have been eating nonstop, going back into my binging habits, and I feel disgusting. I feel like I cant stop eating. I am constantly bloated and full, and I really dont know how to motivate myself to fucking stop eating. I want to find a balance but I simply just cant let the thoughts about food go away. I dont know how to change my mindset about this. I am terrified of getting fat again. What should I do to stop? Thanks.",1678653675.0

It took three treatment centers and a lot of therapy to get to the other side. And as it turns out I had some undiagnosed mental health issues that perpetuated my condition for a long time. I'm properly treated today.

I (22/F) live in the UK but I'm from Romania where it's quite normal for family to criticise your weight constantly. Ever since I moved out and she started work somewhere else my mum (44) has started spiralling. Every time she comes over (I live with my boyfriend), she calls me fat including in front of my bf and friends. I am barely above the underweight margin for my height (5'2), and it really upsets me when she looks at me with a sick look on her face and says things like ""you better not get any fatter than this"" or ""you have such a fat a\*\*"" when I know for a fact I am skinny and have been trying to gain weight for years. I was underweight my whole life due to being quite poor and my mother not cooking anything substantial. I know this is projection on her part but I don't know what else to do, it's making me think I am actually fat when logically I am not. 

She herself has lost a significant amount because she eats maybe once a day and has small snacks here and there. She has started losing hair and having skin issues she never had before like rashes, cystic acne and so on. Whenever I cook anything when she comes over she can't finish it and is obsessed with ""healthy"" and raw diets, says the key to health is eating olive oil with bread. She is not vegan, but she is becoming disgusted with the idea of meat and fat and trashes our traditional Balkan cuisine quite often nowadays. I am worried this is because she is lonely, she ruined most of her relationships with friends and is worried that she can't find a boyfriend because of her age and weight, but she is quite an average weight. She has a co-worker she tried asking out after he led her on and she has these delusions that he loves her but he's just not ""ready"" to say it yet. I'm scared this triggered her to try to lose weight to appeal to this guy who told her to go away in hopes he will change his mind. In reality it's more the fact that he's 7 years younger than her, not her weight...

I don't know what to do, is there any advice you could give me? We don't live in the same city so I'm not sure what I can do but to me all this sounds like ED and maybe other issues.

My anxiety has ebbed and flowed over the past few years, but I have had one persistent source of anxiety that has not left my mind. Ever since I was in middle school (I'm now out of college for a year), I somehow got it in my mind that my sister might have an eating disorder. A big part of me understands that I'm probably projecting my own experiences since I was diagnosed with anorexia when I was in middle school and I've since also struggled with bulimia. But for some reason, this anxiety has not left my mind, even if it might seem irrational or unsubstantiated. I think a big part of it stems from when I was in therapy for my ED and I had become obsessive with monitoring what she was eating and when and how much. She hasn't shown any signs of having an eating disorder, yet I still get overly anxious when I see her snacking late at night or spending long periods in the bathroom after we eat (which is occasionally and she's usually on her phone). It's gotten to the point where I feel like I need to make sure and I've stood nearby to see if I can hear anything. For instance, I recently woke up and found her snacking late at night, and the first place my mind went is that she was binging and purging, even though I know rationally that it's normal to snack at 1 or 2 AM. But there are times when I wake up and I notice larger amounts of food gone from the pantry, which makes me nervous. I get anxious when she skips breakfast and whenever we call while she's away at college, I always feel the need to ask ""have you eaten yet?"". But whenever we eat together, she seems fine and doesn't seem to be displaying any signs. I've also tried to weave it into our conversations when I ask her how she's doing mentally and usually she replies that she's doing well in earnest. Yet I still worry, and I'm not sure what to do with this source of anxiety that I have. I know rationally that it's probably just anxiety, but a part of me also worries that there's an element of truth to it.

Anyways, thanks so much for the space to vent. As I mentioned before, this is a pretty vulnerable experience that I haven't really talked with anyone else about. I've struggled with disordered eating for a good portion of my life, so I honestly can't tell the difference between healthy and non-healthy eating habits in someone else. I think since I've had an ED, I look at food and eating a lot differently, so I don't know if what I'm discussing is something I need to be concerned about or if it's normal.

A little over a year has past since i was taken off the medication and i can still barely eat. My wife, who has struggled with an ED since she was about 8, told me yesterday, that I have one. She said at first, she thought it was the medication and things would change with time, but after watching me for the past year or so, she’s changed her mind. Pointing out different things or rituals i have/do when it comes to food. And she’s not wrong. What I see when i look in the mirror is not how i actually look and I know that. Looking back at pictures from the last year, I now see how thin I was when I felt like i wasn’t at all. 
Anyway, we’re now trying to figure out how to best support one another. We want to expand our family soon and know that’s not possible with where we are right now. We’ve tried finding resources online but most everything is for a dynamic where only one person in the situation has an ED. We want to be helpful to one another, hold each other accountable, but also not trigger each other? I dunno if what i’m asking for exists, but maybe if anyone has been in a similar situation, they could toss in some input or advice? 


TLDR; my wife and i have EDs and want to learn how to better support one another",1678474444.0

I wake up a few times during the night usually to go to the bathroom. EVERY TIME, I have to get something to eat. But the thing is that I’m never hungry. It is never EVER because I’m hungry. It’s comfort or something.

I always eat something carby and/or sweet: bread, peanut butter, cake, cookies, something like that.

Every night I tell myself not to, and during the day I make much better food decisions but in the middle of the night my inhibitions are down and all my willpower goes away. Also I usually don’t brush my teeth again and put my retainer back after so my teeth are suffering. And I also can’t answer why I don’t do that. I feel so much shame about all of this. I’m gaining weight and also I just feel gross in the morning from eating heavy things in the middle of the night.

Things I have tried:

-telling myself not to do it
-taping the fridge and cupboards shut
-leaving the toothbrush and mouthwash out so I’ll do that instead
-putting certain foods up high so they’re harder to get
-slicing up apples so at least I’ll eat something that won’t mess me up so much

i had honestly avoided inpatient therapy because it scares the shit out of me, but i have a lot of support in my recovery from friends and my boyfriend who encourage me to keep going and do better. i truly hope this a step in the right direction…because i’m already feeling way better than i did before i moved. i guess i’m asking is if this is actually a good way of thinking about recovery that doesn’t involve me actively seeking help from a professional? i go to therapy regularly, but refrain from talking about my ED unless it’s brought up. any advice is appreciated :)",1678392461.0

I got a bit triggered wince I saw a scale and it looked like the exact one I used to have and weigh myself obsessively on, but I got through the appointment with her taking my concerns seriously and she’s ordered a bunch of tests like bloodwork, ECG, echocardiogram, and a chest x-ray. I’m still worried about my health but glad that the experience with the doctor was so positive.



I have been having trouble breathing for a while and it’s getting to the point where I think someone should check it out. My only worry is that they are going to tell me it’s because of my weight (because that’s happened in the past). For the record, I don’t think it is. I (ever the hypochondriac) am actually worried that it might be heart failure. Even going into it knowing that that it’s a possibility they will tell me it is my weight, I don’t think I could handle hearing it. Yes, I am probably “overweight” for someone of my height but what they don’t see is the effort to recover and gain the weight I lost to bulimia. I still struggle greatly with the bulimia though, and I know that if they tell me I need to lose weight that I’m going to relapse. This will be a new doctor I have never seen before so they won’t know that but I don’t know how to bring it up or if I’m even allowed to before we get to the breathing issue. How do you guys ever handle going to the doctor? Should I walk in and be like “hi I have bulimia and also can’t breathe?”",1678284441.0

248,How do I tell my recovered partner to see a doctor?,2,11m2kb3,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/11m2kb3/how_do_i_tell_my_recovered_partner_to_see_a_doctor/,4,"Hello all. Throwaway for obvious reasons. Mods, please remove if not allowed, I'm just not sure who else to ask. 

My partner and I have been together for nearly a decade. We have always been on the larger side, and have struggled with EDs for a significant portion of our lives. We are both recovered, but as I'm sure anybody here knows, lots of things can trigger it, even years later. 

With that being said, my partner and I are both getting older, and with that comes natural weight gain. There is nothing wrong with this, I'm still just as attracted to and in love with them as the day I met them, and arguably more.

However, with age also comes health problems. My partner has been showing some pretty obvious signs of type 2 diabetes, i.e. wounds that won't heal, swelling of the ankles, patches of darkened skin, etc. My grandfather was a type 1 diabetic so I'm familiar with the symptoms.

The trick here is that they're also afraid of doctors, since every ""cure"" for a visibly larger person is ""just lose weight"", and that in itself can be very triggering, and I understand their hesitation to go, even for a cold.

I would never in a million years ask my partner to lose weight, and that's not what I'm asking them to do now. They're otherwise very active and healthy, and I find them to be so incredibly beautiful no matter what. I want them to live a long and happy life, and if that means they need medication, then so be it, I will support them with it.

What would be the best way to bring up this concern without sending them into a spiral? I know my reaction to somebody telling me this wouldn't be great either, and the last thing I want to do is hurt them, but I also don't want them to suffer from a treatable disease.

TL;DR: My partner and I both have histories of EDs and they're showing obvious signs of type 2 diabetes AND have a fear of doctors. How do I tell them they should be legitimately worried without triggering them?",1678296924.0

It got to a point of restricting, using diet pills, going on keto, going on literal liquid diets, counting calories in the three digits range, skipping meals daily to one or two meals with compensatory restriction, purging by puking and using laxatives everyday for a period of time. I was diagnosed with atypical anorexia. I have always been clinically overweight or obese, maybe a healthy weight very early on in these behaviours (they started when I was barely a teen, I’m a young adult now), but I’ve been fat since I was 15 or so. My mum told me at 8 that my stomach was big though, so maybe it started all the way before then. And whatever behaviour I engaged in, I wouldn’t lose the weight, I usually don’t really binge or just “subjectively binge” (words of my dietitian) late at night when I don’t eat enough during the day. Coupled with depression, I wake up too late for breakfast, have a late lunch, and sometimes skip dinner. 

Since my diagnosis and seeing an ED clinic every month (to every 3 months now), I’m supposedly in recovery and have been trying to maintain regular meals, and I’ve steadily put on a lot of weight that pushed me from slightly overweight (very near healthy weight) to morbidly obese, since August 2021. I can’t stand the sight of myself, I hate seeing myself in photos, I feel awful all the time. I spend hours searching diet pills and prescription meds for obesity and want to buy them again or even go to a doctor to ask for a prescription for those obesity meds. I don’t have heavy urges to purge (my primary behaviour was restriction), but my restricting thoughts have been very high and distressing lately. I want extreme weight loss. I desperately want to be severely underweight, stick thin. My goal weight is one third of my current weight. I want to engage in restriction again, but I am hungry ALL THE TIME. I hate myself. I feel like a weakling. I feel like an eating disorder failure, like anyone with an ED would be embarrassed of me because my body insults everyone with an ED who is suffering. I don’t look like I’m suffering on the outside. I just look fucking obese and gross.  

And it feels like my ED clinical team (psychiatrist, dietitian, physio) just doesn’t take me seriously, maybe because I’m fat and all of their other patients are underweight. I have all of these thoughts and urges, and they just tell me “you haven’t acted on any urges so far, just tell yourself not to do it”. They probably think I don’t even have an ED and that them diagnosing me was a mistake.

I just feel really low and frustrated with myself. I just want to be small. I don’t want to be fat and have an ED, I want to be skinny and be taken seriously and not be a failure. I’m sorry this post is so shitty and negative.",1678250151.0
251,Cant eat regularly,1,11lzz51,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/11lzz51/cant_eat_regularly/,1,"TL;DR 
I live in foster care and have to buy my own food to be able to eat regularly. I feel that is unfair. 

Hi everyone this is my first time posting here. Througout my childhood I had very disordered eating, starving myself and then binging on sweets and snacks. I now live in foster care and I am trying to eat more regularly but it is hard. My foster mom doesnt believe in after school snacks and tells me to just wait till dinner. Its also very unclear what food in the fridge that I can take or not. Often there not even food at home, last week I tried to make breakfast but the bread was moldy. 

This has resulted in me just buying my own snacks after school (for example fruits, sandwiches or a hotdog) and my own food for home. I have bought yoghurt and cereal and bread and butter so I can eat when I want without having to ask for permission since  it’s my own food. The problem is I am a teenager and dont really have that much money to spend on food. I have a job after school and maybe 70% of what I earn is going towards food.

I have had a talk with them and now I get money to at least buy and cook my own food on the weekends but still not on weekdays.

Im looking for suggestions or encouragement or just other views on this situation. Do you think I should keep buying my own food and snacks?",1678291085.0

After I had my baby (2009) I did really good about keeping better habits for a long time, especially because I was breast feeding. However, I was diagnosed with some health issues in 2016 and my weight started getting out of control. Once that happened I found myself restricting my calorie intake obsessively and constantly weighing myself... Sometimes 2-4 times a day. I've even gotten to the point where I've started purging again when I over eat it eat junk food. I'm trying so hard to not be like this anymore. I don't want to have this unhealthy relationship with good and myself, but I just don't know how to feel comfortable with myself.

I began eating more and felt very inclined to do so as i had been hungry for the last 10 months. This worked for about 6 months. I was not eating at all during the daytime, but would eat plenty of food at night because my anxiety was lower then. I was at a healthy weight.

 In October of 2022 my parents had a very messy divorce filled with lies and fighting. After about a month of this i noticed my anxiety was thru the roof and i was struggling to pick up any type of food (not because I wanted to restrict my food intake). 

Fast forward many months and we are now in March of 2023. The situation between my parents has died down quite a bit and i notice my anxiety and depression is much much more under control. Though, I am still struggling to eat because nothing seems appetizing to me at all. I’ve tried new foods from different cultures, making my own food, ordering my favorite restaurants, etc. Once I take a bite or two of the food I feel like my appetite has disappeared completely.

But they never asked my size or anything. I told them the truth, that i threw up almost everything I ate, that I purged at least once a day, that I was dizzy after purging, that I developed acid reflux from it. That I planned my day around binging and purging. But thinking now, it's like yeah, that's super concerning for people who are underweight, but I'm clinically morbidly obese.

For some extra context, I did have lymphoma a few years ago, but have no evidence of disease, recent blood work came back great, no intestinal involvement, so I don’t think this is related, plus I wasn’t even experiencing it at my recent doctor visit around a month ago. 

After changing my eating schedule to accommodate night shift, and being more active (averaging around 15,000 steps/day at work according to my Apple Watch. Needless to say, after sitting at home all day to being very active, I have lost a little over two pounds a week. 

Here’s where the problem has started. For about the past two weeks, I have had to start forcing myself to eat. I eat two meals a day and generally have a snack. This has been my norm for years. The thought of eating, and sometimes the act itself, is now making me nauseous. I haven’t actually thrown up, but I have definitely skipped some meals or barely eaten in place of a meal to avoid this feeling. 

I feel as if it’s more of a psychological issue than physical. I do have problems with depression and anxiety, but they are controlled with daily medication (which makes me nauseous if I don’t eat with it, go figure). I’m also going through relationship troubles, which could be causing me more stress than I know. 

I don’t want this to become a recurring feeling, and have been trying to make sure I have a well balanced diet, with meat, vegetables, and a moderately healthy dessert. But I really have to FORCE myself to eat it and almost gag my way through the meal. I have never felt this way before, and have always loved eating.

One day I decided to lose weight and through crash dieting (unintentionally) and doing 1 hour of jogging a day, I was able to get down to what would be considered overweight in about 8 months.

Then, I upped my caloric intake to a healthier caloric intake, which slowed down my weight loss, but it was necessary. Around the same time, I started to get into weightlifting. About two months ago, I was at my lowest weight (which would be considered healthy) and about a month ago, I felt that I started to get the weightlifting lifestyle correctly.

However, about 2 months ago, I started binging. In the beginning, I was in a binge and starve cycle. I even tried vomiting about once or twice at that point. But about a month ago, I decided to stop with the binge and starve cycle because I realized that it never got me anywhere. I went from binging every other day to binging every week.

My binges these days seem to be very, very big and I gained some weight since. Nowadays, I’m trying to eat at maintenance so that I don’t feel real hunger or feel like I’m over feeding myself. I feel like I lost the discipline that I used to have when I was losing weight and I feel hopeless in ending my binging. I feel like I might go back to being morbidly obese and I’m starting to mourn the progress that I have made.

How do I stop my binging and gain back the control I used to have?",1678066101.0

I just wanted to talk to someone because I'm meant to be going to a concert later this month, and it's literally been my dream for about 4 years to see the artists whose concert I'm going to see. Like, my friends from other countries have all had their chance but my chance never came until now. However, I know outfits are a big part of a concert experience these days with social media and stuff being such a big deal, and also I understand that in the bigger picture they really don't matter much at all as long as you have a good time. 
However, I'm feeling so down and like I don't even want to go because I don't look how I want to look. I've been waiting for this for so long and I don't even feel excited because I can't get over how much I hate my appearance, and how I regret not trying hard enough with stuff like restricting and exercising because now the time is finally here and I haven't got what I want to show for it. I'm scared other fans will think I look disgusting or the artist will somehow see me in the crowd and think I'm disgusting. (Although, I'm rational enough in my head to know, they won't see me and even if they did, they're doing a concert, they don't care how I look!!!!!) And also, I've never once at a concert looked at someone else and cared in a negative way what they looked like or what they were wearing, so the anxiety is all revolving around me, and I'm not someone who judges people for what they look like, just myself. (I just really wanted to make this clear!!!)

But yeah, I'm trying to feel excited but I just feel so nervous right now because I wish I had more time to have changed my body more, because I'm not that far through what I want to achieve and I feel ashamed that I haven't made changes quick enough. I just want to have a good time but I am so scared that this will negatively influence my experience.

This is not a problem to him, he doesn't care about his health which is perfect at the moment, he's happy like that so I'm not telling anything about it.

But every time i hear the sounds it triggers me so much negative feelings like disgust towards him, and disgust toward myself because i'm judging even if i don't want to. Also a bit of irratition thinking of all the money he gives to industries that produces this cancer to society. And it reminds me my hyperphagia phases, which alternates with enjoying healthy well cooked meals phases, et when I do exactly the same as him when i'm losing control - giving my money to industries i which could collapse, eating high quantities without even being mindful  and not eating stuff that are rotting in my fridge. Moreover, when he brings that stuff home he will share with me and it sometimes triggers hyperphagia urges.  


I don't know what to do, how to talk about him with him, I can't just ask him to hide from me when he wants to do this while we're together or in the same room.  


Does anyone relate to this ? Do you also have a loved one with eating behaviour that is problematic to you but not to them?

I really feel like i'm a horrible person for not just letting him be, wish i wouldn't care

This is about my sister, and I’d really like some advice as to a) whether she does display any warning signs and b) how you would handle a conversation with someone who is very sensitive about this topic. 

So: background. My sister became a very very chubby child age 8. She had a habit of stealing food in the house (we were never able to keep peanut butter or  jam or any sort of sweet stuff in the house because she’d sneak in and eat it before we could open it.) My mom put her on a gentle diet (take half of whatever’s on the table, share a dessert with me rather than one by yourself) etc.  and it slowly started working. 

When my sister was 12/13, our dad lost his job, our stay at home mom had to go to work, she had to switch schools and ended up sort of homeschooled but with nobody there to teach her for a few months. Her mental health plummeted, and what we now know was a cocktail of depression and ADHD and performance anxiety raised its head. She spent the next few years truanting from school, doing her classes one on one tuition and generally cutting her own educational path. Our mom and I didn’t realise at the time what was in her head but things were lots of fights at home, her days passing lying starfished on a bed and us yelling at her for 30 mins to please just get dressed tidy her room and stop being lazy. (The guilt, now we know where her head was at, is unreal btw…). She has tantrums and refuses to attend mom’s birthday because her stomach ‘looks fat’ in a dress. She stands oddly hunched over and obsesses over the ‘fat rolls’. 

When she’s 15, I come across a diary of hers that has pages of scrawls calling herself “a fat disgusting pig” and “whale”. I show it to my mom and we both are very worried, cue a few more fights with sister where she’s aggressive and defensive about it but she’s now at a healthy weight. 

Then she starts chewing up her food at dinner but instead of swallowing she hides the chewed up food in her napkin. She tears up bits of pastry so the whole plate just looks like it’s ‘crumbs’ but she hasn’t eaten any of it. She throws stuff in the bin and says she ate it. 

A couple of years pass, she’s now 19, her mental health is in a better spot and things are better. But she’s getting thin. Every time we comment on it she says “it’s all that fat from when I was younger I’m really a sparrow under here”. She starts exercising religiously(and I mean more like the world is going to end tantrum stop controlling me fight if we gently said ‘Can you go to the gym tomorrow instead because we have dinner with your godmother planned’). 
She looks grey under the eyes and complains about being tired always. 

This year, She went away for a gap year and came home for Christmas. Started doing her crumble the food thing and was shockingly thin. Like, thighs smaller than her knees, bony hands , sharp cheekbones. 

Mom and I looked at each other and mom said “are you ok darling? it’s just you look like you’ve lost a lot of weight and we’re a bit worried about you. Do we need to pack you some home cooked food for January” 

My sister lost her shit. Her main argument is: stop building everything up into an eating disorder which she doesn’t even have, stop controlling her and clinging onto this image of her as a kid when she was fat and that’s not her normal, why can’t we see her body the way it really is, stop commenting on other people’s bodies. Since then we have tiptoed around it but she still looks unhealthy. 

People of Reddit, are we overreacting? My response is that her emotional 12/10 outburst suggests her relationship with eating isn’t healthy, but I don’t have experience with this sort of stuff. How should we have approached this conversation?",1677956368.0

Hi everyone. I (F21) have been dealing with an eating disorder for a long time. I think I have bulimia: I tend to restrict myself, binge and then find ways to compensate. I would say that over the past two years, my ED has gotten much better as I have started a recovery process. Unfortunately, recovering is never a straight road and I sometimes still struggle with bulimia especially when I feel mentally unwell. 

Recently, I have been under a lot of stress, felt really lonely and quite depressed. So I would say that my relationship with food and my body is not optimal at the moment. What I struggle the most with is my body image. I gained a bit of weight and I feel very tight in my clothes, especially around my lower belly. I can’t stand looking at myself, I hate the way I look, I cry daily about that. I check myself every time I see a mirror and every time it’s so painful to see myself. I feel too big, my stomach and my legs are the main issues, I keep thinking of how I used to look like and I wish I still looked like this even though I hated the way I looked back then. 
I feel really hopeless about feeling confident in my own body… it might seem stupid for some, but hating yourself this much is tiring and it really affects my life. Any tips on how to learn to love your body ?",1677964626.0

I am 23 now, but have had an extremely unhealthy relationship with food since I was 5 years old. I've also been overweight/obese my entire life and have gone through periods of starvation, binding, and purging as well. I have not purposefully restricted myself or forced myself to purge in a while, however, I still constantly panic and stress over food and my weight. I have moments where I want to go back to my purging days but I am able to convince myself not to. 

I moved in with my boyfriend and his family a little over a year ago. I moved in since his place is near the University I attend where I am a full-time student. I love his family and they treat me like I am their own. This is very nice since I moved a few thousand miles away from my own family (that was highly dysfunctional). 

For the last year, I have been trying to lose weight in a 'healthier' and at a slower pace. I've lost a good amount but have been at a plateau for a few months. I try to follow a calorie deficit and then I end up emotionally eating at the end of the night.

Anyways, my partner's sister has also started to lose weight. She was given a prescription shot by her doctor and was able to lose the same amount that I did without diet or exercise but over only a few months. It took me over a year with dieting and exercising. She has talked about this shot and how much weight she is losing a few times to me, and each time has sent me into distress that I have to hide because I do not like showing my emotions to people. But, last night was a breaking point. The three of us were eating dinner at a table and then she brought up her weight loss again. Already, I was tempted to throw out my entire bowl of food and my heart began to race. 

Then, she mentioned that she believes she might have an eating disorder because she binges here and there. I offered my support but after I had to go to the bathroom and live out an anxiety attack because this conversation triggered my very bad relationship with food. It was very difficult for me to not try and purge out everything that I ate.

For context, I come from a traumatic childhood but don't feel comfortable sharing any details about my life or my mind unless I am very drunk. However, since I am very good at masking it, people don't believe that I have gone through things. On the other hand, she is very open about her experiences. And as much as I love her, when I try to attempt to speak about my own experiences, it becomes a competition of who has had it worse. 

I feel like unless I say something, I will continuously become triggered when the topic of her weight loss and such is mentioned. I do not ever bring up my weight loss journey with anyone because I don't want it to lead into a triggering conversation. I feel bad though because I don't want to set a boundary and make her believe that she cannot come to talk to me when she needs it.

I also don't know if this is making any sense. I'm writing this on a lack of sleep. I also have a history of severe depression and little things like this can flare it up. I am also in the works of getting professional health again.

Also I am not blaming her for my triggers. It's not her fault and she doesn't know anything about my past. I just don't have the confidence to advocate for myself so I'm just seeking support. Maybe advice.

How would you guys approach this? Would you just ignore it or bring it up to her and set a boundary?",1677940824.0

She has been declining for about half a year now and its gotten pretty bad.

Last night she constantly complained about her weight and how ""fat"" she looked. Note, she is a perfectly healthy, if not on the lower end, weight. She also talked about how she had barely eaten for the whole week. She kept telling me that when she got to X weight she could eat (her goal weight is at an unhealthy BMI).

I have no idea how to redirect these conversations. She wont listen to ""that's unhealthy"" or anything similar. She also will not understand that she is in no way fat whatsoever. I can be a bit of an idiot when I'm drunk, so I stupidly compared her body to mine to get the point across how thin she is. Also said that since she doesn't think I'm fat, it makes no sense that she thinks shes fat herself since I'm way bigger than her. I know this is super dumb but I had no idea what to say.

I just need advice. In hindsight, I can see how absolutely stupid these things I answer her with are but in the moment I don't know what to say to redirect the conversation. What do I say when she mentions not eating or her goal weight?",1677954151.0

Long version:
I have a history of starving myself and binge eating in secret which I'm slowly recovering from. And ate till my body felt content and good before the enthusiastic, ""here, come and eat more!"" Food is our love language, and they especially cooked today for us since we haven't seen each other in a long time. And that's what makes it harder to decline.

So, I ate until I was uncomfortable. But I know that shouldn't happen again. My health is important, and I need to find some way to decline politely. And if possible, I don't want to tell them about my eating disorder.",1677912014.0

But lately het ED has gotten out of hand, the 4 years I have known her she had always sufferd from an ED but she always tries to hide it. It often comes in waves but the last couple of months it has been really bad. We go shopping together and she told me she pretty much needed all new pants because all of hers where too big. She has also given me 2 pairs of pants she used to fit into like 1 year ago. 

It's also smaller thing she never wears her rings anymore because they are all to big now, and at my birthday she almost did not eat and when she thought I was putting a slice of pizza on her plate she almost started freaking out. 

She has lost clumps of hair she is always cold and you can just see she has lost a lot of weight. Sometimes I will see her eat because whenever she says she wants to have for I always say yes. Or if she comes to sleep over she will also eat but often I think she does it to not make me worried and show me she is eating. 

We have talked about it but we only do it when we have drank a lot and then we just kinda not bring it up again.  I have no idea what I have to do, I will always be there and I will always listen to her.

I have a husband that has no problem with food, in fact I cook every meal for him using normal ingredients like butter, cream, protein, pasta, rice, veggies, etc.

Before I got married, I was in a pretty awful relationship with a guy that immediately gave me self esteem issues even though he wasn't in the best shape himself. I got into a fitness and eating routine as a coping mechanism and stuck to it even after I broke up with him. Part of the restriction had to do with food allergies and just eating more ""plain"" foods, but I have slowly gotten to a point that I won't even taste the food that I cook for my now husband (different, better guy lol). 

When I cook him a pasta dish, for example, I'll cook the meat separately (air fry mine and pan fry his with butter). I'll make his pasta and sauce, add his meat, and serve it to him, but then take the meat I cooked for myself and lay it on a bed of veggies and maybe put some seasoning on it. I also use sugar-free every chance I get and ""low cal"" foods/drinks. 

When I go out to eat, I order the same thing when it's available: Caesar salad with dressing on the side and no cheese. Basically just chicken, lettuce, a lemon wedge, and a few croutons. If that's not available, I get a dish and take every sauce and cheese I can off of it and prioritize the protein and veggies. I don't drink alcohol or any drink with calories besides coconut milk that I use as creamer for coffee. Sometimes I even cancel plans out with friends because I don't feel like I saved enough calories or worked out enough to go and have a meal out. On top of all this, I do HIIT workouts 5-6 days a week....

I say all of this because it's getting annoying. The scale is showing that I am losing weight, my body fat is below average, and I would give anything to let myself dive into a high-fat, high-carb, full sugar food...but my mind simply won't let me. 

My husband worries about me because we found out that my resting heart rate is too low and I have to take iron to have energy throughout the day. I am always cold, always wearing sweatshirts and leggings, always checking the mirror and scale for changes. I look at pictures of myself and don't see the skinny me.

My sister (19F) has been struggling with a devastating eating disorder for a year now. We have tried everything we can think of to support her, but nothing seems to be working, and we are near our breaking point.

Initially, my sister started off with what seemed like a desire to lose a few pounds. However, it quickly escalated into a full-blown disorder, with her spending hours on the treadmill every day and not eating anything. From the very beginning, my mother knew that things were not looking good. She constantly warned my sister of the dangers of the path that she is on.

My mom would try to help her and offered to see a therapist or nutritionist with her, but she viciously refused, saying that she knows what she's doing and that my mother doesn't know what she's talking about. She was constantly exercising and never eating, and my mom would try to explain to her the dangers of this and share her support for her. But my sister is extremely stubborn by nature, and would always just brush her off, attack her, yell at her. This continued for many months, my sister refusing any form of help, my mother worried sick for her, until she became dangerously underweight.

We were all extremely scared for her. My mother and I would cry almost every day, desperately trying to support her and save her, worried sick for her life. But she would always dismiss us. She was so malnourished that doctors said she needed treatment ASAP because she was at risk of organ failure, but she refused, and we cannot force treatment on her because she is an adult. If she lost any more weight she probably would have died.

At this time, my sister also wanted to get a nose job, but my mother explained to her that no doctor would put her under general anesthesia and operate on her in her condition. She explained to her that she needs to recover if she wants to be able to do the things she wants and live the life she wants, like go to college.

One day, after months of my mother and I crying for her and pleading with her, it seemed like she finally had a breakthrough. She seemed determined to get better and started forcing herself to eat. We were all so happy. We constantly supported her throughout the way. We thought she was on the road to recovery.

But now she recently got the nose job that she wanted, and she is slipping back to her old habits. Not eating, lying, gaslighting us, attacking us when we try to support her. Over the past month she has lost a dangerous amount of weight, and it seems like all of the progress she made is rapidly being lost. She is quickly entering a dangerous state again, but she is again refusing help.

She won't see a therapist or accept any treatment. She says that she can handle this on her own and nobody can help her. We have tried to talk to her gently, support her, and show our concern, but she just attacks us every time. It's like we're all held hostage by this eating disorder, a never ending nightmare that we cannot escape.

The situation is taking a massive toll on my mother. She looks depressed, exhausted, and stressed all the time. I am so worried for her health. She has a history of heart problems and high blood pressure, and I fear that all of this stress will be the end of her. I can't bear the thought of losing both my sister and my mother.

I feel so terrible for my mother. She lives for her children and the only thing that matters to her is for her children to be happy and healthy. This whole situation has been destroying her. I am depressed not only for my sister, but also my mother. My mother means the world to me, and it is devastating to watch my mother breakdown while my sister withers away no matter how much she tries to help her. It seems like this battle will never end and will eventually kill them both.

We all live in the same house, and I see my mother trying to gently support my sister only to get attacked. I hear my sister yelling at my mother for trying to help her and prevent her from dying. My sister has said such terrible things to my mother despite all she's done for her. Things like she's a shit mother, saying that she's never done anything for her, that she doesn't love her, that she doesn't care about her, when my mother literally devotes her life to her kids' happiness.

My sister even blamed my mother for her eating disorder, saying it's her fault that she didn't save her before it turned into this, when my mom has literally tried everything she could from the very beginning to help her. My sister has tremendous anger issues now and makes everyday hell with her terrible attitude, throwing things, slamming things, screaming at us for trying to help her, blowing up over everything, refusing to see a therapist.

I recently got laid off and have been struggling to find a job in this economy, and my father is worried about losing his job. If something happens to my sister and she needs to be hospitalized or needs medical care, we would go broke. This is such a nightmare.

I'm writing this post in the hope that someone out there can help us. If you have any advice or suggestions, please share them with me. I don't know what to do, and we are all at our breaking point. We just want our sister back, and we want our family to be happy and healthy again.

Lately, some friends of mine made the observation that it seemed like I had an ED. I'm not sure, no one in my family has ever talked about it, and I just want to know if how I think is alright.

I'm F, 14, and currently underweight. Now, I don't know if this is a fucked way of thinking or not, but I *love* being underweight. I have this thing, where I'm absolutely terrified of getting fat or gaining any weight at all. My ideology was, if I lose even more weight now, then I'm free to gain a little without fear of getting 'fat'.

I love being called skinny, i love when people are concerned about how skinny I am because all I can think about is the fact that I *am* skinny.

To lose weight, I started intermittent fasting (16:8) and am currently still continuing it. I don't like looking at my body at night because it's bloated and often weigh myself in the morning, when I haven't eaten anything.

My friends joke about me having an ED. A few of them are serious about it. Personally, I don't really know. I know people with actual EDs go through so much worse, I'm just not sure, let me know.",1677752377.0

I would wake up, drink a can of mountain dew, and snack on some chips for my breakfast. I knew how unhealthy this was, and joined a gym and adopted healthier eating habits that summer. I started losing a lot of weight. I started to become occupied with the weight I was losing, but it was more so an achievement at first because I knew I was getting healthier.

Then, I started sophomore year. It became less of an “achievement” and more of an obsession. I struggled with restrictive eating all throughout that year and kept losing weight. This is when I realized it was an issue.

During the summer before my junior year (my current year), I noticed that I was underweight. All my clothes were huge on me, but although I “complained” about it, I secretly found satisfaction in seeing the difference based on how the clothes fit (and I still feel this way about old clothes).

In fall 2022, I started to get a bit better. I became less restrictive about what foods I would eat and allow myself to eat more than I would in the past.

However, in the past month, I have been struggling and nobody knows how bad it is. I am at my lowest adult weight ever. My boyfriend noticed that I lost weight, but it’s hard to open up to him about something that he doesn’t fully understand (I’ve tried before but he doesn’t really get it). I am afraid to open up to any doctors about it because a) I still find satistfaction from the feeling of “control” in what I eat and look like and b) I do think they would cut down on my ADHD medication dosage because it’s an appetite suppressant, but I absolutely need that medication for school.

I know I need to do something about this. My weight isn’t dangerously low to the point where weight gain has to be in recovery, but I can’t keep doing this to myself. I can’t name one day this week where I have ate enough food to maintain or gain weight, and I feel like if I keep going down this route, there will be serious health consequences down the line. It’s just so hard when I’m scared of professional help and that I know I need to help myself, but I don’t exactly want to at the same time.

As a brown person who has been helped primarily by white women, it is difficult for me to ignore how my eating disorder was largely shaped by the white supremacist idea of societal beauty, that was then followed by the white supremacist idea of recovery/help. 

In summation, I wonder if (in trying to help BIPOC communities) using **food and body** with any combination of struggle/challenge/barrier -- in addition to the term eating disorder -- that we might connect to ancestral wisdom as we work to find individual health and balance.

I’m new to Reddit so if I’m doing this posting thing wrong, I’m sorry. I’m fresh into recovery with “unspecified disordered eating” due to fitting many criteria for all the things… I do not know people personally who understand ED or consider ED to be a “mental illness”. My family is new to accepting mental health as an actual, realistic, and vital part of one’s health… so needless to say it’s been lonely. 

My questions:
How do I go about helping those around me to understand my habits (good and bad) related to ED?
What are some strategies used to identify those habits when ED has convinced me that what I do is “normal,” since our messed up diet culture has made disordered eating “normal”..?
Is it common for other people to have sudden urges to throw away all food in the house and spray so much air freshener to rid the house of food smells? Just me?

I guess… with my recovery I’m just always having all of these questions of “Is this ED?” “How can I know if it’s because of ED?” “Is it ED or one of my countless other mental illnesses?”

Any insight would be helpful. I feel like I have the insight for the direction I need to go but like… I need training on how to open my eyes to see where I’m at.

This has triggered my ed but I desperately want to stay away from my old, destructive habits for the sake of my health.

She wants me to set a routine. My mom disagreed and said I should eat when I'm hungry and stop when I'm not.

We are currently conducting a study that aims at helping inform the design of reflection technology to support people’s reflection on the content they view/post on social media during recovery.

We are looking for participants to work with us on a study activity and to give feedback on several iterations of an interactive technology. During the activity, the participants will be asked to complete a semi-structured interview about their experience with an eating disorder as well as some fun activities to visualize their treatment journey.

We would be happy to work with you to learn more about your feelings, thoughts, experiences, and opinions. And we hope this study could inform our design which may be able to help the larger community.

I definitely have disordered eating, but I'm not sure if I have an actual eating disorder.

I have NO appetite and reject food during the day due to prolonged anxiety, trauma and being numb from depression. I can only eat dinner if I have my Klonopin first to relax me a bit. Even then I can never finish a meal. But later, at around midnight, I stuff myself with chocolate, donuts, cakes, cookies etc, to the point of nausea.

Then I sleep all day. I do NO exercise, ever as I barely go out anymore.

I used to be able to keep my weight down due to the fact I walked (very briskly) everywhere, and I'm anxious constantly when I'm awake. But for the past few years, I've not gone anywhere and I am asleep so much that my body isn't burning anything off.

So...I look fat (to me). I feel fat. My clothes look bad. Some don't fit anymore. And I just get this feeling of utter DESPERATION to lose weight. Like, NOW. The only way I could do that is to stop eating entirely and just survive on peach iced tea.

She spent 2 months in a rehab center for her alcoholism, and then another 4 months in a different treatment center for her bulimia. 

Since she came home about a year ago things have been going great, she has been gaining weight, seeing her dietician and therapist regularly, while continuing to work on her alcoholism. To my knowledge she has not relapsed in either addiction. 

I'm so proud of her and all the work she has put into herself, however I got home late last night and could tell something was wrong. She was lying in bed sleeping, but there was food everywhere, which is not like her at all. 

She was very upset, but unable to speak much. However I did get it out of her that while she didn't drink, she had a bad night and binged on food. Not sure if she purged , but I assume so. I was also able to find out that it was something to do with work, and that people may have been talking  EDs and maybe that what's triggered her. 

She just wanted to be left alone in bed, but as soon as I sat down in our living room she started cleaning the mess and taking out the garbage. I assume because she was ashamed of her behavior and didn't want me to see. I tried telling her not to worry about it and that we would clean up later, but she was very persistent. I know that ED has a lot to do with control, and I feel like this was her trying to control the situation and she refused any help

I tried my best to just tell her I love her, and that it's OK. I cuddled her in bed until she fell asleep. 

I know this is a very delicate situation, and I just want to do my best to not make it any worse. I'm not mad at her, I'm incredibly proud of her and love her very much, but I need advice on how to help her through this slip.

Our relationship was already in uncomfortable waters before I found out about her ED a few months ago. She exhibits a lot of what appears to be typical ED behaviour. It absoutely breaks my heart to see and weighs heavily on my mind 24/7.

I don't really want to go into detail regarding her specific methods but these examples speak to what is also an honesty issue in my mind.
After presenting to emergency department with heart palpitations, she tried to cheat a subsequent blood test by asking the staff there to supply electrolytes intravenously ahead of the test, and they declined, asked me to get her a powerade instead which I also declined because the professionals need to be left to do their job. She showed me her food diary one day recently and left out the binge and purge. There was a charge on the card for a takeout delivery that day which didn't appear on the diary. I'm struggling to see how recovery can happen if there's no honest acknowledgement of what is happening.

We're both in therapy. I'm suffering mental and emotional burnout from the stresses of this relationship and my work. 
Talking about recovery, I feel like therapy isn't enough for me, I *desperately need* a structural change in circumstances so that I can have a chance at leading a fulfilling and contented life. At the same time I don't know if leaving is an option because it feels like it would be sociopathic to leave someone when they're struggling to such an extent as having an ED. I typically have an overactive sense of guilt so it could just end up being a new flavor of mental health issue to throw onto the fire.

I need some help because it’s been two years since I’ve been trying to stop this but I’ve failed everything I’ve tried. I have overweight and I’m pretty sure I’m pre diabetic. I know my problem is not that bad but i want it to stop. I know many people rely on food, specially sweets, but I don’t want it to be like that anymore, I feel ashamed about it. 

Basically, that’s it. Whenever something happens, I eat. To be specific, sweet things but I tend to eat everything that is in the house if there’s no sugar. I get this urges of eating a lot till I die or smth and even tho I try to distract myself, to write it down, or to eat something healthier, I always end up eating a lot. The feeling, the desperation doesn’t stop until I eat a lot  and I’m tired of it. I know I’m not being hard enough with myself but it just feels so good. It distracts me and makes forget about everything. For example, eating rice feels like getting hugged. It feels so warm and quiet but I don’t want to get Ill. 

I don’t know if the problem is candies or just that I want to get what I want. I’ve tried to give me what I want and not prohibit, but that’s not working, I always end up eating a lot and I justify by saying “I want to be happy”

I think I have an ED, it has never been diagnosed though. All my childhood I remember thinking I was fat and hated myself for having no ""self control"" when it came to snacks and candy, I would eat large amounts of those in secret from my family. I remember thinking I wanted to lose weight and was afraid of gaining it, but I still wanted to be ""healthy"" and lose weight through adopting a healthy lifestyle. At 13 years old, I remember thinking that I don't care about my health anymore, I just want to be skinny, ""I want to get anorexia"", went on google and found the pro-ana community and all the ""tips and tricks"" to become anorexic. I followed them religiously.

However, it never came easy to me and I never ""got anorexia"" (never met the weight requirement). I'm 23 now. I still engage in those pro-ana tips and tricks to stop eating, but I always end up eating because I'm too tired and weak to resist my urges. I wouldn't say I binge, I eat normal sized portions but I'm always disappointed in myself if I eat more than nothing. So restricting has never come easy for me, in fact I have never managed to lose weight, only gain (always within normal weight). Isn't it supposed to become ""easier"" to not eat than to eat if I had anorexia/other eating disorder with no binging? I read those stories of people being so scared of food they couldn't imagine eating meanwhile it takes all my willpower not to eat and I fail all the time. Yet I fit all the other ED diagnosis criteria: I hate my weight, I hate myself, I want to lose weight, I am afraid of gaining weight, I think about food 100% of the time. This torture has never given me weight loss though.

So have I understood wrong that (restrictive) eating disorders are supposed to make you scared to eat?

Quarantine was great… for my eating disorder. I lost a substantial amount of weight and landed myself in the hospital by November 2020.

I got out after two months. I spent my birthday and Christmas in that miserable place. Ever since then, I’ve engaged in the same behaviors but haven’t been able to lose the weight.

I have a BED and I am currently clinically obese. I am trying to turn my life around and focus on recovery. 

One thing I wanted to focus on the most was eating around other people. My ED was caused by bullying/taunting around my choice of food and portions (even when they were a regular portion), as I’ve always been somewhat on the curvier side (legs, bum etc). 

So one thing that became very common for me was to eat alone. Over time it has gotten worse, and I think almost encourages my binging behaviour as no-one can see what I’m eating, so along with controlling portions and making healthier choices I also wanted to start eating in front of people.

However, it makes me so incredibly anxious. Even when no-one says anything to me, I feel like I know what they’re thinking. If I’m out for dinner with friends and we all order burgers, I feel like I’m being judged for being the obese one eating a burger, but if I ate a salad I’d feel I was being judged like lol at that obese person trying to lose weight. 

Even in my house I have some great non judgemental housemates, but cooking and eating in front of them makes me really anxious. I went on a trip with work recently and had a panic attack in the hotel over the fact I was going to have to eat dinner with my team. I feel I’ve got worse recently and I just don’t know what to do!

For anyone who has ever felt this way (at either end of the weight spectrum) what tips/advice would you give to someone in my
position? Are there things that worked for
you? Was it just like exposure therapy and keep pushing myself til I stop panicking?

The amount of chocolate bars that I'm eating is affecting my triglyceride levels, which is dangerous for my health. 

Originally I thought that chocolate almond milk might be a good substitute. But I didn't have any on-hand hand and I'd have to wait until the next time I'd get groceries. 

I also received several helpful suggestions from other people on Reddit. But unfortunately I didn't have any of the suggested foods on-hand, and again, I'd have to wait. 

But just now I saw that I had bought some dried prunes.

I *freaking love* dried prunes.

I know that it's kind of a leap, chocolate bars to dried prunes. But I think it's *sugar* that I'm craving, not necessarily chocolate. 

Dried prunes aren't high in trans or saturated fats, which could help lower my triglyceride levels.

It's still not good to consume an excessive amount of sugar. But hopefully I can work on *that,* later on.

Now the problem is that I am a bulimic girl (active bulimia, that in my personal life means throwing up every single day - I usually eat just once a day but that lasts 4-5 hours and after I throw up for around 50 mins and after I am in a fasting state until next day’s binge) - this eating system to me is very important and if anything goes differently, I immediately panic and anxiety and deep lethargy captures me that generates a domino effect of canceling social connections and sometimes even modifying my working hours

My husband doesn’t know about my eating disorder, he never sees me eating and I have always rejected eating together ever since the start of our marriage - I tell him that I prefer eating at home, and that’s it 

But I ethically cannot skip all meals for 10 days and I am afraid what will happen if every single day I will be offered large amounts of food by several relatives a day several times. I am deadly anxious they will point out how little I eat and start asking questions about the reasons or if maybe I will hurt them by not eating

They lightly joke about my eating habits or jokingly/sincerely say good job if I ever finish eating something. it can get really patronising, I try not to think that way but sometimes it hits all the wrong spots.

All this is bringing unwanted self consciousness to what and how much I'm eating, adding to my subconscious stress. I just want to eat without thinking, whether I decide to finish the whole thing or half. I just want to go about without thinking abt it. because that's how I made peace with not counting calories. I don't mind that they ask questions but this whole teasing when it comes to anything remotely food is warping into something I'm not comfortable with I think. I haven't noticed it was affecting me this much, because I sort of disconnected whenever it happens and I feel like everything went in a blur while I remain stunned and speechless.

I'm not witty enough to retort back jokingly either, my social anxiety doesn't help either. Today they talked about how some of them used to hide food or throw milk down the sink and then included me in a joke. I dont even know whether to think it was triggering or feel invalidated. I didn't know what to say and add to their experiences knowing it was a different kind of experience for me. seems like harmless joking but i feel like I may relaspe into binge purge cycle bc of how much consciousness is going to what I eat now. I feel myself having less self control. I notice I eat a little more or force myself to eat more because people keep pointing out that I eat v little. tbh I don't care what they think that's why I eat little without caring but the constant pointing out is affecting me.

So, my wife is currently in the stages of getting better from her ED - anorexia. During the last few years before we got together, she had become a vegetarian and is now a vegan.

Now, I can accept all the moral arguments to support veganism, that is not my dispute here. I have vegan friends. What muddies the water on her moral or ethical stance is that, I believe, is that it is a very calculated way to control what she eats. Let me be clear, I don't think that eating meat or eggs will cure her. Its just that, for anyone else who is a vegan by principle, I could accept. But in her case, I believe it is a way to control and perpetuate her ""ritual torture"". By dropping her strict diet, maybe it will be a sign of a 'letting-go' of the rigid control she feels she needs to have.

I would happily adopt a vegan diet on ethical grounds. But in my case, there's no underlying illness that makes it convenient ruse for me to do so. I know you can be healthy on a vegan diet - you could be a bodybuilder on a vegan diet.

I can't help but find a link between the letting go of her rigid rules on eating and being more comfortable and closer to a 'shedding' of the power of being ill.

Even small things like choosing what to eat at a meal becomes obfuscated and becomes a drag.

I’ve suffered from BED since I was about 12-13 years old, I’m now 26 and very overweight. Throughout the years I’ve gone through the stints of eating better, feeling good for a few weeks and then relapsing and feeling helpless. I currently am in the state of feeling helpless. My family have always commented on my weight, my siblings always bullied me for it, I have always been the fat friend, I’ve never had a healthy relationship with food 

I recently started on anti depressants for my depression, anxiety, and agoraphobia as it was starting to take over my life, while they’re still kicking in I’ve relapsed in my EDs tremendously.

Binging and restricting has always been my main issue, I would make myself throw up a lot throughout high school from excessive eating but didn’t do it until recently, about six months ago I would magically “start coughing” after every time I ate a big meal throw it back up and my boyfriend would always ask if I was doing it on purpose to which I’d lie and say no because to be honest I’ve only really come to the realisation I was subconsciously doing it, I think part of my denial was my own self judgement of being fat but bulimic due to internalised stereotypes 

I’ve been noticing a lot of subconscious behaviours around my EDs, if I go out to eat with other people (which is extremely rare due to embarrassment and fear) I always eat less no matter how hungry I am so I appear to not stuff my face, I’ll also play with my food in a way where it looks like I’m just a slow eater

I have some very dear friends coming to visit me this year for the first time since I moved to a new state.
These visits will be on separate occasions, but both of them have alluded to struggles with disordered eating in the past. They owe me no details and I will not pry, but I wanted to see what steps I could take to make my home as welcoming as possible. I've already made some notes on what snacks they seem comfortable eating and will be sure to stock up on those. Would covering up nutrition labels be a step too far? I'm open to any and all suggestions!

For my thesis, I am analyzing the role of different household dynamics (single versus double parent) in the development of eating disorders and/or disordered eating behavior. My research consists of 26 questions regarding personal/family medical history, family dynamics and feelings related to weight/body. The survey will take approximately 10 minutes to complete. ​​The survey poses psychological risks for participants due to the topic of eating disorders and other psychiatric disorders. The survey also includes discussion of eating disorder behaviors including restriction, inappropriate compensatory behaviors, and binging and purging episodes which can be triggering. An “I decline to answer” option will be available for all multiple choice questions, and can be stated for the free response answers if needed. Additionally, there will be behavioral health resources listed at the end of the survey. Due to the sensitive nature of this survey, no identifying information (such as participant name and internet protocol address) will be collected, and survey responses will be kept anonymous.

This is project #1551 and has been approved by the Viterbo University IRB.

I am requesting responses from individuals who meet the following criteria:

1. At least 18 years old
2. Grew up under their parent(s) care until at least 18 years of age.
3. History of or currently engage in an eating disorder/disordered eating behavior
   1. Disordered eating can be defined as but is not limited to: frequent dieting, anxiety associated with specific foods, skipping meals, chronic weight fluctuations, strict rituals/routines surrounding food and exercise, feelings of guilt/shame with eating or a feeling of loss of control around food including compulsive eating habits.

everything he eats is very plain and measured out. he cant really share food with me because it seems to upset him. and not in an annoyed way, in a sort of panicky frustrated way, if that makes sense? he also says hes eaten the same lunch everyday for the past year, and the same two or three meals for tea. i try not to push him because it might be a sensitive subject, but sometimes he cant eat food if its a certain colour or texture? he also tends to cut up food very very small, not sure if thats relevant? the most alarming bit for me is just how much of it comes out of a tub in powder form. ive also realised over the past few months that he tires very very easily, and is also completely caffeine dependent. ive mentioned some observations to him, but he always seems ashamed so im trying not to push too hard. honestly, should i be worried?",1676675259.0

I first developed an eating disorder when I was a teenager. I was an overweight child, and when I hit puberty I became very self-conscious about my body. Eventually, I became obsessed with the thought of losing weight; despite being a fairly attractive person, I became convinced that I was fat and ugly. At one point, I was not able to eat as much as I normally would for a season, and I lost enough weight for people to notice. I received a ""good work"" from someone, and it all went downhill from there. 

I started restricting food and exercising a lot. I could not stop, and eventually I got so underweight for my age and height that I was constantly in pain and tired, and every time I saw people they commented on how thin I was and how worried they were. I went to the doctor one day and he told me that my option was to recover at home, or be admitted to a residential ED program until I could become weight restored. In favor of the former option, Mom sat with me at the table for each meal everyday for months to make sure I was eating.

I ""recovered"" by my eighteenth birthday after two years of hard work, but all throughout life I still had disordered eating habits. 

A few years ago, over a decade later, my ED returned with a vengeance. I lost weight after spending several years being obese, and again went into the underweight range. I was counting calories, over-exercising, water loading, and restricting. A relatively healthy change of habits thus downturned into being a full-fledged relapse.

 I weight restored to healthy levels back in 2021, thanks to the support and concern of my wife. However, I have actively been struggling with my eating disorder since early 2022. I purged for the first time last summer, and eventually did it a few times a week. I was always honest about struggling with this, and even nowadays my wife gets suspicious when I use the restroom right after eating. 

 Currently, I am struggling with extreme food restriction and over-exercising. My wife hid our scale, but I found it and have been secretly weighing myself. I've lost a lot of weight in the last month, and have been working with my therapist and figuring out whether I will need to attend an IOP ED program. 

 A lot of times, I will agree to eat more, and realize that I need to, but eventually I get so scared of becoming overweight again that I just do not do it. 

 Being male with Anorexia Nervosa has been quite a strange experience. Most people I know with the disorder are women, and a lot of my insecurities about my body are similar yet different to those I hear from others. Either way, it's hard to realize that I am so unhealthy, yet so disgusted with my own body that I struggle with recovering.

 Thanks for hearing me out.",1676669279.0

i'm skinnier than her. she is not overweight either. she has told me several times that she feels self concious or that she constantly compares herself to me, and it honestly isn't good for me either. i really don't like it and i've told her that, but i know i can't ask her to stop, i know it's hard for her. she has stopped saying it to me, though.

now, what i've done basically is ask her constantly what she has eaten or if she is with me i'll make sure we both eat and i stay with her the whole time. when we order food i try to ask her what she wamts or to help me look at restaurants so we don't order something she doesn't like, but she has told me to search for myself and pick for myself if she´s feeling bad because if she does it it's gonna make her feel worse, so i'm trying to do that. sometimes she gets better but she relapses back everytime. another important thing is that we study musical theatre, which needs a lot of physical effort. i've tried telling her that she needs to eat so she can dance and do everything in a healthy way, but i don't know if it's helping.

recently i feel like things have gotten worse. she gets nauseous if she eats, she feels bad if we're watching a movie and she eats a whole bag of chips as a snack, she almost never wants to eat lunch, etc.

the other day we were in my house and she was telling me about something her friend had texted her, so i asked if i could see the chat in her phone and she said yes. i took it and unlocked it, and it was open on twitter, on an account i had never seen before (which is weird because we follow each other and are always sharing tweets). i thought she just changed her username and layout, so i asked why was her twitter so pretty (she usually just has a layout of cat memes), i looked at her and she didn't say anyting but she looked horrified. i looked again and i saw some weight on her bio (cw, gw, im not sure what that means) but i just closed the app and went to the chat i was supposed to look at.

at night, alone, i remembered her username so i searched for it, and i realized it was a edtwt acc. i'm not an expert on that side of twitter but i'm a little bit familiarized with it, and i know how toxic it can be. and i thought she knew that too, because not long ago she had told me she found one of her best friend's edtwt acc and that she thought it was horrible. but now, she's in too.

i didn't know what to do, and i know what i'm doing is bad because it's something private for her, but i've been stalking her acc ever since. it's tweets of her saying how pretty she'd look or how nice her outfits would look on her if she was skinny, complaining how she is the ugly one in the relationship, even tweets saying i never know how to make her feel better, which sucks because i've really tried. she talks abourt fasting and retweets a lot of ""inspo"" that is just... a lot. edtwt as a whole is a lot. she has also started taking pics of every single meal she eats, counting it's calories and posting it, even if she's eating with me. one time she even said she didn't want to eat lunch, but since i was at her house, she had to. she says she wants to lose weight and she's starting a new restricting diet, which i know it's not healthy considering the amount of workout we do on our major. she now spends all day in edtwt groupchats, and i know it because she even chats in them next to me, and it makes me incredibly anxious to know she's talking with strangers that could just convince her to enter unhealthy habits, i don't know. she has over 100+ followers now...

she knows i know about the account and after that i've told her that i've noticed she's not eating again (idk if that was a good idea) and that i really don't get why she has the account, that i'm not gonna force her to close it or prohibit her to use it, but that i need her to talk to me and explain everything to me so i can understand her, because i'm never gonna know how it feels and the only way for me to know a piece of her mind is if she shares it with me. she hasn't said a word, though. i've told her a lot of times to seek help and she tells me she's gonna do it but it never happens.

i'm so worried and i'm running out of options here, because i know she's gonna be uncomfortable if i talk about her ed with someone in our circle, and we basically know the same people, so i don't have anyone to ask for advice. i don't know how to talk about eds or how to help someone with one.

what should i do? should i try and talk to her again? search for a therapist? psychiatrist? any other option?

sorry if it's too long, this is my last resource. please help.",1676667387.0

I have always had a pretty rough relationship with food. When I was a child, my mother was not able to buy nutritious foods. My dad however was. So I would always eat all of the fruits and vegetables that I could. I think this is the root of my bad relationship with food. If I see a donut, I literally shake and need to get away from it, or I feel like I have no control and have to eat it. I am trying mindful eating. I used to scroll on social media while I ate and I think it was one of my issues. I also learned about lifestyle changes, and 80% healthy, and 20% whatever you want. I have body image issues also which I think do not help. How can I overcome these issues and just live my life in a healthy manner?

I eat if I am hungry though. Sometimes I eat if I am hungry. It is just that even when I am hungry, I'll just have a little and I will be full. My parents force me to eat full meals so that I don't get malnourished.  
I eat when I am hungry. But theb there are times (especially mornings) when even though I am hungry, I just don't want to eat anything.  So, I deny the fact that I am hungry and don't eat anything for sometime. 
Honestly, if it weren't for my parents, I probably wouldn't eat at all. 
I'll have food of it is good. I love curry and pickles and I love pizza too. But the quantity I have wouldn't be much.

I have never gotten a diagnosis and I guess it could be a phase or something but I’m just looking for advice.

I usually eat normally and then eat “too much” one day and go into a thing where I only eat dinner for about a week. 

I had tried purging but I could never actually do it.

Recently this happened again but I was able to purge (vomiting). And I exercised… a bit… because I was never really good at that but I think it made somewhat of a difference.

I am still a healthy weight but I feel like I SHOULD be underweight.

And I’m kind of scared that I will eventually stop eating and develop a proper eating disorder (if this isn’t one) and not be able to stop.

I don’t know if I binge but I purge whenever I feel like I’ve eaten too much.

For the past few days I’ve been bringing stuff (eg. cling wrap and a toothbrush) in case I feel the need to purge.

Today for the first time for about three days I ate without purging (but it was one capsicum slice so…) and I still haven’t had dinner yet.

I’ve been starting to get hungry but it goes away and comes back.

I started this when I ate 4 meals and 10+ snacks in a day… so is that a binge.

I also know that you can eat normally with both Bulimia and Purging Disorder however Bulimia involves binges.

I want to get a diagnosis but only if this sounds like something to people who know what it’s like.",1676441328.0

Backstory: My wife and I have been together for 20 years and let me 2 years into my relationship that she has had Anorexia/Bulimia since she was 13 years old. When looking back at how I supported her these last 2 decades it hasn't been the best. I have guilt tripped her and I have criticized her due to a complete lack of understanding on the disorder. This past year I have found the error of my ways and I can see that this is something that she cannot control. I still struggle every conversation, and my wife gets super defensive when opening up, which causes me to be super defensive. SO! I am coming to Reddit for help because I am not succeeding with her preference on how to communicate.

This is what I have found out in regard to a few sessions of her opening up and what I need help with understanding on the newest conversation with her.

* Unless she is blatantly lying my wife has stated that her eating disorder is in no way related to any childhood trauma. She has re-assured me over the years that this is not the main trigger.
* My wife has stated that when she is triggered, she feels like all the cells in her body are ""heavy"".
* I cannot go into details on my wife's appearance due to respect of the group BUT I can assuredly say that my wife is teetering on the line of being underweight.
* My wife goes to a Psychiatrist who addresses her anxiety and has tried a few newer medications to address her ED. As you all know treating ED with meds is very difficult.
* My wife is pro-mental health treatment BUT when it comes to actually go herself - she exceptionally against going. She says it's too difficult and there is no proven therapy to treat ED.

My current situation deals with a conversation that led to an argument tonight. We were making a grocery shopping list and I went first to add to our shopping cart. My wife always makes me go first b/c she says her going first is a trigger. She quickly skimmed the cart and said that in the past I have told her that she needs to order more because it's not enough for the whole week. She stated that I need to add more food. She then criticized me for being too black/white when on a diet. My wife currently knows that I am not eating healthily and I do not exercise. I need to change that.. I have very high blood pressure and I am not healthy. We got further into our argument when I told her that I simply can't trade my health for hers anymore. I have to take care of myself and eat healthy/good foods. This caused her to spiral as there is materials and such on good vs. bad foods, and that by me labeling good food triggers her. I understand what she is saying and she is right. I am a Black/White person. When I get dedicated to something it's a super discipline. 

The issue that I am having is - How do I diet, care for myself, and take my health seriously without triggering her? I tried to ask her and she just says I don't know. Can anyone help me dig into this and help me and her at the same time?

Thanks,

610,Is it possible I actually have an ED or am I just lazy?,4,111jcfe,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/111jcfe/is_it_possible_i_actually_have_an_ed_or_am_i_just/,3,"I 16F am confused if I have an eating disorder.

As a child I was fairly fit, I played outside, didn’t eat often as I do now, and was pretty normal, atleast that’s what I thought. When the third grade fitness exam came around I noticed I was bigger than the rest of the girls in my grade and was fatshamed for it. I started shutting myself in, isolating myself, whenever I was fed by my grandmother I would eat fast just to go back into my bedroom for hours. I didn’t go outside and get exercise besides the daily PE class. As I got older my doctors told my grandmother 64F and mother 40F I was obese and they started forcing me to exercise.I was forced on the treadmill which i hated and so I started sneaking poptarts to the garage where the treadmill was just for comfort. When they found out I was sneaking poptarts in, they got extremely upset and ridiculed me. This started this trend in my family to call me fat and lazy and my siblings and relatives joined in. To cope with this I started eating in my bedroom to avoid them and sleeping in. I hate exercising because all I would hear is them calling me fat. During the pandemic I would make myself puke but it got exhausting to continue so I replaced that habit with sleeping. Highschool made it worse cause nobody wanted to date “the fat girl” and although I was desired it was only for sex or secretly. One occasion my mother asked the doctor if she could put me on pills to supress my appitite or a worm that would eat the food I ate once digested. I always tend to eat alot when I’m bored as well. 

I honestly don’t know if it’s an eating disorder or if its just me being lazy. There are more examples on what my grandma and mom did to me but these are the ones in mind:

- Grandmother and mom kept feeding me unhealthy junk like burgers and pizza, yet restricted me from candy.
- Multiple occasions my mom shamed me in public for asking for candy.
- Forced me to exercise until I met the desired time.

Sometimes I enjoy exercising but when its on my own terms and not on anybody elses.
I’ve tried to only eat salads and while I enjoy salads it just isn’t enough.

So am I lazy or do I have an ED?",1676320779.0

My husband (31M) and I (25F) have been together for 6 1/2 years. He has a number of physical and mental concerns I don’t need to get into here, but I will say he sees a spine doctor twice a week and a therapist twice a month with no end in sight. We don’t have a high food budget. It’s comfortable, but we can’t afford to go out to eat more than once or twice a month (meaning fast food or ordering to-go). If we could afford it and it was up to him, we’d go out a few times a week. 

I’ll lead with the fact that I don’t mind cooking for him. I don’t mind meal prepping or needing to cook every meal. 

His issues with food have to do with childhood trauma and texture. For example, a comedy bit he used to explain it to me was someone’s mom making a popular fast food burger “just like the restaurant” but it turned out to be a wad of half cooked ground beef with white bread. That’s kind of how he was raised. He will almost never eat generic brand anything because he can tell the texture and flavor are a little bit off. He doesn’t microwave cook anything. He doesn’t eat casserole-type dishes. He always needs something crunchy with the meal—like chips or crackers. 

One of the biggest issues is him needing to eat almost as soon as he wakes up. We’ll have a fruit smoothie in the mornings, but it’s not enough. When he gets hungry, his whole body hurts and he will sometimes dry heave. His anxiety kicks in and I can’t get out of him what he wants to eat. I don’t mind cooking whatever he needs but if I just make something, it’s like it’s never the right thing. On top of it, I’m pregnant and now I’m having food aversions, so it’s just a little overwhelming. 

I need help finding how to support him better so he can just grab something, eat, and move on. Eventually it would be nice if he could incorporate more veggies and whole grains because right now he’s not eating any. I know it’s not that easy, but anything will help at this point. He says he doesn’t want to make me do things but no matter how much I tell him I want to help, he thinks the worst. I hope I got all the details without going overboard but if you need more I’ll share.",1676300547.0

if i eat at a low intake i’ll just feel so hungry and binge purge too im basically stuck with bulimia i feel like, and i know this might be wrong to say but i’d kill to be anorexic again, i literally can’t stand bulimia anymore idk what to do atp
and i’m getting help, i have understanding parents, a therapist and stuff but bulimia feels like it’s fucking stuck and glued to me, and this isn’t how i wanna live, and i tried everything so far, the most i lasted without binge purging was 3 days, everytime i relapse it’s impossible to stop",1676307813.0

after she said that i got mad. i stomped to the bathroom and tried making myself throw up. i hate throwing up so that didn’t work even though i wish it did. i’m in my room and i have an urge to cover all my mirrors so i don’t have to look at my new double chin. i want to delete all my selfies in my phone, even the ones i recently thought were nice. i’m so upset i cant even finish my homework that’s due in an hour. i just can’t bring myself to do it. i want to lay in my bed and waste away, feeling bad about myself. we have a treadmill but i stopped using it after a week because i feel like she’s watching me use it and then laughing at me when i eat anything. like she’s going “haha fat bitch thinks she can lose weight by doing the treadmill but still eats more then one meal a day… what an idiot!” deep down i know she isn’t thinking that, but i can’t help it. 

i wish i could rip off my skin. now i made the decision to starve tomorrow. let’s see if i can do it, usually when i try i fail towards the end but i’m gonna do it just to spite her. i guess her tactic worked because now i’m determined to survive on water tomorrow.

she is constantly writing stuff like “ currently relapsing” or “relapsing is hitting so hard right now” all over her social media, and it is overwhelming for me.

every time we go out, she always finds an excuse to not eat… and so when i look down at my finished plate, it makes me want to die.

I was recovered for like 2 years. I just realized today I am definitely in a relapse and have been since at least December. I was using my health issues (causing disinterest in food) as an excuse. They're only part of the picture. The reality is, I'm not fighting it, and on some level I want this again. I'm not even sure if recovery is something I want right now. I'm pro-recovery, obviously, or I wouldn't have committed to it in the first place. But now my commitment is wavering. 

I'm going to talk to a dietician again hopefully since that helped last time, and go to therapy. 

But how do you even make yourself want recovery again? How do you not feel like you've lost all your progress?

 I don't even know what I want. I want to not die anytime soon, I don't want to feel sick or damage my body, but I don't want to recover right now, really. Maybe part of me does but the rest of me doesn't. 

I'm not even depressed, and I feel semi-okay in my body. I just don't feel like I deserve food and I don't really want it right now and I think my life would be easier if I was skinnier. I'm feeling very similar to how I felt when I started the spiral into an eating disorder the first time around like 10 years ago. I am a bit scared though--I was healthier back then. Now I have a bunch of health issues. I'm not sure what this relapse will mean in my new context, and that's scary.

I struggle with bulimia and am currently in therapy regarding this. I am supposed to (and want to) keep an eating diary. I've tried to do this written per hand. However I'm completely honest, it just doesn't work for me. So I was thinking about using an app.

I've looked at ***Recovery Record***, however, I didn't really like it.

She was also addicted to speed and prescription opiates. I was 13 and was my sister's main support as my parents just pretended nothing was happening. My I stopped her killing herself several times, slept in her bed every night to make sure her heart didn't stop and had to deal with her off her head on various substances and behaving in a manic way (cooking really weird stuff, writing on the walls, randomly screaming etc). When I was 17 I lost a friend to an eating disorder too. I also have experience from an old housemate and a few friends who have eating disorders.

I met my friend, S, 4 years ago and we were instantly inseparable. I was bridesmaid at her wedding last year, I went on a road trip with her to get the ring when she proposed and I was the first person she told thay she was going to propose. We trained as nurses together and generally have been through a lot.

Last year was the worst year of my life. Among various things, I found out I can't have children, I had a cancer scare, I was scammed out of £5k and I found out my partner was having an affair. That is only a few of the things that happened! I've been horrifically depressed and only barely coping. S is aware and has sort of kept her distance. She cheated on her husband and i think feels very attacked when j talk about my partner cheating on me (it was very different, won't go into why). I had asked S if I could live with her for a bit while I looked for somewhere else to live when things were bad with my partner and she just laughed and said no because I'm too messy (she is trying for a baby and keeps saying it's great I live so close because she'll always have free childcare) I'm not the best at opening up about stuff from having to care for people so much I'm used to my problems being irrelevant and I've just generally not talked about stuff, but she knows my whole history. I'm going through a rough time, but my eating disorder has been mostly under control luckily.

She has started to restrict to ridiculously low and obsessively calorie counting except one day a week when she binges. We're both nurses so really active at work and she walks her dog everyday too. She did once tell me that she was on the verge of an ED but found being vegan allowed her to get better before things got serious. She was sick this morning and had to miss work because it was her cheat day and she over did it. I said she's better off just doing a sensible diet and I'd have to restrict even lower as I'm a lot shorter than her. She said fine I just won't talk to you about it anymore then.

She then went for dinner with her sister. I have seen people on reddit say they've cut people off before and I've always figured I couldn't do that because my instinct is always to care for people and want to be there. But she's said she won't talk to me about it anyway and I can't do this all over again when I'm on the edge anyway. I just can't.

i'm sorry if this comes across as awkwardly written. i just really feel like i needed to talk to someone or get this out and i don't think i can tell people i know in real life yet.  i even made this account specifically for this so i hope it's all okay. 
so i'm 21, and a university student (my degree means often standing up in front of people and being on a stage, which has become a big problem for me.)

i've never really been a confident person but it got really quite bad last summer (i won't go into details but i was just very unhappy and very insecure.) after that, i started trying to eat less and eat more healthy meals. i also started walking my dog to try to help me feel like i was doing more. my family members told me since that i have lost a lot of weight but i can't tell myself, i look at myself and i'm scared i've actually put on. (this might be down to body dysmorphia which has been really affecting me for a while now.)

i used to eat more such as snacks or breakfast during the day, but i've almost completely stopped anything aside from one meal (that i can't not eat since my mum usually cooks for me) and a small snack like a piece of fruit or a couple of like m&m style candies. i've also fallen into checking parts of the internet (like twitter) that have people talking about eating disorders and this usually makes me feel worse or feel more spurred on to do these kinds of things. i just feel like i want to eat nothing and feel horrible when i do, i often feel like i should throw up when i've eaten something i ""don't need"" and i have tried multiple times, but i get scared (of damaging my voice or my teeth, of someone hearing or seeing or smelling, or just because throwing up isn't nice). i've only actually done it twice but very small amounts. i'm convinced i won't let it become a habit, and if i had more self control it wouldn't need to happen at all.  

something that makes me sad is that i started walking my dog for fun and because i love her. but now i do it twice daily, and i choose routes that don't make sense just to make it longer, and have a minimum number of steps that i need to do in my head. and i feel terrible if i don't do this. 

i just find it hard these days to think of anything else, and i'm in a really stressful time of university and i'm just scared that i'm going to sacrifice my performance in classes because of it, and it can't even feel valid because i can't tell anyone in real life. i just think of it when i'm alone, with people, going to sleep, waking up, in the car, watching tv, listening to music. everywhere. and it's terrible to have to stand up in front of people in classes and Want to look like anyone else on earth. 

sometimes i think i'm fine. i can forget about it. but it comes back every time and comes back worse. and i don't want to be sick, i don't even feel like i'm in the space to call myself sick or say i have a problem. because i know right now, i don't look like i should have this problem. and the fact that i don't scares me into thinking that im making it up or appropriating someone else's serious problem. because i'm scared that the exercising or the lack of eating isn't enough for me to qualify for these problems either, like i should be pushing myself even further. i just wish i could make faster progress (or feel like im making it at all), as sick as that sounds. i just want to enjoy things i always loved and not connect the most random things to wanting to look different and feel different. the anxiety it's causing me is just so hard to deal with. and when i live the same for like a week, and it feels normal, i feel like im doing something wrong and need to ramp it up somehow because i feel like im not trying hard enough. i'm just scaring myself. 

i have a really understanding mum and family. and i have some good online friends i could tell, but i don't want anyone to think of me differently. i'm still me. i don't want them to think i'm fragile or pity me. and i also i don't want to stop doing what i'm doing. i want to keep going. i feel like i haven't even done enough yet to qualify getting any help. and i don't want to stop yet. i want to lose weight and feel differently so bad it might kill me. but i feel so embarrassed of myself even saying that. sometimes i just feel like there's no point in any of this and i'm too old to be feeling this way. i just wish i'd been born as a different person. 

anyway. i'm sorry if that sounded dramatic or too heavy. i guess i'm just trying to figure out if i really have a problem worth noting. or if i'm making it up. i guess i just want to feel normal or feel like someone knows, even if it's a stranger. i just wanted to talk about it for the first time ever.

They don't do it when I'm genuinely struggling because they don't know because I am now able to help myself. But when I weigh perfectly healthy! When I eat probably more than the average person! When I am seriously fine! Oh nope, you're trying to sabotage your diet, you're looking soooo thin, so pale, yup yup two cups of milk and extra of everything a day will fix this.

I dont like feeling full. I think at the end of each meal 2/3 full is fine. You feel energised, satisfied and not sluggish. I don't need to eat SO much to live, to enjoy living - you don't enjoy food when you're full. I mean if you're gonna force me at least give me healthy stuff instead of unhealthy!

Yeah when I was underweight and hating myself and really sick. You don't need medicine when you are not ill. That's harmful. And the more they make me eat the more I avoid food elsewhere. Isn't it contradicting?

I don't know what to do. I have been actually cutting back on other stuff now because I feel too full. I can't talk to my parents about it and no they don't open my mouth wide and stuff food in there, but I can't say no or argue much. It doesn't work and I can't do it. Any advice?

Even after two years in recovery, I still feel so nervous and upset if I don’t know when and what I’m going to eat… which is the case for this trip. This is compounded by the fact that I’m probably going to have to face a lot of my fear foods without the physical support of my mom or therapist…. 

As the date of school trip approaches, I can’t help but feel like i’ve made a big mistake. I feel this overwhelming sense of dread every time I think about it. 

It’s non refundable, and it cost my parents nearly $2000, and so I feel so guilty for even thinking about wasting their money or getting their hopes up.

658,Med changes for bulimia?,6,10yh067,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10yh067/med_changes_for_bulimia/,9,"Sorry in advance for the long post...

I started seeing a new psychiatrist in December and she also specialises in eating disorders. I didn't go to her specifically for my bulimia, but figured it was a nice perk. 
In our first session, I told her all the meds I was on, which included Olanzapine (10mg) and Mirtazapine (45mg), which had been recently increased during my last inpatient admission last year. I also gave a general history of what I have been diagnosed with, which is when I mentioned the bulimia.

She asked me if I was a smoker (which I am) and how much do I smoke. When I told her she said that when someone is smoking as much as I do, it basically nullifies any therapeutic benefits of Olanzapine only leaving me with the side effects which include weight gain and increased appetite. So she gave me a plan for the following 3 weeks to come off it.
She also wanted me to start using Recovery Record again (eating disorder logging app) and link her to my profile so she can see how I am going, since she was concerned about how often I said I was binging and purging. Which was no problem for me since I already am logging everything on Lose It anyway. (I've actually been finding it interesting/helpful being able to log my moods, thoughts, behaviours, and urges as well).

During our second appointment on the 27.01, she said that she knew from what I had explained during the last appointment that the bulimia was a significant issue, but she didn't realise how bad it actually is. That everytime she reviews her patient's on Recovery Record, I am always at the top of her list and always in the red. She asked me again if I would consider another eating disorder admission (first/last time I did an ED admission was in 2016) and I told her no.

She then said that she wants to take me off Mirtazapine as soon as possible. That because it significantly increases appetite and weight gain, that it was making everything even worse (apparently vets use Mirtazapine on animals that need to gain weight for various reasons, including due to cancer... which blew my mind!). That even though the CPTSD is the primary issue, that the binging and purging was making my anxiety and depression symptoms worse, which then feeds into the eating disorder, and it's just a vicious cycle. Her hope is that by coming off the Mirtazapine and starting a new medication, it will help with one piece of the puzzel. She explained that it wasn't going to get rid of the eating disorder, but maybe if I am not having as often and stronge urges to binge, that I won't be purging as much as I do.
She actually seemed a bit frustrated that I was not only put on these medications in the first place, but that they increased my doses during my last admission since I have a history of eating disorders.

SO (lot of background for this one question, sorry), she instead wants to put me on Vyvanse. She said that it's an ADHD medication (which my psychologist is very interested in me trying because she thinks I have ADD), but it has been used to help manage Binge Eating Disorder. Since I am binging, it should help with these symptoms.

Has anyone been put on Vyvanse to combat bulimia/BED? Have you found it helpful or not? I did a quick google and it does say it has been used for binge eating disorder but am curious to hear other's anecdotal evidence. 

If you made it to the end... I am impressed haha thank you",1676006061.0

I never eat breakfast, and I often just have a snack during the day. The only real meal I eat is dinner.

Recently I moved into University, and where I'm staying they make meals for you, and you get to choose from about three options for each meal. Everything that they had, I couldn't stand to eat (other than plain rice), and sometimes I would just not eat or eat a very small amount because I could smell the other foods and they were destroying my appetite.

Thankfully now that I've told the staff about this, they're moving me into an area where I can cook for myself.

My mother says that I shouldn’t be spending money on take out like that as “it’s expensive” but right now I don’t have the emotional or physical energy to cook in front of her. My mother has been and will always be the main trigger for my ED. She in general hates it when I eat “junk” by her standards. Instead of dealing with her lecture me about my portions, or about the money I spend on food when she “buys food for everyone” (for my brother and sister). I am not “allowed” to ask for sodas or “excessive junk” like what my younger siblings get. And the things I like to her would be considered “junk.” Another side note: I’m autistic. I have safe foods. She buys this “whole grain penne” for my sister and I. I hate it. It’s too grainy. Pasta is my safe food. But not in that form.

Instead I buy takeout because I know what I’m getting will be a safe food. However I cannot stand it when she lectures me about spending on groceries and food. It’s triggering and she will not listen until I yell at her to mind her own business.

I, 36F, have been friends with J, 40F, for 17 years. I used to consider him my best friend… until he said that he had anorexia. He knows I have it, and he knows I’ve gotten down to XX pounds. He weighs around XXX, and he thinks that he has anorexia (“atypical”?!) because his therapist told him that. Not a doctor, not a diagnosing person. Just his therapist… because what happened is that his wife called him fat and said other rude things and then left him. Well, he had a series of panic attacks, and he related them to food. I, uh, am kind of ashamed of this, but I refuted the diagnosis for him. (I have an associates in human services and had to study a lot of psychology.)  I dumbed it down, like, “hey, all that happened was that you were afraid of food because your wife called you rude stuff”. He then said something like “don’t you think that could have been a trigger to set it off?”. I said something sarcastic, and then he claimed to have a work meeting. Twenty minutes goes by, and he comes back. Doesn’t even address my comment or the issue. He straight-up said that we should leave his marital issues out of it and that he and I were “edging” on an emotional affair. Uh, so, after that, I told him not to talk to me. He didn’t listen; he sent a long message, so I repeated myself to the point of saying “no means no”. He hasn’t spoken to me since, although he did React to one of my Facebook memes about a cat. I’m supposed to play dnd tonight with him and a bunch of his friends.

I say all this because… when it comes to trigger points, yeah. I can see how something his wife said could have set him off; however, he was on the same token talking about how he didn’t want to make the effort to lose weight. That’s not anorexia (unless it’s recovery?). He’d started the whole talk by telling me about the movie “The Whale”, and he wanted to know about other Ed stories. So, I told him some stuff, and then he asked how he was like/not like the main character (who weighed way more than he does). I was like “sorry, I honestly don’t know because you don’t talk to me about food”. I just feel… Urgh, used? As if I was some token that he wanted to cash in. I’m not a dang token. I’ve had this since high school (before 2005).

The vomiting sometimes happens monthly, sometimes weekly, and thankfully nowadays rarely daily. I went 5 weeks without throwing up but it will always come back. And it debilitates me.

684,I did Veganuary for fun (previously ate meat and dairy) but now all non-Vegan / processed foods have become fear foods (not for the ethical reasons).

And it isn't to do with the ethical side of it, but that somehow I now see vegan food as 'good' / 'clean' / 'healthy' and non-vegan food as 'bad' and 'unhealthy'.

Before this, I had no problem with non-Vegan food and ate processed food regularly, even ate fast-food too, but now I am really focused on eating whole / unprocessed food and non-Vegan food.

It's getting to a really unhealthy point and I've lost a lot of weight (genuinely without trying to) and i'm wondering if it's because of the diet? I do track macros / calories and the nutrients / calories are exactly the same as when I wasn't vegan but I have rapidly lost weight.

My gf has had ED for about 5.5 years now and she has gone from B/P-ing 6-8 times per week to about once or twice a month. She even held out with 0 B/P for three months!

I really try to do everything by my research, while also staying true to myself (not sounding fake or forced). 

How can I support her when she does relapse though? I feel so saddened and hurt when she does 'slip' but at the same time, it hurts a lot less from when it was really bad because she has gotten a lot better. 

Ive been talking about therapy but its been hard to find a faith-based ED therapist (we're both Christian). Not saying thats the only option but I do think that it would be helpful to talk about this with someone who also understands our spiritual background.",1675889312.0

i threw up for the first time in probably over 10 years a few weeks ago, i think it was a combination of betting high with friends (which never usually makes me feel sick) and a ton of anxiety at the time due to some friendship struggles and whilst i was very inebriated, it made me really scared that i would throw up again so i’ve cut back on smoking a lot.

i have really bad anxiety and one of the main symptoms i get are super bad stomach aches but they never make me throw up usually but apparently today was different.

i was already having a bad day, i’ve been stressed out because a lot is happening in the next few weeks and i don’t cope with change all too well but i thought i was feeling better until all of a sudden i had to rush to the toilet and throw up. i felt really gross after i did it but then i felt a lot better. i’m at home now and i feel really uneasy about all of it.

i’ve been eating less and less the past few weeks anyway because eating food makes me feel really guilty and it feels like this is a sign of how it could become. the more i think about it, those intrusive thoughts that say i’m disgusting are telling me to do it again as if it would make me feel better and i’m scared maybe it would make me feel better.

i’ve been in a bad headspace for a very very long time now and i feel like every time i get upset im going to want to throw up from now on to feel less guilty about my weight and eating habits.

i can get really self-destructive and i don’t want to fall down a path of even more self hatred, any guidance would help, thanks.",1675785953.0

702,I binged...,0,10vxoa0,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10vxoa0/i_binged/,2,"Apologies ahead of time if this is TL;DR. I'm hoping someone will read this and have some insight. Something. Anything.

I had a doctor appointment yesterday that I'd been putting off because I knew I wouldn't hear anything good. I have type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. I'm on meds for all three. I'm able to keep these conditions under control when I'm able to maintain a healthy diet and exercise regularly. My problem is that for the last ten years, I've been unable to maintain a healthy diet and regular exercise routine consistently. At some point, I always fall off when I stop seeing progress (e,g., weight-loss, strength gains, endurance gains, etc). I get frustrated and lose the will to continue. I give up. It's actually a pattern similar to addictions I've battled.

Anyway, the goal with my doctor has always been to get off the meds and that would be possible, if I could maintain the healthy diet and exercise. So I have a strong reason to eat healthy and exercise regularly. Even before I'm going in, I'm feeling frustrated, stressed, and sad. I listen to my doctor reading off the lab results from my blood work and it's as expected. This pattern too has repeated itself between my doctor and I. One visit my lab results are great and I'm on the right track, the next visit the exact opposite. Up and then down.

On the drive home, I had thoughts of rolling through a Wendy's drive up and buying some comfort food, but kept driving. Then had thoughts of stopping at the grocery store for a tub of ice cream, but kept driving. I got home and immediately was in the kitchen, foraging. I tried fighting this for a while. I forced myself out of the kitchen, only to find myself wandering back in a few minutes later. Rinse, repeat a few more times. Fortunately in a recent grocery shopping trip I was focused on buying mostly healthy foods. I didn't have the pizzas, pastas, mac and cheese, instant mashed potatoes, and the other types of bad foods I normally would have stocked. I did however manage to make a black bean and cheese burrito with onions, ate a whole 8oz bag of Biena Habanero chickpeas, and also a few pieces of home made chicken jerky. After sll that I did manage to stop myself from going back to get more food.

I guess the plus side to this, is I do now recognize some of my triggers. I also recognize that while I was eating, I knew I was eating to sooth myself and I justified it. Even though while it was happening, I knew I would feel like crap afterwards, and I knew it wasn't good for my health. So again, I'm posting this in the hopes that someone else might recognize some similarities and could provide insight or advice. Words of wisdom. Words of encouragement. Something. Anything.

Thanks",1675761998.0
703,I think my ED might be encouraging my gf into disordered behaviors,1,10vx3vf,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10vx3vf/i_think_my_ed_might_be_encouraging_my_gf_into/,0,"So basically the title. I usually fast/restrict a lot but have been under a lot of stress and lately I've had several episodes of b/p. She worries a lot about it and she has known I restrict for a long time, but she just found out about the binging and purging lately.

She has struggled with body image issues her whole life and she's told me in the past she fasted sometimes and ate less so she dropped a lot of weight and she was underweight. She never had an ED and is currently at a normal weight, she eats whatever she wants and she stops eating when she feels full.

Lately however, I'm afraid she is skipping meals/somewhat restricting.

Yesterday I made her pancakes for breakfast, she didn't even eat one of them. At lunch time, she didn't even eat 1/4 of her plate and had a couple croissants for a snack.
So at dinner time she said she wasn't hungry and wasn't gonna eat, I offered to cook something for her or for her to eat the pancakes she left but she kept telling me she didn't want anything and she was full. I knew this was a lie since I know she barely ate. She ended up telling me to cook some bacon for her and then, after eating it, she told me she wanted some more and ended up eating a normal dinner. Which made me realize, she was actually hungry, she was just trying not to eat. She also said some things which are worrying like, she had a craving for bacon for a couple of days and she said that it's too bad that it has so many calories.  
I count my calories religiously so I'm also scared she said that because I do it.

I'm really worried about her, I don't want her to develop an ED like me and I know this shit is contagious and specially since she has those body image issues.

I don't know what to do, she tells me I always blame myself too much but I want her to be alright and feel really bad thinking it's all because of me. Also, I'm scared that this will make my own ed worse too or getting competitive about it. What can I do to avoid her developing an ED because of me?",1675759722.0

I stare at myself in the mirror for minutes to literal hours and hate myself so much. I’ve lost a significant amount of weight when I’m already underweight, and my mom is starting to notice I’m skinnier too. I can’t handle the thought that I could have an ED again, and I need to tell her so I can get help. How can I make her believe me? I’m so scared to even tell her because i just know that she’s gonna wanna refuse to believe it. I just can’t keep this to myself anymore.

I started throwing up when I was twelve years old. And it wasn't for a reason like I thought I was fat or something like that. It was because my Nana kept taking my phone away, so I would steal it back from her hiding places and hide in the bathroom to text my friends. She and my aunt came to the conclusion that I was in there throwing up. Don't know how or why but
they were positive that's what I was doing, no matter how much I denied it and no matter their lack of evidence. It got to the point where they were confronting me all the time, refusing to let me go to the bathroom alone, trying to get me into eating disorder therapy. Finally I just said to myself, ""fine. If they think I'm throwing up and won't believe anything otherwise and won't stop harassing me about it, I might as well start doing it so I'm not accused of something I'm not doing"". And that's where it actually began for me. 

The more I did it the more it became like a sort of addiction. It was the only thing I had any control over at all in my life. If I was angry I could go throw up. Stressed? Throw up. Depressed? Throw up. It became my solution to everything. I would stop here and there but always start back up. I lost weight drastically. By the time I was sixteen
years old I was extremely underweight. I looked at my bulimia as a friend in a way. A friend that I knew I shouldn't be hanging out with but always got me through whatever bad things were happening in my life at the time. 

Eventually my family got together and sent
me to a home for troubled girls. It was impossible for me to continue my bulimia there because I was
monitored CONSTANTLY. I also wasn't allowed to go to the bathroom for an allotted period of time after meals so usually by the time I was able to make it to the bathroom the food was already digested and unable to vomit back up. I also learned other coping skills to deal with my mental health issues besides throwing up. I finally was able to exit my program after two years at eighteen years old and I felt I was completely cured of my bulimia. 

I got pregnant shortly afterwards within an
abusive relationship, got pregnant a second time when my first born was a year old, and eventually a year after that I made it out of that abusive relationship with my kids father. All that time, I never threw up once.

 I have a new boyfriend now and he's wonderful. He tells me how beautiful I am and how much he loves me and loves my body. He treats my children as his own, and they even call him daddy. We are moving into our own place tomorrow after a year of dating. I have only told one of my best friends this but I have started throwing up again for the past two months. And it's not a control issue, it is because of my weight this time. I feel strange for restarting my bulimia over my weight when it was never about weight before. My body is no longer what it used to be. I look in the
mirror and am disgusted with my stomach and my
neck. I no longer look at my beach bikini pictures with pride of my body like I used to, but now shame and disgust at my cellulite and stomach rolls. I feel like my boyfriend deserves a thin beautiful toned woman, not a short chubby girl who doesn't have the time to work out because of raising a 4 year old and 2 year old. I am constantly comparing myself to other women, both mothers and those who aren't mothers. Everyone looks
better than me. 

I know I am slipping into a hole that will be impossible to climb out of without help. I keep telling myself I'Il stop when I'm back down to the weight I prefer. But I am afraid that I won't stop and I'll keep throwing up in order to maintain that weight. Please help me, anyone.",1675726541.0

I guess that isn’t exactly true, I do have quite a bit of insight into my situation and how it relates to the overall trajectory of my life and now what seems to be an ED.

As a child, I was heavy, definitely the heaviest in my class at school and despite being popular with lots of friends, was constantly teased because of my weight. I was the one kid wearing his shirt in the pool, or in the ocean, I never wanted to play in pickup games when skins v shirts was an option. I especially hated gym class when a multitude of uncomfortable situations were possible.

The summer before High School, I had a growth spurt and lost a ton of weight and obviously felt much better about myself. This was the first time I remember feeling the reward of controlling my weight and being accepted as a result.

Unfortunately, I developed a taste for illegal substances in my later teen years and started putting back on the weight I had lost. The end result was that I spent all of my 20s and the majority of my 30s as overweight, or obese. But I didn’t seem to care, ate whatever I wanted and had few instances where I even gave it a single thought.

Well, when Covid hit, I was trapped in one of the biggest cities in America, my routines were stopped and I blew up. I stayed that way until last March, when I had enough and decided I needed to make a change. 

What began as an honest attempt to correct my health, prevent diabetes, and feel better about myself somehow morphed into a full blown ED.

I don’t want to violate any rules of this sub, so I’m not sure how specific to be, but I used extreme dieting/restriction/exercise to lose a tremendous tremendous amount of weight. Every time I hit my goal, I moved the goal posts and told myself I was the healthiest I’ve ever been, why not a bit more?

Well, now here I am, 12 months later, still employing these extreme measures, now classified as underweight, I look horrible and sick and I can’t stop. 

I have almost no education on EDs in general, but I vacillate between restriction, and then short periods where I indulge in whatever I want (binge) and then go back to severe restriction.

I am at a point where I don’t have any lower to go, I am at the floor, in the basement actually. But I still can’t allow myself stop because I’m terrified it will all come back.

As a small kid, I was very picky and vomited without inducing various times each month. My teachers and relatives tried to make me eat, but I always refused or they forced me and I vomited. They tried it for YEARS without sucess, so they all just gave up so I could at least eat something.

In middle school (keep in mind I'm not from US). I've eat only noodles or bread daily. Yes, I had the condition to eat more than that, don't worry, I just didn't eat because I didn't felt like eating or was not hungry enough. In one part of middle school and high school I was in a school that I was 7 am but got there 6am and got out 5pm, got home almost 6pm. I didn't ate before going and I refused to eat all three meals they offered. In some days, almost never, can count in hands, brought a cookie to eat. Sometimes I gave it away, sometimes I ate only half. I got nausea and gagged when people ate around me, because of the smell of the food, because of the sight of someone eating, because of the vision of the fork moving in the disgusting food. It makes me sick. My mom didn't let me use the stove, so I couldn't make food for myself, either. However, I never wanted to cook, what would I make anyway?

I'm still very picky. I still gag and want to vomit when people eat or when there's food around me. I ate a bit more and not only noodles and bread, even though bread is still my ""main food"". 

Last year one of my teachers asked me about it, because pretty much all my school staff knows I have problems with food. I told her. She said that she is like that too. That she has an eating disorder. I have anxiety so that is stuck in my mind. 

I don't have problems with my body, weight, face, hair and/or clothes. Yeah, some very small insecurities that go away very fast, but I don't really care about it.

My psychiatrist put me on medications that would increase my appetite and cause weight gain.

5 years later, I was complaining to my psychiatrist about the weight gain and felt I was obese even though technically I was a healthy weight. 
I wanted to lose weight and the medication was making binge eat and feel out of control. My psych took me off of them. 

Fast forward a couple of months and I’ve lost about half the weight that I gained. I have little to no appetite and fear I won’t be able to stop losing weight.
I’m scared because I started a new job and don’t want to lose it from being anorexic. 

Do you have any suggestions of what I can do? 

At the same time I know I’ve been diagnosed with anorexia by doctors and I know I’ve had past behaviors, but when I’m not on those psych meds that increase appetite, I’m just not hungry and lose weight without trying. So is this even anorexia?

733,Is it extreme hunger or just binging?,3,10u802s,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10u802s/is_it_extreme_hunger_or_just_binging/,0,"Hello, im recovering from anorexia. I’ve relapsed once around october/november. So i was restricting for about 2-3 months. it wasn’t a heavy restriction but still restriction. i didn’t eat breakfast, had a limited lunch and a pretty normal dinner and maybe some fruit at night. 
I’ve been recovering for about 3 weeks now and 2 weeks ago extreme hunger really hit me and since then i was just eating everything and anything in sight. All the junk you could imagine. even if i wasn’t necessarily hungry, if i know there is a pack of oreos in the pantry it wont last until tomorrow. i know that extreme hunger is normal and i’ve gone through it a few times now and know what it feels like. my issue is that it just feels more like binging now. like i use “extreme hunger” as an excuse to hust binge. i eat even though im not even really hungry. sometimes i just cant get food out of my head and cant sit still if i haven’t eaten it. i feel really gross about this. 
im scared i’ll develop BED. 
is it normal for “extreme hunger” to last this long even if i haven’t restricted too long. ?considering this was a pretty short denial period compared to when i first developed anorexia, where i restricted for over a year.
or am i just a binge eater?

I also have this internal battle of enjoying undereating but also fearing for my health. It's like the ED part of me wants me to eat less, but my rational side knows it's bad. So it really just prevents me from dieting at all, and I often overeat and feel bad about it.

Also does anyone know how long it takes for your blood levels of stuff to normalise? 



When I was younger, like 14, I struggled with disordered eating until I left home to go study. (The thoughts were still there often, but I never really acted on them.) I was never underweight or diagnosed and feel like I am making this up or at least worse than it is, because most people struggle with eating at some point, right? Essentially, I feel like an impostor. 

Half a year ago or so it slowly crept in again and a few months ago it all came back worse and when I went home for Christmas I could see my weight had dropped to slightly less than my weight at 14 (which is ten years ago). I fucked up the semester and ended up not taking any exams. My thoughts were all over the place. 

I kind of set myself an ultimatum. Either I would go seek help with my issues or I needed to actually work on them on my own. Surprisingly, after figuring out I don't want to afford therapy right now, I still stuck to the ultimatum (probably thanks to telling a number of friends a very watered down version). 

So in the week I had off I took everything very slowly and cleaned my appartment and stuff like that and realised that I really needed to want to get back to normal.

And damn, I thought I was in control and could start eating normally whenever I wanted. But even though I felt (and still feel) like I was not that far gone, I had to learn that that actually wasn't the case. Still, during the last two weeks I slowly reintroduced myself to more food than in the past months and am eating nearly normal now I think? Perhaps? I can't tell anymore. 

My thoughts are so much better and it feels like it actually might be worth it. (On a logical level, I know that it is indeed worth it). But then there is the extra amount of money and time you have to spend on food, preparation and eating. And thoughts questioning whether I deserve this today and so on. And the bloating and cramps. Urgh.

Now I have an upcoming doctor's appointment where she wants to do blood work and get my weight to make sure I can continue on my meds. On the one hand, I really fear she might find out and hope that in the two weeks until then I ate enough fruit stuff for vitamins and so on (does that even show up in blood work?) and for my weight to not drop even further so she does not get suspicious. 

But on the other hand a sick part of me hopes my weight goes down even further so that I am finally underweight. I feel like I can say that my struggle has been real then. Again, logically I know this is stupid because it doesn't matter whether I will be weighing one or two kgs less, the struggle will be the same either way. 

I want to live again. I am on a good way right now. I don't want to let the dark thoughts win.",1675423935.0

I've always struggled with my weight from a young age, been on diets since I was around 8 or 9 years old, which I know a lot of other people with EDs went through as well. I've always been a little overweight for my height, but I was still a fairly healthy weight all throughout high school, which I was able to maintain because of my parents supervision and being an athlete in high school. 

Once I moved to college, things started to get worse for me with my weight and food. It was the first time I was able to eat whatever I wanted with no one to stop me so I gained a lot of weight over the school year, then I would lose it all again when I got home once I was back under my parents supervision again. Even when I lived with my parents, there were times when I would sneak unhealthy foods and eat in secret. Anytime I was unsupervised, I would take the opportunity to eat junk food. I never really was able to get any good habits with eating food because I would always make excuses like 'oh I'll just starve myself for the last month of school and drop all the weight', or 'it's fine I'll start my diet tomorrow'. But living on my own, I haven't been able to get into good habits with self-care or just food in general. 

Now that I live on my own after college, things have taken a turn for the worse. I've gained a lot of weight to the point where now I can't play the sport I used to play in high school, I can barely walk around for longer than 20 minutes and I'm starting to get back pain just from walking. I know that I'm sick, I know I need to lose weight, but I can't get myself into the right mindset to want to get better. It just feels too overwhelming and pointless. My parents are really worried about me and I don't want to go see friends or anything because I'm so ashamed and embarrassed of how I look.

I know the general steps of getting better: start eating healthier and exercise more. But I get discouraged really easily and end up eating junk because it makes me feel better. After eating junk food I feel ashamed and I hate myself, which just makes me want to eat more to get rid of that feeling. 

This isn't a super unique story, I know there are probably more people with similar situations like mine. I want to get better, but it feels so impossible, I just need someone to tell me that there is hope. I've considered therapy but I can't afford it, having just graduated with my master's.

My (20F) best friend (20F) told me about a month ago that she is having trouble eating. I won't go into details here about her difficulties since it's not my place to share. Since we don't live in the same city, it is hard for me to support here and be physically there for her. At the time, I reassured her that I am always happy to talk/listen to her, and after we called I sent her a document I compiled with resources for EDs in her city/university, some self help workbooks, and some insights I found from others who have experienced similar difficulties. She thanked me and told me she'd look into these. 

Fast forward to now, I just saw a video of her where she is now looking worryingly thinner, so I suspect that what she is trying isn't working, or she hasn't sought out help yet. For context, her uni doesn't offer counselling for EDs, and I think she is reluctant to get therapy externally because of the cost. She wouldn't ask her parents for money for therapy since they're the ones who caused many of these body image issues, and would probably congratulate her on looking so thin... It seems that GPs or hospitals won't intervene or offer support unless they consider it to be severe enough. The situation feels so helpless. 

When we called last month, she mentioned that there was someone in her life who would ask if she had eaten, reminded her to eat etc. and that she appreciated it, but now they don't talk anymore. I am scared if I do the same I will come off as nagging or pushy. I don't know how to bring it up with her that I noticed she has lost weight, or if I should bring it up at all.

I know I need to do something. I'm a aged 50's male. I'm overweight. Have type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol. For the last 10 years I have struggled to maintain a regimen of eating healthy and regular exercise. My pattern for the last 10 years has been similar to what I went through overcoming addictions to cigarettes, drugs, and alcohol. I will start exercising, eat healthy food choices, feel good, see progress losing weight, and losing inches. Eventually progress stalls/plateaus, I get frustrated, nothing I try to over come the block works, and then feel like a failure. I then go back to eating whatever I want. 

When I do eat, I do tend to eat way too much, and I do this quite often. After eating I sometimes want more food less than an hour later, in spite of feeling really full. The compulsion is really strong. I do sometimes think it's either because it was ingrained in me during childhood to eat as much as I want, whenever I wanted to. But also, I have felt it's driven by feelings of low self esteem. I did go through numerous traumas as a child. But I wasn't always overweight and unhealthy.

 I was always told that I was ""big for my age"". I was also always encouraged to eat as much as I could. The adults in my life seemed to take delight in watching me eat. I wasn't very athletic or excelled in sports, but also wasn't totally horrible either. I was bigger than most kids my age but my doctors always said my weight was within proportions to my height. I even look back at old pictures and don't see an over weight kid. But I was harassed regularly by other kids and my weight was one of many things chosen as a form of mockery. I think these things did contribute to the additiction problems later in life.

I just want to clarify that I’m quoting my mom directly here, I’m not trying to be offensive, I love her a lot. 

My mom (40’s F) has always struggled with weight. Ever since I (16F) can remember, she’s talked about her issues with it. She’s on the “bigger side” (again, quoting her) and always has been. 

Due to health issues, she’s unable to lose weight via exercise/diets, so for the past year or so, she’s planned surgery. I’m not sure exactly what it is, but it’ll take some weight off. 

I’ve always had body image issues. I can remember being 7-8 years old and hating my stomach, hating how big my thighs were, always sucking in when wearing tight clothes, never wearing shorts or skirts, wearing my dad’s 2XL shirts to hide my body completely. This only got worse as I got older. 

A few years ago, it really escalated. This was further stemmed from a friend who was very open about their ED experience (she would tell me she could see her ribs, she hadn’t eaten in days, she had an account on Twitter dedicated to it, she became visibly skinnier, etc). 

My mom, as much as I love her, doesn’t exactly help this. She’s constantly making comments about how lucky I am, about how someday I’ll gain tons of weight (since it 
‘runs in the family’), how when she loses weight she can wear “skinny people clothes”, she can wear my clothes, how I’ll never understand her struggle, etc. We went out of town to go shopping and she made so many comments about it, it brought the whole mood down. 

I went to a doctor about my issues a couple months ago but nothing has come of it. My mom knows about it but doesn’t think it’s an eating disorder. She thinks every girl my age experiences this, that it’ll pass, that I need to just ignore the thoughts. When I told her, she said something like “I already have enough stress in my life, don’t start not eating.” (This was after I told her I wasn’t eating for days at a time.) 

Now to present day; she told me a few days ago that she had finally booked her surgery. I’m over the moon for her, it’s something she’s wanted for a long time and I know it’s going to make her so much happier. But that night, every bad thought I’ve ever had about food and body image came back and I ended up barely eating. 

I don’t know if it triggered me? If it’s just a touchy subject? I have no idea, but I feel so many different things. Why am I upset when she’s doing something that’s going to make her life easier? Am I jealous? Am I triggered?

No need for details but I'm a pretty normal-looking mid-range plus-sized lady, objectively.

I can't lose weight. Idk if it's the psych meds I'm on, lack of willpower, or what, but restrictive dieting doesn't work because I can't stand being hungry, and ""just make lifestyle changes and exercise and feel good about yourself!"" hasn't worked either because I'm still fat & still hate myself. 

I don't binge. I'm not bulimic. I'm not anorexic. I'm just fat with a deep, awful self-loathing that I can't seem to get rid of. If I had the choice to make all kinds of unhealthy decisions, but they'd make me thin? I'd do it. I'd sell my soul. I'd hand over my life savings. I just don't know how to stop hating myself so much and I hope someone here can point me to the right kind of resources.

some backstory: been struggling with body image issues since the third grade. in seventh grade was the first time i tried to stop eating but eventually failed. i’ve always thought i was fat, in reality i have been, at times, more overweight than i should have been, i know what it feels like to weigh more than the other girls. in my sophomore year of high school my best friend developed anorexia, it was quite traumatizing for the both of us but i saw it worked and i stopped eating. i lost a lot of weight and became textbook eating disorder but once i hit my lowest weight i eventually gained it all back, and i never told anyone. 

during covid i worked a desk job and was at my heaviest. i felt disgusting. i decided to start going to the gym and eating better, i lost a healthy amount of weight and gained muscle mass. but i started school and ran out of time for the gym so i just started eating less. i’ve lost much more weight since then. i don’t know how little or how much i’m eating. i block that out, i think. but i don’t feel like i have an eating disorder. yes i stopped eating so much but now i just don’t have an appetite and don’t care for eating. i won’t eat when i’m hungry quite often because i just don’t feel like eating. but i still eat, often making full meals and having at least one meal a day. i don’t feel anxious when i eat. i don’t feel distressed when i eat. 

but i still take pictures of myself on days where i feel particularly skinny, to relish the moment. i weigh myself often, and still get excited when the number goes down. i often look at photos of me i took when i was at my heaviest with shock. i won’t delete them as i view them as progress pictures. i do avoid food every once and a while. i’m not hungry most of the time and don’t feel like i’m engaging in disordered eating. but at the same time i feel hungry all the time and am always thinking about how i’m going to get through the day running on nothing. consciously i’m not thinking about food but unconsciously i think i might always be thinking about it. i am obsessive over my image, spending hundreds of dollars on skincare, makeup, body care, hair care, clothes and products, and i need to be the best out of all my girlfriends and girls in general.  i need to be perfect, but at the same time i don’t feel like i’m doing anything unhealthy, and technically, i’m at a healthy weight.",1675286665.0

I was wrong. It was low. Alarmingly so. I have health complications so it's a result of that and it's in large part due to food intolerances, nutrient deficiencies, and wasted muscle that I desperately want back. 

Anyway, the dietician took my weight and I was turned away at my request. Then she wrote it on a sticky note, perfectly visible on the front of my printed notes for the doctor, puts me in a room with the intake nurse and says ""and I put her weight right here"" so obviously I look down and see it and it haunts me throughout the entire appointment. The way it affected me was surprising and scary and extra triggering because of the mixture of sick twisted pride I thought would never resurface, mixed with utter fear at the realization that I'm not getting better. At least not physically.

I think about food all the time. There is no other way to satisfy my emotional hunger. Games do not help, friends do not help. Exercise? I try to move as much as I can but I don’t have time for it right now.

I don’t even have that much food at home. At this point I snack on green olives and chocolate sprinkles cause there is literally no other food. 
I have easy access to food delivery so I that is mostly how I overeat + when I’m out I buy pastries.

I’ve been really struggling silently behind the scenes with my body and my relationship to food. I can’t stand being full. I get nauseous at the very thought of food. I can usually only get myself to eat something once every 24-36 hours. I’ve been having dizzy spells and have been struggling to concentrate at work. 

I just really desperately want to lose weight and my brain is telling me to do whatever it takes. 

A couple of my coworkers have said something along the lines of, “wow she is such a good little worker, she doesn’t even take her lunch break!” 

That only weirdly validates me…

Now, I am not officially diagnosed with an ED but some friends in my life have recently pointed out some things in my behaviors that are pointing to disordered eating at the very least. I didn’t even consider it before then. Now I’m doing my research I suppose. 

My anxiety is starting to get the best of me and work is getting harder and harder for me to focus on. My job demands perfection and the workload is overwhelming at times even when you are *not* starving. I just can’t seem to stop. But I don’t want to get fired, and I don’t want to cause a scene by maybe passing out in the office. I cannot eat when I’m stressed out and being at work is currently stressing me out but I need money. Haha the spiral of life.

I guess bc I need someone to cares, I would like to someone give a crap about what happens to me. I talk for about 10 minutes, trying to explain it and how i think i need help, and then i noticed he fell sleep while I was talking. 
I can't go to therapy, I'm unemployed. I really can't count with my family or the few friends I have.
This... I don't know. I want to give up on everything. I don't need advice, I know I need to seek help, but like I've explained, isn't possible, believe me.

In my class, there is this girl who is clearly very anorexic.

She does all of those things VERY obviously and sometimes comments on them (starts listing all of her workouts loudly, or speaks about how 'nobody likes her anyways') and shes literally screaming for attention.

Its triggering me, but at the same time i want to help and dont know how, and its clearly none of my business though. Today i talked to another girl about my ed past, and she said she had an ed too and we spoke about losing our periods. The anorexic girl sometimes just threw words into our conversations (she was working next to us while we talked), and all of a sudden she said ""i havent had mine in 6 years"" and smiled. At that moment i felt a panic attack setting in. I recovered all on my own and told almost no one, and every time i talk about it, i get anxiety and panic attacks.

I have a trauma-informed therapist who I have been working with for four years and who I have made great progress with, but she doesn’t treat eating disorders so I have had to find someone else who does treat eating disorders through my university. So far, it seems this new therapist is not trauma-informed. We stick to CBT only and we never talk about my feelings around food and body image, or the traumas that have contribted to my ED. She told me that people in the first stage of therapy people with EDs are “difficult” and that we can’t talk about my traumas until I change my behaviours. She says this is the only way to do things but I have a feeling that’s not true. I am struggling so hard to meet all the goals she sets for me every week because I am stuck in freeze mode all the time. I try to tell her that but she assumes I just don’t want to get better. My ED is ruling my life so I want and need help but don’t think I can go through with my current ED therapist, even with the amazing support of ny trauma therapist on the side. I had a dietician who was helpful but she gave up on me because I didn’t progress at the rate she thought I should, which triggered fears of abandonment and really dark thoughts. She also didn’t seem to know how to help someone with complex trauma. I know in my heart that what I need are people more compassionate and patient, but sometimes I worry that I am just overreacting.

I have made many posts on this sub and other ed/nutrition subs in the past (I’ve deleted most). Here is one of my recent ed vents https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10jfiaw/i_fucking_hate_my_ed_its_ruining_my_life/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Additional context:

I’ve drastically dropped in weight, and I didn’t worry but feel more and more happy with myself, because the pounds dropping on the scale satisfied me with my success, it made me feel like I was winning and I had control. However, this weight was not only fat but muscle mass as well. I became something called “skinny fat”. And, losing muscle slows down your metabolism, so I’ve had enough of losing weight. 

I still wasn’t happy with myself, even after losing 2 stone and obtaining my dream weight, a weight that I labelled as “perfect” and told myself “I’ll be happy once I get there”. But I wasn’t happy, I wanted to lose more weight. People started noticing my skeletal hands, pale skin and weak-looking figure. My mum told me “you’re skinnier than a model” and “there’s nothing on you, you’re getting so skinny”. I hid the fact that those comments made me feel better about myself. I didn’t want to tell anyone about my ED. But it all became too obvious. It got so bad I couldn’t even eat with friends. I avoided going outside. I refused to eat or I would pick lettuce over pizza. 

After many motivational recovery stories I read online I felt convinced to stop.

My mum brought me to the doctor as I lost my period and look underweight. and they told me I need to eat more carbs and calories. Thanks to this sub, I’ve taken my first steps into recovery. I’ve now started eating carbs guilt-free, less caring about added calories in sauces, and weighing myself less. I’m going to put on weight!

I have depression and anxiety among other things, and 10 years ago I began to completely lose my appetite and be unable to eat whenever I was under extra stress or extreme distress. Once the extra stress was gone, my appetite would return. Then, 5 years ago, after a time of extended and prolonged trauma, in which my appetite vanished, it simply never came back.

My type of depression is anhedonia, meaning I can't feel pleasure, enjoyment or interest in things. I am always bored and empty. I sleep all day. I haven't eaten in the day for years and if I try, I feel sick and it goes right through me within 30 minutes. I resent people who need to eat lunch. It feels so foreign to me. I feel like a robot who never needs food. My stomach never rumbles, gurgles or feels anything. It's like it is switched off and numb, like my ability to feel interest in anything.

When I used to lose my appetite directly from stress, I'd drop lots of weight very quickly (and I was already slim) as I couldn't eat at all and just survived by sipping juice and iced tea, but nowadays, the only reason I'm not underweight is  because I binge eat chocolate, donuts, cookies, and everything sugary and sweet every night about midnight. It's the time I feel less anxious and can just zone out and watch Netflix or something, and stuff myself with sugar.

Looking back, I then realised I've never eaten much during the day, and as a kid, I had issues eating breakfast and also lunch at school, due to anxiety. I could never finish my dinner either, though I could eat chocolate and cakes as my snacks after dinner, as again, at night time I was more relaxed.

# 

i self diagnose with orthorexia, after not being able to go out with friends anymore, losing friends and losing relationships with all of my family, plus not going out to eat with my family anymore and just developing a very elitist view on diet.

I saw a lot of stuff as toxic poison and I started to become a bit unhinged. I never reached out for help with it but I have other things in my life I was in therapy for like depression and anxiety. Plus some schizophrenic stuff. Thought I'd share I guess and wanted to know what you think of orthorexia, I grew up in America and basically saw the commercials of a starving african kid, I thought that it was my fault he was so thin and that the food I ate was causing his country to be very poor or full of slavery.

I still cant really do any of the stuff above but I've isolated myself in my room and not ate for a day and my mom noticed last year then brought me some canned soup, which I ate right away because I haven't not eaten for an entire day since I was a kid. I know that fasting is pretty good for people too but I dont think I was even drinking water. I got really paranoid about tap water and I think that's also orthorexia based, since I thought it wasn't healthy water.

What makes me feel safe is that there is some good food out there, that I would not be directly damaging a whole entire village and children from another area for eating. For example, I used to go pick chicken of the woods nearby my apartment in a kind of woodsy area and I ate that on the stove with some butter. Chicken of the woods is pretty good for you. I don't like the idea of veganism or cannibalism. Diets can and should be balanced.",1674975467.0

I even tried having a romantic relationship with someone that I had probably shouldn't have because I thought maybe doing so (for the first time in my life) could somehow help me out of my predicament. I didn't follow through on that because it seemed a little illogical.

I’ve physically recovered from anorexia, which i had been working towards for a good two years or so.

864,Do I Need Help?,3,10npa1p,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10npa1p/do_i_need_help/,4,"Hello everyone! I have recently joined Reddit in the search for a community just like this one. 

Apologies on the length…I hope someone reads.

I am 23F and I am wondering if I’m am struggling with an ED or if this is just disordered eating.  

I used to be athletic and played all the sports in high school and even some of college, but COVID-19 hit, I had to drop college, and thus dropped my normal rigorous training. I piled on pounds and quick- ballooning up to completely overweight when I was a muscular athletic build before. I had no ‘problematic’ body image issues outside of very normal, non ED behavioral thoughts before the weight gain.

I had held onto that overweight range for the next 2.5 years, seemingly unable to make it budge.

Then my life changed for the worse in the summer of 2022. My 2+ year relationship with my partner started crumbling due to confirmed infidelity. I also switched jobs right around the same time. 

Now, my partner and I have lived together essentially ever since we had met, we have pets together, everything. I decided to give him a chance. He however, had a job opportunity to work out of state, and has been working out of state Mon-Fri for over 6 months now, and has no intention of quitting even though I’ve begged. He is only home on the weekends.

During my time alone, I began struggling with paying all of the bills (as when he moved out of state, he started getting paid in cash and let his bank account close, so all bills were in my name and he also could not even send me money electronically because he only ever had cash). 

My food intake started going down slowly, just needing to save money and spend what little I had on the necessities. My animals always eat first. 

Then, my loneliness manifested into depression and anxiety on top of the stress of this new job. It’s a financial business and pays well, but it’s stressful and demands perfection. I also have to commute 65 miles one direction to even get there- 5 days a week. (saving to move closer to work)

I started having very negative thoughts and emotions towards my body. Every time I ate food I felt guilty- but I couldn’t bring myself to purge it back up. 

I was too busy to start working out, so I downloaded a fasting app to keep track of how often I was eating- trying hard to make a 16 hour fasting window daily. 

I was barely seeing any progress- so did some research and found out about the calorie deficit needed to guarantee weight loss. I began running 5 days a week, never shorter than 3 miles but on average 4-7 miles per day. 

When I first started running, I was extremely hungry. My body was not used to that exercise on that smaller amount of food, so I started eating smaller meals 2x per day instead of one bigger meal.

But the guilt slowly continued to creep in. 
Now I am losing weight at a pretty fast rate- fast enough that people are starting to notice. I’m probably very close to if not within a healthy range for my height now, but I’m not done losing.

All my clothes are baggy, I’m constantly thinking about food but not eating it- and even if I do, only 2 bites goes by before I get queasy. 

I am prescribed anti-depressants, and my boyfriend does not think I have any issues, I just need to , “relax.” Gee- if only I had thought of that?

I just am really in my head now, and have never felt worse about myself. Not a minute goes by where I’m not thinking how stupid I was for eating my last meal- I love feeling empty. 

My focus is decreasing at work and I’m finding it hard to complete tasks and stay on top of things. 

My fasts are stretching to 24 hours+ but usually not too much longer in between, and the meal I choose is always under what I need in a day maybe even closer to under 1/4 of what I need to be more accurate. 

I had to pick up a second job on my nights alone to help with overdue bills, and being alone, I know I should eat, but I don’t. And I’m an adult so no one is watching me and no one is holding me accountable. Also not being underweight makes me slip by pretty easily. 

I can just start seeing this as a very slippery slope that I’m practically already sliding down. Last week, I had a 6 inch subway sandwich, first food in 24 hours. I ate it all, but immediately had to go take a trip to the bathroom. I didn’t even have to use my fingers, my thoughts were plenty. I purged about half of it up before I stopped, my chest tight with anxiety, guilt, anger, and sadness. 

Am I supposed to feel this way? Is this an ED? Is it just a weird ploy to get my partner to care and come home again? I’m not really sure.

I was wondering if any of you lovely people who have had experience with inpatient treatment (or other intensive treatment) have any tips/advice?  As in, was there anything particularly helpful or therapeutic for you (or not helpful, that you wish staff had done differently)?  No pressure to answer this of course, but any insight is appreciated :)",1674902988.0
872,Why does eating feel like a chore,1,10ndi40,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10ndi40/why_does_eating_feel_like_a_chore/,0,"Hi everyone - I’m 26M and I think I have an eating disorder. Basically, the physical act of eating feels like a chore that I need to make constant effort to perform. I could be mildly hungry, but I won’t eat something because I don’t feel like it. 

Growing up, I had asthma and was always underweight, and I wanted to grow up to be big and strong. In my late teens I realized that I both eat too slowly and too less, and have been making conscious effort since to eat more in order to gain weight. The efforts somewhat paid off and for the past two years my BMI is healthy, but I still feel skinny and weak. On top of that, I have some mild anxiety about not being able to finish my food in time / at all when I’m with people. Usually when I go out for food with people, I eat a little, stop eating even though I’m hungry because everyone else is done, and go home on a half hungry stomach. Once home, I rarely eat anything and just go to sleep. 

I’ve recently observed that my 5yo nephew has a similar problem with eating, so could this be something genetic? In general, does anyone else feel like this?",1674907292.0

My best friend since childhood struggles with binge eating disorder. I don’t know how many people in her life know, but I do know that she’s said before I’m one of the only people she feels comfortable talking to about it. (She has regular visits with a therapist- this is more of a “venting to a friend” type situation)

The thing is, I’ve never struggled with an eating disorder. I definitely have self-image issues and have been on some diets I probably shouldn’t have been, but nothing I would classify as an eating disorder. 

My main question is: how do I help? I love that she looks to me for encouragement, but I’m so scared of accidentally saying something that makes her feel worse even if it’s completely unintentional.

She texted me this morning that she binged last night for the first time in weeks and that she just needed someone to talk to about it. It took me nearly 20 minutes of just staring at the message to come up with a response because while I want to help and be someone she can talk to, I have truly no idea what to say. 

I guess my main question is if you were in her position, what would you want/need to hear from a friend offering support and comfort? Any phases or specific wording to avoid? I want her to continue to feel like she has a friend who she can talk to about this stuff but I’m completely lost on how to respond.

A close friend of mine has been struggling with disordered eating for a few years now but denies it, and whenever I feel like she is starting to get better, she seems to relapse again. 

She seems to get a lot of satisfaction from mentioning when she's gone a whole day without eating, and when she's lost weight or dropped clothing sizes. I don't know what to say or do, it's so worrying, and I feel like whenever I have tried to address it in the past it's gone nowhere. It's worse that I have always been the smaller friend despite my huge appetite, and she seems to compare herself to me. 

She makes out she is obsessed with health and tries all these fads like intermittent fasting and substituting meals for coffee/tea and 'health elixirs', but then she talks about how she's deficient in all these nutrients and never has any energy. It's like she intentionally overlooks the fact that her symptoms are because she doesn't eat properly... She also now claims she can't eat all these things because of self-diagnosed digestive issues (which I think she has also given herself by living off black coffee on an empty stomach...) 

I'm worried about her health, and our friendship hasn't been the same since her disordered eating (we often bonded over cooking and eating together, but these days when we hang out, she tries to fill our time with store-hopping or whatever else so we miss meal times and I end up so hangry by the end of it, despite my attempts to ask for a snack or meal break). Recently, one of our friends had a picnic for their birthday and she didn't eat anything because she claimed to have had a big meal beforehand. I don't know if anyone else notices but it's so obvious to me and I feel so helpless.",1674852745.0

In May 2022, it really got bad and since then I’ve restricted to only a few small “snacks” per day i.e., slice of pie at 11am, cup of yogurt at 9pm is pretty typical for me. If I have to eat a dinner for social reasons, I won’t eat all day long and the next day I’ll restrict further to make up for the large amount of food the day before. Anyway now I’m in recovery and I find that I feel like I’m going to vomit after eating. I think it might be because I’m having a larger food intake during the day, like a muffin in the morning, small snacks throughout the day and a proper dinner at night. For so long I haven’t adhered to breakfast, lunch and dinner, so I think it’s important in the recovery process to practice getting used to that again, and it has been a gradual build up to the food intake. But I’m just wondering, does anyone else feel like throwing up after eating? I’m not sure if it’s typical or something I’m doing wrong. And it’s not psychologically rooted, but truly just a physical reaction.

I've never remembered a time where I didn't struggle with food issues. Most of my childhood memories are surrounded by food, and a lot of my family struggles with food issues. I never thought I had any real issue with food, other than not being a healthy eater, until recently, but I've had issues for a long time looking back. I tried to change that lots of times. I'd starve myself. I'd go to practice at 4pm without eating anything beforehand. I thought it would make me skinny, and honestly it probably would have if I wouldn't resort to the same thing every night or every drive home. I'd binge. For a long time I didn't understand that binging was a thing at all, or that other people struggle with it. All I knew it as was eating so much that my stomach would hurt and I'd hate myself. I got good at hiding the wrappers and no one knew what I'd do. I attempt to eat less/nothing around other people, and I always would lie about what I eat. It was too embarrassing. This has gone on all throughout playing college sports. Being a female college athlete, at six feet tall, I'm never expected to be small. I'm meant to be strong, so my binging didn't affect me as much as it might the next person. 

Recently, my coach has been on a kick about people checking in with what they're eating, because we have a couple girls who don't eat enough who've gone to our coach for help. She made us fill out an email to her answering questions about our fitness and eating, and I admitted my unhealthy food issues for the first time in a long time. Practice today comes around and she asked everyone who hadn't eaten before practice to come with her, because it was a morning practice. My roommate told my coach I didn't eat, but she told me not to come. My teammates didn't understand, but I do. I'm the only overweight person on my team (being probably 20 pounds overweight), and the only person over the height of about 5'6"". Some people think fat people don't need to eat. If a fat person was too be struggling to eating issues it's because we're fat, but if a skinny person is struggling it's usually because of something else.

For the ED warrior, 
Whether you’re struggling or not, I think this is a really good read, because if you’re struggling, it may help you to give you a better grasp on what it’s like for family and friends, completely raw. If I would’ve seen this, when I was struggling, things would’ve changed. and even now, while I am so well in to recovery, if I slip up, this is what I think about now, because it’s said perfectly. So it may give you some motivation.



For the Loved ones of someone with an ED,
I think this will be super beneficial for you to read, because this may be very relatable for you, it’s so hard to watch someone you love so much, deal with an ED be completely absorbed in it, and watch them slowly become someone you don’t know. 



The Monster

A monster consumed my sister. It first tempted her, pulling back strands of curled hair to whisper, You aren’t beautiful. But her hazel-green eyes sparkled when she smiled. Freckles lined her fair skin that glowed a rosy pink in the summer. Even when I stood on my tippy toes, she was taller than me, reaching a height of 5’8”.

But the monster told her these features weren’t enough. It preached that although there were some qualities it couldn’t change, parts of her that should be fixed. The monster followed her, creating a darkness shadowing her every move. It hid in the kitchen cabinets, ensuring she didn’t consume anything too high in calories. At first, the monster was lenient. The monster tolerated sugar free items, but it encouraged a clear liquid diet.

What was first a whisper in my sister’s ear turned into a grotesque growl. Three meals turned into one. The monster snarled, Just a few bites. Day after day mom and dad would set the table, and we sat down to a family meal. However, my sister scraped even her favorite spaghetti into the white garbage bag, staining it with streaks of red marinara.

The monster then took my sister’s beauty. It picked out her clothes, telling her the baggy ones looked best. They were the only clothes that were able to keep her frail body warm. The monster reminded her that she didn’t need makeup because her caved in cheeks already looked great. Dark circles emerged under her eyes, dimming the hazel-green sparkle. Soon enough, the monster became more than a shadow.

Time passed, and the monster took her physical health. Heart monitors echoed around the house, sounding her abnormal heart rate. She needed a feeding tube up her nose because she could no longer process food in her damaged body. But the monster roared, You’re so healthy! You don’t need the tube! So, sometimes she ripped it out in a fit of rage. Daily tests became routine, blood rushing through glass tubes to ensure her body was still working. But her major organs were shutting down, and the sound of a flatlining monitor was approaching quickly.

Each day I recognized my sister less and less. It was then my family and I realized it finally had a full grasp on my sister. The monster, named anorexia nervosa, turned my beautiful sister into a sickly stranger. I ask myself why I didn’t see the signs sooner, and why I didn’t know how to help. I wondered why she couldn’t see how beautiful she was to everyone around her, and why she had let this monster consume her. My family decided it was time to get my big sister back, when we sent her to an inpatient eating disorder clinic halfway across the U.S.

This was one of the most difficult things I’ve ever had to encounter. Watching my sister slowly fade away took pieces of me I may never get back. There were some points where I thought I would never get to hear my sister’s laugh again while we watched a corny movie, or have her arms wrapped around me while tears fell down my cheek. I was terrified she wouldn’t get to see her little sister graduate, build a family, and become a fantastic aunt to my children like I know she would be.

After years of treatment, I’m happy to say I’m still getting those hugs, and still get to hear her contagious laugh. She has made immense improvement, regulating health issues anorexia has brought as well as healing the distorted thinking that came with it. She is one of the strongest people I’ve ever met in my life, because as many people know battling a mental illness is not easy. Although I don’t think the monster will ever completely go away, my big sister is out of the shadow, and back in the light. A healed body walks to college courses she has now restarted. Her smile is genuine, not hiding anyone or anything. And, her hazel-green eyes sparkle even brighter now, with a glimmer of hope for herself, and others.",1674831523.0

Taking part would involve an online interview which would last about one hour. This would include questions about the experience of being under the MHA, and what was happening in the lead up to going into hospital. The questions are participant led so there is no need to talk about anything unwanted.

Each participant will receive a £20 voucher as a thank you for their time. Please see link below for further information and contact details.

I think I'm just looking for reassurance/support?

I've had issues with a restrictive ED since I was a teenager, I've been self-recovered for a few years; I don't engage in the more severe disordered behaviours anymore, and I've got a handle on the more subtle ones most of the time. I'm a medically healthy weight, and I generally do my best to work through the negative self esteem stuff, but I would say that's probably the hardest part to shake off. I still have weeks here and there where I'm too ashamed of my appearance to leave the house. It's improved significantly this year, but I'm definitely not perfect.

I had deliberately avoided getting a doctor, dietician, or ED specialised therapist involved in my recoverg because I have some trauma stuff that makes me very afraid of medical/psych professionals, especially regarding ED/body image. But I did go to therapy during the first few years of recovery, just not to a specific ED treatment focused person. And that really helped me handle my thoughts and behaviour patterns, but of course a therapist can't really give nutrition advice, so I've been winging it as best as I can with the research available to me, but there's so much contradictory and questionable info out there.

This year in particular, I've been really wanting to get back into athletic hobbies (running and dance) because they used to bring me a lot of happiness and I really miss them. I know I'll need to give myself enough energy to handle the increase in activity but I feel honestly unequipped to navigate that on my own. So, I've started working with a dietician to get some outside support to make sure I won't burn myself out. She seems really grounded and knowledgeable, she knows about my ED history and is tailoring her approach with me to make sure she's not pushing me back into old habits. I think this is the right decision for me, but oh man am I ever nervous about it.

I'll be getting my first set of meal plans from her tomorrow and I'm really scared. It'll be a relief to have some structure and not have to stress over every decision myself, but I'm super nervous that I'm going to gain loads of weight and that it'll trigger a relapse. I know that she's not going to design a meal plan that would cause that, and I know I'm going to need to eat more if I want to increase my activity levels, but I'm having a lot of trouble shaking off the fear. I'm worried that every option (exercise, don't exercise, eat, don't eat) is going to somehow cause me to gain weight and be unhappy with myself forever.

I have always loved food however this also meant with even a minute feeling of stress I would reach over to the food that is available to me at the earliest or my comfort food which is usually junk. I did not realise how this was impacting me until my weight tremendously increased. The effect is visible on my face, my belly, my arms the most. It was too late by the time I realised and now I genuinely do not know how to stop.

I don't know how to be ok with having rolls when I bend or slouch, or pose myself in a sort of ""shrimp"" position. The sensation of light pressure the rolls give me makes me feel absolutely horrible. I know that the only reason I had basically no rolls before is that because I was severely underweight, but that doesn't stop me from feeling horrendous about having them now. It's more about the bodily sensation than the body image issues, I just can't stand the physical feeling at all.

TW: <!binging, restricting, food aversion!>

I am just now actively learning more about my eating disorder. I binge and restrict fairly regularly, with binging being about 80%-90% of the time. Bulimia is sprinkled in there, but not enough to mention. I’m not good at it 🫠

I want to have a healthy relationship with food. I love it, but I have had some recent trauma in the last year that changed my body. My hormones are already wack, but this has given me a super sensitive stomach.

I’m sure most of it is psychosomatic. But I find most foods absolutely repulsive anymore. It’s been so sudden. I literally had to force myself to eat *pizza* the other day. It’s not consistent, except I’m becoming less and less of a fan of meat. Milk tastes rotten/spoiled to me unless it’s chocolate milk. I’ve always hated mushrooms because “ew fungus,” but now I actively gag when I try to eat it. 

I’ve always wanted to have a broad palate. I never want to be picky. I don’t know why I suddenly have this strong, visceral reaction to so many types of food.

Is this consistent with mixed EDs? Should I see a doctor? I’m going to see an ED/OCD specialized therapist. How have you all balanced the eat-everything-in-sight/I-will-be-sick-thinking-about-it pendulum?? Am I actually progressing?? Am I not doing as well as I thought? 😰",1674671303.0

It might potentially be triggering though.

I’m recovered from anorexia-turned-bulimia (after 10 years) since 2010, then had three kids with various weight fluctuations, nothing major though. After my recovery I managed not to weigh myself at all and eat pretty much intuitively for almost another 10 years. That is until I had a complicated/high risk third pregnancy in 2020. Suddenly regular weigh-ins were required by my doctors and I wasn’t allowed to exercise or get my heart rate up at all. The postpartum period was tough as well. 

I ended up with chronic hypertension, messed up blood fat levels and a pretty high body fat percentage. I’m expressly not asking for advice on these medical issues, just mentioning them for context. The point is: my current doctor advised that I lose weight and I’m really unsure how to go about that.

I’ve tried implementing more veggies in my diet and cutting back on fats and sugars without measuring anything, but the thought alone that I *have to* lose weight now is triggering binges and intense guilt whenever I eat something „unhealthy“. It feels like fighting fire with fire. If I lost weight and lowered my blood pressure, but relapsed into an ED, it wouldn’t exactly help my overall health either.

So my question is: 
Is there a „safe“ way for recovered ED patients to lower their weight?",1674677325.0

I try to starve myself, but my body doesn't let me... do I have an eating disorder? What do I do? I want to feel normal and confident again.",3,10ksp4r,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10ksp4r/i_have_lost_all_self_confidence_due_to_weight/,4,"\[Trigger Warning: anorexia, bulimia, negative views on weight, waist sizes\]

I (20F) am not sure what to do, or say, or feel, but for the past year I've felt trapped by my thoughts about eating. I love food and exploring new restaurants, but I absolutely hate my relationship with eating. It feels like this couldn't possibly be an eating disorder per se, because I still do love food and even if I try to starve myself, I always end up eating.

But, my entire world revolves around eating. And I hate myself when I eat. I try my hardest not to eat that much, but I always end up eating so much to the point where I feel super guilty. There have been a few days where I've tried to starve myself, but at the very last moment my body starts to feel extremely weak and soon enough I find myself scrambling to eat a lot. This is honestly a blow because I really do want to do anything to be skinnier. And when I starve all day and then eat a lot at night, I feel so much defeat. Like I can't even do anything right, no matter how badly I want to be skinny. But eating... my life revolves around it. I feel driven to eat by my love for food, but I then feel EXTREME sadness, guilt, and self hatred. It's gotten to the point where I just feel so trapped and worthless especially after big meals. I don't know what to do. I don't know what's wrong with me.

For background, I was always pretty skinny up until I turned 20. In the past year I've grown noticeably more fat especially in my stomach and arms. I absolutely hate myself when I put on my clothes, especially the jeans that used to fit me just over a year ago. When I see old pictures of myself, I feel nothing but self hatred. But I genuinely do wish I could just make it stop. I know that logically, I need to feed myself and give my body what it needs. I need to be kind to myself. But something about me just can't allow my brain to do that. Every time I see an old picture or video, every time I try on jeans that don't fit me anymore, I just feel so much hate. It's hard for me to feel happy even in social settings because I'm constantly conscious about what my stomach looks like and how it used to be easy for me to wear crop tops and low rise jeans. I used to feel so confident in my smaller clothes, and now I feel on the brink of breakdown every time something doesn't fit me.

I especially feel like I can't talk to my friends about it because I really still am on the skinnier side. I know my friends tell me that my size gain isn't noticeable, but to me it is. It's all I think about. Moving up 4 inches in waist size in less than one year is the most growth my body's ever faced in my life. I know that it's not reflective of how desirable or healthy I am, but it just feels emotionally and mentally painful. And my body just doesn't like it either.

Because of this I've been trying to find answers to my weight gain. High cortisol levels? Bad birth control prescription? Early diabetes? IBS? Stomach problems? Hormonal imbalance? etc. But I'm too scared to actually see a doctor in the case that my waist getting bigger has no explanation and I just let this happen to myself.

Is this an eating disorder? How do I stop these thoughts? How do I get myself to love/appreciate my body, no matter how much I eat? What other ways are there to get skinnier, and why have I not fallen into a more common eating disorder like anorexia or bulimia?

I fasted as much as I could and made sure to hit my steps a day, and if there were days I would eat I tried to keep it under a certain limit of cals. My hair was both long and had a bit of thickness that I didn't notice was slowly getting lower and lower. My mom was mainly the only one who ever commented on it but I never took what she said seriously, until I noticed that my hair was actually falling out. I didn't want to stop though. I kept fasting and doing low res. 
It was around December when I finally had that 'oh shit' moment and decided to up my daily intake in order to try and stop the shedding. I have hypothyroidism and take meds for it, also have a vitamin D deficiency and I have been taking meds for both for a few years now. I also started taking some pills for hair growth (one of those multi-pills that promise stronger thicker hair with lots of vitamins in them) in November, but honestly they might not be working to their full potential because I'm supposed to take them before breakfast and I don't usually eat then. I recently got some blood work done as I suspected I might have anemia, but the results came out great.

I have decided I will try recovery since this hair shedding is making me spiral into a really serious depression. I have been eating somewhat normally for almost a month now and terrifyingly enough, this is the time I feel like my hair is falling the most. I don't understand why and how this is the case since I've been looking out for it a lot more lately.

My most special friend in the world is currently in inpatient at the Priory Group to treat her severe anorexia. She’s struggled for the last 15 years and was hospitalised over the summer in cardiac arrest. She’s only 27. She was making fantastic progress up until being in inpatient. She agreed to go voluntarily as she was told she could leave whenever she wanted, but has since been told she must remain until she reaches a healthy BMI and if she tries to leave she’ll be detained. 

They’ve told her she can’t have visitors at present - not even her parents - because they want to get her settled first. I learned today she can receive mail while she’s at Priory, and I wanted to send her a big card full of nice things while I’m waiting to see her in person. I posted on my instagram story asking my friends, regardless of if they knew her or not, to please leave well wishes and messages of positivity because lord knows she needs it right now, but unfortunately I haven’t had any responses. 

I’m asking any of you here, please could you take 2 minutes to leave well wishes, words of positivity, any kind of happiness for my friend? I won’t include your username, I’ll sign everything off as anonymous. 

Thanks so much in advance, and also sending so so much love in the direction of anyone else who’s fighting this cruel disease <3",1674584809.0

I (17M) have been struggling with anorexia for about 4 years now i would say. Im pretty sure i had some sort of BED growing up and when i was 13 i “decided” to lose weight. It quickly spiraled out of control and in the first two years i would have periods of rapid weightloss (i was borderline obese so it makes sense) but also had bingeing periods. It was probably ednos or some type of bulimia back then (i have never v*mited to purge). During covid it all got worse and i had a pretty severe exercise addiction, i lost weight fast and i was at my lowest point and in those two years attempted to unalive multiple times. 

I kinda lost contact with my old friends but after the first lockdown in my country i made new friends at my school. Both my best friends (18F and 18M) have struggled with disordered eating and one of them currently still does. We dont go to the same school anymore since we graduated last year, but were still close. Due to recent events i have deleted all my ed social media (edtwt and edblr lolol) and today i told my best friend (18m) i was finally ready to try recovery on my own terms. Im a little scared and dont know how long this will last. But most previous (semi) recovery attempts were forced or not serious. Im afraid to let him down but im also tired of this disorder. He was really sweet about it and told me he was proud of me but that makes me more afraid to let him down since the struggle is pretty constant to fight my thoughts. does anyone have any advice? My biggest struggles are lack of control and (or rather feeling out of control without this disorder) and compulsive exercise. Also being afraid of not knowing whats in my food. 

Im just looking for advice ig, and motivation to exercise in a way thats fun instead of calorie focussed. I want to be normal again and not so focussed on this and losing out on memories and experiences for a goal thats not realistic because ill never look like the dudes in pics i stare at and ill never be them to begin with. Im also just really tired of it.  Brainfog makes school hard for me and im a lawstudent so its really not ideal and i need to be able to focus for my assignments.

But then i got into body building. 

i was doing so good. eating a healthy amount of food. gained weight. obviously. thought i hated the weight gain but i stayed consistent because i had goals and i know that’s just a part of bulking. I started to think counting calories was causing me issues, so i stopped counting them. 

after i stopped counting them i became extremely restrictive without realizing.

I’ve been starting to get more confident in myself lately, and trying to put more effort into taking care of myself but after everything I STILL FEEL TOO BIG. But I can’t lose any weight. My body won’t let me. 
For example, I ran 5 miles every day for around three years straight and didn’t lose any weight. I did work out routines and did taekwondo for 6 years and didn’t lose any weight. The only thing that let me lose weight… was whenever my anorexia was in full swing, and I ate MAYBE once a week. And I just don’t know what to do. Even after having my gallbladder removed I didn’t lose anything. Just constantly stuck at a slightly overweight state. My mom always said it’s muscle but I don’t believe that.

I didn't know it at the time, but I have POTS and restricting food can trigger dizzy and fainting episodes so I was very unhealthy at the time. (I wasn't diagnosed with POTS until I was 19ish). Through college, I struggled with extreme exercising despite my chronic illness, along with restricting and binging. In my mid-20s, I seemed to get things under control and had a pretty healthy relationship with food.

Now: I'm 33 and have gained weight over the last few years. I think I might have PCOS because I have other symptoms of it too and have a family history of it. Anyway, since the weight gain, I've started binging again because I'm depressed. I'm married now and don't want to disappoint my wife, which keeps my from restricting. But she goes to bed early and that's when I end up binging. I think about food all the time and the next meal I'll get. Money is tight, but we have enough to have good mostly nutritious meals.

I'm really worried that I'm going to fall into old habits again and that using my wife to hold myself accountable won't be enough. I want to go back to therapy but we don't have insurance at the moment and even with sliding scales will struggle to pay out of pocket (I'm in the US).

Since the day I was born, the only food my family has had in the house is unhealthy. It's cakes, sugars, pizzas, meat (and I'm vegetarian), just all kinds of crackers and snacks. My family isn't well off at all so all the money I make at my part-time job (I'm in high school) goes straight to our bills, I can't buy my own food. My parents buy us fast food every day. I watch TV shows where kids beg their parents for McDonald's and are so overjoyed when their parents buy it for them and I can't believe that's relatable for most kids. 

Everyone in my family is overweight except me.. because of my eating disorder. 

But it wasn't always like that, because up until I was about 11, I was overweight, too. Then I learned more about health and begged my parents to buy healthy food or make actual meals for us instead of just telling us to make microwave pancakes for dinner, or at least regulate what we eat and when, put a limit, anything, but they refused. I decided that I'd rather not eat anything than eat junk. 

As I got older and began to care about my looks more, the reasoning behind my starving turned more onto trying to avoid looking how the rest of my family looks - I do want to be thin. But it's been five or six years of this and I'm out of energy and I've lost my period and I have panic attacks and meltdowns over Cheez-Its and no one knows. I haven't told anyone. 

But I don't want this anymore. I want to be able to eat, because I don't want to die. 

But I don't want to eat unhealthily either, because again, I don't want to die. 

If I ever told my parents, they would just see it as ""oh, she needs to eat more"" and force me to eat their unhealthy snacks. I want to be healthy. I want to live normally. But no one can help me. I'm trapped between death or death and for the next two years, I have no way out. Please help me.",1674422847.0

My eating disorder used to swing back and forth between binge eating phases and extreme restriction phases. My binge eating was very unhealthy but it used to provide a big comfort to me in stressful times. 
Now days I’m attempting to work on things and eat correctly. When I feel stressed or upset, I feel the desire to binge and sometimes I’ll even prepare binge food, but I’ll take a couple bites and then become disgusted with the food. My brain will start telling me, “You already ate 3 meals today. That’s already so much more than I’m comfortable with! Stop right now!”
Often I’ll end up throwing away the binge food. Then I’ll go sit down somewhere. But since I’m still stressed, my brain will eventually start telling me I’m hungry again because it wants the rush from a binge. But that same brain also won’t let me binge any more?? It’s all so confusing.
I know I need to eat, but because I’m eating more, my eating disorder will NOT allow me to eat any more than my meal plan allows. So I’m left without both ED coping mechanisms.
Obviously neither restriction nor binging are good coping skills. I don’t want to engage in either one. I’m autistic and when I feel like I’m gonna have a meltdown, I used to pacify myself with binging. Now I feel repulsed by the idea of binging, which is good in some ways.

How do I get over it?,3,10iiqy2,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10iiqy2/what_happened_almost_a_year_ago_between_me_and_my/,2,"So I'll try to shorten the story as much as possible since it's really long if I get into details (Spoiler: it ended up being extremely long anyway, oops!)

&#x200B;

When I first met my gf she was still with her ex-bf of 4 years, but they had had a lot of issues and were always fighting so she wanted to break up with him but she felt bad thinking he would be sad about it. So she didn't leave him until some time after.

&#x200B;

We started to get along and to meet more often, and eventually we showed attraction for each other and some night, probably drunk, we... did stuff. At that time I was really uncomfortable with my body already but knowing someone was attracted to me kinda helped to get through it.

&#x200B;

Time passed and she eventually broke up with her ex, she had always told me she really liked me and would like to have a relationship but she couldn't because she was still with the guy. At this point I knew she would need time to be alone, to heal from her past, toxic relationship before getting into another one so I did that, gave her time.

&#x200B;

Eventually it was her bday and she made a party where she invited some of her highschool friends, she told me she used to fancy this one girl who was coming but she hadn't seen in a long time, and I thought nothing of it. Little did I know, she (my now gf) ended up getting drunk and making out with the girl she fancied in front of me.

&#x200B;

A week went by and she stopped giving me any attention when we were together and she was even more distant now, she spent the time we were together texting the girl in question and sending her love messages and stuff. She was never very affectionate with me whatsoever.

&#x200B;

After that, I stopped talking to her at all. It made me feel extremely bad. I knew the other girl was hotter than me and prettier than I am and I was so jealous because of course she would rather be with her, I would too.

&#x200B;

Some time after she texted me saying that she didn't know what happened or why we weren't okay (as in our friendship) and I ended up meeting with her. I had got a girlfriend at this point but I really, deep down, loved her so, after more rounds of gin that I can count, I ended up cheating on my gf.

&#x200B;

So to finish this story, I broke up with my ex-gf and started dating her, and they lived happily ever after.

&#x200B;

FALSE, those things that happened still haunt me to the date and I spent last night crying and couldn't sleep at all thinking about it and it has grown a lot of anxiety in me. I also I'm at my worst with my ED right now so I feel really bad overall.

&#x200B;

Well, the reason to this post is she is meeting with the girl she changed me with next Wednesday and I can't shake the thought that she preferred her over me. This is really triggering to me and I refuse to eat anything until everything has passed. How can I get over what happened? Or how can I make it less triggering?

We all really really want to help her but she's struggling so much. And I think I'm making it worse.

S is fragile and emotionally unstable, just in a very bad headspace. My husband and I have been taking on most of the effort in helping her recover. She stays with us most of the time and feels comfortable in our home. She's been making a small amount of progress, but she dips a lot and will relapse constantly. 

But last week I got into a big argument with one of our other friends. She (I'm gonna call her D) says that I'm hurting S just by being around her and I need to let more of the group be involved in her recovery.  

I've always been a very thin girl and many times throughout my life I've been told I look like I have an eating disorder. It's not something I've ever personally dealt with though. On a few occasions, S has said she wants to look like me. I always tell her I would rather her look like herself.

So D and I got into this fight, and when I told my husband, he actually agreed. I asked S and she said I'm not a problem, but I'm not sure I can trust her judgment about this.

I really really need advice. Am I actually making her fail her recovery? Do I need to take myself out of the picture? I just want what's best for her and getting better. ",1674370887.0

I realized being vegan, for me, was a little restrictive as I have some texture aversions and don’t like a lot of things (still veg), so a lot of times I wouldn’t eat at events or nights out. I definitely noticed a bit of disordered eating going on. It wasn’t normal, I looove food. I love eating!

Pretty often, probably like once a week or every two weeks this past year, I would throw up from being so hungry. Or, even if I wasn’t starving, just knowing that I’d have to go to a restaurant and eat something, even just imagining the smell or smelling it, made me sick and I’d have to go throw up in the bathroom mid-meal.

I’ve been absolutely wonderful the last probably 2-3 months and have been eating healthy, good amounts and didn’t feel sick or weird once. Never even thought about it. It’s been great.

Now, I’ve been really depressed for the entirety of the last week, and haven’t been eating. It got to a point where I was so hungry I threw up bile 2 days ago. I was sad again yesterday and only ate a few veggie sausages to start my day, and then was SO hungry later, and after I got and ate a few fries, I had to run to the bathroom to throw up.

Is there a label to out on this or? I’ve had an extremely sensitive, queasy stomach since I had COVID, so maybe that’s it. I don’t know.

985,I found out my friend has an eating disorder and don't know what to do,3,10her3g,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10her3g/i_found_out_my_friend_has_an_eating_disorder_and/,6,"I really need advice. I (16f) have a close friend (15f). We were best friends for several years, but covid just sort of distanced us. We still see each other and talk occasionally, but not on the level we did before. A few days ago, I was on twitter when I saw two old tweets I had bookmarked last year. They were both from the same account, one was about something that had happened at my school last year, and the other was complaining about the weather in my state. I thought it was odd that the person lives in my state and had the same thing happen to them at their school. I figured we probably went to the same school, and when I clicked on the account I realized it was an eating disorder twitter account. I didn't recognize the girls name, and when I asked a few friends, neither did they, and I forgot all about it. 

Until a few days ago when I found the tweets again and went back on the account, and noticed the way she tweeted was very similar to the way my 15f friend types. But the account had her age on the account and said she was 16 in her bio, so I figured it was just coincidence. But then I scrolled down and saw tweets from a few days before, where she thanked everyone for all the birthday wishes, and that's when i remembered my friend had just turned 16. As soon as I realized they had the same birthday, I just knew it was her and my heart dropped. 

Right now I don't know what to do. I don't want to confront her, because I'm worried she might try to hurt herself out of panic. Should I tell my mom so she can tell her mom? I don't really want her knowing I'm the one who told, but idk I'd rather her be mad at me then be dead or anorexic. I struggled with an eating disorder in the past and know I would have felt better with someone knowing, but I would have completely freaked out if someone found out on their own. I just feel really bad and want to tell someone. I'm also worried how her parents will react, cause when she got diagnosed with anxiety and depression they just brushed it off and said it wasn't ""real"".",1674263216.0
986,How can i help with my friends ED,5,10h8ev2,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10h8ev2/how_can_i_help_with_my_friends_ed/,2,"I (14F) and my Best friend (14F) met eachother a few months ago. We get along really well and I love her so much but recently i found out that she has anorexia. 

Some time ago i installed Tumblr and asked her if she could give me her username. I'm pretty sure she Hestitated for some time but still gave me her username. When I saw her posts i literally froze. 

The whole account was about her anorexia, pictures of her body (She has visible bones everywhere) and starvation diet.

Some time ago she did told me she had anorexia but i was sure it was all in the past. So i started asking her about it and everytime she posted something I couldn't have a normal conversation with her without saying something about her ED. 

I started wondering if maybe i should message her parents about it (From what i know she has a good relationship with them and they had to deal with her ED before) but i was scared she might get upset about it, so i told her I'm considering talking to her parents. 

She was a bit upset and told me about her ex friend who actually told her parents about her ED and that when she found out about it she started to dislike that person. 

I really don't want to lose her but I just can't stop worrying about it. 

So what should i do? I heard that telling her parents is a good option only if it's really bad with her but when is it,, really bad""?

Looking for some advice on a how to help my sister who struggles with anorexia and bulimia. This has been an ongoing issue since her teenage years, she’s now in her late 30’s and has been in and out of recovery over the last years. With the biggest scare being about 8 years ago when her blood levels became so out of wack she almost succumbed to her eating disorders. Over the last year I have noticed some things that have made me question where she is currently at in her recovery process but know how tender the subject is and have never pressed the issue. 
Then comes tonight when her 16 year old daughter, my niece, comes to my mom and I in desperation for help for her and her mom. She’s beyond worried about her mother whom she states is barely eating and when she does is vomiting. Talking about no food in the house (she herself looked quite gaunt tonight and was asking for food… que the pizza lol), and how her mom has overall been acting off lately and treating her differently as well. 
Looking for any advice on how to handle this situation and how to get my sister the help she needs. Us as a family would do anything to help her but don’t know where to start and the last thing we want to do is push her away or make her angry with her daughter for coming to us. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
From our house to yours, much love!",1674283963.0

Needing to track what i eat, needing to eat at specific times, limiting certain foods, etc. I want to do this as a way to better myself, but im scared it will make me worse.

My parents and siblings are all huge athletes, so unhealthy behaviors around food were just… normal to me growing up. I started counting calories before I was even in middle school. So, by my freshmen year of high school, I had full blown anorexia. I’m sure my parents were pleased that I had finally started to be more like them, so I never really got the professional help I probably needed. Anyways, I drug myself out of the abyss of anorexia last year, but I had a pretty awful recent relapse. I’m doing better now and working hard towards recovery, but lunch is still just a hard meal for me. (I hate eating in front of people) So, I try to take baby steps and don’t force myself to eat lunch, even someday soon I’ll hopefully be able to. The very close friends I sit with at lunchtime know the gist of my situation and don’t push it, but most of my other friends didn’t notice my Ed when it was bad and so I never told them. If anyone questioned me, I would try to play things off by saying I had bad migraines (yeah, sucky excuse, I know) and surprisingly people bought it. Like I said, I know I should be eating lunch, (as should you, food is fuel!!) but it’s just too much right now, so I just use the time as a study hall. My friend whom I’ll call B was in the bathroom near my lunch table and when she came out she saw me and sat down to say hi. She noticed I wasn’t eating, and I made up some dumb excuse about having Chem homework, and no time in the morning to pack lunch. She told me I looked “dead” and needed to eat. I don’t remember exactly what I said, I just wanted her to leave. Which she did. So, the next day she comes up to me in class and tells me she brought me lunch and gives me the whole speech about “you deserve food” iykyk. Now, I know people like that have good intentions. B is just trying to look out for me. I know that. But the remaining eating disorder voice in my head is screaming at her. I don’t need to be fed like a child. I’m capable of taking care of myself. I just can’t stop myself from being annoyed, even though it’s such a kind gesture. Today I managed to get her off my back by telling her I had actually brought my own lunch (a lie) but I know she’ll just be back at it again Monday. What do I do? She’s going to report me if I tell her anything, and even though she has good intentions, I just don’t want that at all. Please help.",1674278623.0

I will not mention any numbers but I am curious if anyone has a similar experience. I have found each time I've relapsed I usually gain a bit of weight and then it tapers off over the following months. I shouldn't be surprised I guess that after almost a year of health problems that triggered a nearly year-long relapse is causing a similar effect. I am now at a weight I haven't been in 3 years since I was in the first two years of recovery and allowed myself to be overweight...this is a very scary thing for me and I'm trying to remain calm and not act drastically but I'm finding myself very triggered. I have a different mindset on recovery and my body after 5 years of recovery with various blips, i truly feel like i have learned...but you never know, ya know? I am tempted to ask my doctor to do some testing on me as I am concerned with the shear amount of weight in such a short amount of time with literally all that was done was just stop restricting, meaning i eat like a normal person (I have autoimmune gut disorders so not that normal but eat enough and can't eat inflammatory foods). The second qaundry is is there safe weight loss after recovery? I feel like most times I've gone at it like that I've ended up falling into old habits but now I am overweight (which you know obviously isn't the worst thing and i can still be healthy) and some of my abilities are obstructed. 

Lemme know,

much love.",1674245869.0
