1. Music in my head. All the time, non-stop. Sometimes it’s a real song, sometimes it’s a song I made up in my head. Sometimes it’s a song I like, sometimes it’s super annoying (even my own songs). 

2. Intrusive thoughts. Could be anything from violent and disturbing images to something super benign. I have a bag of Mamma Chia brand chia seeds, every time I see I think “mamma chia, mamma chia figaro.”

3. Obsessive thinking. I’ll become interested in a subject to the point where I can’t stop thinking about it. I’ll try to focus on something else, but I creeps back in and I wind up reading the same Wikipedia article 100 times instead of doing what I’m supposed to be doing.

14,Am I in an abusive relationship?,21,11xlsnl,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11xlsnl/am_i_in_an_abusive_relationship/,42,"I have been with my partner for a little over 9 years now. We have had our ups and downs. I've done things in the relationship during manic episodes that I am not proud of. I've sought sexual relationships (mainly sexting) with others, been emotionally abusive, and quite manipulative. This was primarily during times before I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 and on a solid medication/therapy regiment. Now, I feel like I am the partner they need.

Howerve, and here's the rub, I have a sinking suspicion she is not the partner I need. She isn't supportive anymore and is somewhat condescending. She is constantly reminding me of all the past pain I have caused, and when I bring up that it was in the past she just says that I am not taking responsibility for that pain. Recently, she has gone so far as to comment on my appearance, calling my beard pubes and asking me to shave so she can find me attractive again. She brags to others that she got me to shave and belittles me in front of friends. She fights with me anytime I bring up a change that I wish to see in the relationship. She has commented on my weight. SHe has commented on my ability to be a father. She has accused me of having inappropriate emotional relationships with friends. 

I am honestly not sure if deserve this. I did emotionally cheat on her. I have verbally accosted her. I have been mean, aggressive, and manipulative in my own. These actions are mainly when I am manic and being confronted. I become incredibly defensive, to the point that I will be this way.

I know the relationship sick and that we need to speak with a couples counselor, but I am afraid that my partner will just listen and not change. Now, she used to be quite supportive. She took me in when I had no place to go after coming back from Afghanistan. She dealt with my PTSD. She has loved me through so much.

However, lately my mood has been faltering due to how lonely I am. It’s a type of loneliness I’ve never felt before; it’s so bad it physically hurts. I can’t find the words to explain the intensity of it. It hurts so bad. 

I can genuinely say I have only one friend, and she lives halfway across the world. I live with my parents while I attend college. I have to take online classes so the only time I really leave my house is to go to a coffeeshop a couple days a week. I don’t have a driver’s license due to crippling anxiety (I’m working on getting it), so even if I did have friends, I wouldn’t be able to see them often. So I have no one. No one to talk to besides my parents, and that’s just mostly superficial stuff.

Which is extremely common with BPD and bipolar. But. Now I’m struggling. I feel relieved but horrified. Not to say that bipolar is better than BPD or less bad, but it’s just distressing to have a label stripped and replaced with another. If I’m being honest, I’ve doubted my bipolar diagnosis for a long time now, but somehow I feel like I’m betraying my sense of community and self by feeling hopeful. It’s like? Idk I guess it was easier to say it’s just
Bipolar because it became a cop out.It was easier to dismiss my explosive emotions and constant mood swings as just being bipolar symptoms. Because it meant that I could treat it with meds. And I tried so hard to act like the mood stabilizers help, but They don’t. I cycle through so many extremes on a daily basis. At my old psych all of this was dismissed and treated with anti psychotics that just make me feel sluggish and disinterested. It feels liberating to be listened to for once, but I feel so? Lost. Like I’ve just been stripped of the “identity” I’ve been cultivating for years. It’s weird. It feels like I owe everyone an update.

I'm in a job that often triggers me for various reasons. I've been in a almost constant depressive episode for the past almost two months. The exception is some hours of natural ease/happiness from spending time with a few nonjudgmental friends throughout that time. My work performance has tanked and it's becoming an issue. I have coworkers talking to my boss about it, and I don't blame them, but my boss is trying to be nice about it to a degree that makes me worry that I'm taking his reputation.

I will be doing an out-patient treatment program in the next few weeks. I am already on intermittent FMLA, but the current plan (which i do not like much) is to do part-time work in the afternoons at my current job while i do the program in the mornings.

I just had an anxiety attack after getting a phonecall from my boss to talk about it. I feel like the end is near, but my boss and a few coworkers are still trying to be on my side and I see that. However, i need to leave sooner or later. I used references to get this job (I've been in it for just under a year) that were absolutely glowing from people I respect. Quitting is embarrassing for me and I wonder how much it will reflect on them. I don't feel comfortable using them as references any more. I have a long job history on my resume, with a new job about every three years. But i think it will look weird if i don't use anyone from those jobs as references.

My main question is:
Assuming I don't have references, how do I find a job? 

I'm 30, I live alone because I have a hard time with roommates. I know i can be ""the problem,"" but I always try to resolve any conflict and the older I've gotten the better I've gotten, but I also am in a difficult place emotionally and am having a hard time focusing and functioning. I feel like I'm at the edge and yet there's a light at the end of the tunnel of treatment if i can just figure out how to do this job a little bit longer and find something else that can help me keep my home and continue my medications and therapy.

Feels like a tall order.

TL;DR: Assuming I don't have references, how do I find a job as someone in their 30s?",1679438395.0

38,I think I was misdiagnosed,2,11xxjja,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11xxjja/i_think_i_was_misdiagnosed/,5,"Okay, so 2 years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, and at the time I was like, ""this doesn't sound right, but I guess I'll go with it."" I was put on lamotrigene after a 20 minute appointment with my psychiatrist where, with some vague descriptions of what my highs and lows were, he decided it was a solid diagnosis. But the thing is, he never asked for specifics about what they were like, just generally if I experienced them.

The highs of my 'mania' would last about 1-3 months at a time, and usually consisted of me being very active and upbeat, but I never exactly had any risky behaviors associated with it. I've never had periods of hypersexuality, or completely upended my life on a whim or anything extreme like that. I can get irritable, and my impulse control has never been great, but I've never felt like my thoughts were racing or anything like that. 

Probably the most 'extreme' thing I've ever done was to move to a different state after a 5 year relationship that I felt trapped in ended. I just needed a fresh start from it and I got that before moving back home with a better perspective (albeit in the middle of a depressive episode).

In fact, the only really concerning thing I ever had going on were intense periods of depression (also lasting between 1 and 3 months at a time). I would have a hard time getting myself motivated to do basic tasks and my interest in things I enjoyed waned during those times to pretty much nothing. 

Being put on meds, I was just coming out of a long funk and, after starting lamotrigene, it never really felt like that funk ended. I still have problems motivating myself to do basic things, even 2 years in, and I constantly feel like I'm lagging and forcing myself to do everything and I hate it. During my up periods I used to actually workout and be active and would write and take my son to the park and be an active and eager participant in family activities. But since being medicated I don't have any of that. I'm gaining weight and have zero motivation to do anything about it despite being miserable because of it, being an active parent feels like a chore, and I can't write to save my life. 

I feel like I'm a totally different person, and I don't want to be this way anymore. I think I might have been misdiagnosed, but idk how to broach this with my psychiatrist (I feel like he barely listens to me). If anything my symptoms are much closer to that of ADHD or MDD just applying my lived experiences to them, but when I tried to bring up ADHD he kind of handwaved it away saying that adult ADHD was difficult to diagnose and left it there. 

I'm not sure how to bring this up with him and was hoping some people here might be able to give me some tips on how to do that? Should I get a 2nd opinion from another psychiatrist? I just want to stop feeling this way.",1679438530.0

But in all this time I never once realized that my hypomanic episodes from before ended after I stopped taking lexapro.

43,I Think My BP Is Getting Worse,6,11xmtyz,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11xmtyz/i_think_my_bp_is_getting_worse/,1,"Hi... I really need a space to express myself right now. I have had a BP diagnosis for just over 8 years. I was diagnosed at 18, and I stayed medicated until I was 22. However, when I was 22 I ended up homeless due to a conflict with my mother. I was having trouble getting my medication at the time, so I eventually talked to my doctor about weaning myself off my medication. He agreed that I was handling my symptoms very well, and that we could give it a shot. All was very well for the next unmedicated 3.5 years.

However, just this year, I've been going through some noticeable changes. Starting about 6 months ago, I settled into hypomania and dealt with it rather well. However, that hypomania, for the first time ever, developed into mania. I am currently enjoying the worst depressive episode I have ever had in my life - but I'm thinking it's a mixed episode because I am also irritable and experiencing impulse control issues. 

I've heard that bipolar can become more intense as you age, but I really didn't see this coming. I thought I was one of ""the lucky ones"" whose symptoms weren't severe enough to necessitate treatment and that I could use all the tools I learned in my many years of inpatient and outpatient therapy to stay on track. I do have an intake appointment for a local psychiatric care group lined up, but, for the first time, my symptoms are so bad that I'm having trouble working and doing day-to-day tasks. I have also noticed a lapse in memory, which really scares me. I can't bear to be around people because I don't want them to see me like this. And I'm scared I'll lash out at them before I can think twice.

First, I'm French, so sorry if my english is not perfect perfect. 

I'm 24 years old, living in Paris and apparently bipolar type 1 with intense psychotic features. 

My life was almost totally hell for several years, after my diagnosis. 

The doctors didn't correctly adjust my medication, and I already have undergo more than 2 very big  crisis. Since we have discovered that I needed neuroleptic, my life has changed for the best. 

Despite my age, I'm still in an undergraduate program at university.  In fact, my disease has caused many issues during my school and university years. I would love to become a ""documentarian"" (somebody who work in the field of documentation, information...). I want to have my first job, in the public domain, in less than two or three years. 

I have a boyfriend since 5 years, and I would love to build a life with him. He's already working since several years, so I'm eager to work, so we can ""advance"".

I would like to have a family, one or two children, and a house, in a place that we would love. 

BUT I have to be realistic. Since my diagnosis, I had more than 2 very big crisis, and many littles ones. 

I have decided since two years to perfectly take my traitement. So my life is better now. But in 2022, I had a hypomaniac and next mixte episode, which cause many problems in my study program. I'm in the obligation to do one year in two years, because I have too much delay. 

To be precise, my doctor and I had change Zyprexa to Abilify. The Abilify was at 15mg, the lithium that I take too was too low....So there was a crisis. Now, I'm hoping that the augmentation of lithium and Abilify will be relevant and protective for the years to come. 

Moreover, I decided to establish a more protective routine. I began yoga, stopped alcool...

But I really need to be stable in the years to come in order to succeed in my academics, and in my life in general.

Do you think it is possible ? Are my dreams impossible ? Do you think my stabilization in the long run is possible ? 

I precise that recently, a doctor said me that with this treatment, it wasn't impossible to be stabilized for me, but I don't know if I can believe him.",1679412037.0

Well it's official, my guess was correct, i know this because i've been crying for no reason and I was like oh im just dramatic, then i started getting very irritable, then paranoid, and now I feel coked up. I hate it here idk what triggered it. 

Is it possible that realllly good news could have triggered it? Cause over springbreak I got the best news that the person who sexually assaulted me got suspended from the school. And I had like this burst of euphoria because I was so happy, I stayed up for two days because I had so much energy, but other than that I don't think I had any other symptoms. Last week tuesday is when the random crying episodes began. My ex has been trying to take care of me because I would just ball for no reason and I was trying to figure out why, like i couldnt be alone or else i would start crying from anxiety and then on sunday I was so depressed I was staring off into space and wouldnt move or talk so my ex had to help me out of bed.

Yesterday I had sugar and was like hm this is a suspisuous amount of energy. Then today after I got a good critique from my proffesor I got filled with energy, then I ate food and drank water and now I have even more because when Im manic and I eat or drink water it makes the mania worse. But like seriously could good news have caused this? 

Over break I was also pretty inconsistant with meds but I was still taking them. Like I think I missed one night dose (Which I've done before and I've felt compleltly fine. I take 300mg total 200mg morning 100mg at night of lamictal, I was preparing for a depressive episode if i lost but now i'm having a mixed episode for the first time in a year which i was really happy about my winning streak against that and I havent been manic since like novemeber. 

Anyways from the way I'm typing im like 100% sure that I am and it's just been getting worse throughout the day. I need to take some hydroxizine that typically takes me down from the euphoria. Like I feel great but I hate feeling this happy and peppy and literally nausious from energy it's 3pm and I've eaten like four fried mozzarella sticks and that made me so stuffed.

1.) I am not going to cheat, I am able to reason enough to know I won’t, but that doesn’t mean the thought isn’t there

3.) Just because you personally have never experienced this feeling, does not mean it’s not a thing. Everyone’s experience with mental illness is different. I am aware that mania is not an excuse to cheat, when not manic I have no desire to seek attention or sex elsewhere

This isn't meant to be  a testimonial exactly, I'd be happy to have that someday, but for now I want to see if this is relatable to folks here. I've been diagnosed with BPD2 and am a self identifies sex addict (and video games but let's stop that list here:⁠-⁠P) [btw I have joined the SA 12-step program and sought other outlets, which are all well and good, I'm just seeking validation]

 I've been on Lamictal and Wellbutrin for a couple years now and they've been a part of my daily routine through some seriously hard times, some could argue I wouldn't be here today without them as part of my treatment. Another consistent factor is my primary coping mechanism..., since I was like 13 I've had a daily routine, a nightly ritual if you will, of masturbation and more often than not, some form of pornography. 

It dawned on me that I might be dependent on this behavior as it's a function that I literally have a handle of and gives me the otherwise nonexistent sense of predictability/reliability in my neurochemistry. Nothing beats the surge of endorphins to detach from my woes at the end of the day, followed by the subsequent oh-so-sweet fatigue and ability to sleep.

Now I don't have the capacity to get into the weeds here yet, but it's causing me issues even in a peak state of stability in my life. I want to know if other neurodivergents are experiencing similar sexual habits and their perspective, both on themselves (yourselves) and on the behavior. I'm oversleeping after late nights on screen, struggling to find peace in my love life, and craving the same power & control I feel when I get my porn and orgasm. 

I have had periods of time where I stayed limited: turning of screens before bed, being open with partners about my porn usage. What I notice still is I crave the release, my body demands it or will refuse to sleep. I'm always half a thought away from overspending on sex toys or obsessively looking for ways to have sex.

I find myself over sexualizing things and ending up at a point of...well guess I'll just masturbate and coast on that feeling. Procrast-urbation is also a like a key figure in my life's behavioral history; I've masturbated and crashed out to fill the time, then woken up the moment (or long after) something was due or I need to be somewhere or do something.

TL;DR

Not to even mention the ""natural"" supplements I tried out of pure desperation. IT DOESN'T FUCKING WORK.

The only combination that ""worked"" for me was the olanzapine/fluoxetine combo with Lamictal as a mood stabilizer. That combination bought me a month of euthymia, A FUCKING MONTH before it started to go to shit again. My mood started to decline for NO FUCKING REASON. My life was going perfectly, BUT FOR SOME FUCKING REASON MY MOOD STARTED TO DECLINE. I decided to go off Lamictal because of the brain fog, and because it wasn't helping at that point. Eventually, I went off of olanzapine because of the fatigue. Replaced it with quetiapine but that didn't do shit.

I’m always questioning my diagnosis because I feel like my mania isn’t even half as bad as some things I read. Or not even close to what is portrayed on tv shows or movies. Recently it’s been getting worse, as I’ve had strong urges to do really risky stuff. For example, I had such an urge to climb up the stairs and stand and lean over the railing where a kid jumped off. And I was gonna do it to get rid of the feeling, but then I was scared that I would continue to lean and lean until I got the urge to jump off. Same thing happened when I crossed a bridge except I did end up leaning into it. But before this episode, my mania was only feeling really confident, or believing I had superpowers, or paranoia that everyone was looking at me, and my irritation was really bad.

But anyway. I have been in a very low place lately, I was doing great for a while, was relatively stable, the closest I have been to ""normal"" in a long time. However I had a pretty bad episode a couple of weeks ago and hurt myself and did some stupid stuff. Anyway, now I am waiting to be admitted into a PHP but there is a 4 week waiting list so I am just kinda floating by as I wait. I am a stay at home Dad (I am on disability), and I feel so awful because I just kinda sit here while my 1 and a half year old runs around and I put on Ms. Rachel (if you are a parent you may know who that is) and just let him do his own thing. I love my son with every ounce of my being, he is my whole world. He and my wife keep me going, keep me alive. But I just feel like I am so inadequate as a dad. I barely have the motivation or energy to fully interact with him and be the father I really want to be. Don't get me wrong I don't neglect him, I make sure he's healthy and safe, I keep my eyes on him and when he acknowledges me I give him hugs and snuggles and kisses and  he just fills my heart with joy. But I feel like I could be doing so much more to better his life, I should be sitting with him and teaching him how to speak, teaching him right from wrong, but instead I sit here on my computer listening to music and watch him run around and play with his toys because its the only thing that keeps me level and the only thing I have the mental capacity to do to get through the day before my wife gets home from work. I have no regrets being a parent even with this disorder, I just hate myself for not being more involved in his development. I know he loves me, he always runs up to me saying Dada Dada and smiles and laughs and is such a happy little dude, I just hope this program I am going to be doing will help me figure out how to regulate my emotions better so I can be more interactive and give him the best childhood he can possibly have. I want to build forts with him and run around outside and use our imaginations and go on pretend adventures. I just wish I could have the mental power to do these things and feel like a better father. And with my wife I feel like I am always dragging drama into her life. She constantly has to worry about me, hide all the knives in the house, she has to remind me how to be a human, make me shower, remind me to eat, remind me to take my meds, remind me to do things around the house etc. she is incredible and such a trooper and my savior but she deserves so much better.

I’ve recently gotten my diagnosis and the psychiatrist believed that the last hypomanic episode seemed like it was bordering mania and I’ve yet to disclose some of the following to her yet out of fear. 

When I was depressed about 19/20 years old I experienced some odd things that I brushed off for years believing I was “just depressed” and it was normal for depression. I felt consumed by this dark cloud entity in which I believed was the soul of Hitler haunting me. I believed he was going to possess me and take over or that he saw the same darkness within me and wanted to rule through me. I also heard my name once when no one was around and dark male voice rambling words I could not decipher. He was speaking but I couldn’t understand words only the noise of the voice. 

Then in 2021/2022 I experienced an episode that now we think was mania and not hypomania. I’d had a spiritual awakening and believed I had ascended to a new dimension, I would preach spirituality whilst simultaneously gatekeeping what I thought was the ultimate knowledge. I would try to link everything philosophically. I’d felt I tapped into the powers of my ancestors and was magical and was better than everyone else. I was seeing shadow people, feeling entities again, experiencing paranormal activity. I believed in so many wild theories about the universe and that I was getting messages through animals, angel numbers etc. of course the mania continued with thousands of dollars spent on rocks, completely changing my house decor, wardrobe etc to match. Using divination, tarot, witchcraft etc. 

The 2021/2022 time confuses me because spirituality became a trend and more widely accepted but my experiences still feel really “off”.

122,Yesterday was the one-year anniversary of my last suicide attempt.,7,11wq970,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11wq970/yesterday_was_the_oneyear_anniversary_of_my_last/,2,"TL;DR: I'm in a much better place and decided to make it a day of celebration instead of a sad anniversary.

Here's a lengthy post I wrote on my socials in regard to my attempt up to now and other sentiments.


Today is the one-year anniversary of my last suicide attempt. 

It was traumatic enough the first time but nothing compared to the second time. I had a quicker and easier recovery after the first attempt, but I was completely broken on this day last year. But I’m happy to report that since that day I am (mostly) whole again. I say mostly because there are still things I’m working on and I still deal with symptoms of PTSD from it and there are things I’m still heartbroken about, but I’m still here and continuing to improve.

I’ve made a lot of strides and changes since then. One of the biggest and most important changes I made was choosing to leave my psychiatrist and therapist, both of whom I had been seeing for 10 years. It wasn’t an easy decision, and in some ways, it was just as frightening as the state of mind I had been in. Up to that point, they were the only mental health professionals I had ever worked with aside from one counselor I briefly saw at the college I attended. It was hard enough to find doctors I was comfortable with the first time and to find someone else after 10 years felt like leaving a part of myself behind. Obviously, their treatment wasn’t working for me any longer and in fact, was only worsening the condition I was in so the change was imperative. 

It is easily one of the best decisions I have ever made and I would make that decision again a trillion times over. The psychiatrist and therapists I have now are phenomenal, I couldn’t be happier to have them, and I am eternally grateful to have them. All three of them were recommended to me by the wonderful therapist I had during my IOP, who I am also eternally grateful to have had. If you feel your doctors aren’t helping don’t wait to find ones that will.

When I posted about my hospitalization and IOP last year I mentioned how my fellow patients and group members were just as instrumental in my recovery as my mental health care professionals and my family/friends, and that is still true now. I have been in a DBT group since last June and each group member (past and present) has helped me heal as much as anyone, whether they’re aware of it or not (of course I try to tell them that). By the way, DBT is awesome and there are so many aspects of it that everyone could benefit from, mentally ill or not.

Over the past year, I’ve strengthened parts of me that needed work. I changed things and reframed ways of thinking that were detrimental. I discovered new parts of myself. I broke down the walls I had built. I strengthened the parts of me that needed work. I’ve established boundaries and have stuck to them. I’ve opened up more. I now allow myself to feel my emotions instead of fighting them or bottling them up. I have stopped putting myself last. Most importantly, I have found myself again.

Of course, I didn’t do any of this alone. I’ve been lucky enough to have a ton of support. I have great bosses and a work family that supported me from when my struggles started, when I was going through recovery, my time away from work, who welcomed me back with open arms when I returned to work, and who still support me daily. I already mentioned the support from my fellow patients and group members who I will never forget. The health professionals both when I was inpatient and during my IOP. My amazing therapists and psychiatrist. My friends who I’d die for whether I see them frequently or not. I’ve been blessed with wonderful family members, wonderful in-laws, my brothers who I love, amazing parents, and of course an angel of a wife. I owe them everything, and I owe them everything. I also owe myself for allowing them to help me and for working my ass off to heal and improve.

If you’re still here after the struggles you’ve endured, you owe yourself too.

Instead of letting this be a sad anniversary I’ve decided to look at it positively and celebrate it. I will celebrate the small wins as much as the big wins. I will celebrate the positive changes and progress I’ve made. Instead of mourning what I left behind and who I was, I will celebrate what I’ve gained and who I’ve become. Instead of mourning the past, I will celebrate the present and the future. Most importantly I will celebrate that I am still here.

If you’re struggling, don't struggle alone. You are not alone and you will be surprised how many people want to help you. Keep fighting and be proud of yourself for still being here today. I’m happy you’re still here.",1679335474.0

I had been ruminating about this for a while, because I was freaking myself out reading about meds on the internet, and I asked him what cocktail I was on way back when I started seeing him a year and a half ago after I got discharged from the hospital. He read the list to me and I immediately started crying. It was so much. It all came back to me and I remembered how miserable it made me. 15mg olanzapine, 1200mg lithium, forgot how much effexor, along with anafranil. I was in such a terrible place for a year constantly trying to work around those meds and getting unstable anytime I tried to get off of one. I couldn't feel pleasure, I was tired all the time, lost interest in all my hobbies and in life, felt stupid and dumb and numb, lost my libido, was emotionally flatlined (my fucking grandfather died while I was on these and I felt nothing) and I felt so hopeless. I had to get a job because I took a year away from school and I sucked at it so hard because of my lethargy and my tremors.

A year and a half later, my cocktail is completely different and manageable: 250mg Lamictal, 50mg Prozac, 2.5mg olanzapine (tapering), and thinking of adding wellbutrin. but I broke down because of the regret and the time wasted and the amount of depression and numbness and pain I had to go through. Weren't the meds supposed to make me feel better? I remember initially the previous doctor from the outpatient suggested maybe lowering the dose or switching to a different AP, but I declined and I regret that so much. I regret that I never got to give Lamictal a shot initially before I was hospitalized because I tried it for a few days and my mom thought I was getting a bad reaction. I regret that I ever took stimulants or smoked or that this pandemic ever happened or that I made the stupid mistake that led to the trauma which all collectively resulted in my episode.

I want to move forward, but I still feel like I'll never get back who I was all those years ago. My psych said that the brain is constantly changing and growing and healing. But I want my old brain back, I don't care about it growing, I want to feel what I used to feel. I broke down right after the session ended really hard and my dad talked me through it. I feel bad for what I've put my parents through the past two years. I've had to take a second leave of absence from school and I'm not sure if I'm in a position to go back again. Feel like I've ruined my life and I can't move forward, no matter how good the new meds are and how well I do in treatment, my mind will never forget that medication cocktail and those doses and how it wrecked me.",1679344807.0

It's like you know that your being irrational and there is nothing that you can do about it no matter how hard you try. 

So last night in the middle of my manic episode, I just had this moment apologizing to my partner for keeping him up with my crying. I didn't sleep at all and I just was angry about that. I'm really good at masking most of the time. I have to be, as I work in retail. But then I come home and sometimes I absolutely unravel. 

The part about this is that my logical bits of my brain know better. I know that all the terrible things my brain tells me during my episodes is not true. I know that I can do better. It's as if I'm paralyzed and there's a disconnect between all the parts of my brain. It's fucking horrible and exhausting! 

I am medicated, I am really bad at remembering to take my medications so do you have any tips to help this? I also have a slew of other alphabet soup stuff going on with me.

i swiped right on the most attractive man ive ever matched with on a dating app, totally out of my league. we talked for a few days, and then met and had an amazing date. we had ice cream, went to a book store, and art museum. im trying to figure out the line between manic and adventurous, but it felt nice and not dangerous.

anyway, before the date i sent a friendly but firm text that i didnt want to do anything physical, not even kiss. he said he would respect that, and he did. at the end i even tried, i said i wanted to kiss him when we parted. he said he wanted to kiss me too but we should wait for the right time.

I DONT WANT TO MESS THIS UP !! any tips? when do i tell him im bipolar and how much do i tell him? i want to lock this man DOWN.

At 11 years old I had my first attempt and my live has been spiraling down ever since. I am now a 16 year old alcoholic and drug addict (kind of) who spent their last year in prostitution for alcohol.

I wanna get diagnosed so I can get better and stop burdening all my friends and my boyfriend with my problems, but at the same time i dont wanna be diagnosed. I cant really explain it. I wanna get better but at the same time I dont wanna? I wanna get better so I can really live my life and not destroy my body and life at any given minute. I wanna get better so my friends can stop worrying about me. I wanna get better so my mom doesnt need to cry herself to sleep every night because of me. I wanna get better for my boyfriend, cause already after only a month of relationship i feel like im just making his mental health worse cause he spends all his energy worrying about me. But I also dont wanna get better. I want that my mom cries herself to sleep so that she feels what she did to me all those years. I want my friends and boyfriend to worry about me (if that makes sense?). But I mostly dont wanna get better cause im scared.

For the first one in summer 2021, the pharmacy messed up my Zoloft dose and I was taking 1.5 times as much as I should’ve been.  It was a euphoric mania, and it occurred during a period of extreme stress from a divorce as well. I also started taking a 5-htp supplement around the time of my episode. I was hospitalized. I was also on lamotrigine at the time. 

I gained a ton of weight from both the antipsychotics and lithium. I went off antipsychotic first, seroquel, that caused me to gain around a pound every single day. Lithium I stayed on longer but I gained around 5 pounds a month. 

I then fell into a severe depression.  Like unbelievably severe. I thought I had had severe depressive episodes before, but I was wrong. I was not functional and planning my suicide. My psychiatrist initially refused to prescribe an SSRI, or put me on vyvanse, what I used to take for adhd and also helped with depression. I eventually talked him into it, I can’t remember exactly how.  I was also on lamotragine I think I would’ve died if I had not been out on Zoloft at that time. But it was a lower dose. 

Fast forward, during a time of work stress maybe 6 months later, I slipped into a more agitated mania. I was also on lamotrigine.  I was again hospitalized, stopped taking Zoloft and vyvanse, and went on Zyprexa and lithium. 

Weight gain with Zyprexa was still significant but leveled out relatively quickly, and lithium doesn’t seem to be an issue this time.

After writing a book, I guess my main question is- does anybody here only go manic on SSRIs?  In the past the one other time I was on one it caused rapid mood cycling, and so did Zoloft until I was on lamotrigine. I’ve been labeled as bipolar I, which I initially  talked him out of and he changed it to not otherwise specified, until I had my second one. I’ve been told the average age for first mania for a woman is 31, and I was 35.  But I don’t think it was a coincidence they were both on Zoloft. I am pretty convinced I won’t go manic without Zoloft or another SSRI. But I can’t afford to take the risk. Which means I’m stuck on meds I may not need for basically forever.

So I'm 17 (got diagnosed on my birthday, quick fun fact I guess lol) and moved out of my parent's into an entirely different state back in January. I was doing completely fine, and actually felt on top of the world for awhile. I did some exams that allowed me to graduate early before moving, told myself and everyone I'll get a new job and start college as soon as I can. I haven't been able to get a job here yet, so I have been doing commissions to hold me off for a while. I was doing really good with that, making about $80-200 a week which held me off pretty well (I'm living with my boyfriend who lives with his mom so I don't have to pay rent or anything, just need to buy stuff for myself and my cat) everything was going good. 

I had to stop my meds after I moved because my psychiatrist isn't licensed in this state plus the side effects for the meds I was currently on gave me really bad tardive dyskinesia. My boyfriend's mom has been pressuring me more and more recently to get a job, sending me links for places to apply to more, and I've been applying to them. The other night I had a conversation with my parents (I'm still on good terms with them) and my mom noticed I must be manic because I told her I've been unable to get much sleep at all due to my mind constantly racing. She said she wants me to come visit home asap because she has bipolar too and based on her experience she doesn't want me being unmedicated and manic in an entirely different state especially when the depression comes. 

I told my boyfriend's mom this and she was really disappointed, saying that she doesn't want me to constantly visit back and forth again (before I moved I would visit for a couple weeks very often) and that I'm supposed to have a job by now, and that basically if I'm going to be doing this I should just move back until Im 18. I seriously don't want to move back though. I love my parents and everything and I want to just visit, not move back entirely. I'm happier here with my boyfriend, finally have myself settled and comfortable here, and I'm worried if I move back I'll get addicted to bad habits again because my mental health was a lot worse there. 

My parents and my boyfriend's mom had a whole dispute and I was in the middle of it, and since then I just feel like it triggered something in me and now I feel miserable and sick and scared. I'm sleeping constantly, and when I wake up I have messages from my boyfriend's mom telling me to apply to some place, along with messages from my parents asking when I'll be visiting. I don't want to disappoint or upset either of them with what I do and I don't know what'll be best for me, staying here and getting a job or risking it and going back to get my mental health worked on. I haven't been able to draw much at all since then and I fell behind on my commissions which is making me feel worse and I just don't know what to do right now. I feel stuck and I just want to cry and sleep and ignore all these issues. I haven't felt this shitty in so long, I can't bring myself to do anything and I keep suddenly crying several times a day when I'm awake.

Sorry if this issue seems trivial or anything. I just have an extreme fear of disappointing people which makes this all so much worse for me. I really want to visit my parents and get on something that'll help me, but I'm worried that if I go my boyfriend's mom won't allow me to come back, and I don't want to upset her with my decision since she keeps telling me to apply to the places she's sending me and I'm telling her I will so she won't get upset.

I don't know what I want from this post. I just know I needed to let this all out. If anyone reads this all then personal input or advice is welcome. I'm not sure what to do right now, I need to make a decision quick but I can't bring myself to",1679324306.0

I'd rather go unmedicated than doing the antipsychotics (Abilify in this case). I don't feel like I'm ""psychotic,"" even in my mania it was barely psychotic--feeling like I could feel objects emotions.

When I’m depressed I am in contact with my feelings, I’m completely focused on what’s happening inside of me instead of outside of me 2. When I’m “happy” I’m not in contact if my feelings, I get my happiness from external factor, in contrast of when I’m depressed I get my sadness from internal factors.

My personality? I talk A LOT. I can be very insensitive and agressive. I WILL do everything I need to be better than whoever is around me. I want to be prettier, the nicest, the funniest, the sweetest, the most intelligent. But that takes constant control. So when I lose it, I go fucking rogue. 

I have a VERY hard time controlling what I say cause my impulse control is absolutely shit. I don't know what to do. Cause that's when people start to lose respect toward me. And that's also when people start to despise me. I want to avoid it as much as possible cause my new job is my dream job and I've been doing amazing until now. 

I don't want to ruin it by literally being myself and blunt. When I'm blunt, the things I say are inexact and stupid. 

What can I do? 

Counting to 3 before speaking is impossible, I can't do it. I forget about it as soon as I enter the world...",1679317801.0

152,Wanting to be Normal,1,11wu1gh,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11wu1gh/wanting_to_be_normal/,0,"It’s been a weird year. The world became a hotbed of viral death and I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I mean, apparently I just couldn’t let the pandemic upstage me.

I’ve tried to deny who I am for the past 10 years. If you had to label me, I often am described as an extreme extrovert. All my friends tell me they “don’t know how I do it.” I stay out until 2am, go to bed at 3am, and wake up for work at 6am multiple days in a row without a problem. I do it all seamlessly, making it look effortless. I’ve never missed a day of work because I was tired or hungover, which is why I can’t stop acting the way I do. I don’t know how to say no. The word is literally not in my vocabulary. My lust to wander, be around friends, and experience everything the world has to offer is insatiable, but in an unhealthy way. 

I used to think that everyone else I knew was lame. I would come up with excuses for them; “they didn’t go to a party college, they’re married, they don’t like techno music.” But ultimately, I would get mad that my friends couldn’t handle social interactions the same way I did. Turns out, everyone I know is just normal and I am bipolar.

Throughout undergrad and graduate school, I normalized my actions as part of the college experience. I still did well in school while partying and sleeping around, so why worry? Promiscuity and drinking is part of college culture, so what if I was a bit extra every now and then?

Recently though, my disease has gotten the best of me. The thoughts in my head won’t go away. I sit there in turmoil knowing that I am being unreasonable, but I am plagued by insecurity, fear of missing out, irritability, anxiety, and no matter how I try to reason through them, they disrupt my life. 

There is such a stigma on not only bipolar disorder, but mental disorders in general that it has made me afraid to try medication. Why can’t I be the way I used to be without medication? Why can’t I feel like myself without taking an antipsychotic? I know we all need a little extra help sometime, but I am scared. I am scared to admit who I really am.",1679342646.0

I do not believe in ghosts. But I found a can of reduced sodium soup in my cabinet and there is no way my roommate or I would ever buy that. We both have POTS and are on high sodium diets. I got this deep seated feeling that either someone broke in and put it there or, more likely, there is some sort of supernatural shit going on and I’m being haunted. I know rationally that this isn’t true. But I still feel anxiety in my gut that I’m being haunted and bad shit is going to happen. 

This is a pattern, I tend to get really emotional about some conspiracy or something supernatural. One time I salt lined my friend’s apartment because someone left a creepy doll in the vestibule of her building and then it got moved to the laundry room.

The sadness is so consuming, you don’t think you’ll make it one more day. There is the anguish of not being able to be reliable every single time you’re needed.
Some days I can’t count on myself, let alone be there for another person asking me for help. I wish with all of my might that I could be someone’s rock, even though I can’t be one for myself.

The lack of hope that one day it will get better and I will be strong enough to conquer this. The feelings of anger and irritation pulsing through my body for no apparent reason. My aggression toward everyone, even though I know they have done nothing wrong. The grief I feel when the thoughts come rushing in, telling me I am a burden to others and everyone who once loved me.

The heartache from the thought that I am pushing everyone away and will soon be alone. The fear of facing this alone.
The exhaustion of putting up a front to mask my many emotions and terrifying thoughts, just to seem OK and “normal.”
It’s more than just being happy one day and sad the next. There are highs of being productive with little amounts of sleep that can go on for days, even weeks.

The manic state of rash decisions and risky behavior, such as impromptu tattoos or even solo backpacking trips through Europe. The euphoric feeling of being on top of the world. The racing thoughts and distractions that cannot be controlled.

I’ve been on them for years but they are not helping enough anymore. I’ve gone off lithium before and that went fine. I tried going off Invega but I couldn’t keep my shit together.

I got off of and had really bad withdrawal from lorazepam but it helps my major panic issues. So I’d keep that but use it sparingly.

My husband said he’d seriously consider divorcing me if I go off of my meds. I’m kind of devastated. We were together before I got diagnosed and medicated. We never had a bad relationship while I was off meds. I did some stupid shit occasionally but we got though it more easily than a lot of the shit I’ve done medicated. 

He drank like a fucking fish, got increasingly violent and acted like I shot him when I said I’d divorce him if he didn’t stop. He was sober 1 month. 1. And while infinitely better, still has episodes of drinking way too much. And I’m supposed to take it with a fucking smile.

But how fucking dare I say I want to get off the stuff that give me side effects I don’t want to live with anymore. I’m even open to other medication, just not what I’m on currently, except maybe lamictal.

I was first diagnosed with bipolar type 2 in 2019. I quickly got stable with medication until I was pregnant in 2021 and my meds were changed. It set me spiralling and I saw a new psychiatrist who again diagnosed bipolar type 2. 

I came off my meds for 6 months last year and stayed pretty stable other than depression. Then around Christmas time hit a manic period and saw a new psychiatrist. This time they said they weren't sure bipolar was the right diagnosis but put me on lamotrigine anyway. 

I've been really good on lamotrigine for a couple months but my husband spoke to my psych nurse today about maybe having some counselling and she said I don't have a diagnosis of bipolar anymore and they're treating my autism and depression. 

I don't know why I feel so panicked and upset by it. I think it's come out of the blue. The fact nobody has told me and they've now told my husband without even speaking to me about it. It feels like they've been sort of talking behind my back and think I'm lying or something?

I was initially diagnosed Bipolar 2, and tried a number of medications that either didn’t work, or made me worse.

The bad experience with medication caused me to “take a break” from medication, off and on. 

Around the age of 25 I was hospitalized for a manic episode. A year later, when I was 26, I was hospitalized again for another manic episode.

Finally, around the age of 27, I started seeing a new psychiatrist, and she put me on Abilify, and to my surprise, I finally felt stable, happy, and “normal”.

Over the years, I have had to adjust my Abilify every now and again, but can usually get stable fairly quickly.

Until now. 

I began having hypomanic symptoms about a week ago, so we raised my Abilify to 30MGS and added 5MGS of Zyprexa.

Maybe I’m being impatient, it’s only been two days, but I’m still having hypomanic symptoms. And on top of that, I’m having balance and coordination issues.

My fear is that the Abilify is no longer working, and I am accepting the possibility that I may have to start from square one.

Which means medication trial and error, and with my past bad experiences with medication, I may be completely dysfunctional for God knows how long.

Which leads me to considering possibly going on Disability. I know it’s not easy to get, and could take up to a year to receive benefits, which is a concern.

I also feel going on Disability may lower my self esteem. To be clear, I don’t judge others that are on it who really need it. It’s just a personal issue I have, I really want to work and function in the real world.

And I know you also have to jump through a bunch of hoops to get Disability, and even when I’m “stable” I tend to give up easily.

So yeah. I guess I’m posting because I’m really on the fence about this. I’m scared, worried and feel shame.

Please stop deleting this.

So basically med-induced stupidity is ruining my life. Being smart is my thing, it’s the only thing I have going for me pretty much. I’ve been labeled a “genius”with a 140+ iq for my entire life and now I can’t do basic math. I’m freaking out, it’s so bad I might actually flunk out of school at this rate.

I’ve been on lamictal for years and always knew it made my memory and cognition worse, but it never was that big of a problem because I wasn’t doing anything that hard.

All of that changed this year when I went back to studying computer science in college, something that I was always good at. But now I can’t do anything, and I mean that. I can’t remember anything for more than ten seconds, it takes me 10x how much time it should for me to learn anything and my brain just doesn’t work. I’m a month behind in both of my stem classes. Even when I was in a mixed psychotic episode I was 10x smarter than this, hell even when I was hospitalized I was smarter than this! So I know for sure that it is the meds causing this, not the disorder itself.

I’m scared of stopping it completely but I want to at least try cutting the dose. My psychiatrist agreed that it could potentially help, but he also pretty much said he doesn’t know much about it. I used take 400 and going down to 200 helped a little, so I’m planning on going down to 100. Has anybody successfully regained some of their brain power by lowering their dose?",1679279040.0

My next appointment for my psychiatrist isn’t for another 3 weeks (she’s also very booked out) but I will be talking to her about what I’m saying here :) 

My psych started me on 10mg of Abilify. I started taking it and felt so jittery and just down right awful. I couldn’t stand up in the shower, I couldn’t do my makeup or get dressed. I also didn’t feel like it would be safe for me to drive. It was hell.  

I took 10mg for 5 days. I went to the chemist that we see very regularly to pick up our prescriptions and she said I am experiencing akathisia. Her advice was to write it down and see if it gets any worse, and if it did, to email my psychiatrist or get into contact with her some way. 

I kind of took it my own way and just started taking half of the pills, and guess what? Akathisia is only half as bad now. 
I’ve been taking the half tablets for maybe 5 days? So 9 days on Abilify so far. It’s still horrible but I’d never want to feel that way again. It was so bad. 

I know Abilify is not the right medication for me. The benefits for me are : less racing thoughts, more stable mood. 

The disadvantages of Abilify for me are: not helping sleep at all (this has been a huge issue for years), feeling kinda “weird” and not myself around my friends etc. losing interest in a lot of creative things I used to love. And of course, the akathisia. 

I am scared of a few “bipolar meds” because I’m scared of gaining weight now that I am at a healthy weight. Just thought I’d add that in there.

EDIT: Thanks again for all of the advice. I know that my husband just doesn’t understand and needs to educate himself more on this illness. A little backstory on me- I grew up with a bipolar-schizoaffective mother who really was out of control. No stability. Ever. She ended up killing herself when I was 16. I was first medicated and diagnosed at 13 and always felt my mother almost pushed me into a diagnosis. I was medicated until she died. Then not again until 2019 at 25 years old in the midst of a terribly toxic relationship. This man lied to me about everything, forced me to go get medicated only to use it against me and gaslight me into thinking I was crazy. I found a good med combo and met my husband in 2020. I was still emotionally shattered from previous relationship. But my husband stuck by me. When I say he pushed me- I don’t mean he made me or asked me. He did make comments and suggestions. I think he is just afraid the meds are going to damage me more in other ways, idk. Since being off meds I’ve held down a great job, but I’ve never had an issue working anyways. I think because I’m not like my mother was, to the same extent, I think I can do it without the meds. But lately I feel like I can’t. My work is suffering now bc I can’t focus. My relationship is suffering because I can’t open up and be vulnerable anymore. Just feels like a spiral and I don’t like that. I’ve always prided myself for my resilience but it’s come with a lot of suffering, self hatred and pain. So yeah. 

Thank you all again.

When my husband and I first got together I was medicated and mostly stable. He is very natural and pushed me to try life without meds, so I did.

I’m also very sensitive so any criticism really pushes me. Anyways- I have a had a few drinks and when I drink all my stifled emotions bubble to the surface. And my husband is a very logical, type a person. He doesn’t get it and I don’t know that he really wants to. I have really suppressed a huge part of who I am in order to stay “normal” but I feel like I can’t do it much longer.

I had never brought up the manic feelings I got where I'd just be really confident and happy for no reason, kind of like not giving a shit about what anyone thought and then having a million ideas, thinking how I'm gonna improve my life, also wasting a ton of money on games because in those moments my mind just goes do it who cares.

Does anyone else struggle to tell the difference between what’s “normal” behavior and what’s manic behavior? For example, I’m in a relationship with a wonderful man, and out of the blue last week I just decide I don’t want to be with him anymore and lose all feelings for him. And all of these reasons to leave that I keep telling myself sound completely valid, but how can I go from loving him and wanting to marry him to just complete indifference? When I get like this I turn cold towards him and want nothing to do with him. I feel annoyed when he tries to talk to me. Is that normal? Just to add, I’ve done this like 10 times over the course of our 2 year relationship and feel so guilty later on. I just don’t want to rashly and regret anything later.

I’m in a depressive state and haven’t had a manic episode in over two years now. (Some hypomania but nothing too concerning).

I’ve been having a hard time with work recently. After finding this community I’ve discovered that I’m not the only one with trouble holding down a job. 

I have a relatively high paying job for my area that allows me to live at least paycheck to paycheck with one pay period worth in my savings. I guess I don’t really know where to start, but I just can’t work my job anymore. I have this horrible depression and the job itself is very difficult. I have FMLA for my mental health and can take up to 2 days off per week and also have time off for appointments. I’m finding myself needing more and more time off, unpaid, and I don’t know what to do.

I applied for a much lower paying job, but I feel like it will be much better for my mental health.

I’m just so upset and defeated, I don’t know if I’ll start this new job in a good mental state, if I even get it.

I’ve considered short term disability because I just feel like I can’t stand a single more day working my current job. I just want to cry the whole time. I feel like such a failure.

I’m looking into doing a year longDBT program. It was recommended by both my therapist and psychiatrist.

I’m just having such a hard time making decisions. I know I need to leave this job. I feel like my body and mind is screaming out for help. It’s causing me physical symptoms like nausea and vomiting, migraines, panic attacks.

My parents definitely both have some type of undiagnosed mood disorders but Bipolar runs rampant on my father’s side.

Currently taking 375mg Lamictal (extra 100 added because I use the Nuvaring), 900mg lithium, and 300mg of gabapentin. I had a pretty bad alcohol issue prior to January. I realized I went into mixed episodes when I mixed lithium and wine. So I switched to Whiteclaw and had no issues and now I just have not been drinking much. Like an idiot I was feeling relaxed the other night and thought it would be nice to have some wine to further calm down. Just had a glass. Last night, I drank the rest, and started getting super hopeless.

My issues with bipolar lead to my husband telling me he wanted a divorce 2 months ago. I was struggling a lot in the second half of 2022. I was weaned off Lexapro after taking it for 8 years. Historically, i do not do well in periods of adjusting meds. I was getting better by early January as I stopped drinking wine. But then the divorce happened (not officially but no chance of reconciliation).

My kids (13 and 15) knew he wanted a divorce before I did. They thought it was a good idea because of all of the fighting. My 13 year old still spends time with me but my 15 year old doesn’t even like being around me. I love spending time with them, and it’s the only thing that makes me remotely happy at the moment but they are just not that into it, which makes me less happy.

I literally am so miserable. The only thing that I like doing is going to concerts. So I bought four concert tickets for shows over the next two months. I just don’t know how I can sustain being so depressed. I am a mid-level practitioner in a profession I can’t get out of because of a bias/ stigma against. I hate my job and it’s actually physically injuring me. I’m in $400K+ student loan debt ($120K being the actual loan, the rest as interest). I wasn’t aware that I had bipolar when I started professional college. My career requires an entrepreneurial mindset and this motivation fluctuates. I’ve tried applying for jobs outside of my profession but I know I’m qualified for and I am always rejected or looked over.

I have no family or friends closer than 1000 miles that actually care about me. Just online friends. I live in a very expensive city near where my husband is from and cannot leave.

I just feel like I exist to bring in a paycheck and give my kids rides or help them as needed.

224,On suicide,3,11vwp52,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11vwp52/on_suicide/,21,"The past few months I've been struggling with persistent suicide ideation and even attempted during a major depressive episode. But instead of saying ""it's just a symptom of your disease"" I would like to walk you through my thought process. 

1. The argument from circumstance. 
Right now I am unemployed, with no realistic chance of getting a job. My resume is spotty, and the market I operated in pretty much collapsed. My memory, focus and cognitive skills are pretty much gone after having two psychoses in a year. A low skilled job almost always requires a drivers license, which I'm not capable of (I tried). Furthermore, I have a criminal record from the things I did during my psychosis, excluding me from most jobs in my field anyways. I'm lonely and have no support system (no friends or family that can offer any stability). Meaning that within a year or so I'll be forced to sell my house and eventually live on the streets. Homelessness is not a reason for suicide of course, nor is unemployment, but it's also something I'd rather not do. Yet it is almost unavoidable. 

2. The argument from harm. 
My actions, whether in psychosis, depression, mania, anger, or just because who I am, have caused irreparable emotional and material damage. My continued existence is a danger to society, and will always incur tremendous cost (through health care, living on the streets, and I've had multiple encounters with the police during both manic and depressive episodes). While one could argue that all life is ultimately detrimental, in my case it's fairly obvious: I cause harm without being able to effectively control it, and I do not wish to cause any more harm. The self image of a calm collected person is a fever dream, in reality I'm just a unstable criminally psychotic mental health patient. 

3. The argument from hopelessness.
You might argue ""well maybe you'll find a job, some friends, maybe even love, and what you did in the past might not happen again"". Living on the streets is an adventure! Unfortunately, it might also not be the case. I've always had a pessimistic and depressed outlook, and whether that is caused by brain abnormalities or not almost seems irrelevant: life has always been a struggle, and I do not want to continue this struggle. It's hopeless, really, I just kinda fumbled my way into an impossible situation. 

4. The argument from despair. 
Although perhaps a majority of people disagrees with the following: I believe society is on the brink of collapse, and within our projected lifetimes things will likely only get worse. Without going into the precise reasons for believing this, I feel like it's almost uncontroversial to say ""things are bad, and they'll get worse"". For the longest time I held a certain morbid curiosity for this ""lets see how this plays out"", but after my depressive psychosis (which was a traumatizing hell) I quite simply no longer have the desire to see it. 

5. The argument from meaning. 
Commonly the argument against suicide goes ""what about the people you leave behind"". The two people I still have in my life pretty much said ""we get it, just make sure your affairs are in order"". So that's not a real argument for me personally. But in the abstract you might say ""you owe it to the world to do your best"" to which my mind always replies ""no"". I have nothing to contribute anyways, but if life is simply reduced to doing the meaningless bidding of others in order to perpetuate some bizarre notion of ""you must work to live, even if life is miserable"" then I simply refuse to play that game. But even if it is not miserable, which it will be (because my brain is broken), is life then simply some egocentric hedonism ""find pleasure in something"". I mean that's also a little bit of a hollow existence. Someone once said to me ""life just *is*"", there is no purpose or meaning to it, which is fair. But then not living really seems like a choice, and I can choose to stop it. 

6. The argument from personality. 
Nobody likes a pseudo-intellectual climate activist with anti-capitalist tendencies that has a mental health disorder and will probably live on the streets. Especially not one that studied AI and philosophy. Especially not ... you can fill in all the stereotypes, feel free to pick the ones you hate the most. Now you might say ""just shut up then and be normal"", I quite literally can't. You can't just say ""change your personality"". I have seen so many death threats on social media, it's worrying in its own right. 

So that's it, that's the thought process. I'm just too tired, I have lived an acceptable life. I've known riches and wealth, love, and the depths of thought. But it's done. Life will always end, there is even some beauty in the idea that I get to pick when.",1679257792.0

I'm taking medication that I'm excited about, I feel really happy that my psychiatrist and therapist both think this diagnosis is 100% accurate.

I just also feel so lost - like a part of me has been identified that has been ignored for so long. It's really strange to feel like no one has ever really questioned my behavior. I feel a little odd even just identifying with the Bipolar label, I feel like maybe I've made up my symptoms in my head.

226,"starting abilify, plus some venting",4,11vqywz,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11vqywz/starting_abilify_plus_some_venting/,7,"I've been on wellbutrin for around 5 years, lamictal for three, and now am adding abilify. Wellbutrin stopped by zoloft-induced dissociative fugues, and Lamictal changed my life, tbh. I started taking it at around the same time as the first COVID lock downs, and the medication plus the chance to recognize (and indulge) my agoraphobia was huge. I used to have panic attacks and dissociative episodes every single time I tried going to grocery stores, restaurants, malls, or anywhere else crowded and overstimulating, and that's much less of an issue now. 

Three years later everything is still better, but I have a really hard time with task initiation/completion and do still have hypomanic episodes, scary intrusive thoughts, and constant suicidal ideation (that sometimes gets a little too active for comfort). I kinda thought I was doing fine, since it really is noticeably better than before, but during a recent appointment with my psychiatrist I was mentioning this and he asked if it was affecting my ability to work. I said no, but then almost immediately remembered how frequently I spend an entire day staring at my screen unable to think clearly enough to write, only to have anxiety attacks at the end of the day because I feel ‐ correctly - like I got nothing done and am bad at my job. (Logically, I know that I'm actually really good at my job, but ykwim). Then I end up working late and it compounds with everything else and I end up exhausted and can barely help with housework and things, and that then makes me feel like a terrible partner. (On the flipside, I think about how much better I feel now, and wonder how tf my partner stayed with me through all that - it'll be 8 years in a few months.)

At this point, I'm already on 400mg of lamictal and 300mg of wellbutrin, so rather than increase the dose past the point of clinical evidence, my psychiatrist suggested trying abilify. It feels kind of rough to add another pill to the handful, since I'm also on other meds for other health issues, but I just really hope it works.

I was recently diagnosed by a therapist with Bipolar 1. I’ve been able to use the counseling center at my university after coming back from a year long leave of absence from my masters program (likely due to a manic episode that I hadn’t recognized as a manic episode at the time). I had initially come in with the goal to reduce my chances of burn out when I was diagnosed. She recommended I see a psychiatrist to get medicated. I’ve always been highly wary of being on medication for anything, especially long term. Long story short I left with a script for Depakote (500mg) to take once at night. I work overnights, I intern during the day and I have classes throughout the week. I fear that getting on this med will affect my productivity (can cause sleepiness/dizziness). I guess I’m still working through accepting my diagnosis. How do I go about asking for a different med that will better work for my ever-switching sleeping schedule? I haven’t even wanted to take the Depakote. Sometimes I wonder if the diagnosis is wrong and I fear messing my brain chemistry up more.",1679248865.0

Interestingly, and unbeknownst to me, I noticed it had been changing my behavior.

Since being off, I'm less irritable, more social, and more creative/funny.

The downside is that my sleep schedule is now shit and that my swings are back to what they used to be (which isn't all that bad since my depressive swings have always been mild/moderate - it's the hypomania thats the slightly problematic one but I'm aware of when it's setting in).

Don't really know how to proceed really because the trade offs don't really seem worth it for me. I Uber so I can drive when I want and the hypomanic impulsivity isn't really something I think I can't handle.

Usually during the workweek I’m distracted enough that I don’t feel tired. On the weekends I’m consistently tired enough that I need a nap unless I’m super distracted by a task or social engagement. 

What more can I do? I go to bed at 9 or 10 pm and wake up at 6:30. I never feel rested and basically have to army-crawl out of bed. I follow every sleep hygiene tip out there (no caffeine after 2 pm, block out all light and sound) other than watching TV before bed (no phone/screen time IN bed though). 

I get a ton of exercise, at least 1 hour per day of walking my dog and walking to/from work. I also work a very physical job but it’s not my body that’s tired out, it’s sleepiness. 

I eat clean and quit eating refined sugars about 6 weeks ago. My “junkiest” food that I eat is probably sugar-free rice putting. No fried shit, no chips, no fast food, none of that. 

I also have ADHD but am not medicated for it (nothing has worked) and I’m on Seroquel but feel as tired as I did on 200 mg as I do on 100 mg. I’m sober and my only vice is vaping at the lowest concentration of nicotine.

I'm guessing this was grade school, I don't know any details after that he went to his room. I've tried to tell him in here and checking on him but I don't know what to say.

I’ve been diagnosed with BD type 1 for two years and when I got diagnosed it made so many things from my childhood make sense.
I was always so “emotional and dramatic” and known as being a “cry baby” basically my entire life. To be completely honest I truly think I’ve always been bipolar (genetically not necessarily an environmental effect-although my environment didn’t help but cause more spark to the fire) 
Anyway, I’m 27 now and I’ve decided to discontinue birth control. I currently take the pill and have the nexplanon. The combination of the two seemed to help for about five months but since having the nexplanon I have gained so much weight and have become more noticeably irritable. My episodes are more drastic and scare not only myself but others around me. Along with that my depression has gotten worse and pet of that is because of the weight of gained-it makes me so mad. I’ve tried dieting and exercising extensively. I have been told that a k eto diet helps manage symptoms of BD-not sure how true tha is. But I did do the diet for about two months and I dropped weight quick and get on top of the world. Thinking back on it now idk if that top of the world feeling was me having an episode.
I few like my BD has been managed quite well but of course I struggle day to day. 
Everyone here knows how dark bad days can be, you know how it can be. It’s scary as fuck! 
I want to be healthier with minimal medication and I feel like that means no more birth control. I’m hoping it helps me lose weight and decrease my depression. 
I also want to start a family but it worries me that my children could possibly have BD like me. No one is immune to pain and suffering but man having a mental diagnosis sure makes things a hell of a lot harder. 



Edit: the only reason I’ve taken birth control is because my cycle is extremely irregular. Sometimes I have it every day for  months at a time to having it very painfully for a day or two. All birth control I’ve used has helped for about two months until it seems to have no effect on my body. The last birth control I was using was the pill along with the nexplanon.

Over the past few months I've experienced my first full-blown manic episode, with all the characteristic symptoms. 

Now I'm back in a really bad depressive state. Nevertheless, I've really been treated like shit over the past few months by some people who were once friends. In the past, I'd have been very meek and mild and probably would have let such behaviour slide. But over the past month or so, I've been very confrontational about the way I've been mistreated. 

I also went to the annual general meeting of a society I used to be president of, and called them out for their causal homophobia, misogyny, racism etc. 

These are things I wouldn't have considered doing in the past - I'd have been far too anxious and frankly conflict avoidant. Now that fear has gone and I see willing to embrace confrontation when I've been wronged. 

Is this just a sign of personal growth or have others experienced a surge in confrontational behaviours as well?

I’m NOT suicidal. I’m just exhausted. The help I’ve received has been minimal at best. My original diagnosis was 10+ years ago, and the treatment was and still is a joke. 

I was never the best patient, but my doctor told me that I was the bipolar poster child. 

I lived at home with my single mother, who moved to a different apartment at least once a year. She was a victim of domestic violence. The incident occurred around 2004, and this man (the abuser) played a minimal role in her life in the following 13 years. Even though he’s out of her life completely now, she will still “play the victim card”, as she’s likely consumed by thoughts of the event. That being said, she refuses to confront her trauma. She played little to no part in helping me get any help for my mental illnesses or her own. 

Due to constantly moving, when I could get any kind of professional treatment, it was never long lasting. I wasn’t able to stay in therapy/psychiatry and I surely wasn’t able to stay on a medication long enough to tell if it was beneficial or not. This led to episodes of mania and depression that then led to hospitalizations that shattered my trust in everyone. 

My mother moved out of the apartment we lived in when I was 17. From that time until I was 20, I rapidly cycled through manic, hypomanic, psychotic manic, and crippling depressive episodes with great intensity. I wasn’t able to tell where the mania ended and the depression began. I was mostly manic, which meant I didn’t need treatment because I felt like a god; completely untouchable. I got arrested, lost my job, and totaled my car. My mother had put me up in my own one-bedroom apartment. After losing my job, I didn’t have any income with which to pay my rent. I lost the apartment, too, and ended up homeless. 

I started to get back on my feet with a lot of help from friends, family, and my boyfriend at the time. I started self-medicating with cannabis and the symptoms actually started to subside for a little while. I certainly won’t say that it’s an effective treatment method for bipolar disorder because I was still cycling, but I wasn’t moving through episodes so quickly. For the past 5 years, I’ve noticed annual depressive episodes with shorter, less severe hypo/manic episodes. 

I currently have a psychiatrist whose not willing to give me anything other than Abilify and Hydroxyzine, which is basically just Benadryl, but at least it helps me sleep at night. 
I’m on the waitlist for therapy, with no openings in the next 90 days, at least. 
I have a stable job, steady income, a car, and a place to live. I try to get to the gym 3 times a week. I do yoga almost every day. Things should feel better, but they don’t. 

I’m tired of taking care of myself. I’m tired of babying my mental health. I’m tired of trying to learn about bipolar disorder on my own because nobody ever educated me about my diagnosis. I do not have it in my anymore to keep doing all of this.",1679178465.0

Rapid cycle. Mixed state mania. All that jazz... 

What I experience doesn't seem to be consistent with what many other people feel. Before a full blown manic episode I feel great, all my problems melt away and I hardly sleep at all. This makes sense to me. Once I pass that phase, things become very extreme. I can only describe it as absolutely excruciating, like being in hell. Like I'm on a ton of amphetamines and the most extreme anxiety I have ever experience. It never stops or takes a break. I never sleep or even sit down. All I can do is pace around my house all day and night for days on end. My heart is beats out of my chest the entire time. It breaks me and I'll do anything for relief. The last time I was manic, after taking seroquel for a few days, it brought me down to a point where I felt like I was on cocaine all the time. That I could attleat tolerate. 

Does anyone else have horrific manic experiences?? This doesn't seem to be consistent with everything I've read, and it's been bothering me for years. I'd appreciate any input. Thanks!

On a positive note, I haven't had a manic episode for almost a year. 300mg of lamotrigine does a great job keeping me down. Vraylar was very effective as well, but the side effects were more than I could handle.

I used to smoke about half a pack a day fairly reliably, but in the wake of a very stressful cross-country move, my consumption spiked to 20-25 smokes a day and I haven’t been able to get it back down yet.  I have BP1 with psychotic features and my own therapist said he doesn’t know anyone with a psychotic mood disorder that doesn’t smoke, so I’m not sure if actually quitting is in my future.  I’ve tried before using patches and after two weeks I felt like I had a rabid rat scratching around in my head.  However, I do think getting back to half a pack or less is doable.  My current plan is two-fold: replace some of my daily smokes with nicotine gum, and instead of having the whole pack with me out on the porch where I smoke, I keep them inside and only take 2 with me outside.  When I’m done I’ll set a phone timer for 2 hours and not smoke until it goes off.  Hopefully this will get me down to around 15 or less a day at which point I’ll either smoke every 3 hours or only have one at a time (perhaps both!).  My therapist is a big fan of the harm reduction method of dealing with substance use.  Yes, I know that any smoking at all is bad for me, but so is completely losing my mind and raging: it’s a balance.

Does anyone have any thoughts regarding my plan or any additional tips that may be helpful?  I’ve been smoking since I was a teenager (now 51) so it’s a deeply ingrained habit.

Then today Sunday I have been looking forward too because I was finally going to see my FwB that I haven’t seen in quite some time and I really like him/fallen for him. And even more excitement was besides just hooking up he invited me to AX throwing so I just felt so giddy but he informed me tonight that he had to cancel due to something about his ex/custody issues. So here I am completely broken in every way and tired to keep living. I really can’t keep trying/going. I need to get off of this ride called life…. 😞",1679211924.0

I remember maybe when I was 7 I would be confused as to if music was actually playing.

It doesn't happen too often, but it's peculiar when it does. I became more consciously aware of this when I was maybe 13. I remember being restless because I could hear music, but it was too clear for it to be real. I went outside my bed and didn't hear anything.

I was talking to my psychiatrist maybe 2 days ago about it. If you want you can take a quick scroll through my post history, but basically

1. Got sexually harassed badly from a supervisor. He told told me sexual things about my body and told me he liked sliding in and coming inside

2. When I reported it, the manager cut my hours to zero. I have to pay for rent and food, not to mention how it felt to muster up the courage to report it, and then right face retaliation. I've never experienced this kind of devastation before. I can't even describe how painful the act of retaliation in itself was. I was aware I might not be believed, but I didn't think I'd get punished.

So I told my psychiatrist about it and almost cried. I'm still processing this information, and I'm struggling. I really am.

Sometimes it's music playing. More often, actual music will be playing, and I hear an actual person singing along with the song, but they aren't. It's the most bizzare thing. I have to stare at their lips, and they won't be moving. But I hear their singing very clearly.

Has anything like this happened to others before?

But, thank God for meds. I've dipped in and out of suicidal fantasy because of it, but overall, it's been ok. I still have panic attacks when my throat closes up and I have to step away to cough it out and/or drink water. But again, thank God for meds.

I am far from a inspirational speaker but I wanted to just hop on and say that when it comes to my BiPD I feel I am a much stronger person because of it. I grew up with a mom who likely had the disorder as well but took the path to meth as her escape and my dad was always working and never there. 

I grew up on my own and didn't find out I had the disorder till I was in my late teens. I wasn't able to go to college and I struggled to find work that was a fit and take care of myself for a bit but now I am happy to say I found the best job and make more money without a degree than most.

This IS NOT me bragging, I say all of this to show that I think we all forget sometimes that while having this disorder is a struggle it can teach us a lot of lessons. It also allows many of us to think differently and that can be a benefit. The problem is finding a way to get to stability to be able to use it in a way that doesn't make us self-destruct. I know it's hard (understatement of the year), and everyone has to find thier own path because it is definitely not one size fits all. I hope anyone who sees this knows there is hope, it's the small wins that keep it alive. Small ones lead to larger ripples in life.

Hello people,

I am writing to you because I need help.

Please excuse me first of all because English is not my first language.

I am desperate, I am destroyed.

I am bipolar and borderline.

I am in a relationship with someone who was perfect for me at first and has since neglected me, disrespected me, ignored me, and blamed me for everything because of my disorder.

Before I met him, I had managed to rebuild myself, to go back to work after a 2.5 year break (I was diagnosed in 2019).

Since then, I have been living in hell.

He lived far away from me (950km/690miles) and we tried life together but that's when my disorder revealed itself.

He was constantly on the computer, talking down to me, having horrible outbursts and insulting me.

He even threatened to kill himself and jump off my balcony and I tried to hold him back and that's when I had my first ""boderline"" crisis where I started screaming in pain and wanting to end my life.

I called him parents to warn them of his actions and when they called, my boyfriend said everything was fine while I was crying in the back and they could hear me.

A lot of things happened and I asked him to go home (he lives with his parents).

Since then, it's been hot and cold between us.

One day I'm ""his Queen"", the next day he barely pays attention to me and when I criticize him for not even asking if I'm okay, he says ""because you think I'm your knight in shining armor?"" when for me it's the minimum for any social contact.

You should know that from the beginning of our relationship, I was threatened with a knife by one of his family members and insulted and while we were abroad in a remote place I didn't know.

His family consults a lot of medieums, psychics, card readers and all of them say that I am the devil and not made for their son while I have never shown anything but goodness, kindness and compassion despite what they made me go through (recently, I learned that they would be persuaded that I raped their son and that my first goal is to ""kill him"" while I have never raised my hand on someone).

They even told me while her sister wanted hut me with the knife that it was ok because ""the devil is INSIDE HER' and so it means that it's not her fault and they didn't event ask if I was fine once ?!

Last week was the worst of all, I hurt myself, I hit my head multiple times during his present and I tore my face off + hit myself with an alter because I heard his parents on the phone saying again that I was going to kill him and he did nothing to stop it and instead he left when I could have killed myself.

I am stuck in this relationship, I don't know how to get out of it.

I feel like I can't see any way out because I feel like no one will want me because I'm ""crazy"" and I don't want to live with someone like him, nor do I want to start a family with him because of the principles he may have and his family (I can't tell you everything, but the story of the knife already tells you a lot)

I need help, my caregivers don't tell me anything, they listen to me and that's it.

No one understands me.

The more I talked to him about my illness and how to help me if I was neglected, the more he did nothing.

When we lived together and he insulted me, I took it upon myself at first and went to him with a big smile and hugged him as he pushed me hard and said ""YOU DISGUST ME!"" to then tell me ""sorry, I love you more than anything, you can't even imagine, I will never leave you alone again, I will do the work for both of us as you have done for the past 7 months, everything it's over I'm not going to abandon you anymore, it's up to me to make sure that you become again the one you were before my family and I broke you"" then suddenly it's ""you're responsible for everything, it's is because you are hypersensitive""

His family hates me because I'm ""too pretty, too nice, too cuddly to be true"" when I'm just me!

I can't take it anymore, yesterday and this morning I wanted to end it, I can't tell myself that I'm going to get out of this, I can't tell myself that I'm going to manage to escape of him because I'm hooked in spite of myself and I don't know why because we no longer live together and it's a daily suffering.

He's h24 on his computer, he just plays, he has nothing to talk about, we don't share anything anymore (he was different at first, it was amazing then he showed his face when he moved in with me).

I just asked him again if we could call because I need help because I'm in pain, I'm taking xanax for the first time in my life in addition to my usual treatments when I've always managed to do without (and even with that, it doesn't work)

I'm begging you, help me, advise me, I don't know, but I need help from people who understand me.  
Thank you very much",1679175188.0

https://neurosciencenews.com/high-protein-diet-depression-22760/

""A new study that focused on nutrition and mental health of adolescent athletes found an association between high protein consumption and a decrease in symptoms of depression.""

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19841581/

""The indicator amino acid oxidation-based requirement values of 0.93 and 1.2 g protein/kg/day and the reanalysis of existing nitrogen balance studies are significantly higher than current recommendations. Therefore, there is an urgent need to reassess recommendations for protein intake in adult humans.""

https://examine.com/guides/protein-intake/#references

""higher protein intakes increase satiety, which is particularly helpful if you’re trying to cut calories as part of a weight-loss diet""


https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-much-protein-do-you-need-every-day-201506188096

""The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein is a modest 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. The RDA is the amount of a nutrient you need to meet your basic nutritional requirements. In a sense, it’s the minimum amount you need to keep from getting sick — not the specific amount you are supposed to eat every day.""

As you can see, making sure you eat enough protein improves depression symptoms, helps weight loss (but is not a panacea) which we struggle with, and is generally deemed to be safe. 

The mainstay advice is *at least* 0.8g protein per kg bodyweight. It is generally recommended to get this protein from plant sources and also engage in physical activity.",1679148982.0

I (f25) was diagnosed in mid 2021, but never categorized in 1 or 2. I was doing therapy (combo biofeedback with the intent to get to emdr) for a few months and taking 200mg lamotrigine and 10mg Lexapro, but I haven't been to therapy in months because of distance and cost, and I've been off my meds for months because the lamoteigine (I think) was causing me sleep problems. 

I work 9 hr days and 6 days a week most weeks while also helping my husband (35m) with his online business (usually don't get home most nights until 9:30). Here's where my problems start.

My husband wants sex a lot. When we first got together, we had sex every day for like a year. Then it started to slow some but was never really an issue. Now we have sex maybe once a week and it's putting a strain on our marriage. He feels like I don't love him or want him or want to be around him anymore. None of those are true and in my mind I have valid reasons for not wanting to have sex when he initiates. I have the kyleena IUD so I get some pretty painful cramps sometimes, or I'm tired, or it's late when we get home and I have to be at work a 6 am. Recently an additional pronlem is that I've become self-conscious about how I look again. He says I don't initiate enough or respond when he tries to get me in the mood. I tried to explain to him my reasons but he said I'm making it sound like a chore, and sometimes it does feel that way until I'm actually in the act and enjoying  it.

yes 
no 
sure 
i realized then and remembered what happened. i texted her to ask if i could call her tomorrow and she said “sure” that was like 3-7 days ago though. i’m not sure whether to call her text her or even address this situation. if i did address it how would i, would i call her, text her, or??? this is just a very hard situation and idk what to do. please help me",1679165127.0
330,Bipolar Disorder type II is compromising my relationship and I feel beleaguered. How do others navigate relationships while undermedicated/still finding out which meds work for them?,2,11uumnt,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11uumnt/bipolar_disorder_type_ii_is_compromising_my/,5,"I have recently moved in with my partner from across the nation. We had known each other for a long time since we were in the same community-focused nonprofit organization. We had spent a substantial time building an intimate rapport with each other and we began to fully believe we were madly in love with each other. Unfortunately when I moved in the true depth of my mental unwellness quickly forced its way to the surface. My bipolar disorder shares a dangerous comorbidity with various other mental injuries to include combat PTSD from my time in the Marine Corps, community trauma from being raised in poverty, and general childhood trauma which has resulted in an additional major depressive disorder diagnosis. 

My mood cycles rapidly as in several times in one day rapidly. The resulting agitation fills my head with various examples of why the relationship will never work despite her initial fervor to cater to my every need. Now she’s exhausted, beleaguered, and on the precipice of lapsing back into previous trauma behavior—she has PTSD from witnessing her ex-fiancée shoot himself in the head right in front of her. I have become the single most stressful thing in her life and I’ve repeatedly attempted to leave the relationship as a result but she would refuse to let me leave. 

I’m exhausted and I have a maelstrom of dark thoughts swirling through my head. Our relationship has devolved into resentment, petty squabbles, and she no longer has the energy to convince me to stay when I feel compelled to flee from the relationship even though she states she still wants me to stay even if she doesn’t have the energy to stop me from leaving. I can’t seek solace in my partner because we have become a point of contention in each others’ lives and if I keep venting to my best friend she’ll begin to grow resentful of my partner for being what she may perceive as unhealthy for me even though I share a large portion of the blame for causing our relationship to devolve to this point.  She constantly states how she needs support and cannot withstand the capricious nature of my mood swings on her own which breaks my heart to hear because now I’m fully convinced that I am far too much more trouble than I’m worth and that I am no where near at a point in my mental health recovery to be a healthy boyfriend.

Now this is where my question comes in:  I started on latuda 20 in early feb (which seemed to work for like 3 days a week in then stop).  Then Feb 22 I got upped to 40 (as well as wellbutrin being doubled from 150-300 o_O).  Now since last week (almost exactly 2 weeks after upping the two), the pattern has started doing something extra weird....


Now, instead of just going up-down-up-down like it was before, there's a day ""break"" between the solid up and down ... and it's not euthymia it's like a funky mixed thing going on where it rapidly switches back and forth between lighter versions of both sides, with each side ranging anywhere from a couple minutes to an hour.  Then it switches into a 'full state' for a day to continue the cycle (usually it goes in order but it doesn't always).

So my question is ... I really can't understand exactly what this means ... does this mean it's getting better or worse?  I'm trying to figure out if maybe the med changes are in the right direction or if this is actually worsening ... in some ways I'd say better (since the number of 'full' cycles is technically slowed a little) but for more obvious reasons it may be worse.  Also, these bouncy days are pretty obnoxious when it comes to doing things like work because I can't actually maintain a flow since it keeps changing on me.


Has anyone had any sorta situation like this before?  Do you think this is a path toward better, or is it actually getting worse?  I would think a question like that would be obvious but ... it isn't for this o_O",1679113761.0
357,Why do negative social interactions give me such existential dread? How to cope?,5,11ufemf,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11ufemf/why_do_negative_social_interactions_give_me_such/,0,"I’m posting here because I’m technically diagnosed as bipolar and I suspect it could potentially be related in the form of overthinking.

Overall I’ve had pretty stable mental health since I graduated college and started working. College was hell and now I occasionally get hypomanic but nothing extreme. Even less frequently do I ever feel depressed. All without meds (has bad side effects, didn’t really help, felt like it kept me in a “sick” mindset but I digress). So I think I’m doing great overall. I feel privileged in that way.

But something I still struggle with is this feeling of existential dread I get when I mistake a mistake, am wrong, or am just being trolled.

I have many examples, but one today was someone on an academic subreddit telling me I’m wrong about something and implied I’m an idiot that doesn’t know what I’m talking about. All when this person couldn’t refute what I was saying and was generally being a d*ck focused on me being wrong instead of trying to discuss as a community.

Others have been related to feeling secluded in my field of work because I research a type of illness our product exacerbates to find preventative measures. So sometimes I have to trigger people and if I try to find colleagues to talk to “it could harm the business” which my boss is annoyed about (not violating any NDAs)

But I digress.

Basically, anytime I get shut down by someone one way or another, I have thoughts of just not wanting to continue on. Just being unable to cope with other people. 

I don’t perceive them as being s*icidal, like I wouldn’t act on it or plan or anything. But just a feeling of anxiety and fear from making social mistakes (like fearing being canceled for a misunderstanding). I just feel like I don’t know how to move on. Then I think my hypomania kicks that overthinking into overdrive.

All until I sleep and wake up the next day. Usually, but not always. Sometimes it does lead to dysthymia or depression.

I’ve never really had a lot of friends. I’m married in a great relationship with great (international) in-laws but I don’t have regular friends I hang out with (mostly friendships of convenience, like classmates) nor do I have a good family. I guess I generally feel like I don’t really have people to support me.

Despite being able to get by in most social situations fine, I don’t have a real social life and always feel lacking or like I know how to talk to people in personal.

I know both those things contribute to the impulse of money spending. I am still in college and my parents give me money for necessities (groceries, therapy, gas money to visit home). I DID have a regular job, but I quit because of how toxic the workplace was. I babysit pretty regularly and I am in the running for a job as a ghost tour guide, so it’s not like I CAN’T afford frivolous things, but I do feel bad about not having basically any money in my savings ($20 to my name right now! It’s insane)

I am no longer someone who buys clothes just because I like them, but I did go up a few sizes due to medication increase and diet change so I’ve been having to replace a lot of my old clothes. I always shop at goodwill though and lately I haven’t had to buy that much. I don’t buy house decor anymore since I am definitely fulfilled in that aspect. I only buy art supplies when my current ones are totally out of use.

I think I impulse buy fast food or even restaurant food super easily when I can just cook it or use my meal plan at school. I only have to pay $1k-2k per year at school due to scholarships and financial aid, but it’s still a big chunk (my parents now pay half ever since I quit my job). My biggest vice, however, is legos. I buy so many legos, especially when I’m feeling anxious. They’re a super efficient distraction and a really engaging hobby. Even my parents support it because they see how it calms me and makes me happy. But my issue is that whenever I get any sort of significant money I immediately go to buy legos. I don’t know how to stop or budget or anything or put any of it into a savings account without just taking it right back out. It’s like every other week at this point.

I met someone I shouldn’t have trusted and helped him buy a car. Luckily I was able to sell it, but I also bought myself a new car I didn’t need. I am now 10k underwater in a car loan and had to move back in with my parents. I am close to 30 years old. My professional career is destroyed and I lost most of my friendships. The ones I still have now keep me at a distance due to my behaviors. Everyone says that they “didn’t recognize me at all during this time” and I am ashamed.

My hypomanic episodes always start lightly - actually eating properly, cleaning the entire house, talking to people, etc. and people will “congratulate me” (“you finally got up/cleaned the mess you live in”) and are all happy that I’m somehow fine and cured now. 

Then it gets worse and I’ll start to get angry easily, hit stuff, yell at people over the smallest things, get drunk or high with anything close by. I’ll do illegal shit, steal stuff or try to harm myself either by relapsing, staying awake until passing out or straight up attempting suicide because why not. 
And everyone blames me for it. In their eyes I am choosing to destroy the supposed progress from my depressive episodes; “Why would you do that to yourself?” and “I thought you were doing better.” No, I’m fucking not.

It’s dumb I know it shouldn’t make me so angry but I hate that no one around me is capable of grasping the fact that I’ll always be sick- that it’s not something that will just leave.

This disease is so much more nuanced than the typical ""extreme ups and downs"" description it usually receives. I have survived two absolutely devastating depressions, and approximately twenty manic episodes. 
Attempting to describe what mania is like is the worst frustration. It happens gradually and then comes upon me like a brick to the face. First I stop sleeping, then the creativity comes. The blank page beckons to me the way freshly baked bread might entice the starving. It is soft at first, subtle even, but the persistent pen-to-page prevails and soon I am unable to make sense of, or even put into context, the hasty and paranoid puzzle of words. Grandiosity accompanies the writing, then the delusions come, and I believe that this puzzle of words is worthy of a Pulitzer. Other things happen too; reckless driving, substance use, rage, impulsivity, irrationality.... Ultimately I surrender to complete psychosis. Saying it is ""a lot"" is an understatement. 
I have destroyed and lost relationships with family members and friends because of this illness. I have said and done unforgivable things. But it is my deepest wish that people understand that becoming manic is not a choice, it has happened to me whilst on medication and off alike. I would never choose it. 
I'm simply reflecting on all of this today because earlier I read this: Bipolar disorder results in 9.2 years reduction in expected life span, and as many as one in five patients with bipolar disorder completes suicide. (National Institute of Mental Health).
That's the reality. It's my reality. I do not want to ever become a statistic and I want to live as full a life as possible.
Here is what I'm grateful for: I have an incredible support network. I have doctors and therapy. I have the most loving and supportive family and friends, ones who are able to look beyond my illness and recognize that I am not ""me"" in those manic moments. 
And I am grateful for the ability to empathize with all those who struggle.  We can do together what we could never do alone.",1679058621.0

this made me analyze my behaviors and realize when i was manic. 

movies and shows make mania seem fun. it makes it seem like a drug. it can be fun. it can be euphoric. but it’s usually so unbelievably painful. it’s excoriating. 

when i told my friends i was probably bipolar they didn’t really bat an eye, they saw me being reckless and doing risky things and they thought it was fun. 

mania is so much anger. it’s such a deep anger, i can’t explain it and i’ve realized that’s a symptom and not everyone feels it. it’s such a trip. all the things i thought were normal were probably symptoms. 

my friends thought mania was fun, they saw movies of people going out and doing drugs, they saw me going out and doing drugs but when i explained what it’s like they were terrified. and they should be. this isn’t fun. 

bipolar isn’t fun. mania needs to stop being romanticized. your perception of reality shifts, you’re angry, and even more angry that no one can help you. you do reckless things because you just don’t care. you’re filled with so much self hatred and if the consequence isn’t immediate death than it doesn’t matter. 

it’s not fun. i can’t explain how un fun it is. it’s so unstable, you can’t control your emotions, it’s constantly changing. 

it reminds me of Vampire Diaries. when they’re in transition their emotions are magnified. it can be fun but they’re usually a mess, hurting themselves, being destructive, drinking, hating themselves. 

i’m not sure why i made this post. i feel cheated kind of? everyone makes mania seem so fun and crazy and like a movie but it’s scary.",1679031691.0

The dark flashes (not the actual real moving stuff) would always leave me disturbed, but I always just freezed in shock and then I was able to rationalise it and calm down.
However, this week I was laying in bed with my partner and when I turned my face to the wall, in the shadow I saw a dark moving shape, like an animal or a black blob of darkness, crawling into the bed. My body immediately started screaming to the point of throat hurting afterwards, I was extremely terrified and scared about our safety.

After telling my psych the updates she thinks it’s that I’m “not absorbing latuda effectively with my GI symptoms” I don’t think I fully understand what she means. She also suggested that I switch to Zyprexa / olanzapine instead of the latuda. 

I messaged my therapist today hoping for something else I guess and all she asked was if I started the zyprexa.

I was recently diagnosed bipolar 1 but am sitting in the tattered remains of my life, wondering how I could have believed what I did.

I first felt symptoms of mania and intense narcissism this summer (I’m 28 yrs old). I had recently gone through a breakup with my partner of 6 years, had fallen in love with my female best friend (first queer experience) and she did not reciprocate my feelings, and my workload had become incredibly overwhelming.

I started losing weight and hair, had a stress rash on my body and was experiencing fluctuating feelings between paranoia to believing the universe was speaking to me directly.

But theres a delusion I am struggling with the most, that has left me feeling horrid and unforgivable. I believed my wonderful boss of 3 years had emotionally abused me, and was the reason I was experiencing mania and psychosis. I believed this so hard I convinced myself and my therapist/psychiatrist I had PTSD, and that my boss and workplace were all to blame. I told so many people this was what happened to me, because I truly believed it. I blocked my boss on everything and didn’t talk to her for 6 months.

This January I finally looked back at the texts that I thought “proved” I was abused, and found nothing but support and concern from a woman who never did anything but treat me with respect.

How the hell does this happen? Has anyone ever experienced anything similar? Honestly I’ve been feeling suicidal since the realization- I got fired from my job for other mistakes I made while manic, but I don’t know how to tell I everyone I talked to that what I believed for the last 6 months was a total lie.

This post could be triggering to others with imposter syndrome, so I want to start off by saying that these are my own anxieties, my goal here is to know if anyone else has felt this way and if they've been able to circumvent it.  


I was officially diagnosed with BP2 by my psychiatrist in the fall, but had previously been diagnosed with a general mood disorder and major depressive disorder, and a suggestion of cyclothymia from a therapist. Bipolar 2 makes sense to me, it tracks with situations and periods of my life where I was feeling unnaturally confident and ""fun"" in a dangerous way, and more often, the periods where I've been unable to get out of bed or the house for weeks.   


Still, I have this weird fear of learning more about Bipolar Disorder, because there's a part of me that fears that if I read about it in-depth, I might start mirroring symptoms that I don't usually experience. Sometimes this includes even browsing or participating in this sub and r/bipolar2.

I think being medicated with varied success also plays into that, but I also think that's just a common bipolar experience: you find good meds and then you wonder if you're even bipolar. I feel that way when they work, but I keep on taking them. And then I will have breakthrough depression after years of being more stable on meds, and I wonder if it's a sign that I have something else wrong with me.

Where the Squibberpops squibbered, and the Flobberjops flew,
A creature named Zeebie lived high in a tree,
Where it twisted and twined in a squiggly spree.

Now Zeebie was special, you see, my dear friend,
For the way he would feel seemed to twist and to bend.
Sometimes Zeebie would zip and would zoom,
Like a rocket ship blasting straight past the moon!

""I'm on top of the world!"" he'd exclaim with great cheer,
Bouncing high on the clouds, without any fear.
He'd giggle and wiggle and dance all day long,
Singing sweet Zeebie songs in a voice loud and strong.

But there were days when Zeebie felt quite the opposite,
His energy vanished, as if swallowed by a Glopit.
He'd mope and he'd grope for the light in the dark,
His once-sparkling eyes now a mere flickering spark.

The creatures of Whippety-Woo began to see,
That Zeebie's behavior was not as it should be.
They'd all gather 'round, full of worry and care,
But their words couldn't lift him from his deepest despair.

One day, as Zeebie lay down in the shade,
A wise Flippety-Flop hopped along and displayed,
A great book of wisdom, with secrets so grand,
It could help Zeebie balance and finally understand.

""You see, my dear Zeebie,"" the Flippety-Flop said,
""It seems that your feelings are not in your head.
A thing called Bipolar has made you this way,
But I'm here to help, so please don't dismay!""

The Flippety-Flop opened the book with a grin,
And as they read, Zeebie's eyes widened within.
He learned of the ups, of the downs, and the swings,
And how he could manage these challenging things.

""Take time for yourself, dear Zeebie,"" it said,
""Find comfort in quiet, and rest your sweet head.
When you're feeling quite high, try to harness your glee,
And channel your energy through art, dance, or a spree.""

""And when you're feeling quite low, in a pit of despair,
Please remember, dear Zeebie, that we'll all still be there.
Reach out to a friend or a Whippety-Woo,
For they'll help you get through, and they'll see you pull through.""

As Zeebie absorbed these new lessons so wise,
He wiped away tears that welled up in his eyes.
The Flippety-Flop smiled and patted his back,
Then hopped off into the sunset, his bag tightly packed.

With new tools in hand, Zeebie set out to try,
To find balance and peace beneath the bright sky.
He'd still have his ups, and he'd still have his downs,
But he knew that his friends in the Whippety-Woo town, Would always stand by him, through thick and through thin, No matter how high or how low he'd begin.
For Zeebie was loved, and he'd always be so,
A creature with feelings, and a heart that would grow.

So remember, dear reader, this story so true,
When life gets you down, or your feelings construe.
There's always a way to find balance and peace,
In a world full of love, where friendships won't cease.

Ive been diagnosed bp 2 a year ago and since medicated, found a combo that works for me since november 22. Before that it was either really depressed and a bit of mixed and latest major hypomanic episode in summer 2021. 

So it had been a while and the thing is, I'm still very slow and sleep a lot, but compared to before when I slept 10-12 hours a night every 24h now I still sleep 10-12h but  I stay awake 24h+ multiple times a week.

Last friday I went to my psychiatrist and he asked me if I had any hints of impulsivity that could indicate hypomania, specifically spznding, sex and substance abuse (ya know the usual menu).
And I thought about it for a moment (in retrospect I was making up excuses that would make things logical) and then said no, just spending but for necessary stuff.

And here I am exactly a week later, wearing one of my two new wigs that arrived from aliexpress yesterday (I had only bought one super cheap one before), been smoking weed since monday and unpacking my new dildo in my newly fairyland garden themed decorated kitchen. Oh also received 150 bucks worth of beauty products (I've never done skincare before in my life except sheet masks and face creams from aldi).
For clarification I bought it all before seeing my psychiatrist and smoking again.

Things have been REALLY rough for the past six months or so for me, including getting my bipolar II diagnosis about 3 months ago. I’m still trying to understand it and wasn’t even really sure I actually was bipolar. I also was on Vyvanse for ADHD and being without that has been tough.

I just had my first psychiatry appointment in three months with a new doctor since my regular doctor is out on leave, and I was really curious to see if he would agree with my doctors diagnosis, and he did. Previously, I have been on Celexa, Cymbalta, Lexapro, Abilify, Lamictal, Vraylar, Prozac, and Pristiq with little luck. This doctor is starting me on Caplyta which initially I was worried about being very expensive with my new insurance. I called the pharmacy today and it is only 15 dollars a month! I’m really hopeful that this will actually work for me, and I’d be curious to hear what other people’s experience on Caplyta has been like.

He also wants to wait to start me up again on a stimulant for ADHD since they can be very activating for someone with bipolar.

Back when I took Seroquel, the out-of-pocket rate was about $700, with insurance $280, and with GoodRx $20. 

Medication costs have absolutely gone through the roof, even with employer plans. But for meds that offer generic, the cost is ridiculously less expensive with the app!

Mom’s oncologist prescribed her an anti-nausea medication, and I texted him to ask if there was a less expensive option considering CVS wanted to charge me $220 for a month’s supply. He was livid! He said CVS had been charging the old-brand name price for the generic for not only that med, but several others that his patients had informed him of. He advised me to download the GoodRx app, and I paid $10.

-thought I was an Aztec chased by jaguars and loved the feeling of fighting for my life. It was exhilarating. 

-thought the Starbucks mermaid lady was laughing at me and that walls were moving. Also heard some voices.

-walked through puddles in the rain and got my clothes and shoes sopping wet because I thought I’d be reincarnated as a mentally healthy person

-saw cameras where there were none 

-thought people on the bus were plotting to kill me 

-thought an escalator was gonna eat me

-kept dissociating 

-pretended to eat my fingers like they were chicken tenders, looked in the mirror and thought my mouth was full with my fingers and laughed at myself, then I was horrified.

-in my head was thinking “I must grab the skin and scooped it out” and realized I was picking at my face and stopped myself 

-overall I was unstable for around 2 weeks

-was incredibly depressed for around a month afterwards 

But I was able to reality check. I was very agitated but I worked okay and hid the symptoms successfully and let myself enter the other world when I was alone. I don’t remember how sleep went but it wasn’t bad. I took myself to the hospital when I almost walked into traffic bc I was dissociating badly and terrified by the mix of suicidal/self-destructive thoughts and intense glee.

I have been seeing the same therapist for almost two months now. While I think we are working well together, I am getting the feeling that I am repeating myself every session. 

I just can't help but overthink my whole life. This tends to obsessively question my career, constant negative self talk, and occasional suicidal ideation (although I could never take action, so its mostly more self torture).  I'm eating maybe 1 to 2 meals a day, inconsistently showering, never doing laundry, and so lethargic that I mostly just lay down and watch tv/YouTube whenever I get home from work. I don't take walks, I don't try to think positively, I don't really exercise, I don't practice gratefulness, etc etc. I feel like a loser, but the thing is...I don't make any effort to change or feel better.

My therapist keeps clearly telling me this rumination is simply not beneficial. I know this is true, but it feels impossible to stop. I can't feel better without taking action (again, total agreement with my therapist), but taking action is so hard. Its getting to the point where I am thinking I am comfy in my misery. I no longer have hypomanic phases thanks to medication, but at least when I was hypomanic I was putting in effort to better myself. This nonstop depression is so consistent, I am beginning to hypothesize that its not really depression, but me continuously self sabotaging myself and always blaming it on something external.

Can anyone relate? Would you say this is just more negative rumination or overthinking? If not, how does one shake the refusal to take action for their own sake?",1678990490.0

I just want to come to terms with it. I don't know what my abilities are, how smart I am anymore. I'm certainly not capable of any kind of degree or a job anymore. I can't learn a trade or skill. I couldn't be an electrician or an engineer or a programmer or a writer.

All I want, more than anything, is a purpose. I would take a job even if I wasn't paid. I can't volunteer though. I'm simply not smart enough anymore. I'm dumber than a rock now.

463,Manic for 6 months ending up in jail where I had a suicide attempt.,6,11t9ixl,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11t9ixl/manic_for_6_months_ending_up_in_jail_where_i_had/,3,"38m.  February 2022, I finalized my divorce.  I had been trapped in a dysfunctional marriage for 7 years.  During those years, I was incredibly stable, but incredibly over medicated.  Towards the end when things were at their worst, I was alone self medicating with alcohol.  During those years, I was on Venlafaxine, Seroquel, and Lamotragine.

In February, with a fresh start to life, I started exercising and eating better.   I stayed away from my phone and computer, and I would go out and socialize.  I started looking better and feeling better.  Knowing the side effects of the meds, I started tweaking the dosages.  Seroquel in particular is incredibly sedating, so I thought I could go down a natural route, managing my bipolar with healthy stress management.  I saw improvements.  I had more energy, my rest was better.  I kept lowering the dosages and kept seeing improvements with my mood and energy.  I was aware of the risk of mania, so I was very acute in getting enough sleep, and if I needed to, I would use seroquel more as a PRN.

Fast forward to June, and this slope lead me to a path where I was completely off all medication.  I was making strides in all areas of my life.  In particular, my relationship with my daughter.  We were having a blast and an incredible start to the  summer with my motivation and optimism for life.  All while this was happening, I was keeping watch on my mania, never denying that it could pop up at some point.

It would be about when July hit that the first occurrences of mania became apparent in retrospect but wasn't obvious or out of control at the time.  It was the beginnings of losing touch with reality.  Passing interactions with other people, I would sometimes get a hint that I had a larger purpose.  But they were fleeting and rare, so I didn't take notice.

By the end of July, I was semi-regularly battling against these thoughts that the strangers I would come across would be part of a conspiracy, and that there was some purpose behind their being there.  I was in conflict with myself.  90% of me didn't believe it, and thought it was ridiculous, 9% thought that it was my duty to be humble with getting recognition and attention, and 1% was feeding into the delusion.

By the end of August, I was getting exhausted with the notion of being at the center of everything.  I hated the idea that I had to be studied, admired, and protected.  I ""knew"" that something was happening on the outside world, and I didn't know if I was seen as a reconciler of religion, science, and all cultures.  I was seen as the person to bring the whole world together and the inspiration of a movement that could potentially solve any problem.  It was seen as the opportunity for aliens to finally make their presence known.

By the end of September, I knew there were reasons that ""the movement"" couldn't directly come to light to me, and I being in a sort of partnership with the movement, I started giving my personal belongings away.  I would donate my clothes, my coin collection, my golf clubs, my old baseball glove, and most of my other stuff.  It was my belief that each item would go to a person in need, and every item would be cherished by someone.  I sort of expected to get something in return, but never did of course.  Or if I did, I stole it thinking I was meant to steal it.  I was also writing and doing art at this point, which I was also leaving behind on purpose in public places.

When October rolled around, I quit my job because when the world was following me, I saw my job as a way for me to feel normal for a while.  I didn't want to give up my old life, but I had a higher calling.  It would have been around October 24th when I was completely exhausted from all of this.  I couldn't handle the pressure.  I couldn't handle the fact that most of me still didn't believe this shit, but that brainwashing-propaganda-part-of-the-brain that kept feeding me these thoughts, I was exhausted fighting that all those months.

I had the idea to go find some weed.  I never smoked it before in my life.  So, I went to a vape store and asked if they had anything that could get me high.  They gave me a canister and a battery.  I didn't look at it or do any research because with everything being planted and all information to my phone being filtered, there was no point.  I went home, and smoked it.  I went into a panic immediately.  Thinking I was going to die, I called an ambulance.  They came but they didn't seem too concerned when they got here.  I was getting frustrated because they weren't taking this ""emergency"" seriously.

I was out of my mind psychotic.  I fell to the floor ""devolving"" from a human to a werewolf, to smaller and smaller mammals up to and including being a microorganism.  I remember ""going offline"" and coming back online a few times.  I remember seeing a coordinate graph where the line kept splicing off the edge, and it felt like I kept dying.   It felt like I was shedding timelines where I actually died there, but I kept surviving in this one.  I remember being in the bed in the ambulance with the EMT, and he would turn from male to female, and I wrestled with the idea of ""male"" and ""female"" at the most abstract level (almost like properties of the universe).  I remember re-living my life organized in different ways, and coming back to the EMT each time, thinking that this is the infinite cycle of existence.  I have only small fragments after that, but apparently I had a ""freak out"" moment in the hospital, and they saw it as me being aggressive to one of the personnel.  I was arrested, handcuffed, and brought to jail, charged with a felony, simple assault on emergency personnel.

In jail, my parents were not willing to bail me out without being on meds.  The jail system here is completely dysfunctional, and there's basically no mental health support, so there was no way for me to get on my meds.  After about 3 days living in an open dorm situation, the other inmates took notice of my behavior and obvious mental health issues.  They're bored and destructive people, so they preyed on my mental weakness, and I stayed strong as best I could.  I can't go into every thought I had, but there was a night that I thought my family was kidnapped and were being tortured and murdered one by one.  The inmates were feeding the thoughts, and when it got to my daughter, I couldn't hear anymore.  I went into the bathroom, got as high as I could (about 8 feet), jumped, and pushed off the ceiling trying to land my head on the concrete.  I didn't lean back far enough and landed on my spine.  The pain was intense and I threw up the shampoo, soap, and cleaner that I drank about an hour earlier.  I shit my pants and was writhing in pain.  The officers rushed in to check things out.  I pleaded for them to shoot me telling them it will save my daughter.  I kept begging them to do it.  They told me to get up.  Walking to suicide isolation, I felt reassured that what I did put an end to them murdering my family.  I was in suicide watch for 20 days, which, if someone weren't suicidal, would make someone.  I had no clothes but a velcro towel, and I had to shit in a hole and smash the turd down with my foot so it would go through the bars.  I couldn't have more than a few squares of toilet paper.  Nothing to read.  My bed was the concrete.  I'm not complaining because it is what it is.  It's jail and I was there.  But what was the worst part is the back pain lying on the concrete.  No position felt good, it was simply finding the least painful position and last as long as I could before that became too much, and just keep shuffling to find something that's tolerable for just a moment.

After 28 days, there were enough people who got involved that I was finally able to get released on bail with a treatment order.  I got back on my meds, and I've been on them since.  I've slipped into a real bad depression.  The charges were dropped 10 days ago.  I'm resuming my job search (it's impossible to find a job with 'assault' on your record).  The arrest itself can still be found if an employer does a certain background check, but nothing I can do about that.  I slipped into drinking semi-regularly, but I've pulled out of that the last 2 weeks.  All in all, I'm holding on by a thread, but there is hope.

Oh, I forgot that the night of the incident.  I had all my money, $20k dollars in cash, stolen from my apartment.  I have no proof, but my intuition tells me that one of the officers took it when they were searching my apartment.",1679008218.0

I messed up, and there was an order I did not place by mistake, I forgot about it, and I even forgot what I had spoken to this particular client about. I was sure he remembered who I was, and i was terrified of looking like a dumbass and him asking for a supervisor bc this is the kind of person he is.

They did not seem thrilled that I asked for help and  didn't even get a confirmation on whether or not they'd help. Perhaps I'm making this bigger than it is, but it was hurtful to see how unwilling they were to help me while I was panicking. I rarely ask anything of anybody bc I have learned to be self-sufficient, and bc with bipolar I have 0 friends. I'm just sad that I didn't get a smidgen of consideration and just went for it on my own. Issue is being resolved now, and after 20 minutes, my coworker has approached me to say, ""So what do I have to do?""

So I would never tell anyone at work that and broadly speaking these people are supposed to be empathetic and nice healthcare workers. So I feel like I have a pretty good idea of what people actually think of us when they don’t have to be politically correct about it cuz they know they aren’t speaking to people who will be directly hurt or offended by what they have to say. 

I’ve noticed younger people like people on tik tok or like just in general not only talk about it but put it front and center as a key piece of their identity.

I wish we didn’t live in that world but we have negative stereotypes about being late being unreliable or substance abuse issues and even though a lot of us don’t do those things often or at all. 

People who have power to dictate important parts of our lives like what jobs and opportunities we have will go with default assumptions like those and will go with the “safer pick” the person who doesn’t specify that or the one who doesn’t have that info readily available on tik tok youtube insta Facebook.

519,Meds,3,11sym40,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11sym40/meds/,1,"So I currently take 150mg SR Wellbutrin, diazepam 5mg for my panic attacks when needed (not daily), and Trazadone 100mg at night for sleep. I just got bumped to Wellbutrin 300mg XL, usually when they have bumped my Wellbutrin at first I go through 1-3 day period of agitation and then hypomania. However I love my hypomanias. I am so productive! I do things around the house again, I over achieve at my online classes and work. I am so happy during these times. But it seems after about 4 weeks with the Wellbutrin I hit a wall and go back to the depression. And the depression lasts so much longer than the hypomaina, and is more severe. I don’t go into full blow manic episodes usually but these are full on depressive states. I feel like nothing I’ve tried in the past has worked. The Wellbutrin has had the least amount of side effects. I’ve been on Celexa, Zoloft, Prozac, Paxil, and now the current. While being in the Prozac period is when I was finally hit with my diagnosis. Bipolar ll and GAD, my therapist also believes I have ADHD as well and has even discussed BPD with me! Before they thought it was just MDD after having a baby, that’s when I was put on Prozac. It actually helped for a while till I reached the highest dose and then just flatlines progress. This is when I was added mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. I was then put on Lamictal, a lot have success but let me tell you….. the worst medication ever. I couldn’t trust my own thoughts I thought I was going crazy, I wasn’t in my own head, I would be driving through my hometown and forget how to get to places which was never ever an issue. And then the Abilify was added, very low dose. And it was like nothing worked??? I’m so afraid of mood stabilizers now because no, I don’t want to get rid of my hypomania, in fact I’d love to just stay there. I had a bad experience with is what I’d expect to be one of the most well tolerated mood stabilizers…. No I don’t want lithium I don’t want to have my blood levels checked so often and I don’t want to be sedated. And no I don’t want a medication that’s going to cause weight gain as I struggle enough with self esteeem and body image issues as it is after having three kids! Idk what to do. Going to start the 300XL and see how it goes but sometimes there seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel. I don’t want to have to gain weight in order to be happy again. Because again, I’m talking sever body issues, (and tbh I’m not super overweight I’m just so insecure for other reasons and the after baby belly even though you lose weight, you still have lose skin…. Idk I am so hard on myself which is a whole separate issue) so it just seems like a recipe for disaster??? Here take sometime to stabilize you but you’ll likely gain weight which could just make you more depressed????? Ahhhhhh 😫",1678983532.0

i’ve been a “stoner” for years, but have tapered off after receiving my diagnosis and learning it was counterproductive. however, it’s still a way i unwind or work up an appetite and i’ll definitely miss the calming aspects of the ritual. with alcohol, i definitely increased my consumption with onset of symptoms, and never get to a sloppy blackout level, but i drink with dinner at a low amount whenever appropriate. i’ve also been taking ritalin for a long time as i was previously diagnosed adhd (although that’s being reevaluated now since bipolar is often first misdiagnosed as adhd), and she’s requested i drop that too because stimulants can worsen symptoms. 

i know it’s best to stop and see where it gets me. the fact that i’m irritated about stopping proves to me that it’s a good idea. in the past i’ve had issues with extreme boredom during sobriety, and i’m also worried about stopping since it has become sort of a band aid for the pain. i am worried that when i get manic, sad, or bored my resolve to stay sober will crumble. i would really appreciate tips or mantras. maybe something to replace the sort of feeling from any of those? anything is appreciated.",1678981812.0

It took a mental health nurse to see something was really wrong and she got my seen by a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with unspecified bipolar and I’ve now also been referred for an ADHD assessment. 

I don’t feel any better though. Well of course not, nothing has actually changed. I have been taking Lamictal but not feeling any positive effects yet. 

I had been told for years it’s depression, anxiety and one doctor said it sounded hormonal. I thought that I would get better. I thought that I would recover and live a healthy, normal life. I feel like I have to mourn the idea of this now. 

I’m not getting much help behind this diagnosis. They say because I’ve never been hospitalised and I manage to hold down a job and maintain relationships I don’t need it. I get it but it hurts. I feel invalidated, confused and alone.

I managed to get myself a good job at a company I could have only dreamed of working for. I am fucking it up though. I do nothing most days. I’m so consumed by what’s going on in my head whether it’s good or bad. 

I’m going to have to go back to a less demanding job which breaks my heart and I feel if leave it will trigger an episode. I’m scared I’ll impulsively quit one day too like my last 4 jobs. Maybe I’ll get fired first anyway. 

I have an amazing support system and have cut off anyone who wasn’t good for me. I’m also in a loving relationship with someone I want to spend the rest of my life with. I have to fight thoughts about sabotaging these relationships though. They’re so annoying I tell myself but actually I’m just irritable and they really care about me which can be hard to believe.

Despite everything appearing good to others, I am so chaotic. I’ve stopped pretending now when people ask me if I’m okay. I tell them no, I feel crazy. Everyone tells me I need a routine but it is impossible. 

My life on paper is great and in reality it is too to be honest. It’s boring though. I’ve gone sober too. I feel ungrateful almost. I am the problem and I am losing my mind.

(If anything I say is not allowed please let me know in a message even if you do remove the post so I can be more mindful in the future)

Kinda nervous moving forward but today I finally went to a Psych and after about an hour of talking about different thing's she settled upon one sure for diagnoses of BP2 and immediately prescribed Latuda 20mg at night during dinner. I had spoken with a therapist years ago and was on Trintellix and also tried Zoloft which did nothing but give me headaches and the other made me rage out (respectively). I found out many of the things I do in my daily life are actually Symptoms of both Mania and Depression and that I'm going through episodes of both Multiple times a day for the past 4 years that we covered.

I also have Chrons disease and I saw how it can affect weight and appetite, so I'm hopeful it can boost that as well as get my Racing thoughts, Insomnia and Hyper Productivity to a normal/manageable level. Im very leery about taking it with the experiences I've had with antipsychotics in the past, but my Dr also works with my wife who is ADHD and BP2, and I've seen how our Dr has helped her by listening to her and not just her diagnosis.

I'm on a Month trial at the 20mg so hopefully no severe side effects or medication interactions and this does what it needs to. And I apologize ahead of time to those on this Sub, I will most likely be spam reading a lot of your posts in the coming days just to understand different perspectives of this, cause I won't say I love it but I have a special thing about researching all I can about new things, especially medical.

I feel like my psychiatrist at my most recent appointment was talking to me in a way that made it feel like I was being stupid or taking myself too seriously on what my problems could be. 

I'm diagnosed with a mood disorder and my previous psychiatrist strongly suspected I may be bipolar due to the symptoms I experience. I've been open and shared a lot of my issues with my psychiatrist, but he doesn't seem to care.

What really grinded my gears though was him saying ""well I'm not sure if you really are bipolar because you don't show one of the most common symptoms which is the lack of need for sleep. And I don't mean only needing 5 or 6, I mean more like 2."" To which I had to tell him that no, I have had that back in high school most prominently. I never was diagnosed with bipolar and didn't know what it was before I started my mental health journey, so at the time I didn't think much of having little to no sleep when younger and figured it was normal to go a day or two without sleeping. 

To which he asks me ""well how did that change over the course of time?"" It's called forcing myself to get tired by mentally or physically exerting a lot and also becoming a single parent helps with getting tired a lot faster.

 I felt horrible and hurt because it felt like I had to justify to myself that I'm not crazy, that it's not normal to struggle going to bed before midnight, that feeling crazy swings back and forth isn't normal. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow and I feel like expressing to him how the psych treated me made me feel like I'm being stupid or blowing things out of proportion. I hate this and I hate feeling out of control of my own emotions most of the time, and I just want to be taken seriously. I see now why so many women struggle to get diagnosed; ""it's all in your head"" or ""that's just normal for a woman to be moody""

That being ADHD. I was on Medication for it for about eight years, until last year, when I began to feel... different.

My ADHD used to consist of hyperfixation, hyperactivity and inability to concentrate- so normal ADHD stuff, but last year before I graduated high school in May, I noticed something was changing. I assumed it was my ADHD, just evolving with new symptoms as I got older but towards Graduation time and shortly thereafter, I realized I was wrong. 

It began to get worse with huge depressive episodes, I would cry, or feeling like crying some days, and be fine the next. And I would feel worthless, like I didn't mean or contribute anything, and then have confidence that soared through the roof. I started snapping on people and then being okay the next second. 

The anger and mood swings problems got worse within the past few months. I work retail, and I've been showing attitude and anger and even hatred one moment, and then I'm super happy and energetic the next second. Even outside of work, I snap at my parents, my best friend and have constant negative emotions. I have started talking super-super fast without realizing, and feel like my thoughts are going a million miles an hour. (MY Psych mentioned this to me yesterday). 

One of the biggest things that coincides with the anger and mood swings is my impulse control and motivation. One thing I lack is impulse control, I know something is wrong, but I still choose to do it anyway. This has affected me with porn, gaming too much, and most importantly- spending. I have credit cards and I paid them off a month ago, and once again I have a huge balance on both, because I know I shouldnt be spending money, but in the moment it feels like I should. Also the lack of motivation issue is *huge*. I want to go to the gym, I want to go out and do things, but I just *can't* no matter how hard I force myself to try.

After an argument with my mom about how she's worried about me and how she knows something is wrong, I came clean and told her that I've been keeping how I've been feeling from her, my dad, sisters, and my psychiatrist and therapist. I was afraid to be on new medicine and to be diagnosed with something new. My psych told me that sometimes ADHD can evolve or even be mistaken for Bipolar, since the two share similar symptoms. I was put on Latuda yesterday, and I feel no difference yet, since it takes 3 weeks or more to do so, but I'm hopeful. And hopefully I can learn to live with this since it's a part of me now.",1678943208.0

I feel like I can't turn to anyone. My psychologist and doctor understand but damn the nights are so long, and in the day, I have to be around so many people I can't tell what's going on for me. Some professionals even don't understand me unless they know me very well. I'm a serial masker and even when I'm wanting to throw a chair through a window I'll just casually say ""I'm raging right now"" and they don't take notice lol. So some professionals don't take notice and others say things like ""I'm very alarmed"" at my behaviour. I just can't be that person I used to be anymore; exploding rage and emotion. Luckily a have professionals that see the signs clearly but talking to others can make me feel invisible.

I feel like everyone in society, the world around me, online, is watching everything I'm saying and doing, even people in cars or shop assistants. Which I know sounds ridiculous, but I feel like I can't move a muscle or say a thing, it's constant. It's even hard to post here.

It was fun with the spiritual and sensual bliss but now it's just hell. I made the mistake of having a nap before midnight and I won't sleep tonight. I got an exam today, I'll see my nurse thankfully, then my therapist, but right now I just see this long stretch of night ahead of me. The house is so quiet, I'm worried I'll see ghosts if I leave my room lol. I just feel so very alone.

College helped so much, they're very supportive there, my classmates are amazing but it's getting confusing for me there, too. My mouth is starting to get me in trouble. I feel like my world is getting smaller section by section. 

My psychologist said it was ok for me to go to a Buddhist centre for a few days as long as I don't drive there, as long as I stick to grounding meditation rather than the transendental stuff lol. So maybe that will help me a lot.

I don't even know what this post is about. It's just all crumbling down, now. I might try to switch channels in my brain rather than hyperfocusing on my phone. Have something to eat and drink. Maybe try sleep again.

I'm focusing so inwardly; thoughts, feelings, etc. I need to get out of my head and into my body. I try to do the mindfulness 5 things but I'm too paranoid about ghosts right now. I wanna listen to my headphones but can't for the same reason. I think I'm literally too afraid to leave my bed or do anything but type, and too paranoid to ring a hotline.

(i’m 19 and still live with my parents) but i was upset because she started questioning if i was drunk and said to hang up the phone but i told her i was finally happy and i don’t remember much from that night but apparently the next day my mom told me tht i got violent with her and threatened to “beat the fuck out of her” if she didn’t leave me alone. anyways, because of that night i haven’t had any access to alcohol, and i’m proud of myself for sticking to that because i would even drink at my boyfriends house and he could get me drinks if i wanted but i’ve been good with it and the only substance i put in my body is nicotine now.

i don’t want to be here anymore. im tired and angry. i have no interest in anything anymore other than sex and work because it at least distracts me.

So I am a bipolar and I haven't actually told anyone but few about my bipolarity. Anyway I believe being a bipolar affects the way I am thinking and the decisions I make according to my emotions which are instable and which will eventually lead to a feeling of regret and guilt later.

So my problem is that now while the usual and frequent depressive episodes trigger, this depressive episode is the WORST so far, I live in this paradoxical loop and cycle between my past and all these nostalgic moments I am always recalling in my mind that could make me sometimes happy but also crying because I miss these moments so much and miss the people that I don't see anymore but have been a great part in my life nevertheless left me for either no reason or with a reason that I couldn't really do anything about it, my present which is affected negatively by my nostalgia and emotions for the past and taking a great amount of time just living in the memories, living in the past and dreams instead of living in the present time, and my future which l do think about but don't care about it anymore, sometimes I used to think about my future to forget about the past but failed to do so. 

Thinking about what I could do in the future makes me a bit happy nevertheless when these nostalgic moments hit me, it just converts me from a happy person to a sad, desperate and disappointed person again that eventually lead to deep depression which cause suicidal ideation, mostly to overdose to death, but ends up with failed attempts to commit suicide. I can't even determine if these memories are good or bad by now cuz it depends as well, sometimes I just get the good parts of the memories while other times I just get the tragic parts and events that happened to me as for getting bullied recently at the university, losing my best friend, losing my boyfriend ...etc. I just believe by now that good memories are even worse and more hurtful than the bad ones. It just feels like getting stabbed in the back.

These many emotions and mixed-up thoughts I get give me a headache and usually panic attacks, that sometimes I cut myself with a nearby sharp thing as well.

I also have ADHD, social phobia and severe trust issues. I now feel so bad that I wish this world to stop and my life ends. Thinking about suicide already makes me more comfortable to end my struggle you know. So I've been asking if I am alone on this. Does anyone relate to my experience?",1678928566.0

For me it’s:
- Losing sleep, (but not quite all of it—I have an anxiety med that increases need for sleep though so that could play a role)
- Paranoia about all my friends and the world around me
- Risky decisions in terms of conversations with friends, putting myself in a physically dangerous position, and the things I put inside my body
- Hearing whispers
- Feeling like God (and being pretty good at convincing myself I am)
- Sensory issues specifically with touch
- Making boatloads of artwork (it’s my hobby)
- Over-emoting
- S*lf h*rm, but not taking time out of my day to do it, just doing a project or task and being like “I bet I can h*rt myself doing this”
- Talking a lot and having something to say about everything
- Doing tasks super rushed and poorly
- The urge for violence (verbal or physical)
- Not responding to people because I’m in a thrill of art or work
- Leaving my house at any hours during the night/day

So long story short, i’ve had 3 manic/psychotic episodes in the past year. One of them I was completely sober and still got psychosis.

my problem is i really want to smoke some fucking weed. my psychiatrist says no weed or alcohol and my family i’m living with obviously says no weed. i also really really hate lying. i’ve smoked a few times since this and been completely fine except for some derealization the first time (which is normal for me if i smoke too much/heavy indica). i WANT to just get a pen again and only smoke at night to sleep or at a friends house or something. i feel like i can much better monitor my use now that i have to hide it/know what it can do. it immensely helps my creativity as an artist, my intense anxiety(that my psych won’t prescribe antiaxiety meds for), and my sleep (that i now need pills like ambien to help me sleep). 

i’m sorry for such the long ramble but this is just the spark notes summary of my life this past year. i just want to feel whole again without sending myself into a psychotic break. am i OK to smoke a little while on mood-stabilizatiers and antipsychotics? i smoked a LOT before (unmedicated) and only had an episode when i was undergoing extreme stress and was triggered again. I feel like it’s different now that i’m medicated, can’t be high around family anymore, and just want a hit or two to calm down/actually feel happy without going into full blown psychosis.

How can I assure I wake up so I don't lose my job?)

Hi everyone. I will start with some background.

I (24 f-ish) have had various sleep issues literally my whole life. Mostly sleeping too much and at the ""wrong"" time, which when I was a teenager wasn't a big deal; and even through all of my adult years until now, I could get myself out of bed in the morning when I Really Needed To.

I have been in and out of therapy and psych treatment for half my life, including antipsychotics consistently for 12 years now. Even then I could get up when it was necessary.

Last year though I was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder (saw it coming; runs in the family; knew it would catch up to me someday). I have it decently managed med-wise finally! I became stable enough to get a job after spending over a year coasting on savings.

But now, I cannot for the life of me wake up on time. Yesterday (my first day) I managed-- but today I would have slept right through the day and lost my new job if my partner (who took the day off and could have easily slept later) had not woken up by chance half an hour before my shift and woke me up. Even at work I was literally nodding off for the first two and a half hours despite having drank 3-4 entire cups of espresso.

I have a million alarms on my phone. I'd turn them off in my sleep so I tried leaving my phone across the room at night, only to adapt to sleeping through the alarm completely.

For reference, I take seroquel (600mg), lamictal (200? 250?), and just recently we added lithium (300mg and increasing slowly).

How the hell do you guys get yourselves up when you're so sedated? These meds have finally made me stable but now I literally don't know how to get up in time.

ETA: I take other meds unrelated to my bipolar– cymbalta and lyrica for pain, klonopin for PTSD panic and rage.",1678924881.0

Now here is the weird part. Every morning I wake up BEFORE my alarm, now mind you, I usually sleep through 10 alarms without getting out of bed. And as long as I don’t do any all nighters, I’ve been able to sleep 6-7 hours every night with no issues.

I’m thrilled about it and my mom is absolutely amazed, but I am a bit worried that it might not be all positive. I do think the low dose seroquel has helped my sleep schedule a lot and I’m taking other meds, but the amount of erratic energy I have is odd.",1678937759.0

I experience night terrors at least once a week if not more. I used to think I was over dramatic but now I'm starting to pay attention to my tightened emotional states. The self-loathing and suicidal ideation have always been a factor for me. I was used to experiencing chronic depression.

I had more hypomanic episodes when I was younger but not so much now. They're more mixed episodes than anything else. All these things I have started paying attention to seemed to have gotten worse now that I've come to terms with my bipolar disorder.

In the past few years before I got on good meds, an episode meant wanting to not exist, being a danger to myself, it was very obvious.


But what’s going on with me now just doesn’t feel normal either, but it also doesn’t feel like the kind of episodes I’ve had the past few years.


Everything is just WEIRD. Like…

- I wake up before my alarm everyday and can function fine on 6-7 hours of sleep when usually I need 10-12 hours, I mean it’s great but kinda odd 

- I keep going down these strange obsessive rabbit holes where I forget the outside world - last time I spent 30 hours in two days doing nothing but arguing on Reddit and looking back my comments no sense at all 

And yet, with all this energy I’m still struggling to work, it’s BAD. I have to pass 2 hard stem classes this semester and I’m weeks behind in both

We’d likely have to move to antipsychotics next which also I’m hesitant about. And I had to navigate a lot of side effects (severe acne, weight gain) with lithium which also make me unsure about changing meds again.

2.) Blue light blocking glasses after sunset! Extra points if you can set your screens to warmer tones. iPhones do it and my TV has a dark calibration mode. 


3.) Get tf off your phones around bed time (I fail at this every time lol).


4.) TAKE YOUR MEDS!!! Take them earlier, take an extra sleepy dose if that’s in your care plan. I take L-Threanine with them and it helps relax me more but check with your doctor.

Hello! So I want to preface this by saying I’m only eighteen, and have not been diagnosed with either Bipolar disorder. It has been brought up with my therapist and doctor, we all agreed we’re just gonna keep an eye on it. All I know is I have “episodes” of being really depressed and episodes of being really happy and “you fools can’t stop me, I’m invincible”. That last one was a little dramatic, but I figure y’all may understand.

I was on Seroquel and Effexor, but I stopped taking those in December and now the “mindsets” are back.

Question: How can I learn to know if my happiness and hopefulness is genuine or if I’m going into one of my episodes? 

These episodes usually end with me in my depressed mindset. I really hate the explosive mindset, as I make bad choices and bite off more than I can chew. But I also hate being scared to “look around corners”. I tried to ask my mom for advice and told her that I was scared because I felt so excited, she just told me, “Well don’t think like that!😁” I want to protect myself by taking the adequate steps and precautions to make sure I’m not in the mindset, but now I’m afraid of every big emotion.

Any tips? Thanks💜🖤💜",1678897200.0

How many of you ended up in hospital or being medicated for bipolar that was only drug/medicine induced?
First time I went involuntary to hospital was in 2018 after doing a lot of amphetamines! Went out of hospital stoped my proscribed medication straight away and I was ""fine"" (of course I crashed down after mania ) for about two years after when my doctor proscribed me some antidepressants for anxiety and I took them on its own and I went back to hospital shortly after that ! I went back from hospital stoped my medication and now again I am fine for over two years ! And I really belive if I don't do any drugs or antidepressants I can be fine without bipolar medicine because on both occasions I went manic  only during times I was using drugs/antidepressants!

I know I haven't gained as much weight as other people but it feels horrible. I'm technically not overweight and apparently it isn't that bad according to other people, but I am struggling so fucking much not to slip back into my eating disorder. I had to go through a hospital program to treat it and can't afford a relapse. Literally. I can't afford to quit my job for treatment again.

Every time I get back into exercising and healthy habits, an episode fucking hits and I lose all of my good habits and eating and everything gets thrown to shit. I literally have only one other med option since I've been battling this disorder since I was 7 years old and either cant go on certain other ones because they stopped being effective, they react to other meds, or the side effects were too severe. The one other med option I have has a higher chance of gaining weight too. To boot: I've been told that even on proper medication and lifestyle changes, I will still experience episodes because of just how my disorder affects me. It's exhausting.

I know I should be counting my blessings that I havent gained a lot more than I have but it's just so fucking hard to handle when even though I only have a few ED slips here and there, I'm still cursed with the mental thoughts of it plaguing me all the time. It's such a challenge to not fall into problem behaviours.

I tried to kill myself and was hospitalized for a little over a week - and that cocktail was what was eventually whipped up for me.

I’ve always been wary of medication. I’ve been in therapy since I was about 9 or so - I’m 22 now. I’ve had many things prescribed, been told a million times that my problems need to be medicated, yet I always end up getting in the whole “I am better unmedicated” route, throwing them out, not telling my psychiatrists or therapists, and then obviously that hasn’t worked out.

Last night was the first time I’ve missed my doses. I went out late to be with some friends at their place, and it got much later pretty quickly, and my ride there had fallen asleep. I curled up on their beanbag chair in the corner and told myself, “Whatever, you’ve been alive a lot longer then you’ve taken these meds. Who cares?”

I couldn’t sleep at all. The night was excruciating. I maybe “slept” or a semblance of it for 10-20 minutes. I was awake, too hot, too cold, uncomfortable, tight - everything. I scrapped my money to get an uber the second the sun came up.

Today has been fucked and weird. I was a total edgelord teenager, and to be fair I’m still insufferable and into the macabre, so weird and gross shit was and is nostalgic to me. I called off work and spent the entire day bright awake, sluggish, watching old shock junk, impulsively buying old shock dvds and books, from near a decade ago and cutting myself. Pathetic, I know. 

It’s so fucking random. And it’s also one literal dose - but to be fair, I’ve also just been having a shit few weeks. But I also am realizing I literally don’t know how to fucking sleep now without these medications, and I just feel hazy and gross and all that dumb shit.

I don’t want to depend on something. I feel sick and sicker making this discovery. I don’t know why it makes me as upset as it does. I’ve swallowed my dose early tonight and praying it knocks me out once and for fucking all.

Not sure what happend but I was totally lost. I run up and down the stairs because I was in shock. I was so scared that count go through a door hole while the door didn't even had a  hole. I did had a fever at that moment but I was totally lost. Lots of kids do not get a delirium at that age by a fever. Can it be psychotic? I mean when I think about that event I feel totally lost. How can it be that I thought those things. I do get paranoid sometimes and get scared that people talked behind my back. But I do have a reason for it and it has to do with trauma I got around when I was 14. It can be that a delirium and the night terrors came from that still wet my pants around those ages. It was terrible.

My whole life I had problems with sexual urges. Even when I was 6 six I humped a lot. When I got older I jerked of in someones house and got busted by my (fake) friends as in they saw me jerking of. I did not saw them but they saw me and told everyone at school. I got addicted to porn at a young age. Now I have moment when I jerk of 10 times everyday when I feel more happy.

618,On The Receiving End,6,11rqh7a,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11rqh7a/on_the_receiving_end/,1,"Something happened to me in the summer of 2017. I won't go into a lot of detail, but a lot of years of repressed emotional pain poured out of me all at once and I almost committed suicide. Then, untreated for two long years with the full onset of my disorder pressing into me, I teetered back and forth from giving up and pulling through. It terrified the people closest to me and drove away those who weren't. I would settle and plan on it when things got to be too much because the pain was too much. Then I would back off from it and try again. I didn't realize how much I was hurting people until towards the end, then I forced my way through the barriers preventing me from getting help. I spent a year on lithium and got on lamotrigine in 2020. I rebuilt my life, mended the wounds.

In 2019, I made a friend. We became close very quickly. I felt like she knew me right away as well as anyone ever could. I opened my heart to her, and she shared things with me too. We spent time together, we had fun, I cared about her. I could go on forever, because the memories will stay with me forever, and I felt so many things that I could never put them all into words. Then she made a change in her life, fell on hard times, shifted to where it was harder for me to reach her. At the time, I used the distance as an excuse to get out of doing more to help. I was still pretty young, things were hard on me as well, and I was bitter in an unfair way - I felt abandoned. She slipped into the negative aspects of her environment more and more and I just let it happen. I could have done more.

I would have never admitted it at the time, but shamefully, I admit now that I wasn't so entirely surprised. She confided things in me over some of our late night conversations. There was a stronger history there than even I had because she made an attempt that - according to her - only I and the hospital knew about. But I was so angry over her seemingly abandoning me that I didn't try to reach out as often as I should have. When I did, it was usually stuff about me, or about our friendship, but all too little about her except when we actually got to talk. In a way, I didn't want to know after a while. In my mind, I'd all but lost her. It was only after I lost her for real when I realized that I had no idea what it would truly be to really *lose* someone. Because now there's nothing left to to mend.

I have spent a long, long time blaming myself, making a false peace with it and watching it all slip away, wishing I had the chance to go back and say something to myself - to tell me to get my head out of my ass and help her. To be there when the time came. And wishing I could speak to her, myself, so I could beg her to come back around, so I could tell her of the hurt she would leave in her wake. To tell her how I mourned her. To try and take the chance I had while I still had it to at least *try* and give her a way back. Because I would have given anything to help. If I'd have known what I know now, if I'd have felt the pain I still carry today, I would have worked tirelessly, I'd have given it a greater all than I've ever known myself to give. But I didn't. And now it's over. And I have to live with that.

I knew that I loved her. I still do. How I love her, and how I did back then, I'm not really sure. She'll forever have been one of my closest friends, I do know that at the very least. Maybe there is more that was left unspoken, but I'll never get to explore those feelings. I'll never get to talk with her, confide in her, share a tender moment, have a bit of fun, share artwork and inspiration, make plans for the future, create dreams with her, nor any of the other beautiful things about life. It's just over. That's all there is. And although I'd like to believe I'll see her again on the other side, I do not know that. And even if I did, what would I say? What would anyone say? When all the people she ever loved come back having lived full lives, having moved past her long ago. Left to an eternity alone.

I wish I could have helped her as she once helped me. I wish she could be here so I could show her my meaning for togetherness, support, friendship, and love. But she is not, and those she left behind live on with that bitter, bitter fact. Yet, despite it all, I do not live bitterly. I look into my mirror every morning and I say to myself that today, I will give those who rely on me for support and friendship the best effort I can make. I will continue trying to give myself the best life I can live. I will struggle through whatever comes my way and find my happiness in each day. I live decently, today. I make promises on my being there and I come through however possible. I let people trust me because I know today what I once did not - that I could not hurt them as I was hurt.",1678869550.0

Recently got diagnosed with ADHD after years of being treated with massive amounts of bipolar meds. I was agreeable to my new psychiatrist trimming my bipolar meds down (fuck me was I grateful) but she sadly took it one step too far after Christmas and made a play for the lithium, which I’d been on for 10 years. 

During the titration I:- 

- got really depressed to begin with. I could deal with that. 
- missed out on a day with my kid which was awful. On that day I started smelling things that I knew weren’t there. 
- I then started to get super paranoid and delusional, to the point of almost hurting my SO because I thought she’d stolen money from me. 
- Everything became too real for me. 
- I had visual hallucinations, became very frightened of being in the house on my own. 
- I then got really manic, incredibly unpleasant, verbally hostile to people around me. I couldn’t work and my SO and family didn’t know what to do. I’d compose lengthy emails and messages about conspiracy theories and stuff I really don’t have much interest in when I’m well and I ruined a few fairly stable friendships because I was so fucking grandiose. 


After missing time with my daughter, being incredibly unpleasant to my family and generally being a mess my psych finally increased the lithium back up to 1000mg. For reference, the major relapse happened at 600mg. I held out for about 10 days before giving up and putting it back to 800, then 1000 with my primary care doctors approval. 

Now, my psychiatrist has agreed not to touch the lithium for now. She feels that my relapse was due to autism spectrum, not bipolar. I have agreed to an autism assessment but she is totally unphased about the lithium. I’m still on low dose quetiapine, klonopin and my ADHD medication. She has refused to reintroduce lamotrogine even though I’ve said numerous times I am depressed and struggling to do things. My work situation is precarious and honestly, I just want to get back to normal. 

I’ve seen psychiatrists since I was 19 and have always known I have bipolar, and have been treated for a mood disorder since I was 20. I agree with the ADHD and I’m willing to explore autism. I don’t want to have bipolar, but I know 100% that is what I have. I’m currently dealing with depressive symptoms, lethargy and still unable to work, all of which I feel are concordant with someone who’s had a pretty nasty manic episode. I don’t want to be a victim about it but it feels so invalidating to have to go through this knowing I’ve had a manic episode. 

I’m frustrated that my psychiatrist is being so dangerously negligent here. I don’t want 100’s of new meds, but it’s kinda insulting for my family to be told I’m autistic when I’ve struggled with bipolar symptoms for over a decade now. I’ve gone from seeing a psychiatrist who told me I had very severe bipolar and medicated me way too much to the complete opposite. For what it’s worth, all of my family (myself included) work in mental health, some clinically, others administratively.

Diagnosed in 2020 with bipolar 1. That’s when I had my first psychotic episode.


Now, I applied for income protection insurance in case I had a manic episode again and couldn’t work to protect me and ensure I get paid around the same amount if I couldn’t work. I had another episode in 2022(I was lazy with my medications and would miss frequently).

I was granted my claim. I’m back at work now so I was only paid for the time I was off but it’s way better than unemployment(in Australia we call it Centrelink)!!!! I received 85% of my original pay before I had my incident. 

You do have to read your policy and need to be working for a period of time. Do not think you can get a job for a month, force an episode and get paid for the rest of your days! Doesn’t work like that! 

Hope this helps ladies and gents!",1678869462.0

Oh boy, okay. I’ve been with my bf for almost four years, before we got together we were friends (best friends honestly) for a year. Met at work, I dated his toxic friend and he really help me get out of that situation. Also, I was struggling with addiction bad, I was in a really horrible group of friends and he was my only escape. It started off really rocky, he’s two years older and never had a girlfriend before. He was a hermit most of his life, that was even his first job. But he was a sweetheart, he was so gentle and patient (we both worked in mental health if that tells you anything!)
I was a mess, this was my first healthy relationship and I had just got done being in a very traumatizing situation but he was there every step of the way.

Fast forward, we both leave that job and eventually move out on our own. Now we’re here, nothing really to mention in between since I got clean, got a nice job and continued to work on myself for the both of us.

Now, last month was really hard. Recently I had been struggling with my depressive episodes, he was very aware but I wasn’t very present in our relationship for the last couple months. I honestly was mean, I had stopped talking about wanting kids with him and changing future plans. Last month he had become very distant and I immediately noticed, valentines passes and he comes to me in tears. I immediately knew what was going on, many people have walked out of my life and that look was all over his face. He cried to me saying that I no longer wanted the same things, he had been thinking for the past month about us and that our relationship had ran it’s course. I was devastated, the love of my life hadn’t been shown the love he deserved. I had always wanted the things he wanted, kids and evrything. I’ve just been feeling so down I hadn’t cared about anyone else, I really haven’t been feeling like I’ll make it past this next year. 

I of course apologized, we cried and I reassured him I’d do much better at verbalizing my wants with a future with him. I’ve got to be better because he deserves it. He said after that day he felt so much better … but I keep reliving that day. Ever since I’ve had bad anxiety attacks which I have a history of, used to take meds for (on meds for bipolar) and he’s witnessed a few. I keep having nightmares about him breaking it off, I need more reassurance than ever. It just replays in my head over and over.
The only advice I’ve been given from my therapist is to just trust him and try getting back on meds.

i am not asking for a medical advice or a diagnosis! This is more a question about accepting what the doctors say.

I am wondering if anyone can relate. I am constantly questioning if I was misdiagnosed or if my meds are working well and I'm simply in denial.

I was diagnosed two years ago with ""unspecified bipolar disorder"" at the age of 18, I think they have settled on bipolar 2 since. The reason for the diagnosis was psychotic symptoms and sudden phobias between two depressive episodes where they ruled out everything else and concluded hypomania. Whatever my true disorder is I have always been high functioning which I am very thankful for. Now comes the problem.

They have treated me with lamotrigine 200mg for two years and they recently increased the dose to 300mg. My current doctor is very good and I trust him but has told me the meds are working which is the reason that I haven't had any hypomanic episodes since. If that is the case then I am lucky that they caught it so early. 

The few people in my family I've told don't believe that I have it, they believe in my depressions but as I said earlier I am high functioning even then which masks the problem a lot. A private psychologist has concluded that I am not bipolar, while multiple doctors have said that I do have a mood disorder and they have pinpointed bipolar (unspecified or type 2).

When something interesting happens in the day, they just pick up their phone and text others. When they need advice on daily things, they easily just shoot someone a message. It feels like they can keep up light hearted, fun conversation along with the tough ones. 

I also do have pretty severe social anxiety and what has been diagnosed as “autism congruent traits”, but this feels like a bit more than that. I feel like my life has really been defined by my illness and the tragedy that comes with it, and it limits my ability to have meaningful social interactions. A lot of my friendships have been based on heavy trauma dumping from my friends and them really needing things from me too, and I wish there was more beyond that.

Who am I?
 
The biggest question for us is, “Who am I?” As humans, we start this thinking in our earliest memories of who were are and how we relate to the people around us (usually family and close friends in childhood).  For those of us with Mental Illness, the question of who we remain throughout Adulthood.  After our diagnosis, we must question who we are compared to the person we were before. Do the jumble of letters and names of the diagnosis matter? Am I now cursed with this illness I may have had for most of my life? 
            I have no idea if I am the same as before the diagnosis, but I know that after over 25 years of untreated mental illness, I was at the end of my rope.  I had expended my energy being “normal,” or what I thought was normal.  During this time, I always felt that I was the best in the world or the world's worst person.  Never an in-between. There are days I can't remember and nights I wish I could.  In that element, I am a completely different person on medication.  However, I am still very much the same person as before. I love the same, hurt the same, work the same, and talk the same (maybe a little slower and with a better tone). My emotions, or my ability to control and regulate my emotions, are drastically improved.
            What's in a diagnosis? Well, I can say that I am terrified that people will find out; it's like my secret identity.  Clark Kent is at work, around others, and a Super Mental Illness guy when the glasses come off. Would people look at me differently if they realized I was Bipolar, had c-PTSD, Anxiety disorder, substance use disorder, Panic Attack disorder, and ADHD? I think that they would, and I hope that they wouldn't, but one's ability to lead seems to hinder on their ability to be “healthy,” and even treated mental illness is not considered healthy.  
            I know I am a great father, a good husband, and a great leader.  I have led troops into battle, players on the field, hoopers on the court, and teachers in the classroom, and I will not let the mash of letters and dx codes define who I am.  Will I struggle some days? You betcha ya.  Will I need time, love, and acceptance? of course.  But I refuse to allow this diagnosis to define who I am.  There are mornings when I cry out, “why me” why do I have to put into place all the safeguards for my triggers? Why do I have to do therapy, go to the psychiatrist, to group, live by a schedule, and take all my medications?  It's hard, and it's hard almost every day.  But when it comes down to it, I am still the same old me, and I hope others see it the same",1678848201.0

With all the stress comes the promotion at work, everyday working out in the gym, etc. For about 3 weeks, I feel so pumped and productive... I feel like everything’s falling into place.

Not a good mindset but I honestly miss those days where I felt so happy. I cried all the way to work today looking back on all the fun experiences I had when I felt so outgoing and charismatic. Life is so lonely for me now. No contact with friends and an unwavering feeling of apathy.

Does anybody else experience small triggers like that?",1678838931.0

But something I’ve always wanted to do is work as a therapist. After going through so many since 98% of the ones that take my insurance are kind of terrible, I had the epiphany that I should pursue this dream of mine. 

I know it’s about 6 years of school, but I want to know, with this disorder, is it doable? Is it hard to communicate with people that have gone through what you have? Is it actually possible to stay focused and committed for 6 years to become a therapist? Has anyone done it and lived to tell the tale?

Hi everyone - this is my first post here. I was diagnosed with bipolar in 2017 and have worked really hard to build a mostly functional life. But as I’m sure y’all understand, I don’t handle stress as “well” as other people, so I try to mitigate stress as much as possible.

Anyway, for some context, my best friend of 11 years moved in with me and my husband in November. It was supposed to be temporary, but she’s still here. It’s been really hard for me to adjust to less alone time, but that’s on me to deal with. But she is INCREDIBLY messy. She has been her entire life. I’ve repeatedly told her to at least contain her mess to her room and to please keep her bedroom door shut, because I have three dogs (one of which is a puppy) and they could get into shit in her room. She never remembers and it’s a constant thing I have to remind her of. Well my worst fear happened - last week, I was cooking dinner and my puppy wandered into her room, and ate a bunch of pain meds she had left out on her bedroom floor. My dog started to aggressively vomit and was overall just extremely sick. I rushed her to the vet ER, and she’s okay now, but it was EXTREMELY stressful. I genuinely thought my puppy was going to die. She was sick for days after and the vet bill was over $1000. 

My best friend basically sent a quick apology text and then expected us to go back to normal. Meanwhile this level of stress is making me severely depressed. I can’t get out of bed except to take care of my dogs. I haven’t gone back to work. My husband is very supportive but nobody else in my life understands why I’m so angry and taking this so hard. I feel like I just can’t get over it. It’s been 4 days and I can’t bring myself to even speak with her. I’m so angry and exhausted and I’m getting depressed again.

The longest I've taken them was for about 8 months with almost no days missing, but that was about 5 years ago and I have yet to fall back into that. This is something I have always struggled with, even as a kid.

Extreme mood swings, from irritable and angry, to sad and weepy, to an inability to sleep and constant restlessness to no energy at all. I feel confused and disoriented.

I have been having paranoid thoughts that I am possessed by a demon. I’m not religious, probably identify most with agnostic/atheist beliefs, don’t come from a very religious family or background (occasional church visits on special occasions as a child). I have never put much weight into demons/possession/god, but now I can’t stop obsessing over whether I am possessed. I think I am still able to rationalise that I am not possessed and it’s just in my head, but I don’t know if I will slip into delusions (I’m still quite new to the experience of delusions and had my first one in December ‘22). 

I’m also having urges to act impulsively and recklessly, which is very out of character. I am having desires to shoplift, spend all my money, and meet strangers for sex. I have managed to control myself so far, but I’m worried about how much longer I can control it. I have never had any desire to do these things before. 

I have a psychiatrist who I see fortnightly and a therapist who I see weekly. I have been diagnosed with generalised anxiety, major depression and EDNOS. I have been seeing a psychiatrist since November for suspected bipolar disorder, but diagnosis is still pending. I have had 2 episodes of paranoid delusion in December and January.

I'm new to this sub and actually, new in my diagnosis. But I'm here to talk about food.

**TLDR:** I will see my psychiatrist next month, but until then, how can I eat more and not gain (much) weight? **Not asking for a diet**, **just your tips to trick your brain in feeling more satisfied**. *Ps.: I ask you kindly to don't tell me bad things about my meds or ask to change my meds.*

I'm currently in **Depakote ER 1000mg** (three weeks) and **Seroquel (50mg)** (three weeks, but already used 25mg, 50mg, 100mg, it varied for 4 years). Been treating several mental health issues over the last 15+ years.

Now, **I'm extremely hungry. All the fking time.** Like, I just ate, 30 minutes ago. **A lot**. And I wanna eat again so much.

Changing meds its not an option now. Please, I ask you kindly to not cite that topic here. I'm sensitive about that. I've changed several meds and been in hell this last three months and I'm trying to stabilize myself with the help of my psychiatrist. I will see him in three weeks and will discuss this urge with him.

*Until then:*

I've been off work since then working with my psychiatrist to figure out the right combo of meds. 
Currently I'm on 1200mg lithium, but my blood level is low at 0.59 and has been for months. 
I am working on getting up to 200mg Lamotrigine but only at 100 mg currently as we're slowly increasing to avoid side affects. 

I have a meeting with my Psych Dr tomorrow to determine and discuss if I can return to work and what my graduated return would look like. I'm really nervous about how that appointment will go.

My job in healthcare was what set off so many awful episodes in the past and I'm scared to go back. There's a lot of death at my job, especially in regards to infants and it got to the point where I was crying before, after and during my shifts. I don't feel like my meds are enough at this point since I'm not at a therapeutic dose for either of them. This might seem vain but I've gained weight from taking Olanzapine and won't fit into any of my work scrubs and that is a pretty big trigger for me. 

I'm just at a loss for what to do, 4 months seems like a lot of time, but I don't know how reasonable it is to say I need more. Even if I get an extension I'm still not sure if I'll ever be capable to returning to that job. 

Has anyone else been in a similar position, or have advice?

My life is great and I’d like to consider myself as stable as any regular healthy person. I just happen to have bipolar 1 and I’m on 2 different mood stabilizers. I went into bio life today and when the nurse found out I was bipolar she got all uncomfortable especially when I said I take lithium. She made a face and said “that’s really serious..” it really isn’t.. it just makes my life normal which is a good thing? She said she needed approval from my doctor to make sure I was stable which is understandable. I understood the whole process of why they were more cautious when people have disorders. But then she made a comment to me saying that the reason they get an approval from the doctor for a bipolar person is because they want that person to come in to the plasma center in a good mental state then continued to state that they have needles and they don’t want us to get angry and Stab ourselves because that’d be so scary for everyone else. I’m just hurt about that. I was treated normally until I said I was bipolar and she could have kept that thought to herself that I might go stab myself with their needles(or bipolar people might) I have social awareness just like everyone else. Just because I’m bipolar doesn’t mean I’m going to act out in public and do something outrageous like stabbing my self?? I understand that they need doctor approval I just hate the instant fear people get when they hear I’m bipolar. For me bipolar means that I sometimes think I’ll be the most amazing gymnast and movie star even though I’ve never done gymnastics and I don’t act.

We have been dating for two months, and I believe she went to their church sometime last month. She also had me think that she is not using Facebook anymore when we met. But, when I got to be close to her family, I found out about her Facebook. I stalked it, and found a guy liking and commenting on her photos in the past. I confronted her about who it was. She said, it was her ex that she had been telling me, but it was just a different person.

I actually don’t give a fuck about her past, it’s just that, it hurts me knowing that she made me believe it was a different person. So now, I’m starting to think she might still be in love with him, or she might have seen him sometimes. But she told me it had been like a year since she saw him. She said she had trauma with that person that’s why she had decided to forget everything about him. She just doesn’t want me to know about him because I’m telling you, the way she said to me about that guy in the beginning was really traumatizing.

Last night, I gave her a chance to explain everything to me because I want to continue our relationship. I told her to explain everything to me, no lies, just all truths.

I understand it takes a real truthful mindset to deticate yourself to actually really making that step, and unfortunately I know I'm not ready for that.

I just wanted to talk about it in depth for a minute to someone, it's nice to rant but I don't want to waste a therapists time with my silly rants and not really solve anything again. 

Despite being 17, I've been talking to counselors, therapists, and psychologists for 10 years now, seeing my first one at age 7, where my first therapist told my parents I wanted to runaway and/or hurt myself.

I'm not officially diagnosed, but bipolar runs in my family and I'm the exact same meds at a higher dose than my family members with the disorder aswell. My psychiatrist told me he wouldn't see me again until I was visiting with a therapist again, but after years of therapy with no results I just don't see the point anymore.

I guess it's my fault, I was never able to actually use the suggestion they gave me. As soon as the meeting was over, I just forgot everything they ever said, in CBT especially. I've seen some really great people who really liked me and found my case really interesting, but I couldn't bring myself to see them more than a handful of times. I'm not sure why, maybe I came in and they were busy, or I felt like I couldn't commit to it. 

I've had a very stressful and traumatic life ranging from all kind of abuse until very very recently when I finally moved out of my house and in with another family. I was failong highschool horribly and was on the brink of dropping out and attempting again. I met my boyfriend, and I hospitalized myself because of it. But, because of the system here, they kept me there for 17 hours and told me I was going to the ward and then just sent me home, I was pissed honestly. I was set for change, I was going to help myself, but they dumped me because I voluntarily admitted myself. 

I don't know, I'm not ready though. I'm a teen, and the idea of being manic again after so many horrible lows of depression is honestly such a dream come true. I bet you can see it, I've struggled with depression and suicide attempts and brutal self harm for years and years to suddenly break and change so suddenly and just feel ""better"" of course I was fucking delusional as shit with it being my first episode and it was a long one. I got into another depressive episode after and nearly killed someone out of pure jealousy, I'm not even kidding. 

I know I'm really really REALLY bad without therapy, and my medication is EXTREMELY high because of it, literally above the highest prescribed dose of lamotrigine to make up for it. 

I have been trying to keep track of myself, using dailyio has bee good for mood tracking and keeping notes of mood swings, but whenever I see my mood go up, I get more excited. I want to stop taking my meds I want the feeling to stay I indulge in every little thing I can go keep the feeling, but then BOOM the universe fucks me up and spirals me down again and fucks me up like shit man get out of here let me do my thing. 

Like man it's a terrible mindset but can you blame me? I'm 17, I have such a huge life ahead of me what's the worst a few years of having fun can do to me? It's not peer pressure either, but I want to party I want to drink I want to smoke o want to have fun while I can. I've been depressed and isolated from the world for YEARS. The second I got a taste of freedom I yanked it my way and went crazy, it was literally the best time of my life despite the outcomes. 

Luckily, my mind's defence mechanism (and drug use and ADHD) is to literally forget EVERYTHING. I can't tell you shit about last month and no way in hell ill recall anything before that. I don't remember the consequences of my actions, and I know that's the worst part. 

I've been with my boyfriend for nearly a year and a half, he tells me how I treated him in those episodes, and I feel shitty, but I can't help but yearn for that sweet feeling again.",1678770035.0

 There are a few cool things I've noticed for down->up switches.  The most common is that if I'm listening to music, I won't really pay attention ... but just before I switch, I start whistling to the music.  Two other neat ones I've caught lately are kinda related to each other... whem i'm down i'm more sensitive to sound and light and commonly drop phone brightness to 0.  But sometimes just before switching I have to turn my phone brightness up because it feels dim.  Today, I had the reverse(?) Happen ... i was laying there in bed when for no reason, the whole room lit up like i turned on a whole nother set of lights.  At first I thought it was just the sun popping from clouds but I confirmed it wasn't.  About 10-15 minutes later I switched.

Another probably stupid trick ... because I switch so often, I take 1-2 delta9 gummies every 8-12 hours when I'm depressed.  They do absolutely nothing when I'm down, but suddenly kick in as I'm about to switch, like a marijuana powered alarm system o_O.

As for up->down it's boring, I usually just get an overwhelming need to take a nap.

I've been dealing with bipolar since my early 20s (diagnosed about 7 years ago after being hospitalized for a mixed episode). I always assumed it was type 2 (or NOS) because it was mostly depression though I didn't ask and was never told.  Today I finally asked my provider and she said it was type 1 because of being hospitalized and that my high moods sometimes included psychotic symptoms. She has not given me the feedback that my symptoms were psychotic throughout our time together and for me I always wrote it off as intense levels of fear that drove me to weird beliefs because I got so scared or spiritual experiences during hypomania but I'm very touchy about mental health issues or labels so she's had reason to dance around it, I guess. She's always recommended appropriate medications and I've been on antipsychotics most of the time. She just never spelled it out. 

I don't know if the type matters or why it does to me right now.  I don't want to play the comparison game or say one type is more severe or whatever so maybe my reaction isn't reasonable. I know everyone's experience is different. I  guess I feel the hope of getting better slipping away and more fearful of the future. Any thoughts on how to digest this would be appreciated.

746,Partner can’t sleep,10,11qc338,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11qc338/partner_cant_sleep/,13,"My bf has RLS which is a huge disruptive of sleep for him. I get it - it’s truly awful. 

When we decided to move in together it was discussed at length. I cannot have disrupted sleep. I’m bipolar, I already struggle with radical nightmare and wake up drenched many nights. 

He’s always cold so he’s running the F-ing hair dryer at night, so it’s on and off all night. Which makes the air dry and hot. Which means I can’t breathe and am sweating more than I usually do. 

He can’t sleep so he’s up and he’s down and he walking around or he’s standing at his side of the bed on his phone. 

Last night it was hair dryer on, hair dryer off, he woke up startled, he woke up and thought I was mad at him, he left our room so I woke up because he was gone, then the kicker is he’s in the kitchen at 6 am asking Alexa 42 F-ing questions which every time makes the bedroom Alexa pause white noise so now it’s silent and I can hear him repeatedly asking her if there has been a fucking time change. 

He knows RSO helps him sleep but won’t go buy more because it turns out to be about $4 a day. He makes almost a quarter million per year. He knows hitting the gravity bong helps him sleep but forgets to do it. He doesn’t want be on sleeping pill because it makes him drowsy in the morning. He doesn’t take his magnesium/melatonin as he’s supposed to.

I am diligent about my medication, I eat well, I exercise, I’ve always taken sleep really seriously, I go to therapy, I see my psych regularly. I do all the “things” that we are all supposed to do. 

And now he’s mad at me because I’m irritated with him. Jesus. So am I supposed to get on yet another F-ing prescription because of his sleep bullshit??

Edit: We talked and I laid it all out for him. I told him I wasn’t going to risk going into mania, which causes brain damage, because he won’t do the things needed to sleep. He said that he can’t sleep because of my snoring and that the hair dryer is to drown out the sounds of my snoring. Although he used to do it in his previous marriage so that doesn’t track and he has RLS which is 100% known for sleep disturbances at night. My best friend lives two doors down. I’ll sleep there for a while.

Edit 2: He did mention my snoring about a month ago. I immediately researched solutions, bought mouth strips overnight delivery and have worn them, maybe falling asleep without them a few times. He hasn’t mentioned that it’s not working.

Edit 3: Thanks everyone. I’ve stood my ground and not got sucked into any distraction type conversation from the real issue. I appreciate all the validation. I think as a bipolar person I’ve spent years not trusting myself so it’s nice to have some back-up that we’re all seeing this situation the same way. I have communicated for a year about being bipolar and what that means and what all efforts it takes to remain stable. If he didn’t hear it and take it seriously - that’s not my problem. Much love.

I'm on abilify, and I know its a little early to really tell long term, but I do feel like its making a difference. I've felt pretty stable and its been about two weeks since my last hypomanic episode (I have cyclothymia so more mild but phases switch more often). I feel like my anxiety has increased so much though, specifically when it comes to driving.

A few weeks ago I had two job interviews in a day (not a good idea in retrospect haha), and in between while I was driving to the next interview I was turning left and I almost ran over this man. I didn't, I saw him and stopped, but because my adrenaline was already so high from the job interview it has just really stuck with me. I used to like driving, but ever since then my anxiety has just been so so high when it comes to driving. I had a long 2.5-hour drive yesterday and I almost had a panic attack on the road, I was shaking because I was so anxious, and I don't feel like this is a normal level of anxiety for me. 

And what's worse is I'm psyching myself out so I'm becoming scared out of nothing, and then I'm not acting confidently on the road and creating confusion, and then I am actually creating a potentially dangerous situation. I genuinely feel like I should not drive for awhile but I'm mid-move right now so I literally have to so much. 

My psychiatrist said that its normal when stabilizing to notice more anxiety because my mind isn't focused on being hypomanic or depressed or anything else that comes with that. Was I really this anxious before I started these meds but it was just masked behind my bipolar disorder? Because wow I didn't realize how goddamn anxious I am, it's kinda funny haha.

Well, in my case I never present psychosis in my manic episodes. I was hospitalized for the first time last year, after having very impulsive behaviors, a lot of irritability, spending money that wasn't even mine (it was my parents'), very talkative and for not sleeping.

The day I was hospitalized I remember that I had come home with a goldfish, which I had bought after running away from high school that same morning. The School notified my parents and then after a ""talk"" with them I agreed to be hospitalized.

Tell me the stories of why you were hospitalized for the first time, I would be delighted to read them.

I actually logged onto reddit today to relax and read some trash talk about an incredibly silly survival reality show I am watching. It was not supposed to be deep. And on the 1st page  I encountered numerous comments and posts accusing the villain of having bipolar disorder. And this character exhibited absolutely no signs of bipolar disorder, none. And I am pretty sensitive to that. What she did do was behave like a terrible person, sabotaging others and stealing their items. All while sleeping regularly, speaking at normal speeds, and contextualizing everything she did within a conscious, rational strategy. The worst part? One of the commenters claimed to be a psychologist, and wrote several comments, one of which was ""Jill reminds me of every bipolar, (classist slur), angry (sexist slur) I've ever met in Appalachia (and there are a lot of them!).""

I have bipolar disorder, and both of my abusive parents have/had bipolar disorder, so I have been on both sides of it here, and I just do not want to hear it anymore. I don't care what individual experiences someone had, they shouldn't make these statements. It's not like we are not predisposed to behave ""badly,"" but being abusive, cruel, or violent is not part of the diagnostic criteria. And there are so many assholes in the world who do not have bipolar disorder! Being a jerk isn't some unique quality that only we are susceptible to.

Most of us are just trying to live our lives.

It's about a boss who threatened to fire me when I was hospitalized (not related to psychiatry care)  


I've been working this job, they paid me jack but demand me to work for something that worth like 4 times that. I was freelancing before that and my ex (bless her heart) introduced me to this asshole.  
So my job was, I had to draw a picture a day, no break, pics range from 4-13 people a picture. I was young and a moron apparently so I accepted it. Also I was in debt from all the shopping spree so desparate times.  


So, the people who hired me, knows that I have some mental illness, but they didn't know it was schizoaffective disorder. The owner talked to me directly, something like ""look around the company we have so many people like you this is not a normal company I created this to guide people like you"" and ""you're lucky you found us, I bet your online friends won't do anything for you like we do"". Though I stayed quiet about my bipolar until a year into working there. Worst decision of my life.  


One time I was feeling depressed and someone called the owner in, I said I'm scared to go to the psychiatrist because I don't wanna be hospitalized. I was hospitalized before after my suicide attempt. Owner decided to ask me for my years old hospitalization paper when I was still a minor, when I said no he began to belittle me and say things like ""you think you know more than my FRIEND who is a doctor?"". He uses this friend that is a doctor argument a lot whenever I want to take a day off for my health or just couldn't work because I cannot move, literally (keep in mind I don't even take weekends off). Whenever I say something that he doesn't agree of he would pull me aside and lecture me and I have to listen to him because he has been through hard times too he said. After all I was lucky that anyone would hire me at all.  


After more than a year of working there, my body finally caved, I was hospitalized. I didn't answer their phone call and texts because the reception there is awful and there's no wifi, but when I did get to contact them I did told them that I was in the hospital. They only asked if I can work. When I got home I was greeted with the text ""If you didn't contact us in 24 hours we will terminate you"" (paraphrase bc different language). I call it quit right then and there. And that was probably the best decision of my life.

1. My mom tells me I can’t move to a city an hour away because I’m mentally ill. I am 24 and have been planning to leave my hometown for over a year... I have only recently been opening up about my mental health struggles because I did have a pretty bad manic episode recently that led to my diagnosis. But my mental illness has been so much worse than she’ll ever know. I’ll never tell her cause she can barely handle the milder stuff I tell her.
2. My friend calling me crazy when I describe obsessive and hypersexual behaviors I experience during mania. Saying I need help and to stay away from certain types of people. Ouch. I am in regular therapy and trying Lamictal, which I told her, and trying very very hard to take a break from dating. This interaction left me speechless.
3. Almost all of my friends and family demanding that I check in with them regularly if not daily and spam texting me when I don’t reply. Good god. I am recovering from a months long manic episode and am sleeping a lot and catching up on homework. 
4. I actually cut off my sister indefinitely because she was emotionally abusive and controlling, always judging me especially when I was manic, screaming at me and telling me what to do, who I could date and spend time with, etc etc. Stupid shit. She’s done much worse but I’d had enough after I got diagnosed and it only got worse. It’s like she thought because I was more mentally ill than she realized that gave her a pass to invalidate every decision I make because I’m “not in my right mind” and can’t make my own decisions. Phew there was an explosive fight.
5. Now when I’m just casually talking about something my family is constantly asking, “were you having an episode then?” “Were you in a right state of mind when you did (insert typical young adult behavior)?” and it is absolutely sending me. Like, I don’t know? What answer would satisfy you? I feel as if I have always vacillated between severe depression and mania so, have I just always been bipolar and never in my “right mind?” Am I not me when I’m having an episode, which is most of the time? I’m still figuring this out. I feel like everyone around me is now constantly interrogating me.

I cannot fucking stand people telling me what to do! I am pissed off and feel infantilized. I was already nervous about moving and getting my first full time job after graduation and it’s like all these people think they’re supporting me but I just feel like they’re doubting my capabilities. My mental illness is more visible now because I decided to be more open about it, but goodness it has been 100x worse before but no one knew. This is making me want to stop talking about it except for with my one closest friend who has been cool. Has anyone experienced this? How do you set boundaries? I feel like all anyone can see in me anymore is my mental illness. Shit fucking hurts.",1678671511.0

Turns out she's prescribed it before and gave me a script. 

1 week in and while I know its likely the new med high, my room is clean. I've showered and brushed my teeth twice a day every day. I don't even think about it I just...do it. All the dishes are done, kitchens clean, I just do it, almost as an impulse.

My entire adult life I've been an alcoholic. Put myself in the hospital, wake up and finish the counter tall can kinda person. My urge to binge drink has, and I'm not exaggerating, almost completely disappeared. Same with binge eating, one of the only things I had to look forward to in the day was when I could go home, pile on food and eat it in the dark. Urge is now gone, I'm only craving healthy food. 

My bad habits have always been a running joke. I've told people that something else is up but even with diagnosis it was dismissed as me being messy, to the point where I believed it, believed that I was just this gross uncontrollable mess.

I'm curious to hear some insights from other BP folks on my current job situation.  I've been working in project management with the same company for nearly two years.  Frankly, I'm underpaid, but the work isn't terribly demanding and my team and the company are pretty understanding about my BP and allow me quite a bit of flexibility.  I could probably move into a promotion for a \~10% raise in the coming months.

I constantly see online and hear in person people talking about needing to switch jobs every year or two to get the best pay raises and that loyalty to employers is bad news.  I know there is some truth to this and I have been applying for positions and receiving a lot of interest in my applications.  These positions could come with 15-30% pay increases.  However, the job search and interviewing gives me severe, debilitating anxiety and I really worry about switching to a new company only to have to learn completely new systems and work with new people.  The company I switch to may also not be as lenient or understanding about my situation.

I suppose I'd like to hear any opinions from other bipolar folks on their career development.  Do you think its worth it to just stick it out for lower pay and peace of mind?  Or should I really force myself out of my comfort zone for the potential significant salary increase? Any other thoughts are very welcome. Thank you!",1678660869.0

I’m going to discuss this with my psychiatrist, but what i’m wondering is if that was more so psychosis from my bipolar? and maybe i was misdiagnosed with ocd? the thing is when i go through extreme paranoia like that it’s episodic, it’s not consistent. I would even have visual hallucinations of people putting pills in my drinks. that’s when i ended up in the psych ward. I’m just wondering if other people that have experienced psychosis with their bipolar could relate to any of my symptoms, or based on your knowledge of the disorder could suggest that my experiences were a result of my bipolar?

Want to talk to my therapist on this topic but worry about being judged.

In my twenties I spent several years in a foreign country. 

I lost a job at first during a manic episode as I had untreated bipolar disorder at the time. And lost in a country at first that I knew little about in terms of language. Later I picked up the language.

I found myself on a few occasions getting paid to exchange sexual services.  I also would accompany people on trips and have them pay for it, and treated via extravagant dinners and gifts. Having clothes bought for me in exchange at the time.

I feel horrible as some were married. I also find myself confused conflicted in terms of gender as I am not sure if what I did was common in my role and what I did. Hope this was not all too vague. But I feel like when I look at my past I have a hard time understanding and I do not know why.

Also do not understand why people were so often interested in somebody such as myself at that time when I was often half their age. And that bothers me too.

Ten years ago my ex wife left me and I went to my friend's birthday party a couple weeks later to get out and do single guy stuff. That night I met my friend's roommate who was so stunning to me that I didn't care she was a total bitch to me for spilling beer on her kitchen floor. I'm not sure what happened but I know I left my shoes there that night and the next morning her roommate answered the door when I went to get them and threw them at me then said ""please leave my house now""....I became absolutely infatuated with her immediately. After some weeks of finding excuses to hangout with my friend, the girl saw I wasn't ALWAYS a belligerent drunk asshole. We became friends. In fact we found out we had much in common. We found out that we had so many of the same thoughts and feelings about life and the world. We empathized with each other in so many ways. We fell in love. 
Unfortunately, it couldn't have been worst timing. I was still legally married and not done with the divorce process. She was joining the Coast Guard to finally find direction in her life. We were at two different crossroads in our own lives. We broke up amicably and remained acquaintances.
In August of last year I was having a breakdown. To this day, no one has made me feel more understood than this woman does. I reached out because I needed a friend. Mind you we rarely talked and certainly not deeply. Well we did that day. For weeks she was there. It doesn't take much effort for me to feel cared for and it felt so good to be cared for. We quickly rekindled the friendship we had. She's moved to a different city that I've wanted to visit for a long time and did so in December to see her. 
Turns out we were both undiagnosed bipolar and self medicating with alcohol 10 years ago. We also both have ADHD as well and we laugh that we get along because we're ""all the same types of fucked up"". We have both grown and changed independently but so similarly. I was planning on seeing if there was still a spark when I went to visit. We kept it casual. We hadn't hung out in years and this was our first time hanging out since both getting treatment. I guess I'd hoped for some romantic movie reunion but I had hope as she had planned on making a trip home in January (which she did). I don't even know why I was clinging to the idea of something happening with all this new distance between us but I did know when my heart wants something it wants it and I'd do whatever I had to to follow my heart. Even if it meant moving. 
Here's where it gets awesome. She decided in January she wants to move back home after 10 years of living all over the country. She'll be back in less than a month. We talk every day unless one of us is self isolating. When I'm manic and weird she doesn't care and when she is withdrawing from the world for a day or two I completely get it. We even have the same dreams of living next door to one's spouse and retiring to a gigantic dog farm now. 
I'm trying to not get too excited. I don't want to get my hopes up about it romantically. Either way this woman that makes me feel accepted and supported is coming back into my life and it's just so exciting. I'm a 33 year old man and am currently feeling like a teenager. I can't say for certain where this will go, but wish me luck.",1678656079.0

There's just too much bullshit but to sum it up: debt, drug use, lost jobs/friendships, criminality and so much cringe. God the cringe.   


&#x200B;

I agreed to do a wide evaluation regarding my mental health to spot symptoms of personality disorders, ADHD, autism, bipolar, schizophrenia, etc. I didn't match any disorder or neurodivergence. They suspected bipolar disorder but couldn't conclude the episodes were related to the disease or my drug use and therefore didn't give me a diagnosis. They offered continued medication after my ward visit since I was deemed high risk if I continued using drugs. After my evaluation though I am now deemed healthy and capable of working.

I have been without mood stabilizers and antipsychotics for months without any symptoms at all. Although this is without any drug use whatsoever.

Anyway to the point. This experience conflicts with what I've read on this subreddit and my overall understanding of bipolar type 1. Afaik one destructive manic episode qualifies one to be diagnosed. Technically I am healthy and my doctor doesn't require me to take medication. I am feeling confident I won't get sick again unless I use drugs recklessly.

Some made me feel like I was numb or in a fog. Some made me impossibly tired. Some made me gain weight and loss all motivation. But finally after about 5 years of trying, I found a medication regiment that ACTUALLY works for me. However lately, I have found myself struggling with wanting to take it at all. I recently missed a week, then a few more days after a few days back on. Now I know this is playing with fire. I know I can turn on a dime and this can go wrong in a million ways. I just wanted to know if I am alone in the struggle of knowing you need the medication but being tired of popping pills in order to feel any kind of normality. And I know taking medication doesn't make you any less of a person, but it is such a hard pill to swallow that I cannot function adequately without it.

They didn't disclose my own diagnosis to me. They just medicated me and then when I left the rehab they basically said ""just don't stop taking these."" And my young still relatively naive self didn't really push. I stayed on those meds for a few months after rehab and then dropped them. I didn't see the point to take medications for something I was never told I had and that I still sort of denied.

Anyway, eventually... I fall into a deep depressive episode.. I thought I had been fine for months even after dropping my meds but suddenly I'm having suicidal ideation and I realize while I'm in the ER and speaking to the psych team that I've actually been having symptoms for weeks. Symptoms of both hypomania and depressive episodes. 

Really I think it's been a mixed thing for the past couple months now and I feel like all my medications have done are really just make me a bit more careless or indifferent to some of the damage I've caused and in some ways am still causing. It's so hard to explain. This is the first episode I ever really recognize or that ever got this severe.

\--

Hello all. This is a bit of a ramble/story wrapped into a question. Last week, my psychiatrist diagnosed me with bipolar II. Since then, I've done a lot of reading and thinking, and I'm feeling quite conflicted about it all.

My entire life, I've felt that something was 'off' about me, that something inside of me is utterly rotten no matter how kind or normal I pretend to be. I've hated myself since I was about 12. I've always struggled to form lasting connections. I was a very moody, yet high-achieving, teenager. In times of high stress or in fits of self-hatred, I have self-harmed (but never in a 'serious' way that causes lasting physical damage, I have told myself). I've only made a suicidal gesture once in my early 20s, but I have spent countless hours 'ruminating' on suicide--but, at this point, I don't think I'd ever do it. Now I am a more emotionally stable and high-achieving, but still fundamentally self-loathing, adult. I've had years of mostly fruitless therapy; I've tried about 10 medications, mostly SSRIs, and none of them has done anything except make me sleepy.

The thing is, I don't fit the diagnostic threshold for depression. I'm more blank/empty than actively unhappy. Until recently, I had never been 'diagnosed' with anything, except (I would tell myself) being a whiny piece of shit.  I just thought it was my lot in life to never be satisfied. I *know* that when I have my 'episodes' of despair, which might last a few hours to a few days, that I will get over it soon enough. I know that when I go days without taking proper care of myself, when I am going through the motions at work, that I'll soon enough have a period when I am motivated to tidy my apartment, do laundry, pay bills, catch up on email, text the five people I've left on read, etc. It is the knowledge that my mood will improve that keeps me mostly functional during the darkest times, distracts me from (what feels like at the time) the unavoidable fact that I'd be better off dead.

A couple years ago, the struggles of returning to work in-person motivated me to seek help, and I was diagnosed with ADHD (inattentive type). It took some time to accept this diagnosis as well, but I thought finally! *this* was the breakthrough I needed--at last an explanation for my inability to stay 'on top' of my life, for always feeling out of place, for my mind working in strange ways that delights some people but seems to repulse most. Adderall has improved my stress levels, especially at work, and helped me from getting sucked as deeply into those brief obsessions that can take up all my attention for days at a time.

So, I saw this psychiatrist only so that I could have access to Adderall, nothing more. My mood has been much better overall since I started, with less severe lows.  What got my psych thinking about bipolar is that I've had one manic episode (SSRI-induced, last year).

Being a 'moody' and very online teenager, bipolar is something I've read and thought about over the many years that I've had to self-analyse and obsess about my deep sadness/emptiness, but I've always dismissed it. Since last week I've done more reading, mostly looking for personal testimonials of what it 'feels like' to live with bipolar II and to have developed coping mechanisms into adulthood. Where I am still struggling the most is that I don't relate to descriptions of hypomania. When I was briefly manic last year, I *did* feel fucking amazing--euphoric, creative, energized. Before I started fully losing my mind, it was actually really great. But in my normal ups & downs of life, I never feel like I have an 'elevated mood' or 'grandiosity' (how could I, when my self-esteem is consistently shit?)... unless I am misinterpreting what these 'feel' like.

**For those of you who have bipolar II and have thought more about the nuances of how it feels and presents itself, do you think it's possible that I've been properly diagnosed even though I am never happy or have inflated self-esteem?** I've tried googling this obviously but haven't found any accounts that totally jive with my experience. I have periods where I am slightly less sad (like, 7/10 instead of 5.5/10), where my mind feels more creative, and I have more energy to be social and motivation to attend to timely errands such as grocery shopping or laundry. I have brief periods where I feel consistently agitated, like I can't stop my mind enough to go to sleep, especially when I have an obsession of the week--but this is *tiresome* more than invigorating, and I self-medicate pretty heavily with weed. My everyday mood, even during those periods, averages 5-7/10 with occasional dips to 2-3. I would go so far as to say that (to me, it feels like) my mood is fairly stable, but it’s *motivation* (drive, optimism) that is perpetually inconsistent, which is why the ADHD diagnosis made sense.

I know this is long--it's very helpful for me just to have written this out and sent it into the void, even if no one can help. But if anyone can relate to my feelings, I would appreciate your insight or recommendations for YouTube videos/articles/ books that might resonate with me.",1678652550.0

843,World Bipolar Day: social media thoughts?,2,11pmza0,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11pmza0/world_bipolar_day_social_media_thoughts/,6,"This past year before I found my perfect medication regimen and really got my disorder under control, I became a lot more in tune with my bipolar II disorder & the stigma associated with it. 

I made it a point in my daily life to talk openly about it, to people close to me and sometimes strangers or coworkers- and although it was hard, I started casually mentioning in conversation that I was, in fact, bipolar. It was scary at first, but I found it important to make a part of the conversation because I’m outgoing, and so many people that know me would not ”ever think that” - whatever that means. 

Which is why I think it’s important to talk about and be more open about, because this disorder does not have a face.  

That being said, with world bipolar day coming up: what are your thoughts about social media posts on personal accounts regarding this? I know social media has changed, but aside from pictures of myself, family, my pets and boyfriend, I don’t get too deep. 

I guess I have fear of putting this personal information on the Internet, and it being tracked back to me and potentially used against me in the future or even the present.  

For example, I do not have the greatest relationship with my boyfriend’s family unfortunately, and I’m afraid this would be ammunition in their guns (“i knew she was crazy” etc).. and that’s just one small example. 

On the other hand, making a post about my personal experience may inspire at least one other person-either with bipolar disorder or any other sort of mental illness- to destigmatize it and feel more comfortable in their day-to-day life, in which case maybe that would be a difference enough in and of itself.

I’m actually stable and every time I think about taking them, I get nausea. When I do take them, I vomit so their practically ineffective anyways, I think it’s more of a psychological thing than a side effect as the nausea and vomiting is quite abrupt. It started with me forgetting to take them multiple times in a row, then when I realized I wasn’t going into an up or down, I just didn’t re continue them. Literally the only “symptoms” I have are increased appetite and irritability, the anger of which is only directed at one person, my grandmother, and even that is not increasingly dangerous or violent and with cause. She’s been nagging me more, getting upset with me for taking forever to do laundry when I physically can’t because her washer won’t wash my clothes, and more. On top of it all, she’s been in more chronic pain lately and has been sick on top of it so I think she’s just getting upset with herself and taking it out on me, which just makes me more upset. I don’t know what to do, she literally threatened to contact my dad and tell him this shit as of he’ll actually believe her and do something. I don’t think I’m in the wrong here.

She'll wait in the shadoes of the corner of your reverie , never tangible but alwyas there. In the dark the nightmares stalk a forever restless brain like a lion, patiently waiting but  never puouncing, His flaming orange stripes reflect the beliefs of Iccarus but the deep purple-blacks fleck between,  always a  reminder.  You try to escape by taking another pill, all the gouls snd ghost are, fot a while, silent and slowly it can all melt away, the blackness taking you in it's arms away for a that short break where  you can be free for those few predious hours before reality comes streaming through the windows again.  The rising of the sun brings with it its own spectres, the ones that have entangled themsleves around you into this twisted, symbiotic relationship; a co-dependency of madness. So I pray for just a few silent minutes where I can esape myself and be numb, yet unfrotunately these are infrequent and fleeting.

More powders, poisens, pills and tinctures, supposedly one for breakfast, pudding and tea will allow me to lead a normal life but I can feel my mind shutting down. One file at  time, slowly losing the hope and possibilities that once drove it forward.    A mind which used to burst with creativity has now become unbearaly numb, with he last reminients clawing and scratching at the inside of my skull. I've lost hope that they'll ever find a way to escape. I go though the motions of being a person in this meat suit but my skin crawls night and day because I'm still in there, I've just been chemincally labotmoised.

We can't be something to everyone and be true to ourselves.

The devil has the best lines.  I'm searching every crevice that could possibly, just maybe hold a remnence that might still be me: I'm not here. My reflection, where once shone back eyes full of passion and excitement.. now they are dead and lonely.  Where there was once a swirling pallette of dreams now sit two pieces of coal.

I try to find meaing in the faces around me but all I see are sucken sockets within pallid skin, eyes like mirros reflecting a drudgery we all try to pretend is not there. Pores filled with different shades of orange, desperate to be young again, desperate to be loved.  We all need to rember a time when we were in love with the world, when we saw it for the beautiful place that it is but minds are masters at consuming your thoughts, desires ..and when it comes to lyig to you they are they win the championship.  I miss the person I was beore it was stolen from me.

OPEN YOUR MIND

All time warped in to one. A cosmic reality , infinite possiblities, time twising into a loop and where do we stand before that ? This unimaginable vastness of space that we know so, so litle about filled with  matter, anti matter, dark matter, the things we can't even comprehend even exist. What do we truly understand? Nothing! We're pawns in a dream and we're arogant enough to actually believe out of infinte possibilites that we are some how different, special.  We are no  more than matter existing alongside eveything else. I wonder sometimes if sentience and conciouness are really a gift or a curse.  Not a new philosophical concept I know but still it nags at me

HIDE YOU'RE THOGHTS AWAY. IF YOU TRY TO TELL THEM WHAT YOU SEE, WHAT YOU HEAR ,WHAT YOU KNOW; iF THEY REALLY KNEW YOU THEN YOU WOULD NEVER ESCAPE.

You think you hide your sins but eyes can't lie, shining with make, trying to flutter the parts of you that you hate away. So scared to be seen as someome you'll do anthing to hide the shame and the guilt.  Covered in paper cuts that tell of your misgivings. All you really want is to leave but the noose is too tight now.  Fumbling to reach out and touch what everyone seems to agree is reality but you don't know what you're looking for.  You believe the best part is the best of you and no one is telling you that the best of you is the worst of you.  

So you want to know mania...? Here's an exerpt..

My mind is racing , the endless thoughts. The grandiousity because I know I am greater than everything anyone can comprend. I'm trapped in this body but I will achieve greatness and soon people will start to see that sanity confines us .  I see the truth, I can see what you wish you could see.  Every soul vibrates, the colours are unexplainable, I have no words for them.  It's a new spectrum. Everything brighter, more beautiful and the need to escape to where I'm really from overwhelms me. I can't express the constant surge of elation.

Come with me, I can open your mind to the reality that exists outside of what the majprity will never see,  Two minds, we can see together, intertwined , sanity left behind . You can hold my hands and the energy will shake and will flow through you. The vibraions freeing you from common law. I know it's time to leave and the tiger who waits to pounce with the contraints of depression, he doesn't scare me because I know I can easily out run him, I can outrun everyone so don't try to catch me because I will be long gone.

52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52...it's found me and it's everywhere.

THe portals, why can't they see it? The beauty is beyond compare.  The jazz has stared again, wherever I go but theres that speak easy jazz; threre's worse things to hear. WHY CAN'T YOU SEE AND HEAR WHAT I DO? The worst thing is I've lost what's the illness, what's the medicatio and what's me.  I hear the sounds that no one else hears.I see the thoughts that no one else hears. Orocole to the gateay but i can't pass though it because I.m stuck in this body. If I can peel away these confines I can move to the next realm.

Is a thought a reality? Do we create ourselves or are we created with the ability to  mould ourselves within the confines of the life we've been handed down?

856,Dream / Reality Confusion becoming annoying,3,11pe8wq,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11pe8wq/dream_reality_confusion_becoming_annoying/,6,"Since something like a week I've been having peculiarly weird dreams, generally negatively connoted, that I remember vividly and mistake for memories, only realizing later in the day or the next few days that the events I have in my memory did not actually happen and were just dreams / nightmares.

This is not really a new thing, I have already experienced this at times in the past and I've already talked about it with my psych who did not seem to be alarmed by that fact.

It's becoming a bit annoying though, and I've also been feeling quite stressed / anxious for a few days.

I sleep really well though, much better than I have ever in my life as far as I can recall.

Like, I can easily sleep 12 hours a night, and I'm not feeling depressed at all. To the contrary, despite this anxiety (that I attribute to an upcoming positive event) I feel like my mood is rather good. Maybe too good, I'm not totally sure.

My current sleep pattern is in stark contrast with a period of maybe 2 or 3 years of near daily crippling insomnia that was mainly due to horrible nightmares following a very specific trauma that I think I'm finally kinda getting over.

I am not taking recreational drugs, I am not in withdrawal either.

The only change in my medication there's been recently was the addition of methylphenidate to treat a recently diagnosed / supposed attention disorder and it's working well. The mood lift / anxiety is circumstancial I believe, because it started after a very specific event which happened already weeks after the introduction of the methylphenidate to my medication regimen. The methylphenidate did not have any adverse effect that I could feel after the first few days.

It's only this dream reality confusion thing I can't really explain and that is bothering me a bit.

I had hoped that taking the month off in October would lead to me feeling recovered and refreshed since I started a new job in November and wanted to be back in control, but these episodes left me with this deep sense that I will not be able to sustain working full time for many more years and just a general gut feeling that I’m not going to “make it” for a full lifetime. I’m still cycling, but not half as intensely. My periods of stability are way shorter than I can manage this last year.

About a year ago I found myself in the care of a slightly ‘trigger-happy’ new psychiatrist. 

She believed from the get-go that my diagnosis of bipolar disorder was wrong, and that I had ADHD. She referred me to the ADHD service, I got on medication, and she was right- I do indeed have fairly crippling combined ADHD. 

It seems that my new psychiatrist wasn’t content with my being well on my previous meds combo (2 antipsychotics, 2 mood stabilisers), so they set about taking them all away. Coming off the Lurasidone (Latuda) was unpleasant but no relapse to speak of, same goes for the Lamictal (lamotrogine). The Seroquel (quetiapine) 150mg to 50 was a bit unpleasant but again no real relapse to speak of. I then saw her in clinic and she told me that my lithium 1000mg was ‘overkill’ and dangerous, that I didn’t have a psychotic or mood disorder, and that I didn’t need to be on it. Both my partner and I were very dubious, but we went with it. 

Oh boy. 

1000mg-800mg was alright. I got a bit depressed at first, then everything became a bit too ‘real’ for my liking. I began to have an obsession with people’s eyes, and the ‘shadow people’ started appearing in our bedroom. I began seeing things at night and believed I could sense auras and presences around people and locations.

800-600mg I became super unwell. I started having very intense night terrors and my paranoia reached the point of me almost hurting someone because I thought they were trying to harm me. In amongst this I rapid cycled in between hypomania and quite severe almost catatonic depression. 

When I increased back up to 800mg the vast majority of the acute psychosis went, but I was still very anxious, manic at times and when I wasn’t manic, very depressed. It would be a rapid cycling type deal, but I was surprised how intense the psychotic symptoms were. I’d had them before before I was on lithium, so lo and behold they came back when I tried to come off it. I’m now on day 10 of 1000mg lithium and I’m back to baseline, admittedly shitting myself about seeing my psychiatrist tomorrow.

Now, I’m sure my psychiatrist means well but this whole ‘it’s just ADHD’ needs to stop, now. I don’t want a diagnosis, some words on a piece of paper are meaningless to me. I’m not seeking any kind of validation, but I’m now on day 10 of an increase back up to 1000mg lithium and I’m finally resembling my old self. I haven’t been able to work and I’ve really struggled to get anything done aside from a few household chores. I’ve also been a pretty nasty bastard to be around- the paranoia and the mania have driven me to some fairly extreme behaviours. Nothing criminal, but I’ve got some apologising to do.

How do I approach this whole episode with this psychiatrist? My primary care doc has made it very clear that if the psych tries to mess with the lithium again I’m to ask for a second opinion. 

Has anyone else dealt with similar before? Any nuggets of wisdom?",1678612420.0

I have Complex PTSD from medical trauma so this whole thing is extremely triggering. I keep making great progress in therapy and calming my anxiety, and I just get dragged back down again.

**Incident 1:** I had extreme nausea with a new medication so I took extra Zofran like 12 hours apart from my Promethazine. When I called asking about the med side effects, the nurse called me back in a full panic telling me to go to the emergency room and get my heart checked or they wouldn’t see me again. The ER doctor was SO chill, he said I knew my meds well and my heart was fine, and to lower my Zofran since I was taking more Promethazine. 

When I saw my psychiatrist, she said the nurse told her I basically panicked and took a bunch of meds. I told her that NEVER happened, and explained exactly what did. I told her I didn’t want to speak to the nurse anymore and she said I could message her directly instead. 

**Incident 2:** A few days ago, I wake up to a call from my psychiatrist’s nurse that I’ve violated the controlled substance agreement and my psychiatrist could drop me. I was SO confused and told her I’d been given permission from my psychiatrist to use an old refill. She mentioned that people sell Xanax and said she couldn’t say whether my intentions were good or not. (I have trauma with people not believing me in an abuse situation, so this has also been an absolute nightmare.) 

I called the pharmacy and it turns out they had second prescription but never told me, and they were the ones who did an auto refill from the wrong doctor. The pharmacist was just as confused because she said they would never let someone take out two of the same prescription. She said to have my psychiatrist call her and she’d tell her I’ve been getting refills appropriately.

My psychiatrist is out all week, so I’m terrified about what the nurse is going to tell her. I’m trying to get help from these people and literally shaking from stress. First I’m recklessly taking meds, then I may or may not be selling them?! 

My psychiatrist knows I can’t stand the nurse. I told her the nurse makes me cry every time we talk and is incredibly triggering. You know those people who act nice while saying mean things? They have this negative energy that literally makes you feel sick? That’s this nurse. She talks down to me like I’m 12. I certainly can’t do anything that would cause conflict with her. I plan on telling my psychiatrist how upsetting this was but that’s it.

Does anyone have advice on how I can handle this mentally? Especially since I have no choice but to know this nurse professionally.

Six months ago I shared my story with this community right before I went to jail.  I made it through to the other side. It was an interesting and at times terrible experience but it's over. To give you an idea I had a better time in Iraq. 

When I first went in, they didn't give me my meds for 5 days. I went into perhaps the deepest depression I've ever had in my life. It was awful.  I could barely speak without crying. Once I restarted my meds I had a couple days with mixed features followed by nearly two weeks of hypomania. A jail cell with a crack addict is NOT a place you want to experience hypersexuality. It was downright dangerous trying to stay sane, but I made it. (I wasn't attracted to the crackhead, just felt the urge to masturbate almost constantly).

After that episode I stabilized for the most part. I had several ""mini episodes "" of hypomania that lasted 3 days or so but no more major issues. I was very frustrated that my meds were nearly never on time. I was on a working unit and had to be up at 4am but often wouldn't take my zyprexa until 9:30-10, which made for some tough mornings. My wife fought all the way up to the jail superintendent to get us family counseling, which was great and amazing but also happened with just 5 weeks left.

Now I'm home again with my wife and son and I'm starting from scratch in a way- I have no insurance and my old psychiatrist discharged me when I went in. I've got a month worth of meds left, so there's limited time to figure it out. I am seeing my pcp next week and I'm hoping she will bridge me. Once that gets squared away I get to try to find a job with a record and as a registered sex offender. The good news is that I have a really incredible wife and my extended friends and family have all been extremely supportive as well. The future is uncertain but I won't face it alone.",1678556789.0
