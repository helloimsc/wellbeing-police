I don't know if I can get myself to go, I'm not too big of fan of old sci-fi. She knows I like this theater. It's called 5th Element, I don't think I've seen it.

11,Would I be stupid to ask my best friend that ghosted me to meet up?,5,11xjcbp,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/11xjcbp/would_i_be_stupid_to_ask_my_best_friend_that/,3,"Well, I (28F) guess that since I haven't dealt with my emotions in a healthy way, I might as well put it on Reddit for the whole world to judge. Here we go
My story starts in high school. we met my first day of school. Here in my state, 9th grade was in the junior high at the time. The night before my first day, I was dumped. Quite a crappy way to start a new school. I walked into my TV broadcasting class, and there he was. The guy of my dreams. Let's call him Mike. We soon became casual friends. He got back with his ex, and that was the end of that, or so I had thought at the time. 
Fast forward a few years, and I had just graduated high school. Through high school him and I were just good friends. We had the same friend group. And I always thought he was attractive but had no feelings for him at this time. Well, until that is, I started to see someone new. Then I started questioning myself, and we were all hanging out late one night, so I decided just to put it out there with him and figure it out. I was rejected by him. For the first time of many. I was embarrassed but relieved that I could move on with a new guy. But don't worry, I blew that up to, so still no new relationship. (I spent all of high school single. There are a few dates here and there, but there is nothing of value) 
Okay, so fast forward a few more years. I have a child and am stuck in an abusive relationship. I was able to get myself and my son out of that situation. Here, I am in a healing phase, Mike, myself, and my at the time best friend were hanging out, and I went to the bathroom. Next thing you know, my friend is running upstairs freaking out that Mike confessed his feelings for me to her. Mind you, he was inebriated, and by the time my friend and I were spazzing out about it, he was passed out of the couch. So I go home and try to open the opportunity to talk and hang out more with him. He pulls back, kinda goes ghost, and I tell him I'm sorry, let's just keep things platonic. 
Okay, so here I am, dating  now, taking care of my son, working. I'm just all around kinda happy. My besty calls me over to hang out. And drunk Mike verbatim confesses, ""  I don't not like you,"" but again after this confession. Radio silence. It's this time that I realize he just wants to keep me on a shelf. I accept that I love this man, but I feel like I will never be good enough for him. I decided I care so much about him that I would rather be his friend and repress my feelings and emotions than risk the potential of losing him from my life forever. And I was okay with that.  
Over the years him and I grew closer and closer as friends.  Literally, I trusted him more than anyone. He had helped me heal my trauma from my bad ex. Again, with my feelings being hidden, I notice more likes on my profile pics, him texting, and just talking to me more. Finally, one day, I get the urge and dye my hair green(I like fun hair), and we hang out that night, and he is just gushing over me. Mind you, we went to a local bar, and he was totally sloshed. I knew it was bad news, but for some reason, I went searching for pain and hurt because once he started confessing his real love for me.  My response was, "" Say all this when you're sober,""
Well, needless to say, we shared our first kiss, and since he was beyond drunk, I drove him home. And we hung out for a little while, making out, i made him promise me to talk to me and not go ghost in the morning knowing his history.  He wanted to hang out with me the next day, but something came up. After that, I noticed the text messages stop. He stopped everything with me, and I haven't talked to him since. This was over a year ago, and I have tried everything to heal myself but can't seem to go a day without thinking about the love lost. Last night, I had another emotional breakdown and contemplated asking him if we could meet up and maybe get myself some closure, but also, I feel like it doesn't matter. He really doesn't care. But I care, and my feelings are valid. He was one of my best friends for over 10 years, and then he just.. Disappeared... 
So would I be stupid if I asked my best friend who ghosted me to meet up, or is it just beating a dead horse?",1679410721.0

it's my first time posting and English isn't my first language so I'm sorry if it sounds a bit  mumbly  and weird...

I have been battling depression for the past 15 years or so and I feel like I'm starting to lose now.  I'm not suicidal or anything but I feel like I mentally break down on the daily basis now

I have absolutely no energy for anything after I come back from work and it's at the point where I just dropped down on the couch turn on the TV and don't even have the energy to switch the channel to a show I actually enjoy watching or to play video games

I get the overwhelmed very easily and I almost get anxiety attacks when people text me. Whenever I receive a message my first thought is somebody's going to attack me, not because I did something wrong but I'm sure that they will be upset and they will be really mad and I'm just too scared to open the messages... have been asking me my SO to handle my messages for the past couple days 

My SO and I just moved to a new place and I thought it was just stress of the move and the fact that we kind of isolated ourselves from all of our friends because we were busy packing and unpacking but simple house chores like dishes or laundry just overwhelm me to the point where I'm not able to do them anymore not to mention not to mention vacuuming. 

Tonight, my SO is at a conference in a different city and I just spent 6 hours and the same position on the couch I couldn't even bring myself to grab dinner.

And they can't talk about it to anybody because I feel like I'm being a burden on everyone, just because they're my friends it doesn't mean that they have to babysit me every time I feel down, if anybody has any tips on getting out of this slump and taking back my life, I will really appreciate it

I just feel so down on the all the time and I'm not sure what to do because I don't have a great experience with therapists, I just never found one that was a good fit to me. It takes a lot of time to find the service even longer to find a good one it just feels like I don't have the time it will take ornamental capacity to actually call people whom I don't know and convince them that I am troubled and broken enough for them to find time for me in their schedules and I don't feel comfortable writing to my doctor and asking for drugs or medication or whatever you want to call it because I just see it as a Band-Aid for the problem...",1679433217.0

Often i’ll look at my life through a lens of self-doubt, less-than-thou and the existential dread regarding my trajectory in life. On top of that a cold blanket of loneliness with little love being exchanged around me.

it’s difficult to have to manage being grateful for everything i have cus of the duality of everything. passionless job - but pays to keep my lil office, food, and life funded, have a great love for making stuff that fulfills me - not self esteemed to be a fully committed artist, i could go on.

There are a lot of things in my life I am not proud of/wish I had more energy to fix or improve but there are a lot of things I have in my life that some people aren’t so lucky to have. But the negative thoughts persist. Hopping back and forth between “look at these people, they’re doing so much better (or even the same) and they’re so much happier. Why am I not doing these things? Is this why they don’t like me/I have no friends)” and “I don’t deserve all these wonderful things I have. Someone else could’ve done a lot more with all the blessings I have.”

Life keeps going and I’m jogging behind it to keep up. I’m feeling tired, numb, random crying spurts, and angry at myself. How do I make this stop? How do I talk better to myself to keep me from sliding back into this? Are other people like this? Sometimes I wonder what normal productive people think throughout the day. Like when someone’s rude to them, when a problem arises, or at the end of the day, what do they think to themselves? Nice thoughts? Neutral? Idk this is probably also a rant. I feel emotionally constipated. I’ve fallen back to the pattern of not wanting to burden my partner (even though they always say it’s fine and they want me to share) and I called one of those hotlines but hung up because I didn’t know what to say.

It's his house and he is allowed to live however he likes and I'm thankful that I have a place to stay (I pay rent). But it's incredibly annoying that a grown man can't put his dishes in the washing machine and when I do it for him he says it makes him feel lazy. This is not the worst of it, he leaves heavy tools and at random places (like dinner table, sofa etc, and doesn't understand why I find it stressful to live in chaos). 

I've tried talking to him about a lot of these things but I don't know how to put this. He doesn't feel that there is anything wrong with living like this, I find it incredibly stressful and shameful.

It just means you sprint for 30 seconds, for example. It might not sound like it to you, but this is a very powerful exercise. There is a lot of science behind it.

This might end your depression, if you haven't tried it before or haven't done it as a routine for long enough before.

If 30 sec is too much, do 5 sec or 10 sec. And then maybe set a timer for an hour, and do it again after an hour. You've now implemented exercise as a part of your life, high intensity exercise.

 Just doing this before or after breakfast, or before or after dinner or lunch for example, will make a difference in the lives of *some* of ya. Simple as that.

*High intensity running refers to a type of exercise where an individual performs short bursts of high-intensity running, typically lasting between 10-60 seconds, followed by periods of rest or low-intensity exercise. This type of training is often referred to as high-intensity interval training (HIIT).*

I (F18, 6ft tall, unattractive, overweight) have been dealing with depression and anxiety all my life. Even though Im not diagnosed whatsoever Im pretty sure I have several mental illnesses including something neurodivergent like ADHD or Autism because my parents have always been overwhelmed by my behaviours or emotions. My parents or rather my mother are horrible people, they mentally and physically traumatized me bascially from the get-go. For example: My father broke my teeth while pushing me into a steel bedframe out of anger and my mother told me to die when I was 11 without reason. My mother always saw me as an extension of her reputation and public image and always yelled at me for my abnormal/childish behaviour. Ive also been bullied for like forever, even before Kindergarten I was the weird kid and it stayed like that till I graduated. I have never had any friends in my entire life until 7 years ago when I met my best friend, and she is kinda a red flag and toxic ngl, and about 3 years ago my other good friend and they are all I have.
Ive been thinking about unaliving for 6 years now but my friends, my pets and the fear of pain I have keep me from it. I have no motivation to do anything in life and I have an extreme apathy and hatred for people, which is ironic because Im currently working as a Caretaker for the disabled  (40h workweek and 515€ a month) because I was forced into it by my parents and my collegues told me I am not fit for this job. I am still living with my parents and they want to force me in another job immediately after my contract for this one ends. I dont want to do anything and I dont care if you see me as spoiled because of that I just want to make a lot of money either with an easy job or without working at all. My dream „job“ of course would be Sugar Baby but with my looks and personality that is not an option. Id like to get therapy and diagnosis but I dont have the time nor the money and there is none in my area (a village in a rural, german area). I am really desperate at this point so if any of you have good advice Id appreciate it. Pls refrain from mean comments, I have no self-esteem already.",1679346543.0

I had this crazy crush for so long and eventually, she told me the same. About a year in the making of being friends, we finally decided to maybe try a relationship about two weeks ago. However, after about a week together is when I was finally diagnosed with depression. We got drunk one night, and I spiraled something awful. I hadn't received my medication yet, so there was a lot of crying and probably being incoherent. 

This isn't an excuse, but I've never been in a relationship before, so I made a lot of pretty unfortunate mistakes. She is going through a lot right now, as am I, what with the whole recently being diagnosed thing, and I essentially dumped 23 years worth of unchecked and boiling emotion that I refused to acknowledge throughout my life. I know that isn't an excuse, whether I was drunk or not. But genuinely she has been the first person I have ever truly loved, I gave my virginity to her, for god's sake. I just wish I could go back. Take everything I said back. I don't even know what I said, just that there was a lot of crying.

I want to break down into tears. I want to scream. But I can't. I think I've gone catatonic. My body is on autopilot and my brain is crying out for help.

So I am not the person being bullied, a kid I see gets bullied everyday.

I am at a loss and I am pretty new to this school I don’t understand why someone does not do something to help him I’ve told a couple teachers and nothing seems to have helped I honestly just don’t understand why. He has never said a word not even to me and I am always super nice to him, he even flinches if I touch him. He seems so scared, I am not Mr. Popular myself and I have no influence on others here. I have came to his aide also to try to stop the abuse but get caught in the crossfire myself so much to the point I was called a fag lover. But I can stand up for myself. It is not just verbal its also physical abuse nothing that can hurt him physically I don’t think but what I have witnessed is gum thrown in his hair, stuff thrown on him being spit on even stuff stolen from him.

I’m 23 years old and I’ve been working off and on since I was 15 and now I can’t keep a job anywhere because working makes me so anxious and honestly scared but it’s mostly the constant noises coming from all around you. I have always had this huge pit in my stomach and this overwhelming feeling of loneliness and being empty. Honestly I’ve never been satisfied to be honest. I feel so useless and fucked up to the point where I just want to die and I almost don’t care how I die. I held my first job in my tiny hometown located in Tennessee as a cashier for an Ingles Market age 15 to 18 and since then I just can’t keep a job and I even had times when I worked at Ingles that they were going to fire me because I would have nervous meltdowns and run to the bathroom or the back of the store at just any random time and sometimes they weren’t even triggered by something and I would blow up on coworkers and my managers because apparently me going to the bathroom every two hours because I have two periods a month and sometimes I’ll even skip my period up to 6 months and I know I’m not pregnant because I had ovarian cysts horribly as a teenager and in my early teenage years and it gave me major scar tissue plus I was on Nuva Ring up until I had my tubes permanently removed once I turned 22. I have been fighting to get my tubes removed since I was 16 because I knew I could never be a good mother because in my mind I would hate my child. I feel like having children really ruins a lot of people’s lives I’m sorry but you guys are raising brain dead children who are hyper obsessed with their tablet and watching tv constantly. I’ve never had any sort of motherly instinct at all even as a child and I would never want to put any innocent baby in this world right now and especially knowing that their own mom hates them for simply existing and being here. I hated baby dolls especially the ones that made noise so instead my mom got me two pet birds and I miss them so much 💔 idk I know that was an extremely long story for nothing but LONG STORY SHORT : I hate my life and I’m still in the same town I grew up in and have experienced so much trauma here. No one will hire because I’m extremely unstable and suicidal. I can go through 4 different emotions all within 2 minutes for absolutely no reason EVEN AT WORK and ending on how much I hate myself for never succeeding in life no matter what it is. I didn’t even graduate high school.. I was so sheltered as a child and abused every day and I just can’t get rid of this empty feeling I’ve had since I was a child.

People also say that you really shouldn’t put things on your friends that are better left to professionals and I do see a professional but in all honesty the comfort of telling someone I know feels needed. 

But I think I’m also scared of it. I don’t want to put stress like that on any friend, I already know I bring people down just by existing. I’m scared that I’ll cry because I hate vulnerability and even though I really want to experience any kind of comfort, the idea of allowing that to happen feels terrifying. I feel like I’d never be able to look at them again or like who I am would change permanently.

I (27F) live in Europe. I've been reading posts on Reddit for a while, looking for advise. But now is the first time I'm posting myself. I just want to get this off my chest with people who have maybe experienced the same feelings and thoughts as I have, and maybe could understand how I feel and could tell how they handled it.

Brace yourselves, because this is going to be a long post.

In short, I have self sabotaging habits, no self confidence an am constantly beating myself up with negative thoughts. I cry on a daily basis and wallow in self pity and guilt.

I have a lot to say, but don't know where to begin.

I have currently been working as a webdesigner for an adult education centre and also work there as a part-time teacher for 4 years. But it hasn't been too great so far. I've barely grown in my capabilities.

In this webdesign job, I maintain the websites of ceveral education centres. I have occasional meetings with a developer and the people from the education centres to see how we can optimize the websites better this school year.

I'm such a perfectionist that my job (and my life) is suffering. When I started, I had my boss who guided me and told me what to do and when. I feel that when I have a deadline and a clear briefing of what to do, I do a good job. But over the years, this responsability of planning, discussing, organizing and participating in meetings and designing for the websites has grown to be my responsability now (obviously).

I'm horrible at planning and determening the scope. I get lost in the details and also am a bad communicator. I can't communicate well in meetings with developers and the education centres. Sometimes I get brain fog, I can't process well what they are saying and more often than not my brain goes blank. I also don't know what part of information I don't understand. I should take the lead in these meetings, but I can't. I pay too much attention to being scared what they are going to think of me. I try to prepare as much as I can, by writing down what I'm going to say and discuss, but in such a meeting you can't predict how it's gonna go. I dread it all. I'm too scared to make a mistake.

Over time, I began lacking in performance. Some tasks take weeks to complete, what in the beginning only took one day. It's preceded by a huge storm of self doubt, beating myself up, hypothetically punching myself in the face for not starting, etc.

When I need to check something with the developer, it takes days to get myself to discuss it with him. I always feel that I won't be able to convey what the clients want. I've had many pointless meetings, where he just says: 'Sorry, we won't be able to do that because of this programming reason'. And I just go, like 'OKay.' instead of asking why or how it can be done otherwise. It's like I just don't think it trough.

I also feel like I lack significantly in knowledge about web designing, important technical things about a website performance, project management, etc. But those things are easy to grow in, if I just would take the time to better myself in those areas, there's so many free resources like Youtube and online courses. But those things make me think about work and school. It feels like I'm working all the time.

I thought of switching jobs, but that doesn't make sense, because it's me that is the problem. If I don't fix my attitude, it would be the same thing all over again.

I learned a bit of everything at school, I learned a bit of HTML and CSS (but it took so much time to understand), graphic and web design (but I haven't kept up with design rules and principles, new trends, ... in years. In fact, I'm still using Illustrator for webdesign). Also, I realised very quickly that I'm not the type to be creative. I feel so much anxiety for a blank piece of paper. I got through school by just scraping by.

I also learned a bit of Project management, we had to do a group project for a real client. And I got through it by bossing everyone around, by reflecting my perfectionism on everyone. When I had to talk with the client, I felt like a child, really uncomfortable. My only thought was, I just want to get out of here. When I look at it now, It was just because I had no experience with clients and stuff.

Anyway, I also haven't made a lot of friends at school, just acquaintances. I'm so fucking shy. I only have one real friend, who recently has outed himself. He told me that he feels very at ease with me because I don't judge him. It's weird, because I always thought I was a bad friend for not contributing much to the friendship, not taking initiative, being to quite, ... I thought maybe I'm not that bad after all.

I try to be more outgoing and try to take initiative to get to know people. Taking initiative is one thing, but the next step, actually talking to people, that's hard, man!

I like to travel, even on my own, but when I meet people, that's the hard part.

Whenever I meet someone, I feel so guilty because, I'm not interested in what that person has to say. I quickly feel burned out for stressing too much and I want to get out of there. I also don't tell much about myself to people, I prefer it that way, because then they can't judge you. And when I do tell something about myself, I sound so forced and insecure and indifferent, like I don't even like what I DO actually like.

It sounds silly, but recently I've found a new hobby where I feel for the first time, I've finally overstepped my own boundaries, I've come out of my comfort zone. I joined a dance school, it's so fun! And for the first time I'm actually proud of myself! They always say you have to find people with similar interests, I try to talk to the other people at the dance class, but it's like I'm talking from behind a wall. I don't get very far. I try to join in, but I'm afraid to share my opinion on things. I get stressed and I prefer to stay quit. I know to get better at this, I need to practice more and it takes time. But every time I try, it just feels like I'm starting all over again, from zero.

I recently joined a youth travel group to make a trip to France. I instantly got the reaction 'Why are you always so quit? Don't you like it here? Are you going along on this trip against your will?'. It feels like this trip itself was already a big step for me, if people could just see that! I can't go from 0 to 100 in an instant, it takes time, so much time!

I really admire creative people like my dance teacher and that's probably why I chose to study something like graphic and webdesign. Maybe it's because they reflect all the things I want to be.

I also feel hopelessly behind everyone else. I was born 3 months too early. School was never easy. Every subject was hard. My parents had to sacrifice time after work to explain everything again in simple terms so I could understand. More often than not, it would end with me in tears and my parents shouting out of frustration and tiredness. As I got older, I was very grateful and understood they did it out of love, but also understood what they sacrificed. This pattern kept on going until I got out of school at 20. They didn't have to explain every subject, but still they were more busy with my schoolwork than any other parent would.

I have a younger brother who is the complete opposite of me. I always wonder: 'We got the same upbringing. How is it that you ended up that way and I ended up this fucking way?'

I recently studied after work to be a teacher and graduated. But I can't feel proud of myself. I feel like I sold myself short. I kept within my comfortzone and prevented myself from growing.

I don't have good habits, I eat a bit too unhealthy, I'm defenitly not fat, but I could certainly do better and eat healthier. I am a horrible procastinator and often procastinate work to the weekends. Eventually, I get it done, but with al lot of frustration, crying, beating myself up about it, etc. I also don't have a good sleep schedule. I feel like night time is the only time I can be myself and can do what I want, I search for direct dopamine hits like videos on Youtube, social media, ... with the result that I'm always exhausted. It feels like I'm doing everything to ruin myself.

I know what I have to do to better myself. But it feels so overwhelming, because I have to better so much about myself. Where do you get the energy to get up and battle all these bad things about yourself, when you're feeling so low and energy drained?

I'm 27 but still live with my parents. I'm in a place where I can't live without them. I rely too much on them. Mostly for advice to calm myself down and to reason with my negative thougths. When I've spoken with my parents when I've had a bad situation at work, etc. I feel a bit better. But recently I've come to the realisation that I'm so pathetic for relying on my parents. I have such a good bond with them, but I should actually learn to do al these things on my own. I'v recently thought it would be better if I would live alone or to go cohousing. Most people my age can't wait to leave their parents. I should learn how to save for a house, but It's currently very expensive to buy or rent these days. When I would live alone and only rely on myself, maybe that would force me to see the importance of my job, of my life, of having friends, of being independent, ... Maybe it would convince me to start learning how to drive instead of going everywhere by public transport. I think at first, I would feel horrible and a lot of things will go wrong, but it would be for the best maybe?

I have never had a boyfriend, right now it feels like something magical, like something that's never gonna happen. I had brief 'relationships' in the past with three guys. I ended it every time after a few months, because I realized I didn't love them and was just in it to finally feel loved because I can't love myself. I completely effaced myself and did things I am not proud of and cringe about until this day. I dream about having a relationship with a great guy and go have adventures together, go travel together in a Volkswagen van all over the world, going camping, hiking, learning about different cultures, trying different food, ...

God, I feel like I'm throwing the best years of my life away! And I can't get out of this hell hole I created myself. I know all the things I've been feeling are only in my head, imaginary, but it feels so real to me!

I'm living a life I don't want to live, I'm a shy wall flower, a grey mouse, ... right now I live for my work, each day I try to survive. I don't pay attention to myself. I don't feel girly of womenly at all but I would love nothing more than to wear makeup, wear lovely dresses, develop my own style, let my hair grow so it flows in the wind, ...

To end on a positive note, I have one more thing I'm proud of. I learned Japanese in evening classes for 3 years and can speak basic Japanese. So I got that going for me.

Thank you for making it until the end. I believe I did a good thing, because I couldn't take it anymore! I have had countless breakdowns where all the negative thoughts come through all at once until the point where I thought it maybe would be better for everyone if i wasn't there anymore. I feel like a huge pathetic burden on the world and I should just end it. But I'm still here, so let's survive another day.

I was homeless with 2 cats. It was hard to couch surf and/or find a place to stay for one or two cats. Me, personally I didnt care if I was under the bridge or whatever but I couldnt provide for my little guys and it killed me.

My brothers have not called me a single time. My mom tries to help but I know she doesnt know what to do or say. Shes the only person I have had honestly, but I know its too much for her. The worst is I dont have anyone to share my day with or anything. I often find myself grabbing the phone to call someone only to realize that tere isnt anybody left.. Im so fucking lonely its killing me.

I went back to working after a few weeks after her death, got my kitties a paid place to stay. A cat hotel if you will. And I have worked hard ever since. I found an apartment and everything seemed to start calming down.

But depression quickly took over. I have not moved from my spot for few months now smoking weed, playing video games and gambling. I live with piles of garbage and shit and am over a month behind in rent. This needs to stop now and this is why Im typing this.  


I cant believe I let it get this bad..... I believe can still fix it if I just cand find the strength to do the biggest cleanup in my life and work extra shifts for missing rent. I really feel like Im starting to climb the Mt. Everest without any gear, but it's do or die at this point.

Tension at work makes me not want to go there. I have been on a paid vacation for a week and plan to go to a doctor to get time off to fix my depression.

Im really trying hard to get this place cleaned tonight taking baby steps to ""start over"". But this is such a huge mess and theres so much to fix that I feel so overwhelmed. Wish me luck.

Its hard to get professional help since I live out of my home country and I just needed to let this out somewhere. I know nobody truly cares but me, even if I do and thats ok. I have accepted that I cant get physical help and Im trying my best to so what is neccessary.

Please share how you got over similiar periods. Or did you clean your room/apartment? Did you go out today? Whatever baby steps you took today, please share. I need it right now.",1679259734.0

I’m in my early 30s. I’ve been out of the trauma I experienced for longer than I was in it. I am reviewed by a psychiatrist every few months but have been getting steadily worse for a long time. 

I’ve been medicated, unmedicated, participated in ongoing long-term psychotherapy, supported myself as best I can socially & financially, engaged in healthy diet and exercise routine, yoga, sleep hygiene, breath work, arts, outdoors, less screen time… etc. 

This list isn’t fully formed but I feel I have tried my best to try for over 15 years to help, better & nurture myself on a lot of different fronts but I cannot shift or even minimally improve feeling so depressed and anxious all of the time.

I’m SO worn out and exhausted. 

I try to speak to psychiatry and they just want to give me more meds which have never really worked and I’ve have such bad side effects which over the years have really impacted my ability to do a lot of things. 

I have self harmed from a very young age and cannot stop wanting to hurt myself. For the past few years I’ve managed to do this less often but it’s constantly on my mind, and if I can sleep I then dream of hurting myself regularly. I still have “blips” and go back to self harm…and then the shame comes. 

I feel guilty even complaining - I’m in the uk and realise that even accessing mental health support seems to be a privilege. I work in mental health support and feel like an absolute fraud and imposter. I know life is effort and it’s hard for everyone but I can’t take much more of this and I’m getting into the headspace of “why should I?”

When I try to talk to people I am close to I feel worse - I’m so ashamed, embarrassed & guilty afterwards that I hurt myself or want to and use a lot of energy trying to not.

I can’t do this much longer, and the feeling that I just can’t cope with life gets bigger every day. I hate myself and am getting worse.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When I was 8yrs old my parents and I immigrated to another country, so I went to primary school there and then secondary school. You know small town, it was nice. Had friends, and we knew everyone. I did well as a student at the start, was great at maths, etc.. but I don't know but somewhere along the way I got a little bit lazy ie. not doing homework and stuff. I quote my maths teacher ""You're a smart boy who enjoys being lazy"". Which looking back was true. It was like a yoyo effect, sometime I'd do it if I felt like it, and other times nah. My parents would always be after me to read books, I'll be honest my attention span couldn't go for more than 5 pages. I was sportive I guess, and played football any chance I got but sometime it would feel like it was hard to breathe chest pains like. Anxiety! Something that I found out about years later. went to y local gp, and she sent me to do scans and stuff but nothing was wrong. and nothing was said about anxiety. I think it was me worrying about my dad's job and the work permit depending on it, so it was like fear in the back of my head ig.

That was in limbo was a good 2 years. By the time I was 16yr old, finished my(o level) decent marks. around that time my dad's job visa was extended to 1yr, so till the end of the 4th year. 4th years always go on holiday but I couldn't go. They went to Italy. Right after the school year finished within a few weeks my dad's visa ended. He didn't an extension or other offers so we had to leave and go back to our home country. My mom had to leave her job as well. I had to leave behind a life with friends.

&#x200B;

So we go back to our home country. We had to live in the family house with my grandmother and my uncle. It was a fairly big house so we all fit in. My dad owned 50% of the house anyway so no one could say we couldn't stay there. A bit of background on my grand and uncle. My grandma didn't like my mom like at all. Hate would be a suitable word, she would tell my dad that my mom would be at other men or steal from her that kind of thing. She knows how to play my dad when her daughters need money which was a frequent thing even when we lived aboard. My uncle is the elders sibling, unmarried, and still looking for his Jennifer anniston or nothing. He was 50 at the time, fat, unlikeable, and a pervy prick. 

&#x200B;

So when we got back to my home country I had to find a school through the ministry of education, We presented my certificates, letters, and grades. I had already done my O level equivalent aboard but the Education board here just look at it and said we are putting me in 3rd year secondary school and that I would have to redo my o level in years(the 5th year). So I would be losing 2 years. My dad agreed to it because of pressure from his brother saying it would be fine, so my dad didn't say anything, returning to his old pattern. So I went back to school as a 3rd year. It was weird and difficult to fit in as I spoke English my whole life and now I had to speak a different language. The jokes and culture were different. I mean I tried, I really truly wanted to fit in but either I began to feel like an outsider in my own country. On top of that in school I got subjects like chemistry, biology, Eco, and Accounting. Subjects I haven't touched since 1 year of secondary school. So I was expected to pick up new subs and get a passing grade within a few months to move up a grade for the next school year. That's when fear/ depression started. Crying alone in my bedroom. Was told multiple times to suck it up. I was stressed, and on top of that, I could hear/see the manipulation around me. My gran kept planting seeds in my dad's head, and naturally, fights began. I remember seeing that bitch smile when my dad started accusing my mom. She properly enjoyed it. She didn't think anyone noticed but I did. She tried the same tactic with me, giving me money, and attention but when she was called out on it, she began telling me she would enjoy me getting a new stepmother. The joy she would have kicking my mom out. So me being the little shit I am, I began recording her knowing my dad would never believe me otherwise. Showed my dad the recording and videos but nothing he said his mother would do that. But after a while, I think he notices her ways. So he stopped being close. At that point, I was a few days from turning 18yrs old. So I decided I wanted to leave school as I had my O-level and do it as a private candidate for my A-Levels. My parents were behind me for it. The other not so much but I didn't care. I signed up for it and left the school system. I did private tutors for my subjects, which I thought was a good idea since at school I was stuck with shitty subjects, whereas I could choose the subs I was good at. At this point, I stopped speaking at all to my uncle as he would start fights. He didn't believe in the private exam paid for a level. He only believed in the school system. So he'd punch my door, turn off the internet, and stuff. I remember him telling my dad that I would be a disappointment in the future, I would make my parents cry. I would never be able to look at myself in the mirror hating myself etc. I was never going to pass, Why even bother with this as I would fail again and again? 

&#x200B;

At the start, I studied full force but as the fights and words kept coming, I think got to me. I studied less and less. Started skipping tuition. Drinking alone. In my head, I was like ""I gonna fail anyway"" so might as well. So by the end of the year, I did the exam and within a month or so, got the result I failed badly(Ungraded) on three subjects and got a pass on maths. My parents didn't shout and rinse me, they just said to take a few weeks off. then study hard for the next year, try again son. It happens, we all fail. But at this point failing got in my head. Was very depressed, though I didn't show it, I was. My hand started shaking in anxiety, I would black out sometimes randomly. I remember I felt my heart beating, a butterfly in my stomach then I blacked out and fell for a few mins in a supermarket. Still failed the 2nd time. and 3rd. At this point, we moved out of that house and into a small rented apartment. Each year I said I will do better and stuff. Exercise and get fit but never do. Every year. I got a job at Techworld for 2yrs then lost it during COVID. Now I'm 26yrs old. Still ever crushed by fear and depression. Stuck. no friends no life. The one or two friends I had during my 18/19 went to uni, and stopped hanging out. Now they have jobs and new friends. I'm honestly embarrassed with myself. I don't look at myself in the mirror. I don't know where to go from here. I feel like I'm still that kid at 16yr. ANY WORDS OF ADVICE? I understand if you judge me, I am a loser.",1679253979.0

I was diagnosed with mild depression and anxiety in November 2022. Been taking Zoloft and tofisopam ever since. 

Actually I got much better but every Sunday is like a burden for me. It’s hard for me to get up so I do my work from bed. My productivity drops to minimum, even though from Monday to Saturday I can manage work and daily tasks on my own. Like, I can stay in bed until 3 pm, not feeling sleepy, but not being able to get up. And when I do, I’m usually not productive at all — my place is still a mess and I’ve got nothing to eat at all.

Let's say I wake up at 9AM, I probably won't turn my light on and actually get up until 2 or 3 PM. And it's really effecting my life at this point. 

When I wake up I have literally zero desire to get up and do anything. I'll lay in bed thinking about the fact that I have chores, I need to eat, I want to watch a movie, etc. but I just feel like I can't do it. I'll lay there and do nothing.

But the issue isn't being tired or needing more sleep. It's just that I have *zero* motivation to... be alive, I guess.

74,Recovering from anti-depressants,2,11vee1m,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/11vee1m/recovering_from_antidepressants/,2,"I was on and off on different types of anti-depressants for around 10 years. Some of them helped for a week or two but after that I felt worse. So I was prescribed higher doses and combinations. I think the story is familiar to many. It's been 10 years now since I decided that I'm not gonna touch any of those ever again.

Before that time period I was a very calm and stable person. I was very tolerant to pretty much anything in life, e.g. I didn't understand why someone would get irritated of another person, queueing, traffic, you name it. 

But I was a bit lost and lacking the feeling of purpose in life so I made the crucial mistake and went to see a professional. And another mistake was to trust all those doctors without doing any own research.

To my question then. Has any of you been able to recover from a longer use of anti-depressants?

I'm not the same person anymore. I get mood swings (short term and long term), I get irritated extremely easily, I'm impatient and have difficulties concentrating. I cry easily, I give up after any hardship, big or small, I have memory issues. 

All the emotions in general are now too overwhelming, when I had pets the love felt painful and not pleasant, and I might start crying endlessly for being so grateful for having a home, enough food and a priviledge to live in a safe country. Due to this I can't listen to music, it's too much to handle. And when I start laughing on some funny thing it's difficult for me to stop.

To me these symptoms are related to damage in brain. People that suffer from brain damage after an accident are many times with similar symptoms. And people are telling me that ""you nowadays act like my father after he had a stroke"".

That scares me. Has anyone suffered from this type of change in personality after medication, and if so, have you found anything that helps?",1679210154.0

In a short my mother is a very gaslighting, my way or the highway kind of person. She'll make you feel like shit just to get her way, she'll make you terrified of her just to get her way. She's always throwing harsh insults at me. She used to hit me until I was bruised but she stopped but I don't want to grow up looking down at my arms remembering where bruises and self harm marks were. I'm so tired it's not something I can take anymore it's not. I pray that God takes me away everyday. I'm homeschooled and I have no friends and I'm not allowed to leave the house. I'm not allowed to talk to any family apart from who's in the house. Which is only my mother father and sister. They've always been so much nicer to my sister. There's always been moments where she has not respect for anyone or anything yet my parents just let her be. She'll say stuff like I don't love you to my mother. She'll drop drinks and glasses and through all of this she won't get yelled at. My father is always busy if it comes to me. He's like a stranger in my house at this point. I feel like he doesn't even know me. My sister being as spoilt as she is purposely gets me in trouble sometimes. If I were to even drop a little bit of water my mother would tell me how annoying and worthless I am. She does it in such a toxic way She'll say it in an indirect way so that if I ever bring it up she'll say l never said that. Like when I was younger she hit me so hard and said she couldn't care about me unless I was passed out on the ground. I brought it up and told her she didn't care about me unless I was dying and that she said that herself but she just said she never said that but she did. I always hear people saying they have a mother or father like mine and that they understand but they don't. They're no being homeschooled by that toxic women. Their not taking tests under her watch. Your not staying in the house 24/7 with her. It's not like you don't see your cousins. I'm so tired of people telling me they understand but they don't and they always say that I am just being ungrateful or dramatic. I've done school from 7am -3am because my mother broke a glass and was in a bad mood. I was only 7. I ended up with so many harsh words and bruises that night.  I'm so tired I know people are going to say it'll get better.  I can't wait for it to get better its been like this since I was 7 I wanted to end it all at 8 I've done self harm at 10 and attempted at 10. I'm 13 and I still suffering I can't call cps cus I don't want them to get in trouble, but I can't keep living like this. I don't know what to do it's so tiring I just want to quit idc if it'll get better I'm not waiting until 18 or 19 to move. I don't want to grow up with all of this trauma I just want out. I don't want to talk to them about it they won't understand. They don't care either. My mother has done alot for me such has convince my dad to get me and my sister phones and playstations. But money and expensive things can't make me forget and it can't make me forgive. It can't make me happier. It not like we have a big house or alot of expensive things.

I just bought a car(my first) and I’m really proud of that but I can’t shake the thought that when I get out and walk away that I forgot something, E-brake or windows or doors not locked.

82,Angsty post from an old man,1,11v70jb,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/11v70jb/angsty_post_from_an_old_man/,5,"So, first time poster of something like this. Forgive me in advance. Sort of a throwaway 

I've been struggling with depression for almost 20 years. It comes and goes, ebbs and flows, but it's been there in the background the whole time. I've taken different medications (Wellbutrin, Zoloft, lamictil) with varying levels of success. In fact I've taken Wellbutrin on a pretty regular basis since my early 20's with moderate success. 

Over the last five years though, it's effectiveness has diminished: It still does something for me, but far, far less than it did before. 

But it's hard to notice that happen, slowly, from the inside.  Like the proverbial frog being boiled alive, I never noticed the change, or was too unaware and slow to pick up on them. My racing mind too sluggish to perceive. 

Things that used to interest me, hobbies I once loved, and still desperately want to participate in are out of reach, too much of a task to take on. paying attention long enough to finish more than a few pages of a book seems impossible. The things I like to do became the things I used to do. Slowly slipping away

Once the calm, collected person with my romantic partners, I now found myself angry and lashing out. Withholding kindness and affection to one who so desperately just wanted us to be happy together. I instead blame my behavior, my anger on her and continue to lash out. 

Friends start to notice changes. I reach out less and less. I'm not engaging with them on things that we have in common. They notice I'm not really working on the things that used to interest me.  I rely on them to engage and to keep the relationship going. A voicemail I left causes a friend to text back almost immediately ""You don't sound like yourself. Are you ok?"" I return the text with a lie, telling him I'm great. 

Day to day tasks become more difficult. I am able to work, but executive function there and elsewhere suffer. Remembering to pay a bill becomes almost impossible, and actually going through with paying it, well, that'll take me all week

I drink more and more. Never before or at work, but regularly before 5pm. It slows the racing thoughts in my head. Quiets my mind. Almost let's me enjoy the moment.  Let's me feel something else for a bit. 

The relationship ends. My lashing out and other unhealthy behaviors finally became too much for her. I did things behind her back that, while not cheating, were definitely dishonest. 

Where I used to blame her, I see she was in the right. I see the harm I caused to our life together and to her as a person. I accept the blame. 

So now I find myself alone. Trying to take some of the advice I was given in my in the now-ended relationship. 

I have stopped drinking. So have at least made that change. That just leaves me more time with the racing thoughts.

Trying to find a therapist who works for me. I've seen a few over the years, even recently, but have never made a good connection with one. One who I trust to help figure me out. 

Finding a psychiatrist to fiddle with my medication. But it's taking so long. ""Try this for six weeks. We will see how you feel then"" when I don't know if I can spend another six days feeling this way. 

On top of that, neither of those services or medication are cheap, so that's an added stress.

I know this all sounds mighty angsty. I'm almost 40 and in some ways never stopped feeling  as I did when I was a teen. As though I haven't developed at all since then. 

To top it all off, I feel slightly guilty for having all of these problems. I'm a cis-(mostly)hetero white male with what should be a good and easy life, if I'd stop messing it up. I shouldn't have any of these problems. And even if I do, I should keep them to myself, as the world is much more harsh on most of its inhabitants

I find myself alone without much of a support network around me, due mostly to my withdrawn behavior as the depression got worse

What do I do here?  How do I move forward? This seems like boilerplate depression. There has to be a simple fix",1679188480.0

I normally have low days 5-6 times a week, but today has been extremely taxing and just so hard to push through it all. (instead of curling up in a ball in my bedroom while ignoring all my responsibilities)

So far I have made myself workout this morning, shower, talk to my spouse one on one, play with my son, interact with my dogs, focus on what I'm grateful for, breathing techniques, viewing my life and situation pragmatically/logically, and acknowledging my emotions/self compassion. 

I feel like I am sabotaging my own weekend and slowly eroding away my husband's happiness by being like this. I can honestly see it being exhausting to just be around someone who can't ""get over it"" or ""past it"". I have a son who will eventually be old enough to see through my mask on days like these and that breaks my heart to think about.

I have a history of depressive episodes and this past year has been the worst of my life. I know everyone reading this is going through stuff too, but for those that have made it through hard times.. how the hell did you do it?
I had a toxic relationship that I left last month and I don’t feel heartbroken over it, I just kinda miss her at times but I moved out of town for a transitional period so I can figure out where I want to settle down. I thought this would be a good option and now everyday I spend in my home with my dog and I feel bad for her because I don’t do anything. But she seems to be okay with it thankfully. But I have no energy to keep up with any of my old hobbies. My past self would be disappointed. I quit my line of work because I can’t stand the shitty people that belong in it. I was starting to become a piece of shit myself before I left. But now I sit here feeling disappointed because I am working a minimum wage job and do nothing else with my life while in the past I was making more money than anyone my age and I still did shit on my own time

88,Not sure what to do.,1,11uui9a,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/11uui9a/not_sure_what_to_do/,4,"I'm not sure where to start. I've been deeply depressed my whole life, but the past year has absolutely destroyed me like none other. I found out I was pregnant in December of 2021 by the man who had been mentally and verbally abusing me for the past year. I'm 22 years old and we share a 6 year age gap, so he had other children by another woman which never bothered me, except he did not care about my pregnancy because he had already done this three times with the mother of his other children. I debated on aborting the pregnancy for about two weeks after finding out but I just couldn't, the guilt was so horrible that I couldn't eat or sleep. It was all I thought about. I spent my birthday alone the following month, he didn't even buy me a card. My parents took me out to dinner which made the day better, but it was so disappointing coming home to nothing from the man I was having a baby with. Not even a happy birthday. Weeks later, my dad had a heart attack and had open heart surgery. You can imagine the stress and anxiety was through the roof. It was horrible. In February of 2022 I found out he had been cheating on me for the past 3 months and had even taken the woman to a sex club where they had unprotected sex, putting me and the baby at risk for so many STD's..That night we argued, he hit me, pulled me by my hair, dragged me, and slammed the door on my chest and pregnant belly, then threw all of my stuff outside. I made the mistake of staying. He cheated the entire rest of my pregnancy. I worked all 9 months, 11 hour days in fast food, bought everything my daughter needed completely alone, and took care of his 3 children on my maternity leave AND with a newborn. All at 21 years old..

On Father's Day he gave me covid which he got from a night out at clubs with other women. I was 30 weeks pregnant, miserable, suicidal, and exhausted. While being quarantined together I found two other women in his phone. I made him pay for a full STD screening that day. $800. He continued to cheat on me up until I gave birth and even 2 days postpartum. It never ended. I finally moved out of his house and into my grandma's when my daughter was 3 weeks old after he threatened to choke me while holding her. I remember before leaving I would spend hours crying on the bathroom floor while him and my daughter slept. I hated life, I didn't know if I loved my daughter, I wanted to die. Now that I live with my grandma I feel somewhat better, not happy but better. I'm able to work and get breaks. Before moving in I would sit in bed with the baby for 12 hours waiting for her father to come home so I could shower or use the restroom. I never got breaks. As expected he cheated a few weeks after I left, then on Thanksgiving after spending the day with my family and I. 

No, we are not together now. If you've read this far, I'm sure you're relieved to hear that. But how do I stop this feeling? I hate life, I genuinely do. I have a hard time showering, brushing my teeth, cleaning, sometimes taking care of my 6 month old daughter, everything. Is it wrong to wonder if I have PTSD from all of the cheating and trauma from the past year? I'm just so unhappy. I don't know what to do. I have no friends, no hobbies, nothing but me and my daughter who I do EVERYTHING for. I can say the only thing I am proud of myself for is how responsible I am with her, how she never runs out of formula, has diapers, wipes, clothes, everything. She is well taken care of despite me being suicidal this past year and I've managed to do all of this while hating life. But what about me? Where do I start? I'm open to advice, criticism, help, friendship, anything. Thank you to anyone who read this far. I just needed to vent. I'm so alone. Thank you.",1679160767.0

I guess it all started last year when I moved back from college, I was starting to get my life together, found a job, bought myself a car. Then the chaos started happening. My dog passed away, my parents were on the verge of getting divorced, and my dad has a drug addiction that makes him travel to a whole different city to get his drugs and takes my car (my parents don’t have reliable transportation because he spends all their money).

Since I  (F20) was a child I remember feeling empty. Never have been diagnosed with depression as such, but I do see symptoms of it as a consequence of my generalized anxiety. This past few months after 4 years of therapy, I'm taking meds (Sertraline, Zoloft) and honestly, it has helped. A lot. However, I kinda feel like I've lost a part of me. 

Being depressed made my 'inner world' bigger and more interesting (if that makes any sense). It seems like I've left behind a part of me that was more creative, contemplative, and much more. For example, before my meds I used to draw as a form of self-expression, but slowly, I stopped because of lack of creativity, time, motivation, etc. I fear that as I become happier, I also become more boring, shallow.

I really think I'm obsessed with being sad, and I don't know how to stop romanticizing my personality when I was depressed. I know it's wrong, but unconsciously, I have this idea that i can't be truly myself without being sad. I have lived in an obscure world for so long that i've made myself comfortable on it.

I should also mention I have serious doubts that any meds can really change my life, it's my life itself that needs changing, but I just want a way to get through the day, and not wake up from weird dreams with a cloud hanging over me leading to doom thinking in the shower setting the mood for the rest of the day.

I'll probably make a lot of typos.

I got out of partial hospitalization about a year ago, I told myself that it was the start of a new era, that things would be better from now on, and that the worst of my mental problems were behind me, I was wrong. In the past year, I've made very little progress, if anything I've become even more of a basketcase.

I just can't shake the feeling that most, if not all, people in my life are just tolerating me. That every time some ones nice to me, they either pity me, are just humoring me, or feel like they're obligated to, even if they don't truly want to do it. My family is *still* paying off the medical bills from PHP, and they keep saying they don't mind because they think it was important for me to go, but I know they're lieing to me. Why? Because they know I'm an out of controll mess and don't want to deal with me being overly emotional right now.

I know this is true. Recently my dad lost his job, soon he'll be lossing his insurance too. My family keeps acting like this is no big deal. I told my family I was worried about this, and they told be that me ""freaking-out"" was more anxiety inducing than him losing his job, and that I was ""overreacting"" and me not calming down ment that I ""didn't trust them \[my family\]"".

The point is that I've failed. I wasted by family thousands of dollars on something that appernely didn't work, and now we're not going to have any money or insurance. I am a leech on this family and there's nothing I can do about it.

Recently, I started a new job. I know my boss and coworkers think I'm wierd. I don't think they nessisarily dislike me, but they diffentatly see through my facade of professionalism. I know the only reason I was hired was because they were understaffed, my boss must know by now that I'm underqualified and undeserving of the job. A few days ago my boss sent me an email asking how I was adjusting to the job, and if I feel comfortable to work a shift alone. I genuinely have no idea how to answer her. Honestly, taking several days to reply in itself is probably enough to prove to her that I'm unprofessional. If I tell her I'm nervous about working a shift alone, she'll see how incompetant and slow of a learner I am, if I tell her it's okay, I'll have to work alone and will likely fuck up if somethings only left to my judgment. There's an employee luncheon comming up. My family thinks I should go, but I know my coworkers don't want me there. I know I'll ruin everything.

Because of my families lack of funds, I've had to start seeing my therapist less. Being the basket case that I am, this is fucking killing me. I can't be alone with my thoughts for too long, and I know there is no one else I can talk to.

I can't even talk to my friends or family. I know if I tell my parents too much they'll get worried, I can't tell my younger siblings because I'm older than them and it's not their job to solve adults problems. I haven't talked to most of my ""friends"" since Halloween. Of my irl friends, One of them I just don't have the mental energy to talk to anymore, and the other seems to be uniterested in talking to me. Knowing me, I wouldn't be suprised if I'm ruining her day by just talking to her, and she only agrees to hang out with me out of pity because she knows she's basically my only friend right now. Of my online friends, I know how much more awkward I am compared to the rest of them. I know they only tolerate me. Honestly, I think I'm a danger to most people around me. I take a lot (mentally, emotionally, phyically, monetarily) and give back very little. I had a dream last night about hurting one of my friends. I know I'd never want to actually do that to them, but I can't bring myself to even message them, because I worry that somehow I'll still hurt them. I've had intrusive thoughts in the past about my friends. I know it's safer for me to just stay away from them. They don't know how much danger they're in, and I know I can't tell them without making things worse.

Everytime I talk about this with my therapist, she asks for ""proof"" of people in my life not liking me. I know she's doing this as a CBT exercise, not out of malice, but I wish she would just trust me on this. I know they hate me. I know they're sucking up to be for their own benifet. 

I think what makes it worse is no matter how hard I try to be a better person, to make people like me more, it never works. Eventrually I just slip back into my old ways. Everyone around me keeps telling me it's okay, but I know it's not. No matter what I do, I am still who I am at my core. Hell, I know at least one person will probably comment on this post saying something like ""You're not bad!"" or ""Even good people do bad things, it's okay to mess up sometimes!"" SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP!!!! You don't fucking know me! To you, I'm just another throwaway account. You don't know how pathetic and disgusting I am in real life. I'm not just a good person who messes up sometimes, I constantly mess up and never learn from my mistakes. I am a burdon to everyone around me, and I know I can't talk to anyone. At least on reddit, people can just block and mute me if they don't like me, there's no exceptation to pity or suck up to me. I know anyone who interacts with my posts are doing it because they truly want to. I am doing my friends and family a favor by not venting to them about this, because I know it'd be too much for them.

My therapist told me to try to find a way to get out more, make new friends, but now matter where I go, I know I'll stick out like a sore thumb, I always fucking do. I just can't mask my emotions no matter how well I try. Even just in random public places like public transit or the grossery store, I know everyone around me can still there's something wrong with me. I know I'm a spectacle.

Even aside from all of this, I don't have any real goals in life, other than to just keep my job for as long as possible. I can't go back to college, I don't have any talents or skills that anyone else couldn't learn in a week at most. It's especally hard watching my siblings get accepted to big universities and have real goals and friends, when I basically just sit at home all day.

I just feel so defeated, I have no idea what to do. All I want is some real support, not from someone who I paid or someone who pitys me, but someone who genuinely cares about me.",1679089544.0

When I have a beautiful time and I smile or laughed reminiscing at it, I then feel the area of my heart tightening, then I start to cry.

When the good is temporary and the bad so constant, I can't hep but wonder what's the point of living. Nothing lasts, people take advantage of you when you are at your most vulnerable, and if you come from a broken family who abuse and can't stand each other, there is no place to call home.

After some experiences, my belief system has changed and my logic, my rationale, doesn't allow me to be happy and liberate myself from the past as it used to.  

I feel so broken inside and so alone even when surrounded by other people, that the only thought that  brings me consolation is that I will die. 

When I realise that I have 2/3 of my life to live, I can't help but feel a profound desperation.

I've done different therapies, probably spent around 5k on it. I read every book I can find on neuroscience, depression, relationships and so on. 

I know that the reason why I'm depressed is because I feel so alone in life, and anything that makes my heart beat, is unreachable (having a happy family, or at least a mom or a dad that are there for me and understand me, compassionately) or nonsense (having a dog, which is too expensive and limits your life options {rent, travelling}, etc, and I find it even abusive towards animals).

I've been living in a country different to my own for almost 7 years and now that I was going back to my home country to live with my grandmother, who is the only person that gives me that somewhat safe, warm feeling, my brother is divorcing and moving to hers. And my grandmother always puts my brother first, so. 

I also don't know where to live as where most of my friends live, life is too expensive and I don't want that lifestyle.

109,The difference between your depressed self and your not-so-depressed self!,1,11tvils,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/11tvils/the_difference_between_your_depressed_self_and/,2,"Hi!

This is a post to understand the changes I have noticed over time as my meds start working. 

Now some context. I have history of depression now over a decade. It entered the most extreme face around 2021, which is when I decided to take help. After more than a years of know response to any meds and switching my doctor I am in a pretty good phase now for almost 6-7 months. But this phase was not easy because I literally went through the phase where you can feel your fever is going down but you are extremely weak. And also now I feel like certain things are switched off (by the meds I guess!) like anxiety or stress which I can feel even if I have a deadline tomorrow. This also has given me a sneak pic of my own behaviour, actions and responses to the world. 

Look I am not completely out of it. And many of things has not come back yet, like physical attractions. When I told my doctor about this in my last visit he said that's completely fine because my brain has been completely ransacked by my depression so it will take to get back to a normal state. So I have wait and hold on a little longer and meanwhile get back to life.

And when I say getting back to my life I realised not only physical attraction, or menstrual cycle or appetite but there are small things that I do not find any interest anymore. Like photography. I am not a good photographer but I used take photos of scenery and when I am down I would feel somehow lifted by just taking a just a perfect shot. Or taking a selfie. I will try to take at least one photo if I go out or sometimes just take one good one to change my mood. And now I do not. Last photos of me are when I was extremely depressed and was looking a way to feel something. And now I can't even associate myself to that time.

I think the biggest one is my passive and aggressive self. So I am introverted but also if I want or need something I will never hesitate to speak up. If I feel the need to intervene or call out someone I will do that upright. So people who knows me are always conscious about me being such an ""hot-head"". However as I entered that depressed self couple of years ago I kind of pulled away from the world and get in a phase where everything is seemed pointless; like what's the point of getting ready in the morning for rest of our lives to just go through a bullshit job. And the people I met that time, or the friends I made or the relationship I had, they kind of thought I am like this passive nice soft-spoken person. But whenever that 'me' would get out of the closet or now when I am getting back on my feet I see people complaining about why I have changed so much or what happened to that nice person or how and why I am mad on small small things. It amuses often tbh. That they took my nice behavior as something to be taken granted for.

Anyway do everyone who went through the same journey have same experience? Do you feel the dissociation between your two phases?",1679069498.0

Hey Reddit!

&#x200B;

(M21) I don’t really do this kind of thing because it can be a tad bit embarrassing and awkward to talk about. I feel like I just had to get something out there just so I guess there can be some kind of record. I just want to tell someone out there how I feel. So I don’t really know where to begin or where to really start where my problems lie. Sorry if I go all over the place and how long this post is.

&#x200B;

I’m pretty much at an all time low in my life and what feels like my rock bottom. It’s mainly been these past 3 years since 2020 that have completely fucked up my life. My parents are getting divorced, everything/everyone I cared about is out of my life, my house is being torn apart and renovated, an also toxic household, failing grades in college, people who have moved on to have better lives than me, no one I know (outside of the internet) gives a shit about my hobbies or what I like and, the one that hurts me the most for some reason, I don’t have a girlfriend.

&#x200B;

So yeah my parents divorcing I guess isn’t too much of a surprise in retrospect. My dad was an alcoholic and took A SHIT TON of ambien. I mean have gotten the medicine wrong. But holy shit I have so many stories of how my dad made the biggest ass out of himself because of this stuff. He’s a good man and I know this. The reason he began one is because sometime in 2011, he was kicked out of the police force and that left a huge scar for him. I don’t wanna get into the details, but he basically got fucked over because someone won a law suit over him. Something like that. He only started in December of 2020 after getting my brother arrested. That was the final straw for my mom and even if my dad did stop drinking she didn't care. So we've kind of just been going through this transition for the past 3 years of moving out. It's been the most painful thing I ever felt because I never had to deal with something like this. For the longest time I've always kind of assumed things sort themselves out and eventually become okay. They don't.

&#x200B;

There's always this guy that lives in my house and I wish I could tell you more about him… but I can't. This is due to the fact that I don't even know who this guy is and he's been living in my house for 3 years. He was also ""Moved in"" in 2020 and my dad at the time didn't take too kindly to this. Me and my brother kind of just assumed he was being an asshole as usual for no reason because of the Ambien. But looking back on it I kind of get it now. My dad had no idea who this guy was and now being told by my mom ""He's a part of this family now."" She told him 2 weeks before she was making these plans and he was already going to be moving in. My parents have been married since the 90s, and my dad had no idea who this guy was and never heard his name before. Apparently he's a drug addict and also an alcoholic. If it sounded like my dad was bad at times, OH BOY, this dude is even worse. This dude is basically on life support and my mom is kind of just delaying the inevitable. I know that sounds like the most heartless someone could say, but I can't see anything else happening. The reason she brought him in was so that she could help him recover. It's been three years and there has been literally no progress made on his health. I had to carry this guy out of my house because he was on an overdose and had to be rushed to the hospital. That is how bad it is. Not only that the guy is a fucking prick. He argues with my mom more so than my dad did it. With my dad, there was usually a pattern with how the arguments happened. It was usually at night time where people would be drinking and would be around bedtime. With this guy, it doesn't matter what time of the day it is. Morning, afternoon, night, mid night, 4 fucking AM. My mom and this guy are arguing all the goddamn time. I think maybe it's gotten a bit calm, but that still doesn't distract from the fact that I do not like this guy. I don't like talking to him, I don't like his attitude… I basically don't like anything about him. And like my dad, I also have a ton of stories I could tell you about this goofball and how many times he is fucked up. Only in a span of 3 years have I just hated someone. For the record, hate is a strong word but I can't take it anymore. After like three years of this shit, how can't I get Fed up? It just feels as if everyone in my family is at each other's throats. Not to say that we hate each other or anything, but it's just so toxic and not a good living condition. Especially with seeing my own house getting torn apart by this dude and them taking forever to finish something. So yeah one of my bathrooms now looks like a construction site. It's all because some guy is drunk all the time and can't finish anything. In fact a house that I've known for all my life being torn before my eyes. It feels like the memories I've had of my childhood are just fading away and being erased from history. At least with my dad he was still my dad and I still love him. This guy is just a complete stranger, no blood relation or anything. So yeah… I hate him.

&#x200B;

School could be going a bit better, but truth be told it's not really as bad as everything else that I listed out earlier. Pretty self-explanatory I think.

&#x200B;

Everywhere I look people have better lives than me. Maybe it's all smoking mirrors and a mask they are hiding behind, but I can't even pretend to act like my life is good. When I invite friends over, they can tell that this sucks. I go to friends' houses. They have loving families, a house that's still intact, good paying jobs and so much more. Not only that, I've known a lot of people who were nobodies and then became famous on platforms like YouTube. I won't say who they are, because I just feel like they kind of left me behind and have let the power get to them. I do have a YouTube channel where I do stuff (not going to be promoting it here or saying who I am), but I'm not exactly very popular. I'm very small and whenever I tell people who I know people usually don't believe me. Hell my own brother talks about some of these people and I just sit and nod knowing that these people have become more successful than me. One of them has caring friends, a loving fiance, a house that he owns and a YouTube channel with a shit ton of subscribers and viewers. I forgot to mention he was 18 when all that happened. Those are all things that I want in my life but don't have. Not only that I'm reminded of it constantly. Hell, I was just reminded about it today when I opened up my steam profile and saw someone commented wanting to know more about these people. I get that a lot too of people not caring who I am and just wanting to only talk to these YouTubers. Basically just spanning me and annoying me. I tell them that there is a reason they have direct DMs on discord. Then again the more I think about it, do I really want to be so famous that I have people like this wanting to talk to me? It feels like everyone around me just has a better life than me. It makes me wonder what the hell have I been doing for all my life. The thing that sucks about my friends and people I know IRL is that we have nothing in common. I love retro gaming, transformers, history, story telling, video editing etc. Yet my friends… don't care. Example: I tell them to watch Breaking Bad because it's a really God damn good show and usually they just don't care. After a year and a half I finally convinced one of my friends to watch Breaking Bad and he really enjoys it (told them so). I don't know, I just feel as if everyone I meet feels the same. I generally try talking to them and I just can't get through with them. It feels as if we have nothing in common because I'm not really interested in the trends or what's popular right now. I can't really say I'm an introvert or extrovert but rather in between. It really depends on what mood I'm feeling that day. I might be sorry one day, I might be myself one day. It's kind of random and all over the place. This is sort of why I love the internet because I met people who have the same interests as me who I would have NEVER met in real life. Yeah that's kind of how I feel about my friends, I care about them but we have nothing in common. My Discord pals are basically the best friends I've always wanted but never had. 

&#x200B;

Lastly, the one that really fucked me up is that I just don't have a girlfriend. I know that might sound dumb to some people and the more I think about it the more I wonder why I even want it. I've been wanting a girlfriend for as long as I can remember. I've been wanting one since 8th grade, heck maybe even earlier than that. But I just can't get one, no matter how hard I try. I know there's a lot of people who think they're going to be alone forever and yet they haven't done anything. At least I actually have a reason to feel the way I do, I've actually tried to do stuff about. I've been rejected, friend zoned and lied to. Name it and I have probably had to deal with it at one point or another. But I feel like I get looked down upon because of this fact that I never had a girlfriend. My family sure as hell has made fun of me for it in the past and that didn't help. Not only that, I'm reminded of it EVERYDAY. I see couples, people asking me if I have a girlfriend, people bringing it up. Like God damn I can't escape it. And a lot of people might say you have to love yourself before you can love someone else. I get that, I've had like a decade to think about it and I've already gone through the phase. I do love myself and I don't want to change as a person. But knowing this it just hurts more and more every day. I've had crushes come and go like clouds, hell I don't even remember 90% of their names. I have a lot of awkward crush stories actually. My last day being 19, I got into a car accident with one of my crush dads at the time and my former job. After that happened I pretty much just dropped that crush because it was just too awkward. That was actually my breaking point in 2021, that's about when I realized I regretted my whole life and hated my status of living. Everything that you're reading right now kind of came out from that day. I'm not sure why, but I kind of just sat there and wondered ""What the hell did I do with my life?"" I wish getting rejected made things easier, but it really does make things more difficult. It just makes me not want to do it anymore because of how humiliating and embarrassing it can get. The first time I asked someone out was back when I turned 20 and I was actually really happy that day because I finally did something I couldn't do for all my life. She rejected me… obviously. But it still was a good day for me. Here I am now still wanting one after all this time. Hell to make it even more sadder, every birthday wish I wish for is just to get a girlfriend. But it never comes true and I don't even know why I bother anymore. Online dating was sort of the last thing I wanted to do, I did open up a tinder and it didn't really get any matches. That's mainly due to the fact that I have to pay a fee to see my results. Recently I've thought about paying the fee just so I can get someone. Asking people out and talking to them in person sure as hell haven't helped me. It might sound impatient of me, but I am just tired of waiting. I hate having to hear everyone around me tell me that they have these girlfriends and dates when I can't even know a girl for more than 2 years. Some people have tried to help, but they have never went anywhere and have never actually gotten me anywhere closer. To me it's kind of like buying lottery tickets, you're not going to win but you might as well spend the wheel. I took a test about my level of happiness and apparently it's at 60%. Obviously it was an online test and online test shouldn't judge or determine how you feel about something. But in all honesty I actually can believe that. One of the lowest scores I got on the test was relationships. It was one of the biggest downfalls for the test. And I would be lying to myself if I didn't say that I didn't think about it all the time. Seriously every day I think about wanting a girlfriend. Hell at some points I kind of wonder if it's even worth it and I just want to know what it's like. Hell even if I went on a date for one day that would sore as hell would boost up so much morale for me. Yeah this is one of the biggest ones for me and why I'm just not really that happy. But truth be told, I can go on for hours and hours. I don't want to make it sound as if I truly have the worst life of all time, because there are people out there who have it much worse than I do. I just wished that made things easier for me but it doesn't. So what was the point of this post? I really don't know. I just hope somebody out there can read this and just maybe relate or help me make me feel better. There's just so much stuff on my plate and how I feel that I wish I could tell you all it. But I know it's too much information to throw up so I think I'll just leave things there. But yeah that's kind of how I feel about my life right now.",1679017712.0

I'm meeting with my therapist today and I'll probably try and discuss this, if I get the courage to.

Anyway. Starting Sunday night, I stayed up from 6 pm Sunday until 2 pm Monday. I just wasn't tired, but ended up passing out (figuratively) on the couch. Slept for 5 hours, then ended up going to sleep again at 1 am on Tuesday. Woke up at 7 am. Then I didn't sleep until 7 am Wednesday, woke up at 5 pm. It's now 10 am on Thursday and I haven't slept at all. 

I'm already struggling with the other symptoms of depression and anxiety, but this rubber banding of sleep is just really rough. I've tried melatonin, sleeping pills (although I try not to have those easily accessible at the moment), no electronics for hours before bed, all that stuff. But I still end up lying awake just thinking. And that makes me feel even shittier, so I get up and do something to distract myself. 

It's hard because I want to sleep, I know I should go to sleep, but then I have to wake up and I'm so miserable when I wake up. I'm aware of my life as soon as I wake up and the worst part is, my life is decent. So it's not like I can even point to a reason as to why I'm depressed. I just am, and it feels like there's nothing I can do about it.

Anyway. I guess I'm just looking for some support. Like I said, I'm going to try talking to my therapist today, but I've never talked about anything like this before so it's kinda scary, to be honest. We talk a lot about how I seem like I'm doing really well mentally and it's hard to say ""well actually"".",1678986982.0

The times I actually full on cry now for hours like I used too, are during really really bad mental breakdowns which even those are very rare and occasional now. So I'm stuck with a constant numbness. And the only few things that make me happy are or don't feel numb, are very limited people and even some of those people can't help.

131,Do I have depression/am depressed? Or am I just lazy?,4,11stye6,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/11stye6/do_i_have_depressionam_depressed_or_am_i_just_lazy/,2,"Note: I’ve posted this before. 

I don’t know if I’m depressed or actually just sad. The past few years my mindset has gone really bad. I’ve lost interest in the things I used to do and my relationships with friends and family. My irritability and mods swings have gotten worse, the smallest things can set me off and it’s really affected my family life. I don’t mean to get mad, but I can’t help it. I don’t think I’m mentally doing alright, but I don’t think it’s depression. Maybe something else. 

I think what really took a toll on me was my recent losses. My cousin and uncle (family friend) passed away a month apart from, this was last year. My aunty, who I was never really close with, but had always been grateful for, also passed away recently. My cousin and uncle’s passing, really sent me into a bad mindset.

My family life isn’t the best or worst either. To keep it short, parents are separate. 

I have a low self-esteem, which is way I hate myself. I don’t like the way I look and speak. I don’t like what I see in the mirror. I wish I was prettier and had a more feminine look. I know it’s bad to compare yourself to others, but I can’t help it. I feel like every time I step outside I’m being judged, even when people aren’t looking at me. 

I have trouble sleeping. Sometimes I sleep for 9 hours, but most of the time I get like 3-4 hours maybe an hour of sleep. My brain can’t shut off. But when I do go to sleep early, I wake up in the middle of the night and can’t go back to sleep. Which means that I’ll be tired going to school in the morning. I’m also a big procrastinator. Like I do work in class, but most of the time, I’m daydreaming about something (I’m the type to make up fake scenarios in their heads, lol). I get sidetracked too. This really impacts my school life cause I can’t get anything done and leave it till the last minute. In most of my exams, I freeze up cause I don’t know what to do, I get overwhelmed instantly. I tend to fidget a lot too, which again, doesn’t help. My school life I think also makes me feel slight worthless, cause I don’t have the perfect grades. Their average. 

I feel like I’m a pretty average teen. I’m happy, but most of the time I feel like I’m trapped in this dark empty hole and everything I do is a waste. I feel like I’m backed into a corner where I can’t escape it. All I want to do is curl up and cry all the time. And it doesn’t help cause I hate talking about my feelings. I feel like it will just burden the person, or they won’t even care. Tbh, I don’t know how to cope with these feelings. Every time I zone out and people ask me if I’m good I say I’m fine, but something inside just wants to breaks down and tell them I’m not fine. I feel burnt out, like everything is so much effort and now even talking to my friends seems like a lot of effort. I hate this feeling. I hate going out, I want to stay home. But I can’t even stand the state of my room, clothes are every where, random junk on my beside table, old schools books scattered around my room, things cramped under my bed and random shit on my bed like papers and tissues (cause I was sick). I haven’t been bothered cleaning my room cause honestly, I don’t have the effort and mental capacity to do that. Cause, ain’t nobody got time for that (it was funnier in my head). Despite not having the effort to talk to people, it doesn’t mean that i won’t worry for them. I do. I worry a lot to the point where even the thought of them in danger pushes me into a small breakdown. 

I try to make myself happy, like put on a smile, try different things, be more active, talk more, try to get more sleep, but nothings working. And it took so much effort out of me. I try cleaning but it only last a couple of hours before i get tired. I feel bad cause my dad always asks me to clean my room and do chores, but its so much effort. Then he thinks I’m just lazy, but I seriously don’t have the capacity to do it anymore. I’m so tired mentally, emotionally and physically. I hate the things I’m feelings. I hate the fact I can’t talk to someone about how I’m feeling. I feel like I can’t talk to anyone about it, cause I’ll either feel like a burden or they won’t even care or brush it off. I can’t talk with my dad because he’ll say you’re too much on your phone and when I’m not on my phone and sleep cause I’m too tired and overwhelmed of everything he says I’m probably just tired. Same with my mom. At least that’s what I think they will say. I hate the fact I can’t go a day without feeling some sort of sadness that is constantly coming back, even when I’m feeling happy. I feel hopeless in this situation. I want to just be numb. I’m drowning myself with these feelings and I don’t even know what it is.",1678972753.0

I just started taking buspar along with my seizure meds which are supposed to be used for anxiety and depression as well. I guess it started a couple years ago when I had my first seizure while driving and totalled my vehicle. It was terrifying, I  had never felt so close to mortality. It felt like I had lost any sense of freedom, feeling stuck at my narcissistic father's house, i had to quit my job and i bever got to see any of my friends. I was in between two guys at the time but I ended up leaving one for the other, I thought he was the love of my life. He ended up moving like thousands of miles away. I moved in with my sister shortly before he asked me to come live with him. Of course I did but it was a scary experience. He ended up becoming really abusive and we'd get into fights all the time. We got kicked out of where we were living so I had to leave everything I had to come back home. Me and the guy were still talking but it was on and off until he unalived himself. That was a couple years ago and it's still really hard to live with. He was one of my best friends for a really long time despite our toxic relationship. So years later I've been thru a few different jobs, therapy, still no car, and renting a new place with a friend of mine. I want to move on but I'm afraid of getting hurt again.

This is my final gambit, the absolute last attempt at connecting with something, anything, for help. All of my shouting into the void over the past few months has been met with nothing but complete, overbearing silence.

&#x200B;

I spend around 95% of my time in total isolation in this small, dark room. My daily routine consists of sleeping (precisely midday until around midnight usually, but these are interspersed throughout periods of being awake for 24+ hrs) and working online, doing schoolwork particularly. I don't talk to anyone I live with and very rarely even see them. I do not actually do the schoolwork properly, I only cheat because my mind has rotted to the point of only barely being able to form cohesive thoughts and I am tired to the point of being on the verge of passing out at ALL times, no matter how long or well I sleep, I am always able to nod off even while walking. This cheating is also because, frankly, I don't see a point. I never did particularly well and at no point will I ever be able to afford entering into higher education if I somehow graduate. On top of that, the world is just going to shit, there's no reason to create a legacy or continue the family or even just be happy by myself since in a few years it's just going to be an even more hellish dystopia than it already is, the few careers I was once interested in are now either pointless due to being privatized/exploited for money/censorship, or replaced by AI. This cycle is all I do, all day every day, for months, nonstop. Sleep, get up and walk 2 feet to my desk, mindlessly copy/paste for many hours until I collapse from exhaustion and repeat.

&#x200B;

I struggle with a whole cast of mental disorders, primarily intense anxiety and autism, among other things. I am so socially inept I can barely hold my own or act normal in a social situation and avoid going into public or talking to people face-to-face as much as possible out of fear of judgement. My mind feels like a constant uncontrollable hurricane of terrible thoughts. On top of that I am constantly contending with some extreme suicide related trauma but many other smaller traumas as well, all completely unattended, never could talk about it due to my family's complete lack of communication and essentially some kind of silent-running policy where we all visibly acknowledge things that have happened but through quick eye glances apparently agree not to talk about it audibly. Nobody except my online friends knows about my current state, as if this information got out to my family it would cause the only person keeping us barely afloat to have a complete mental breakdown and get us evicted due to not working a couple days. I am certain of this because it has, indeed, happened before but I was able to salvage the situation by some quick thinking and some impressively elaborate lying.

&#x200B;

I might be going insane. I am hallucinating near constantly, hearing scratching and knocking on walls and doors, seeing things out of the corners of my vision such as tall shadow figures and massive insects that dart away when I look at them. In fact, sometimes as of late it's not even corners. I open a door and see someone just straight up standing there right in front of me that quickly retreats around the corner or into the wall/ceiling/floor. Sometimes, when I peer into dark spaces, I can see something looking back at me, evidently not staved off by my recognizing it. My sleep is plagued by endless vivid nightmares, for example my most recent one was of being pursued by an incomprehensible eldritch flesh mass covered in screaming human faces that would always eventually subject me to some purgatory-like torment in an attempt to make me kill myself. This was followed by being in an abandoned building with ever single surface being covered in eyes that would stare at me, eventually impaling me with spikes. Other times I have recurring dreams about waking up in a dark, empty hospital surrounded by an endless, generic town and field coated completely in black texture that gets vaguely lighter the farther I go from it, and above is a desolate sky. I am always wearing a hospital gown with one of my eyes gouged out, and many times I have had other missing limbs, seen loved ones, or had oily black tendrils come out of my chest and empty eye socket in these dreams. While awake I constantly have intrusive thoughts about killing myself or thoughts about brutally attacking anyone I see.

&#x200B;

I don't do anything else in my life besides work and sleep, for the most part. I don't leave my house (can't actually, at least I can't go anywhere that has anything besides emptiness) and have zero local friends, my only handful of friends are online but they're rarely on and they never ever talk to me unless it's about whatever dumb game they're into at the time, opting to ignore me instead in every other circumstance. As of recently it's starting to look like most of them simply do not give a shit about me. I have tried for months to find other friends but all has failed as my current friends are only around me because of incredible luck and circumstances years ago, no such thing can be repeated. I have posted on friend-searching subreddits of all kinds, gone to online places that supposedly have people with the same interests as me, all sorts of things, and everything has turned up empty. I have always been completely ignored, my existence means nothing to anyone and I have nothing to offer that would make me stand out enough for even a single person to notice me and not forget after a day. Even my own family forgets about me near constantly. The only people that don't ignore me are bots. Actually, *as I am writing this* one of my friends just acknowledged an request for help and responded only with mockery.

&#x200B;

I have zero interests whatsoever, everything I used to like I have lost interest in either due to it going to shit, or because of my own inadequacy. I have spent months and years looking for a productive, fun hobby that I can dedicate myself to but everything I try I fail at miserably, I can do nothing well at all and I know this for a fact after having tested it for so long. I cannot gain any skills either no matter how hard I try, my mind just feels handicapped. I am completely useless. All of the hobbies that I didn't fail at, are just too expensive since I am almost totally broke and will be going bankrupt soon. This also explains why therapy and medication is out of reach for me, as well as any kind of decent nutrition besides the equivalent of the college student ramen diet... or anything else you can throw in a microwave for a couple moments. Across the rest of my life before now, it has always been this way. I have not experienced many things that most people would consider normal life experiences, only monotony and isolation, being able to see how life is supposed to be through quietly watching others. I have never done anything worth noting in my life. Not once. No activities of any kind out of the bare minimum normal routine, no accomplishments, no important memories, and most importantly, no ambitions to be had.

135,I think my husband is mentally leaving me..,5,11sfmn7,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/11sfmn7/i_think_my_husband_is_mentally_leaving_me/,15,"I 29F have been with my husband 30M for eight years, married for five. We also have a son who has completed our little family.

Two months ago I started to notice he just wasn't himself. He wasn't talking to me as much and just seemed very detached. I told him I felt as though he didn't want to be with me anymore to which he responded with tears in his eyes that he didn't know what he wanted anymore. That he just wasn't happy & if I wasn't making him happy why should he be with me. 

This threw me through a loop. We cried together as I told him I never wanted to make him unhappy but had no idea how to leave him. He told me he didn't want me to leave. Cue a bit of relief, but so much more confusion. 

We had a long talk the next day, as calm as we both could be. He just feels miserable and doesn't want to do anything anymore and just wants to be alone. 

I (think) he is severely depressed but I can't tell if it's because of me or the depression itself making him think our marriage is the issue. (During our talk I asked him several times if there was something I had done or didn't do.. he told me I'm the best wife and he loves me very much) He is just as confused as I am. 

He did not want to separate or for me to leave either. So I thought we were trying to make this work. But physical touch is both of our first love language and 90% of the time now he withholds that from me. I asked him why and he says ""in case things go South"" It's like he's purposefully creating distance between us and it hurts like hell.

Im just so confused and unsure what to do. If it is depression causing all of this I want to stand by him and help him through it as best I can. But at the same time if I'm the problem I feel I should leave for his sake.

If I had to list my main issues right now:
    * I spend most of my free time laying around in bed and sleeping too much.
    * I have lost all joy for everything that I used to find interesting and exciting.
    * I fell behind in life and am under performing in all areas.
    * I am not happy and cannot remember the last time I was happy. Happiness comes sometimes unexpected at random moments, lingers around for a few hours and then I am back to my usual self.
    * I used to be a cheerful jolly guy and I cannot believe I have not been in touch with that part of who I am for the past 14 years.

Context:- I am a pretty good student academically and i scored 92% in my highschool finals.

My family told me to pursue medical after highschool. On contrast I am pretty good at computer science and i scored 98 on that paper, i love coding and i can do it all day. But since I was naive at the time i listened to my family and chose the carrier they wanted me to pursue.

It's been 3 years of me taking entrance exams for a medical college without any success. In India it's really tough to enter a government college and it has a selection ratio of 2 percent.

My family is fed up of me failing to get in a college after 3 years and they call me worthless. My dad beated the shit out of me a few days ago just because he had a bad day. He told me to die somewhere out there by getting chopped up by a train ( my house is really close to railway tracks).

I ran away from home that day and returned in the evening. My mom was crying.

But now after 3 days my mom and sister are back to calling me worthless and a stain to the family.

I made some money off of coding for a guy (freelance stuff) and bought myself a gift. But my family is saying I'm incompetent and i don't deserve it and that this chump change won't make a difference.

I've been contemplating it i should just end all this suffering sooner or later since I'm at my limit.

The only one I feel sorry for is my mom because she was genuinely worried when I disappeared.

148,How to not backslide into depression when my circumstances are depressing?,11,11rqlgq,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/11rqlgq/how_to_not_backslide_into_depression_when_my/,4,"Hi all. I’m a 40-year-old male with a history of depression since high school or maybe middle school. I managed it very well without medication until 36 when I began taking Wellbutrin. Well, unfortunately Wellbutrin sent me further into a hole that went deeper than I ever knew possible. I went off it for a short period, starting doing well, met a wonderful woman that I love like crazy, but unfortunately went back on it not realizing it was causing serious problems. 

Resuming the Wellbutrin caused my entire personality to change, as well as my decision making and thought patterns. I became very detached, stopped showing her affection, and was just a total shell of myself. My dose was doubled. I became suicidal. I then made up an insane lie about my mom being ill because I thought I needed some cover story to allow me to leave when I was truly ready to kill myself and that is what I did. I abandoned her in a craze, only to snap out of it long enough to realize something was deeply wrong in my head. I was totally confused as I had never acted like this. I never fell out of love with her and I sure as hell was not someone who would make up elaborate lies, nor was I ever suicidal even at my worst before something snapped.

I realized the major changes coincide with Wellbutrin, stopped with my doctors blessing , and sure enough I totally stabilized. So that is great. I am happy to be alive. I feel lots of great emotions that have been dormant for 4 years. But I’ve also set fire to our relationship and my life feels unrecognizable in many ways. I am a very lucky man and she was willing to hear me out and see how things shook out. We are not in a relationship, but we are spending time together which is a hell of a start. We spent the weekend together out of town and it was one of the happiest times I’ve ever had. Not only was I with the woman I love in a beautiful setting, but I was feeling all these things that have been buried underneath the rubble for years and it was so goddamn good to share that with her. We both talk about the fact that we can lead happy lives no matter what happens, but while I acknowledge that to be true I know that she’s the woman I want to spend my life with. She always has been. I don’t know what happened to me, but I know how I feel when I am not short circuiting to a degree that I can’t comprehend and nothing has changed.

So I am very happy with that side of things. I have plenty to be grateful for. But things are still tough as hell right now. We aren’t the same nor should we be. She’s beyond understanding and seems to take seriously the fact that my behavior was totally altered by out of control brain chemistry, but I still betrayed and abandoned her and you can’t just pretend that didn’t happen or suddenly make it all better. Because of that I am living in a crappy hotel while I look for an apartment. Things feel very strange in that regard. I’m going to be living in some strange place, and the woman who was my partner is now someone I am dating. Moreover, she is not someone I can really approach about the sadness I feel because it isn’t fair to her. I’m not a bad guy and I was not of sound mind, but I did what I did and there is a lot of work to be done before there is any hope that we are back together.

I’m fully ready to do the work, and I genuinely feel stable and my emotions are by and large good ones. But there is still sadness there. More than that there is some fear. Returning to this hotel alone was a shock to my system. Not knowing that I would be able to look into her eyes or feel her next to me in bed was painful. Knowing that I occupy this different space for her right now is jarring, and I also think so often of the pain that I have caused her. In many ways I feel like I have to thread the needle here at a time where things have been shaken to the core. I want to show her I care and want her to know that I miss her like crazy, but I don’t want to expose her to my sadness when she has to worry about herself. I want to be involved but want to give her space. I want to maintain my relatively happy disposition but I come home to an environment where I’m constantly reminded of what I have lost. 

There have been plenty of tears but I don’t feel that same depression. My sadness makes sense and it’s often replaced by increased focus and motivation to do the work to continue getting better while also showing her that I’m the loving man she used to trust. I guess I just worry that the circumstances of my life will knock me off track. I am not clinically depressed but it would be easy to backslide in this depressing situation. How do I manage that fear?

TL;DR: spent years in mental hell thanks to Wellbutrin, blew up relationship in the process. Stopped Wellbutrin and feel normal mentally but trying to not let actually depressing circumstances get the best of me. Trying to fight like hell to mend the relationship but worried that the isolation and distance will just trigger depression and I don’t want to let it get the best of me / don’t want to lose her thanks to some combo of the distance and the sadness that comes with it. Need to just stay the course at a time when my head feels better and my circumstances are a lot worse.",1678869964.0

I don't see even see friends often outside of the compulsory events, university classes. I can't. It takes me too much time to recover and make me enjoyable again. I fall asleep around my friends, at the university, at my house. I'm not pleasant being around anymore. My friends still love me but it hurts not being able to call them close friends anymore. They drift away, they used to stay attached to me, but if I don't reciprocate, the waves just finish pushing them away.

It can also be dark, and bottomless. It has lots of waves, it's easy to drown into.

Use a glass water bottle. Or any water bottle that catches your eye- colour, pattern, design, etc. 

Make a point to use it, to fill it up when your in the kitchen. It’s a small task, but the feeling of completing a task no matter how small helps me a lot. 

However make sure to keep a handful of disposable water bottles under your bed or near your bed. It’s good to complete a task, but the days that I just can’t get out of bed having the backup water in my room is a good thing. Being hydrated helps the brains.

I’ve always believed that I was less worthy than others, or didn’t belong in the groups I found myself in growing up. These feelings, along with my social anxiety, made it really easy to shy away from experiences where I could fail and from people who intimidated me. Because of this, I feel that I wasn’t able to reach many of the “social milestones” or socially develop in a healthy way. Now, I am a recent college graduate who is currently living with friends 

These last few years have been particularly hard. My mental health has been very tumultuous and there have been very low lows. I would go as far as to say that these last couple years have been the worst of my life. Negative self-talk has been my biggest issue through all of this, and at this point my inner narrative has been shaped into one of fear and shame. I often feel bad about myself because of my lack of experience socially and in life, and I also feel shame because I have been living with my mental illness for so long. I’ve gone through many mental breakdowns, especially in these last few months, and these have caused me to feel really unstable emotionally.  I still have stretches of days where I can barely get out of bed and feel so lifeless and empty. My brain is working against me more often than not. I even had to quit my job recently due to my mental illness, and generally it feels like my depression and anxiety has taken control over my life and 

My roommates, and the majority of my friends, are in better spots in their lives than I am right now, and have had a more normal social development. They have jobs, significant others, are able to travel, find joy in their hobbies, and generally live more content lives. This is not to say that they don’t have their own troubles, of course they do, but they are able to cope with their troubles in a much more constructive way and are generally able to lead fulfilling lives. That is what it looks like from my perspective, anyway.

Its so hard for me to feel good about where I am in life when I see people close to me seemingly doing it better. They are all doing the things that I so insecurely want for myself, and it seems like they are all able to do it much easier and more confidently. I’m happy for them, they are all really cool people and I am glad that I get to be a part of their lives and see their happiness. However, I can’t help but feel bad for myself when I am around them, and I always find myself in a shame spiral after we hang out. Their successes remind me so much of my failures. Their achievements remind me so much of what I’m not able to do right now because of my mental illness. While there is some envy and resentment because of this, I mostly feel intense shame in myself and inadequate. It makes me feel like there’s something wrong with me inherently. Like I’m broken :/

I am receiving treatment. I go to therapy and have a psychiatrist, and I’m at a point in my life now where I am able to focus totally on feeling better, but the work is hard and the results don’t necessarily feel significant yet. I’m frustrated and it seems like I’m just not good enough. I just want to get to a place where I can feel confident in myself and can show up in my life in the ways that I want to and see others doing now.",1678863372.0

He physically and emotionally abused us - he locked us in our room for hours without any food or anything, got mad and hurt us when we spilled water etc. We weren't allowed to say anything and we didn't do so because we were to scared of what would happen. long story short - we were just kids and had to basically live on our own. 

We now still live with our father and he still has these outbursts - he doesn't hurt us anymore due to our stepmom but he is still abusing us emotionally. This doesn't affect me that much because I am not that much at home anymore due to work or my.bf (19). But my sister is severely depressed (diagnosed) and told me several times that it gets worse every day. I am extremely worried since she has absolutely no social life - I am the only person she talks to. Just today she told me ""It's not about how I can live like this anymore, it's about how long I can live like this"". She also often says things like ""there is no reason why I am still alive"" and how she doesn't understand why god (if there's any) didn't let her die. She also goes to therapy but even that doesn't help - even her therapist said that there is nothing she could do and that she could just support her.

Long story short - I am extremely worried since she is my person. We were always together and our past just connects us two. She is like the other half of mine. I just want someone to help me. Maybe someone who overcame depression or was in a similar situation?

She only recently got diagnosed and only used medicine briefly before she had to stop. 

I'm really into DIY and wanted to make something that she can use to maybe make her feel better. My plan isn't to cure her depression or something like that bc I know its not that simple. I just want to make something she can use that is low effort for her to use and makes her feel better about herself. 
Any tips are welcome, here are some of my own ideas; 

Write down 5/10 minute activities she can do when she doesn't have the motivation to do anything (if you know some activities, please share them). I want to fold them in lucky stars and put them in a jar, if she wants to do something but doesn't know what or doesn't want to think about it, she can grab one of those and do that.

Same idea as the one above but instead of writing down activities, I write down all her positive qualities and things I like about her. When she's having bad thoughts she can read some of those and maybe feel a bit better. Maybe write down some things that bring me joy in life too so she can think about happy stuff. 

I thought about making some mood trackers, so she can track how much water she drinks and how she feels daily, maybe a page in which she can rate every day and write down the thing she liked most about the day. Kinda like in a journal. 

If you have any other ideas, or have any tips for my ideas (like what to include etc) please let me know!

So I'm here seeking for some advice. 

So... here it goes:

I am a 22yr old guy, and by the end of this semester it's very possible that I'm gonna be suspended permanently from my college,  this is gonna be the second time I've failed college. I come from a very successful and strict family,  my parents are really successful and have a growing business, everyone in my family has already finished college including all my siblings and my cousins (I'm the youngest). My household is very strict, they expect from us the best, and I've become some sort of a black sheep.

I never did good at school, always had problems with my family for being gay (we're good now), It came as a huge blow when I failed college the first time around, but they quickly enrolled me in another college (a more expensive one) and now I'm in my 5 semester and It's most likely I'll be suspended permanently from this college too. 

I don't know what to do, I don't want to disappoint them even more, my oldest stepvrother failed college and they kicked him out of the house,  they were kind enough to pay me for another college and not kick me out, but now I'm failing them again. 

I'm 100% aware of the piece of sh*t, mess of a  nepo baby that I am, I'm aware of all the opportunities they've granted me and I just flopped them all.

I truly do know what I want for my future, I just want stability, security and luxury but I need to work and achieve things for that but I've just failed at every chance I had for my procrastination, lack of ambition and nonchalantness. 

Now I'm here, seeking strangers for advice.",1678688882.0
197,I don't know what to do anymore,2,11q1w66,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/11q1w66/i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/,5,"I've been struggling with what I've been diagnosed as depression and anxiety but I feel like there's more to it. I've been in therapy for two years, and with my current therapist for maybe a year now. I've tried a lot of medication but it really just made me feel physically sick. 

Because I don't outwardly present my issues, contrast to my older sister, my parents believe it's not bad. They don't really see how I struggle, and if they do, they don't acknowledge it. My sister has always had problems, she's has quite a restricting diet as she can't digest certain foods such as red meats, and she has an eating disorder. She struggles with sleep, depression, anxiety. All of this is relevant because I'm constantly ignored because of her. Part of me resents her, and it's just so damn tiring to hear ""oh sorry, we only cooked for (sister), she can't eat anything else) They're constantly coddling her to the point where I lash out at her sometimes. I would never try to hurt her, I tend to raise my voice a lot. 

If I don't shout, nothing gets heard. It just feels like they forgot about me sometimes, too much revolves around her and she's literally going off to college (if she doesn't drop out). She's not a baby anymore, I don't get why I have to be compared to her. If it's not as bad as her, it doesn't matter. 

I used to cut a lot when I was younger, the first time in grade 5 for attention but I think that really says something. I ended up getting stitches in my arm, but that did nothing, only more comments from my mom about how ugly it is. I don't cut anymore, even if I really want to, it just doesn't do anything, there's not point. I think my friend also helped with that though, but my parents hate her. I really wish things were better, honestly. I really try hard to get better, and do more things but anytime I even bother, it always gets shut down.

 I've been told I'm not the problem, and our family dynamic is a huge part in how I'm feeling, but there is something deep down that isn't right with me. I know it's not depression or anxiety, because I wouldn't feel this bad. Sometimes I just feel like I'm not a person, my actions don't have consequences. I'm just someone living and it doesn't matter how it ends. I've thought of killing people, my intrusive thoughts are very disturbing. I've tried telling my mom, I've tried drinking, it did nothing. Sometimes I'm worried I might act on it, but it only takes a few minutes to snap back into whats easiest to describe as my programmed personality. Nothing about my personality is real, it's just based on the others around me. Sometimes when I'm alone, I resent everyone I'm with. I feel like my real personality shows. Maybe I should just kill myself before I kill someone else. I think I'm truly insane, but I can't put my finger on what I could tell my therapist so I could get proper medication for whatever condition it is. Or maybe there isn't a solution, maybe I should be looked up. I don't know anymore .",1678688035.0

I have been a generally sad person ever since I was about 12. I’ve had this disease living and thriving inside me for a really long time, and it just gets nothing but stronger, and larger. It consumes me more every single day. I get told all the time “it gets better” “it’ll get better” “things get better”. But not once has anything happened that supports that sentiment. I can’t say confidently that I know what “real” happiness is. I am extremely suicidal, and whenever my mom leaves for work, I dare myself to cut myself, to take all the pills I can find in the medicine cabinet, to get my grandma to take me to the farm so I can shoot myself in the bush out back. But I can’t bring myself to because I know either my mom or my grandma would be the people who found me, and I can’t do that to them. So instead I look for pleasure in booze, drugs, sex etc. What’s worse is I know it’s not *actually* helping me, I’m fully aware of that. But I feel comfort in all of it. It allows me to forget for a little while that I wanna blow the back of my head off, it allows me to forget how broken as a human that I am. I’ve attempted to take my life once before, I was 13 when it happened. And I’d be lying if I said I regretted it. But I would be telling the truth when I say I regret it didn’t work. But I’d also be telling the truth when I say I’m glad my mom didn’t have to see me hanging cold. I didn’t even have a note written. So I took that into consideration. I have a pre-written note, for if I ever did cave in, and do it. It’s so hard to hang on, it is so terribly hard. I sit alone in my room for hours in silence, thinking, writing in my journal, crying etc.

She has been my support system since last 2 years, supported me in tough times especially during Covid 19 phase, also in career. I fear that I would lose her which is bound to happen. I don't have many friends as well


Today, I had a talk with my crush and she was literally over the moon of getting married. I am worried about her as the man with him she is going to get married is 8 years elder. This would be a generation gap. She is saying that vibes are matching but the reality is that the boy is a millionaire, has a lot of property where she also said what would I want more. 

I am concerned as that guy is 32 years and he won't be getting younger by any means. Guys, I want to tell her personally that how she has been a pivotal part of life as we haven't met since 3 years. I am literally breaking down. I am getting insane. She has broken my heart multiple times still I have feelings for her. I personally believe that love happens in minutes.

I feel so tired. I sleep for long lengths of time 12-15 hours sometimes.

I feel like I’ve lost my confidence. I feel anxious talking to people. I don’t feel I take much pride in my appearance I wear dark clothes that are baggy and hide my body.

I don’t see my friends. I avoid going on outings because of feeling ashamed of my body and weight gain. I also suffer from body dysmorphia and find dressing up can be very triggering for me because I don’t like how I look in the clothes.

I feel stuck.

I hate my job so so much (I work in hospitality) but when I start applying to new jobs I doubt myself being able to get a new one because of not having not much faith in myself. My dream is to work in a corporate job.

I do applications for jobs to get through to the next stages e.g. psychometric tests etc. to then not complete the next stage by the deadline. I over-procrastinate on everything in life. And I kick myself because I think to myself all the time I hate where I am in life why can’t I bring myself to change I don’t understand.

I worry about my future a lot. I’m a big overthinker and worrier. I put a lot of pressure on myself because I have dreams I want to achieve. But I doubt myself and feel my mum doesn’t believe in me which makes me doubt myself even more.

I get uncontrollably angry sometimes at work e.g, crying frequently, walking out etc.

I binge eat and feel out of control around food I overeat because it gives me something to look forward to because I don’t look forward to anything else in life.

I used to go gym regularly and see my personal trainer but I stopped because of feeling embarrassed about gaining weight and feel he’d be disappointed in me. I feel embarrassed and get social anxiety going to the gym.

I don’t go on holiday because of disliking my body, dreading how I’d look in a swimsuit.

I hate the lack of routine in my life. I feel like a mess all the time. I dislike working such unpredictable shifts. I feel it’s hard to organise my life go to the gym, do meal prep etc. when everything changes every week.

It’s like a never-ending cycle.

Can someone please help me? I can’t continue to live like this. And would really appreciate any guidance or encouragement. I’m just feeling so lost in life.

Some background info

1. I suffer from Body dysmorphia and OCD.
2. I’m 23 years old.
3. I’ve had lots of therapy in the past. I’ve been on antidepressants for 5 years and it takes too long to get therapy so I don’t think that it would be helpful in my case. I suffered from a drug overdose when I was 19 having felt a similar way I did now but my body dysmorphia & self-hatred was a lot worst.

However, at some point you (I mean me) just realize how tired you are from all this. Sure, let's spend another five hours worth of energy to battle your sad mind, and when you're finally ready to start something, you are no longer having any actual powercharge to do it. How many times have this happened to you? How many _years_? How many more wars can you handle (it feels like a war every time)? Nobody wins a hundred consecutive wars. It's doomed from the start. Nothing's ever gonna change. Why waste your time on this earth to relive same thing causing you just pain, anxiety and devastation? Is there even a point to try again, when it's abundantly clear you're weak and broken and have to deal with an extreme amount of struggle to write a freaking text or take a freaking shower? It's not worth to endure such length to try and achieve any semblance of normal life that's never gonna come.

All this above may be delusional too. I say may be, but deep inside I don't believe it is. I'm afraid that this black thought becomes way too rational to ignore. It's not a depression talking anymore, it's calculated reason of how much can I sacrifice and what can I expect to achieve. Those numbers just don't add up.

Of course, I won't do anything about it, I'm a coward.

I spent a month in training to backfill someone else’s role, right after the colleague left the team, the workload felt heavy I wasn’t understanding what to do or how to improve clients work. Its a very heavy external facing role to communicate with clients 4-5x a week. I had a panic attack when workload became too overwhelming and contemplated suicide. I spoke with my family about what was happening and they helped me draft a short term disability leave for a few weeks. 

I went on short term disability leave for 4 weeks in the middle of a hectic work week and left my tasks for my teammates to handle while I dealt with the medical crisis. I was prescribed to escopram 10mg for anxiety and depression. during my medical leave, I stayed home, did therapy once a week, slept a lot and watched a lot of tv shows. I didn’t want to socialize with anyone but it’s hard living with bf family. I normally would enjoy cooking, while depressed I can’t find the enjoyment or motivation to cook anything. I no longer have an appetite and I lost 10Lbs within 2 months. I feel lazy not wanting to do anything. The last time I felt this way was 8 years ago when both of my grandparents passed away. It took me half a year to recover and get my life back together. I have to return to work soon and I’ve decided to quit the job. I rather let the employer know earlier to find replacement than prolong my leave. I thought about not logging in to my work laptop so they can fire me where I can receive unemployment benefits. But that will affect my future jobs. 
Whenever I close my eyes, I dream about ways to not exist. I felt like I’ve ruined my reputation at work. 

Backstory
I just got my life together mid last year where I thought I’m finally where I’m at in life. Working at a global company in a senior position. It’s my first time working for a big progressive corporate company, I’ve worked hard to pass 4 rounds of interviews. It’s a hybrid role where I get to work in office twice a week which I enjoyed while it lasted. I was working on a fairly easy client account only managing one channel. My manager was very hands on with the client account where they conducted external calls until my colleague and I became more comfortable with public speaking. At the end of the year, the client decided to leave the firm so my team was scattered to different client accounts. I was unfortunately placed on a high demanding client account with lots of meetings a week. My workload went from one channel to three channels that I’m unfamiliar with. I felt isolated all of the time, my colleagues don’t communicate with me, my new manager wasn’t hands on with my work that I don’t  understand. I couldn’t find the connection with the team either, a majority of them Are males and I can’t connect to their conversations.",1678609893.0

220,Recurrent depressive disorder: how it looks like.,4,11p939u,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/11p939u/recurrent_depressive_disorder_how_it_looks_like/,3,"Hello everyone,

I suffer from recurrent depressive disorder, which is an unipolar, cycling, treatment-resistant form of depression.  I'm currently hospitalised, so I wanted to share on this sub. This is my mood chart across several recent years of my life. The onset of my disease was earlier, but I started monitoring my mood later on.

[Mood chart](https://preview.redd.it/q258ezn9n9na1.png?width=3600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c304590e604507b4ca10ac91d12232364823c490)

The various smoothed curves help me to notice some patterns, like the period of the recurrence as well as the duration of depressive episodes.

My current psychiatrist is not quite sure of this diagnostic, and has a suspicion of bipolarity (among other stuffs). To me however, it only matters that I suffer from this and I want to get better. For anyone coping with a similar pattern of depression, I can tell that I now know that, for me, it gets better. Every time. The downside is that it also comes back. I'm in the process of accepting this condition, getting help when necessary and that I'll always be a sensitive person in that regard.

Anyways, thanks for reading and please take care of yourselves.

 I always loved the idea of dating a beautiful woman and I was such a loser in high school the only thing I could think of doing to improve my chances was to make more money.

Well now that I’m 22 I realized I missed the college experience and have never dated. I’m afraid to talk to girls because I have no experience with anything.

I don’t do this for attention, I do it because I suffer with severe  bouts of depression and I have for years. I try not to do it, and I realise that it is a very unhealthy coping strategy, and that it understandably really upsets my mum. She cares a lot about me, and I love her more than anyone in the world. But sometimes my mental health problems just get too much for a few seconds, and I just fall into cutting myself. I feel very guilty about it. 

My mum and I recently had a big fight about it, and she says that it is completely insensitive, selfish, and irresponsible to go to work with these self harm scars visible. I really understand where she’s coming from, and I would absolutely hate it if someone were to see them and become upset while I’m trying to serve them (I work as a cashier). We have to wear a T-Shirt as a uniform, but are permitted to wear a long sleeve shirt under it if we want. She says that I simply can’t go to work with my scars showing, and that she won’t let me go into work without a long sleeve shirt.

I can’t help but feel that she is making me feel guilty about something I already struggle to feel comfortable about, and that she is shaming me for the very real pain my mental health causes me. I also feel that I would hate to upset people with my scars, and would prefer to cover them up (as I have meticulously in the past), but the fact is that it is extremely hot where I live, and it simply isn’t functional to wear two layers of clothing all day.

So… am I the asshole? Should I just suck it up and do the right thing, and wear a long sleeve shirt even though it causes me great discomfort from the heat, because I am responsible for the mistakes I’ve made, and I need to be extremely careful for how my scars might effect others? Or is my mum being hurtful and unsupportive?

This last week specifically has been hard, and in general I've felt muted, clouded and physically tense - hyperaware of every little twitch, strain and faulty fine motor movement. I've also had a dull tension or tightness in my chest for much of the day, coupled with more laboured breathing off/on. Well all of that may have culmulated tonight as while I was laying in bed, the breathing began to flair up. I walked upstairs to the bathroom, sat on the toilet and tried to calm myself. My breathing got more panicked, though, and the only thing I thought to do was grab my house robe, lie on the bathroom floor and hope it passed. I did just that and was basically gasping for air for the next 1-2 minutes. When I finally got back up, I ran my head under some cool water and it all seemed to tone itself down. It's now been 30+ minutes, and after a drink and some relaxing internet clips I seem to be back to normal.

I must admit, however, that its still gives me pause. I've had some panicky moments in the past, but this was something new and unexpected. I hope it doesn't happen again the future, but I guess more importantly, I hope I won't be by myself if it does.",1678596132.0
229,I'm unemployed and want to stay depressed. How do I fix this? Please share your thoughts.,3,11ow3ce,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/11ow3ce/im_unemployed_and_want_to_stay_depressed_how_do_i/,5,"I'm 24 years old. I've been depressed for about 8 years.

I've  been unemployed for the past year and have just stayed at home (parents  divorced, living with mother) while living off savings that are slowly  running out. When I think about it, it sounds pathetic but really all I  do is play video games, consume content, take a lot of naps, and  generally do anything I can to distract myself from the reality of my  life. Mentally, I feel at the capacity of a teenager. Recently I've  started to apply for jobs to not feel like such a deadweight. I even  applied to university to finish my degree and got accepted part-time  this fall, but my heart isn't really in to it. Over all these years I've  never had the courage or care to get professionally diagnosed or see a  therapist. I'm trying to figure out why.

I  would describe my experience as baseline being a completely null and  apathetic existence, but when I hit a mood swing I become so depressed  it's crushing. Yesterday was the worst mood shift out of the blue that  I've felt in a long time. I was in bed the entire day, crying about the  outcome of my life, and actively thought about jumping off the balcony  for several hours.

I feel like I need a wake up call, or validation, or someone to point me the right way forward.

I  woke up today and thought about how I need to get my life started and  even get in to therapy. My family have been as understanding as they can  be, but I'm starting to get pressured to get a job and get my shit  together. Sometimes they're the only reason I'm still alive, but I have a  hard time getting them to understand how much I'm suffering, what I'm  feeling, and that I'm not just being lazy.

I  was trying to ask myself why I haven't been working for the past year  and why I didn't care about it. I used to be employed at a grocery store  for 3-4 years and even got promoted a few times. I hated that job and  dealing with people all day long. Every time I went in I was reminded of  how my life did not turn out the way I intended and it made me so  irritable and anxious to go in. I met my best friend there and he felt  the exact same things I did, it's how we bonded. He killed himself in  2020. My family moved countries two years ago and when we arrived here I  got a job as a delivery driver for about a year. I thought it would be a  good idea - I would generally be by myself and would get to learn the  area better. I was actually fired from that job because I had severe  anxiety attacks while driving several times. I hated every second of  what I was doing and how it brought no value to my life or future and it  made me so upset/anxious I would hyperventilate and nearly faint.

I  think I realized that maybe I'm exhibiting these behaviors and have  distracted myself for years because I'm trying to protect myself. I feel  like if I have to go through the motions, work at another dead-end  minimum wage job, and do the correct things to fix my life that I'm  going hate it so much I will end up killing myself. I will be depressed  whether I'm unemployed or making minimum-wage. Hell, people are  depressed and kill themselves when they have made millions and millions  of dollars. I view my depression and behaviors as a way to ""save myself""  from suicide.

What do you guys  think about this relationship with my symptoms? Do I go in to therapy?  Do I just suck it up and get any job? Do I get diagnosed and/or apply  for disability?

I'm really  frustrated that I can't seem to make any progress. I don't want to  continue living this way for the rest of my life, but I don't know how  to get there. I want to treat the root cause of all the problems in my  life. Anytime I think about being successful and stable and in control  of my life I feel like an impostor. When I was younger I did really well  in school and had high hopes for my future. I don't know the steps I  need to take to get back on that path.

And everything in the present is not only ruined because of my bad decision, (in which I acted less than honorably so lots of shame), but I’m also ruining the present by being obsessed, depressed and mentally ill surrounding this and I can’t break free.

I hate watchin other being happy and doing good in their lives .

I just can't stop myself from going in a deep whole of thoughts full of anger , jealousy, overthinking and anxiety .

I don't hate them but these things make me lose interest in everything and I end up being alone .

I hate watching others succeed , being in a relationship or doing better than me in any aspect of life .

I avoid going outside , using social media , watching tv and talking to anyone bevause of how sensitive I am towards this feeling .

Am I just a selfish self centered person or is there something wrong with me ?",1678480934.0
243,How do you make new friends after depression?,2,11ocdue,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/11ocdue/how_do_you_make_new_friends_after_depression/,2,"Long story short, I’m trying to claw my way out of a three-year-long major depressive episode in which a lot of ugly crap happened and I ended up completely alone… as in, a literal hermit who spoke to no one but my sister. I want to get better… really, I do. I’m trying. But as dumb as I feel like it sounds, I’m so alone. I’ve managed to make some new acquaintances recently, but I’ve forgotten how to bond with people. I remember it used to come so naturally, but now? It’s like a forgotten language. 

I’m still a person… I think. I still have interests, and I’m trying to pick up my old hobbies again. Maybe I don’t really have goals right now, but I think they’ll come back as I get better. That’s what people say will happen, anyways. It’s just that… all those things I don’t or barely have are the things people bond over, aren’t they? So if I have no aspirations, barely work on hobbies, and only have a few odd interests like movies and psychology, how am I supposed to get close to anyone? Is there another way?

How do I get to know people? How do I let them get to know me? How can I, when the last few years of my life are just as depressing to hear about as they were to live out? Who the heck would want to hear about my sickness? Honestly…. again, I feel like this is a stupid question, but any advice anyone could give would be more than appreciated.",1678514587.0

I need help. Don't know where else to post.

This is a throwaway.


I will not reveal my identity in any sort of way or form. Nor will I reveal anyone else's identity if mentioned.


I am currently in foster care. For those who do not know what it is, it is a system where young people under 18 are placed into a household away from their parents because their parents are unable to look after them for a different variety of reasons. I have been in the system for quite a few years and I am allowed to see my parents under supervision roughly twice a month. 

Recently, I acquired contact information of my mum. This is not approved through social workers, therefore if anyone was to find out then I would be sent far away from my parents and will never be able to see them until I am 18.


I just had a phone call with my mum. She said that she was ill and whatever, dad was pissed because I specifically told her not to contact me after a certain time (6PM). However, she called me not long after 6. Although I was able to take the call, it was extremely risky and I could sort of understand why dad was pissed. Anyway, he basically kept arguing with her and saying that she is a bitch and doing stupid stuff because it was risky and that she should have listened to me. (They are eastern european, so I tried to translate as much as what he said to her)

I then told her that I honestly think we should stop contacting each other because of the severe risk it carries of being caught. I tried to tell her that and that we can still talk whenever we formally see each other under supervision. (My mum hasn't seen me in a while due to poor health, so while I am under supervision I call her through my dad's phone. We see each other in a contact centre)

I don't think she really understood the gravity of what we are doing right now so when I told her that I still love her very much and everything, she said she would end her life if I stopped contacting her. Obviously, it made me extremely worried. (She has had several attempts in the past). Dad got pissed that she more or less ""threatened"" me and she abruptly hung up.

I messaged her and said that we should stop contacting each other like this and we can always see each other in formal grounds. I also reassured her saying that I can freely see her after 18. She then responded with, ""I wish you all the best in your life..."". See here, my mum does often worry me and when she said that I immediately thought that at some point during my young adult life, she would not be here anymore. I just responded with, ""I love you very much and we can always talk during contact!"". In which she responded, ""I will not be coming. I'm ill"". I really do not know what to do.


Part of me wants to continue contacting her but the moral part wants me to stop and only keep it at a supervised level. (I know the risks of contacting her outside of these supervised times but I don't think she understands the risk)


Please help me with what I should do. Also, whenever she threatens suicide I always think it will happen. This is due to her seriousness and past attempts. Furthermore, I am worried of what dad might do to her (Not physical abuse, more verbal) and whether this verbal abuse has a toll on her. Please help. If she kills herself so will I.

255,(30M) How to cope with being unwanted because ugly?,1,11nx6an,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/11nx6an/30m_how_to_cope_with_being_unwanted_because_ugly/,6,"(posted this in Dating a little while ago)

So, this is a weird thing to post, as I really don't know what to do, but it's weighing me down and nobody seems to give any constructive help. I have tried posting on similar forums, but have had very little constructive help, mostly people don't seem to read this and understand the problems I am explaining.

Up top, I have no issues with shyness or anxiety, never had a problem talking to women or issues with confidence etc.

In short, I'm male, 30 years old, 5ft 10, 170lbs, I'm in fairly athletic shape. I rent in a city, and am fully employed. In my spare time I enjoy a range of hobbies, such as; going to the gym, swing-dancing, photography, meeting friends, going to bars & clubs. I've also joined some social ""meet-up"" groups designed to help meet new people. All of that is great, I love the things that I do, and I make friends very easily from them. I honestly feel lucky to have curated such a wonderful bunch of people from different walks of life, a healthy mix of male and female, older and younger, married and single. I'm very social, my problem is that I cannot get a girlfriend, and it's becoming increasingly apparent to me that my looks are the issue.

Look, I know that ""nobody's ugly!"" and all the Hallmark card stuff, but at this point I cannot put it down to anything else. This is not some random theory I've come up with, I have been told this many times over the years. Honestly, I think I'm somewhere in the range of 'average', don't we all? Sadly, the single women of the world have a different opinion. I have been told many times that I'm ugly, and though I don't believe it, it does seem like the general consensus. Tinder is the obvious yardstick: women are shown a picture of me with no clue as to how what job I have, my confidence levels, my religion, my politics, literally nothing other than ""is this person attractive?"" and seeing as I've never had a match on there, the answer must be ""no"". I'm on all the other usual suspects as well, Hinge, Bumble etc. Other people have said this either about me, or sometimes to me. I live in a big city, it is odd to never ever get a match. I take care in the photos I put up, it's not hard. I had a friend try to tell me that it must be something I'm saying wrong, and that he could get me date within a week using online dating. I took him up on his challenge, he could say whatever he wanted, just had to use photos of me. 2 months later with no dates, he gave up.

But of course, online is not the only way to meet people. Like I said, I do a range of activities that are very easy to meet a partner, and many do through these channels. I have known many single women actively looking for a man, but any suggestion I make of us getting to know each other better is quickly brushed aside. I will also get the ""I'm not looking for a relationship"" line from people, which is betrayed when they show up a few weeks later with an attractive person on their arm. I've even went speed dating, events where single women literally pay money to meet a man; at these events I've had really good times talking to people, felt relaxed, and walked away feeling good about myself. Then the next morning I find that out of 12 women, all of them ticked 'no' for me. Again, I can't see how it could be a confidence issue when I don't feel un-confident.

I'm having a hard time getting people to believe me. My friends certainly don't, as much as they give the cartoonishly supportive line of ""something will come along soon, just you wait!"", it would be more convincing if they hadn't been saying it since 2012. Thing is, they've all had a completely different lived experience. They're pretty people: they had their first relationships in their teens, then a couple of semi serious ones in their early 20s, then they got married with 2.4 kids and a Labrador. Whereas I'm 30 and never even had a Valentine's Day card. I feel very 'behind' everyone else. They literally do not understand the words I am saying when I tell them that women want nothing to do with me, because they've never had that experience. It makes me sad that as much as I do enjoy my life as it is, I'm getting the impression that... this is it; I will just work during the week, fill my evenings and weekends with hobbies and friends, and that's all my life will be until I die.

Statistically it's unheard of to make it to 30 without having a single relationship, I've never met anyone with that issue. I have had a couple of one-night-stands when I was in my early 20s, but I'm very aware they only happened with copious amounts of alcohol, in the sober light of day each person dropped me very quickly.

It makes me feel there's really nothing to look forward to in life. As in, I don't see the point in working really hard to buy a house, so I can be ugly & unwanted in walls that I own. I'm happy with my job, and it pays fairly well, but that's not something that's obvious to the naked eye when I'm in a bar scenario.

I don't know, but seemingly nobody else seems to. I don't know what I hoped to achieve writing this here, but I'm just out of ideas. I'm very sure many will skim-read this and come up with the usual ""you just need to believe harder!"" or ""have you tried meeting new people?"", to those who've read the whole thing and believe the words I'm saying, thank you.

264,Is it my fault that I am depressed?,4,11n60v5,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/11n60v5/is_it_my_fault_that_i_am_depressed/,27,"Please note that I am not after validation of my emotions or the classic 'I'm sorry that you are going through this' but a serious, intellectual inquiry on that logical statement: **is my depression self-inflicted?**

My past is the classic broken family case, unhealthy relationships with unavailable people (whether married men twenty years older than me (my first sexual and romantic experience), simply not emotionally available or incompatible) and diagnosed depression with suicidal thoughts, profound loneliness yet tendency to isolate and sort out my problems by myself, as I don't like asking for help and I don't see the point of doing it. 

I'm doing therapy and I read every book I can find, whether it is philosophy, psychology, neuroscience or spirituality. I keep a healthy lifestyle: 8 hours of sleep, exercise, eat healthy food, be social, etc.

I've come to realise that the trigger for that depression is external in the sense that certain things have happened to me, but it is profoundly internal for I am the one who has decided to pursue those relationships and trust and build dependency with people who were not ready or interested in it, and also the one who is clinging to that pain and not letting it go. I just feel sad and resentful and angry for those things. I was only caring and loving towards them, and they weren't.

It is not within my control that they have their issues and/or lack feelings towards me that I do have for them, even if it is their responsibility to be emotionally accountable. 

At the end of the day, nothing of this had happened if I had made good decisions. 

It is true that my father was overly critical, against emotions and failed to be there for me. Never calling to ask if I was okay, wishing happy birthday and the usual social conventions. It is true that my mother struggled to provide a stable environment. It is true that my brother also left the house when I was 6 and failed to call to see if I was okay, to support me at school when boys would come to beat me or to reciprocate emotionally when I was affectionate towards him to create a bond. He has also failed to apologise for his mistakes (saying if it wasn't because I was there (on holidays) for a couple of days, he would hit me in the face) and completely divest on me. It is true that my father has potentially sexually abused me when I was a baby (my brother says he saw him caressing me down there displaying signs of pleasure) and maybe that's why I can't have penetration (whether from a man or just putting a tampon in, I genuinely fainted when I tried to put my first tampon on). Yet I still don't know if my dad actually sexually abused me and hence its impact.

All I know is that I have made all these terrible decisions and I've reached a point when I just don't want to live because it hurts too much. My belief system has shifted in such a way that it doesn't lead me to a positive outcome. Life truly is about suffering, it's inevitable. And to live for a moment of light in an ocean of darkness, especially when the darkness feels so intense and so constant, doesn't make sense. Joy is temporary while this profound sorrow and emptiness I feel is always there, lurking. 

I am very confused about everything in life. When my therapist says that I have been emotionally abused by my family I don't believe her. I can't get myself to say I've been abused.

I've noticed that I'm starting to become badly effected by posts I see on social media. For example, if I see a post about a mum struggling to feed her babies/kids then I will usually physically start crying from thinking about it too much, or seeing a dog that has been abandoned can leave me so depressed,and makes me spiral into thinking about all of the dogs/all animals and babies who are scared and in bad situations,and how theres no way i can help.

269,Depressed about work,1,11ndh2g,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/11ndh2g/depressed_about_work/,3,"27f, I started working at a new job back last November. Things seemed to be going ok, but I’ve made more mess-ups and mistakes in four months than in all my past working life. I get so nervous thinking that “this mistake will be my last at this job,” or “how can I possibly recover from THAT?” I have been (unjustly) fired before. I know the saying that making mistakes helps you learn, but so far it has seemed like a series of pratfalls, scrapes bumps and all.

To make matters worse, I have two bosses who want to share my time by splitting me down the middle. The workload is INSANE. One is about to retire, so I suck it up, but he’s a heavy drinker and sometimes yells. He doesn’t tolerate anything but pure perfection, and even then things take numerous revisions and scoldings before he’s anywhere close to happy with my work. I have had one serious panic attack. I’ve burst into tears and sobbed (in FRONT of my bosses) from the pressure and stress MULTIPLE times. I’m having memory and focus issues (ADHD, quite possibly), but every time I ask for help from my bosses I get trodden on and ridiculed.

I’m getting to the point where I don’t even feel I have any worth, I suck at my job and I’m not qualified for anything that pays better. I can’t look at job boards without self-deprecation. I’ve been depressed before, but not like this. I keep thinking about quitting the job for my mental health!

Does anybody have life tips to give, ideas to share, solutions for improving my career or outlook on life? Am I blowing things out of proportion? I could really use another persons perspective.

Thx so very very much <3",1678419257.0

As someone who's had hundreds of dislocations from EDS and has CPTSD from it, I really related to dekku.  


I found inspiration from him initially, being quirkless in a world where everyone has an advantage over you and life doesn't give you breaks.  


I started exercising while watching it, then I found anime rap songs that deeply explain suffering of all facets.  


I stopped listening to anything that wasn't going to push me forwards and made a playlist of anime songs (like from fabvl, he's amazing).  


I ended up coming across David Goggins and I've been obsessed ever since.  


Finally a male role-model that also is learning-disabled, has been through extreme abuse and learned self-discipline - managed to come out on the other side stronger.  


I've battled severe major depressive disorder and am resistant to all but 1 medication, I've tried hundreds over the years going back to a child.  


After watching nothing but goggins 24/7 I started getting on a cycle bike, despite the possibility of one or more dislocations.  


My first time I went 1 hour, my second I had an asthma attack but fought past by controlling my breathing and went on to do 2 hours.  


I learned about Andrew Huberman from the Rich Roll podcast, started watching videos on how to optimize my health and gain.  


I found Wim Hoff and started doing cold showers, it should be noted that you're not supposed to do his breathing while in a cold exposure as it's killed people.  


His breath work is separate from cold exposure.  


Now my max tolerance for cortisol is much higher.  


I went from 100 LBS to 138.  


I'd like to link some videos to go along with what I'm talking about.  


Anyways, I've been stranded on the floor for 5 hours from dislocations when I was younger.  
I've nearly KMS multiple times, I've had hundreds of dislocations so if I can do it anyone can.  


The first step is accountability, stop making excuses.

I \[24\] live with my girlfriend \[22\]. We have been together for a year now. She has been dealing with depression for about 6 years. She is tired of her life, always sad, unmotivated to do anything, and doesn't care what happens to her. She told me she used to have suicidal thoughts before starting to take antidepressants. But now she is forgetting to take them because she just doesn't care. Instead of taking them once a day, she takes them about once or twice a week. Yesterday, she was sad but wouldn't tell me why, just wanted to be left alone. Later, I found cuts on her wrist, which she was trying to hide. She told me she tried to kill herself with a knife but couldn't do it.  I was trying to convince her how serious this is and proposed a therapist but she is just unwilling to do anything about her situation. She acts as if nothing happened and asked me several times to forget it ever happened. I am scared to death that she will try it again. I am thinking about my possibilities.

&#x200B;

Reminding her of her antidepressants:

I made a device that will always remind her to take antidepressants, and I try to always remind her myself. But I don't think this is nearly enough to deal with this situation.

&#x200B;

Contacting her family:

I don't have a contact to her family. I could steal her mom's number from her phone and tell her, but I feel like I will be destroying her trust in me. On the other hand, in this situation, I care more about her health than our relationship.

&#x200B;

Visiting a therapist myself:

I was thinking about going to a therapist myself to talk about her, but I doubt this solves anything.

&#x200B;

Hiding sharp objects from her:

This was proposed in other posts I found, but it's not like she can't go buy a new knife if she wanted to.

&#x200B;

1. Should I tell her parents?
2. Should I go to a therapist myself to talk about her?
3. Is reminding her of her antidepressants enough?

I don't really use Reddit but I figured might as well give it a shot.

I am an 18 year old who has been living with chronic anxiety, depression, insomnia and other things for the past (almost) 4 years. I have been in therapy for 3 years. 

I am also diagnosed with EUPD. Emotionally unstable personality disorder which makes me feel things much more intensely and it's kind of an all or nothing mindset which affects my relationships and basically every aspect of life.

It started off with just anxiety in school exams and social situations, then came the depression, insomnia, etc. And now I am on antidepressants and sleeping pills because everything became unbearable. I have been taken in and out of psych wards and hospitals.

Things get better at times but I always come back to this stage of suicidal thoughts and self harm. My family does not understand anxiety and thinks I need to just grow a pair and face it. My older brother was also diagnosed with OCD and anxiety. 

Now, even the smallest criticism can send me down a spiral at times. There's just alot. I was a decent student and an above average student throughout my high school years but now I've given up on that aswell. I am an outgoing and ambiverted person (but my social anxiety often takes toll and stops me from doing things I would want to do) and have enough people in my circle but I do not talk to them about my issues in depth. Just ask for help at moments when I'm having terrible panic attacks. 

I was supposed to start college last year but physically couldn't get myself to do so because of my issues. I regret that now. I am starting college around August this year, if I make it till then that is. I feel like I'm already lagging behind in life and everyone is much far ahead. I feel like a financial and emotional burden on my family. 

I keep the option of self harm and suicide available incase things go south. I know I shouldn't do it but there's a level of comfort in knowing I can leave if I ever want to. 

I just am living life being miserable. The past two weeks have been spent in my bed, eating and drinking close to nothing at days, crying and just being upset in general. My family sees all of it but all they do is tell me to get off my ass and get to work and studies and to stop ruining everyone's mood. I lock myself in my room most of the time. Just don't know what to do anymore cause even though therapy helps and there's moments when I feel better, I come back to this stage everytime.

I bite my tongue to avoid conflicts. I cannot confront, but nor can I abide. What more can I do? What will my mind allow? This I do not know. 

Words flow from the pages to fill my soul, though my soul can never be sated, nor satisfied. I ravenously absorb every piece, of every word, and though it transports me for a time, it is never for long enough.
The words are an escape. An escape from brutal reality. It may be only a temporary reprieve, but the absence of reality is sometimes the only solace I am able to get from the concept we call life.

The pages of books are my home. My prison that I freely walk into to be shut away from the horrors of the world. To be trapped in a different world each night of my own choosing. For it allows me to express. To freely let the emotions flow without accepting the feelings as my own.

**Words have always been my refuge. They have been my rock. They have anchored me to this mortal coil, and to the dirt beneath my feet. They have yet to lead me astray as long as i put my soul into them. And my very essence shall one day be put into the old pages of the books so beloved by me

He’s essentially been diagnosed with dementia, but the tar has formed in the parts of his brain that help him see. This has been incredibly hard to deal with as a family.

I tried stoicism. I practised meditation. I tried making friends. I tried getting a good job. But the thing is the world has rejected me. The world has told me again and again that I am not welcome. The world has failed me again and again. If the world doesn't want me why should I want this world. 

My relationships? Practically zero. Everybody claims they are my friends but I never get invited anywhere. I DM people and never get a reply back. The moment someone seems to find an opportunity they don't bother backstabbing me to get ahead. Who can I trust. In the name of love all i get is paid lust. The only thing people care about, atleast the people I know is their own happiness and own pleasure. I am done trying to provide them the pleasures. 

My career? Practically fucked. I did pull sleepless nights, scored good grades, won case comps, prepared for interviews, did more live project and certification than anyone in the batch. What's my prize for the effort? Lowest salary in the entire batch. No company wanted to hire me and wouldn't even tell why I am a bad candidature. It was hard seeing everyone getting placed and no company bothering with me. I don't know how I pulled through that blow. I just can't anymore. I became a stoic but I guess I couldn't be fully. All these straight AAs that I keep getting are just a mockery of me i feel. 

I never had a childhood. All spent behind nothing but studies. Not only was there poverty but also bullying from everyone be it relatives or colleagues. The traumas became fear which is affecting me further. My only escape was porn from which I have lost all interest now. I never did drugs, alcohol etc but now I think that would be a great escape. There is no prize for leading a honest life but depression.

I am 25 now I don't want to know what horror lies ahead for me. The only thing keeping me alive is the fact that I am my parents only son. I don't want to suffer anymore. A sleep that never ends seems like a far better deal than this shitshow of a life. I don't want to get out of bed again.",1678287367.0

My younger sister suffered a stroke at birth, resulting in paralyzation on her right side & brain damage, and using a wheelchair to get around. I have two brothers, one younger, one older. The older refusing any responsibility w/ her at all so I had to spend my free time at home, becoming the weird, quiet kid at school. I’d get bullied and my brother would jump in on it, anything to get more attention from people. Trying to keep this short though. But, despite all of that, I met the perfect girl toward the end of middle school. Yes, middle. I’m confident we would’ve gotten married if we had met a few years later. I still had some learning to do about myself, and her parents were super controlling, and because of a mix of those two things, she broke things off and blocked me, b/c it hurt her. We didn’t see each other for a few years, and she moved on from me completely, even as friends when I saw her again. 
Still, without her part in my life, I don’t think I’d be here. She’s married now, and I’m happy for her. Even if things didn’t turn out well for us, of course she deserves that. Recently though, I’ve been stewing over what could’ve been, over my screwups, and the mess of my life. Now, when I think of motivation, I think of her, be the man she would’ve been proud of, and I use that to move forward, w/ or w/o her. 
If I try to talk to my mother about anything, she turns it on herself & plays victim. My father is too tired to care + always takes her side. I’ve had no one to talk to for a couple years now, so here I am putting it on the internet to strangers, so I guess I wanted to see what people’s thoughts were, whether or not that’s a sick form of motivation to use. 
It’s already long as it is, and I tried to keep it short, so I can elaborate on things if need be.

[6.march] this was the worst yet did you notice that i wrote yet ? Because it will get worse that's it for today.

[March 7. Night 00:28] [Note] i was thinking about why im depressed and want to kill myself......maybe that life is the same everyday and nothing makes me happy even if i try new things? Why live if i won't make a change in the world? Why live if i can never find happiness? Why live if i will be alone and lonely forever? Why live even though I'm ugly and i hate the way i was born i hate my race everyone is racist(one of the most racist countrie's in eu) i hate it! I hate the way i was born i won't make a change in the world. Why do i continue to try... Why live even though everyone's fake i always get left out out of everything literally.
Why live even though I will never succeed in life, and I'm gonna be suicidal forever, i don't want to fight anymore, i want to jump of the balcony, i want to take every pill in the house, and overdose but i dont my mom to be in pain. And probably everyone hates me. Why won't it FUCKING end what's so great about living? I've got the answer absolutely nothing. I wish a big meteor would hit the Earth and destroy everything here so no pain would exist again. I just wish everyone would just forget about me or that i was never born.... But that's not possible.... I hate myself so fucking much. I think that's it...




Edit 1: [March 7 night 1:14]these are some things i forgot about. The depression made me loose my appetite. I think about killing myself 24/7. I wanted to cry so much but i can't when I want to cry my throat and chest hurts. And i probably have insomnia because every i can't fall asleep until 5:30 or something like that, on March 6 i got literally 2 hours of sleep. And i met a girl on a site she was struggling with depression because her ex made her feel like everything was her fault i helped her and she recovered, BUT now it looks she isn't there for me and dosent care about me like everyone else. I don't even remember the last i smiled (the real one i always fake my smile so no one will get noticed how I feel). I'm a burden for my parents I'm a waste of money i should kill myself i hate everything in life.
 I should go back to sleep

Edit 2 : [March 7] today i stood on the small edge of a really high and tall building i wanted to do it but i was there with my ""friends"" so i didn't we went there to explore something abandoned and there was s ladder to the roof it was super high up i was there wanting to jump but i couldn't do that to my mom.

I work in an office with just two people, both twice my age and whom I can't connect with on a personal level. The friends I'd made at my last job, people actually my age, all but stopped inviting me to hang out like they had been. My longtime friends are hundreds of miles away now or have all gotten engaged/married and are occupied with real adult things, and I'm stuck playing third wheel. I wouldn't care about the stigma of being a virgin, having never kissed someone, having never even properly dated anyone, but the societal pressure to find a romantic partner is so suffocating and inescapable. So I try and try and fail and fail, and at this point, I'm completely resigned to the rejection it always ends in, without fail.

At this point, it's just leading to greater and greater suicidal ideation. I daydream when I'm driving about how easy it would be to swerve off an overpass when driving on Interstate, when I'm in a tall building how I could take just one step off the edge of the roof. I'm starting to think that the inevitable day will involve huffing enough carbon monoxide to pass out and leave this world peacefully, and I've put basic thought into what kind of message I'd want to leave behind. I don't think it's a matter of ""if,"" it's a matter of ""when."" I know telling people this means I should expect a lot of ""it gets better' sentiments, but I've lived nearly three decades, and that sure as hell doesn't seem to be true",1678315266.0

However, while I was enjoying my time so much, at the back of my head, I knew that me and my family will be moving to another country (moving for my father’s job). I dreaded the moment I will have to leave, however, I did a decent job dealing with it. Unfortunately, the time came, and ever since August, I’ve been living the worst life. I haven’t found any friends with common interests, I go home every time after school, I spend the weekends at home, and it just seems.. hopeless. I look at my snap memories and I can’t believe certain things happened a year ago already, it just seems like a week ago. Day by day I get more depressed since I feel like the situation is unfixable and I will never find the happiness I had a year ago. Has anyone experienced anything similar? I’m just looking for any way out, and I don’t even know who to ask anymore. My parents try to help me and I appreciate it, but their efforts are useless.

I'm 18 and a year ago was doing really well, I never knew what I wanted to do exactly in the future, but I had interests, subjects I enjoyed and planned to go on pursuing. Recently it's like everything has collapsed in on me. So quickly I've turned into the opposite of what I used to be. I've isolated myself, have no interest in seeing my friends or making new ones. I don't have a job or any kind of activity to take up my time, and I can never bring myself to find something, or if I do, I never go through with it, like somethings stopping me. I can't seem to think of anything I enjoy or want to pursue and I can't see anything good in my future it just seems hopeless. I'm supposed to be going to university this september but I don't know if I can do it anymore, I can't tell if it's just not what I want anymore or if I'm just re thinking things because I'm in a bad place.

If anyone else has ever gone through this and come out the other side please could you offer any tips for how you started to find yourself again. Anyone I have spoken to in my life doesn't seem to understand, they tell me to just think positive and basically tell me I can control the way I see things but it really doesn't feel that way. I almost feel like I've lost every sense of who I am and it's probably at the worst time because right now I'm expected to make huge decisions about my life and future.

308,Help with issue needed,2,11lvj5q,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/11lvj5q/help_with_issue_needed/,6,"Hi all, looking for advice for an issue, there's a bit of a back story so bare with me.

A year and a half ago I met a guy who I'll refer to as Z. We quickly started dating but after around 6/8 weeks we stopped as it was obvious there were things that weren't working, however as we were really good together we decided to remain friends.

This was all fine, we had ups and downs like any friendship but we got on really well together and had plenty of good times, helped and supported each other etc. During the Summer of 2022, Z was suffering from a health issue so I tried to support as much as I could, but they weren't telling me how I could support them so I was essentially guessing.

At this point I should say that I suffer with a mild form of Autism, which affects my ability to recognise some social cues/situations etc. Z was aware of this and we spoke about it.

From around October 2022 I started to develop feelings for Z again. At first I was trying to fight it as I only wanted to be friends but it became clear I couldn't do this as they were real. In December I told Z about how I felt and asked if they wanted to try again however they did not which I respect and understand.

From then on things seemed to be strained, we didn't communicate or see each other as much though this was linked to Z's health issues which were causing him issues. In mid-January Z pulled out of seeing me for the 2nd time in a couple of weeks. As I was still processing the earlier feelings this left me upset and I told him this. Z then responded with a long message with a lot of hurtful comments. That was the last message I received from him, nearly 2 months ago.

The message made me feel like a monster and while I don't agree with how it was said, I understand his feelings. He wasn't well at the time and I made the situation about me, so he felt like disregarded him which makes me feel awful. I also put way too much pressure on him to see me, when he had issues himself. The fall out from everything for me has ended up with being diagnosed with depression.

To further complicate matters, Z has a mutual friend who I am very close with and he is now seeing them more than ever since we stopped talking.

I appreciate it's a lot, but has anyone got any advice how I can deal with this going forward? I don't know if I'll ever talk to Z again to fully understand things and this hurts a lot. It was also my birthday Monday to which I of course had nothing from him which hurt some more.

If you've read all this, thank you, and any help would be appreciated.",1678279734.0

However, I met her when I was 19, and mostly dated when I was in the first years of my 20's (she is 5 years older than me). I was a self centered, cheating, lying, narcissistic asshole. I ended up leaving her for someone I was seeing on the side. I put her through so much pain, made her believe lies, then tossed her aside like trash.

- 3/7/23 today I have came to the realization that I’ve always been enough for my self or at least recently, but it’s just the pressure around me of those telling me that I’m not. Whether it’s an action or my character alone. It’s been projected on me so much that I’m not enough. That I’ve began to feel the same way myself. But once I express this feeling that I’m not enough. People try their best to tell me that I am. I’m stuck in this constant loop of being appraised and neglected and I’ve began to lose the truth. I’m scared that I’ll never find it again. 

I’m losing the sense of being happy. In the moments when I do get a glimpse of enjoyment I feel as if I am being judged because I’m doing too much. I digress and act neutral again, holding back the happiness that I am truly fulfilled as it slowly turns back into dull emotion. I’m now crying hysterically again for god knows what reason. I think it’s because my geometry grade went down. But they’re only formative so they don’t impact my grade too much. Regardless I think it is because I see myself as failure once again. I’m trying my best. I truly am. Or am I. I’m starting to feel that my best is bare minimum and that I will never be at where I used to be. I constantly think about how these years are my prime. I should live them to the fullest and be happy with life. So why am I so sad. I fear that I am wasting away these years with depression and I’ll never be able to get them back.

I'm fully an adult, and in the age range where being unemployed is pretty rare. Ive been dealing with it for years in therapy, but my self esteem has not gotten much better.  I know that I'm not alone, and the cards that ive been dealt are not my fault. Because I am so hard on myself, I am constantly beating myself for ""not trying hard enough"", but I also don't know when to allow myself to rest.

I am very fortunate to be getting SSI but I often wonder if that has trapped me? I feel very much for those of us who are unable to get that and I don't always believe that I deserve it.

I'd kill to be creating a life for myself that I value, but right now I just can't imagine getting there and my quality of life is simply not good enough. When I'm extra depressed, I believe that it is inhumane.
What's a big old loser like me to do? How do you manage your issues with motivation? Have any of you found a job you could manage? Any stories of progress you'd like to share? Those are usually very helpful for me.

I’ve been going over my past a lot lately, I haven’t really had it easy. I was adopted into an emotionally sexually and physically abusive family. Left when I was 16 was a homeless teen dealt with assault and poverty. Met my ex fiancé when I was 21 he came from wealth. We bought a house together we got engaged I couldn’t really hang onto a job though. We started a small music career (I’d perform as a rapping drag queen he’d produce) and it was starting to gain traction before Covid. But when Covid came everything fell apart I called off the engagement because my partner was being self destructive and we’d already been having issues. He and his family quickly rejected me. I ended up having a pretty nasty suicide attempt after having an armed stand off with a white supremacist on my front lawn during BLM in St. Louis and dealing with the break up and loss of the stability and family I was creating. I decided to love to LA and been here for 2 years now. Started up my music career again but I never really get anywhere with it. Every traditional job I get ends up not being sustainable (currently filing a wrongful termination suit against the last office I was at for gross retaliation) but even then I feel like what’s the point. When I was young I used to tell myself I’ll get out of my parents house and their abuse when I was homeless I told myself I’ll be successful. Everything just goes in a loop and I end up at square one again.

i have no friends and work has been hard since i’ve been so fucking depressed. i cry constantly and even at work daily. people can tell i’ve lost the light i think im getting asked if i’m ok at work. they’re the only other people i interact with (my coworkers). i’ve always had such a hard time making friends and since i moved around a lot as a child i don’t have any old friends. i live fairly close to my parents but they’re the only family i have nearby the rest are like 800 miles away. i was definitely depressed before but it started after my bf and i broke up. 
he (20m) broke up with me a couple months ago after 1.5 years. he said it’s because hes going back to college and he said he needed to focus on his school and new friends and mental health. he was the only person in my life that i was comfortable with. we didn’t have a great relationship but after we broke up i realized how bad i was and how much i was willing to do more and be a better gf for him. i work full time and the hours just don’t fit. i realize we won’t work out and he’s not my person but i can’t help but hold on to him bc he was the only person i had in my life. and we still communicate and hang out sometimes but no matter what it gets ugly eventually. he gets aggressive because i poke and prod and we argue and both have our issues so it always ends badly. i still miss him though. he’s changing so much and i want to be there for him and to see that. i wanted us to get better together. i understand it’s not reasonable and he said he wants to grow up single so he can focus on himself and i agree but it’s hard that i’m the person he’s cutting out. 
as for for myself i’ve tried reaching out to acquaintances/friends but they just blow me off. last time i complained about my depression to my mom she didn’t help me bc she was depressed when she was young and got addicted to pills. she said she doesn’t want me to be like that. i haven’t really thought about killing myself but it just seems so much easier not to be here. i don’t want that though. i’ve lived this long and i want to see it get better, i really do. but on my weekend i have nothing to do and no one to hang out with. i have a pet bird and i neglect him honestly. he deserves so much more than me. but i can’t give him up. 
i just don’t know what else to do and every day is getting harder and harder. nothing interests me anymore and i’m trying. no shows movies seem good to watch or if they do they’re about relationships and how they’re working out or not working out. every little thing triggers me. i haven’t been eating. but not because i’m not hungry. some days i’m not but some days i just tell myself not to eat because truthfully i am definitely overweight. i do feel weak and the last meal i ate was egg whites with some toasts like two days ago. i had to go to my parents to eat because i haven’t gone grocery shopping in months. i guess i tell myself i don’t deserve the food but idk. i’m just weak. mentally and physically.
i did sign up for talkspace but the therapist like isn not getting back to me. it’s been two days because he doesn’t work on the weekend but i’ve been paying for the service for five days and no one has talked to me yet. like i walked out on my job yesterday (my friday) because it just became too much. my boss cares for his employees truly i think but he’s admitted he has a crush on me so i can’t talk to him like i was before. i’ve run out of places to go and i have too much pride to reach out to anyone else. i can’t do it.

Part one. 

So if you know me or follow me you know that I'm a big believer that everyone could benefit from going to some sort of therapy. In my years of going to therapy or having my girls in therapy, I realize that not all therapists is alike and not all therapists are the same. 

So recently as I was watching this documentary on Netflix called Stutz in which Jonah Hill Interviews his therapist, I realized that the things that he said were definitely not like any therapy I've ever seen or heard of but it made a lot of sense.

So he first starts by telling you it's like a pyramid. You have to take care of your body 1st.

This means exercise, eating right, and meditation. Getting into yourself will definitely get you out of your head and out of your depression. 

The 2nd part of the Pyramid is people.
When you're depressed you tend to push the people you love away. You want to be by yourself, crawl into a hole or underneath a blanket, and be all alone in your misery. But what he was saying is that it is then that you need to pull those people closest to you because any kind of human interaction is a positive thing.

The last thing he spoke about on the pyramid was yourself.
He went on to say one of the best tricks to get into your self-consciousness is writing. Writing is like a mirror to what your unconscious is feeling. You enhance your relationship with yourself by writing.
It's about increasing your life force to find out what you're passionate about.

The next part of this is called part X. It is the judgmental part of you. It's the invisible force that wants to keep you from learning and growing. It's the voice of impossibility, that is within yourself that tells you you can't do this or this is impossible and it creates a primal fear in human beings.

You have 3 aspects of reality: 
Pain, Uncertainty, and Constant work.

The highest creative expression for a human being Is to be able to create something new, in the face of adversity. The worse the adversity, the greater the opportunity.

You can't move forward without being vulnerable. You can't get past your failures without failing first.

So today my friends remember, there are many ways to get you to move on with your life. But you must first realize that you have to be the change you want to see. Check out part 2 tomorrow with more details on how to change your life.

(Some background: I'm a 25 year old woman living in the Netherlands)

Since I was a kid I've struggled with (high functioning) depressive episodes. I am now 25 years old, just ended a year of therapy for my anxiety disorder and started antidepressants. I feel like in my personal life I have gotten closer to what I need to stay in balance, and am better able to accept my condition. Also I am currently being tested for several different diagnoses, including ASS, some anxiety disorders and PTSS. 

I started working as a consultant at a prestigious business firm 2 years back after graduating. I didn't know what to do with my career so I decided this job would give me the opportunity to look into different types of businesses and projects. This all started out ok, I was happy to start a new opportunity and working from home due to Covid made me feel less anxiety about the job. 

Little over a year ago some things in my personal life changed, I broke up with the boyfriend I had for 3 years with whom I lived together, it was a messy breakup that also cost me a few close friends. At that moment my brother was also suffering from severe ocd and was passively suicidal. (He is ok now fortunately) I took care of him by checking in with him everyday and convincing him to live another day. I was devastated, however I've always been a person who despite feeling depressed, kept working hard. So I kept working hard while I was slipping deeper and deeper into a depression. 

Last summer it snapped, I came back from a holiday and couldn't work anymore. I called in sick and didn't work for approximately 2 months. All I did was survive. Not working gave me time to heal from everything that happened, and realign with my values in life. Therefore, after those two months, I started to feel ok again in my personal life.

Then I had to start building up work again. First a few hours, until this point where I'm at 60% again. Everytime I increased the amount of hours I work I had small depressive episodes again of +/- 2 weeks. I realised that from the moment I started the job, I felt like I was living someone else's life. A couple weeks ago I therefore had to conclude that it is not possible for me to reintegrate into this job. The job is at a firm that is not in line with my values (only focused on profit) and I'd like to have a job where it feels more like I'm contributing to society. I feel this is necessary for me to get out of this depressive loop.

So now I'm here, silently applying for jobs, having to still work and reintegrate at my current job while feeling depressed a lot. I feel like a shell of myself. I need to make a decision:

1. Quit the job right now, live on my savings, costing me about 1600/month everything included (high rent, live in the city) I have savings of approx. 16k
Pros: rest, ability to focus on recovery
Cons: stress about money and job
2. Stay in the job and keep silently applying to jobs and hope I can get out quickly while surviving through my days.
Pros: no stress about money or finding a job quickly
Cons: not capable of recovery
3. Some other option?

I feel like both options have their good and bad sides, and give me anxiety in some way. Therefore I am asking you guys for advice, what would you do in my position? Do you maybe see other options? Should I talk to my boss about this? And what should I tell them?

Thanks in advance for taking the time to reply, I am forever grateful!

So many strategies to improve yourself, little by little, over time just will not work for me. Not that I haven’t tried. But it’s also circumstantial too.

The big strategies are like, go out and talk to a couple strangers each day. Put yourself in positions where you can meet people. Nope. Not an option, not yet. I can’t even make eye contact with people. And I push myself to do these things every day anyways, and I get absolutely no benefit from it. I know this just doesn’t work for me.

So, we look at smaller shit like “think about all the people that helped you today” or “ask a friend to do something with you”. Little improvements here and there that are better for people that can’t work up any motivation. That would be great! Problem! I don’t have friends.

My biggest issue, the strongest fuel for my depression, is that I’m just horribly fucking lonely. I don’t have anyone. I haven’t had anyone. Most of my life has been spent painfully alone and now I don’t even know how to begin working on recovering from that. I’ve quite literally traumatized myself from this and every step forward I take, I get knocked 5 back.

I don’t know what to do. Nothing helps. I do these things and I see these things and I wish I could do more, but I can’t. I’ve been trying really hard to give some things a shot. I can journal and write about my day and force myself to list a couple good things that happened but it’s all overshadowed by the fact that I’m still completely alone. I can go out in public and watch people and at least show my face and get out of the house but it doesn’t matter. I don’t feel anything from it. Whenever I look at people all I can ever think is just how much I want to be in their place. How much I want to have what they have. It’s not quite jealousy, it’s that it reminds me what I’ve always wanted and what I’ve never been able to get. I’d give anything.

It’s counterintuitive, right? I want to be with people, so I go out, I see people, it makes me sad, it makes me anxious, I leave, nothing changes. Part of that’s my fault, but a bigger part of it is that so much shit stands in my way that I can’t do anything effective.

Every. Single. Time. I have looked for new things to try, it’s always under the assumption that you have someone to help you, or you have someone to appreciate. I don’t! There is nobody in my life that I interact with enough (not my choice!) to have this, even in the loosest sense. Where are strategies for people below rock bottom? 

Between this and meds not working it makes me feel so sick knowing that nothing helps. I’m positive I have treatment resistant depresssion at this point but the thought of waiting longer and trying more meds and waiting and waiting and waiting for something to work might kill me. And the more time I spend alone the more it hurts. But nothing helps and I don’t know what to do anymore. I can’t have exhausted every option but a lot of them are getting really out of reach. 

My brain takes every opportunity to help myself and just crushes it before it can even do anything.

I don’t know. This turned into a rant. How are you supposed to recover when every strategy assumes you have something you don’t? Strategies for someone that needs something smaller than baby steps?",1678168960.0

So I’ve been struggling with depression for a while now, or at least what I think is depression. Honestly it’s kinda shitty surprisingly and I want to get better. The only problem is is I don’t want people to know I’m depressed. I can’t tell any of my teachers or counselors because they’re mandated reporters and suicidal thoughts will get me attention. I don’t want to tell my friends because we’re all teenagers, plus I don’t want them to avoid me when they have a problem just because I’m suffering. And then I don’t want to tell my family because I don’t want to hear “it’s all in you’re head, you’re faking it, it’s cause of that phone.” Or worse, that they believe me. I exercise, socialize, I’m ‘active’ and I’m about to go to college. I should be excited but I’m more excited anytime I’m crossing an intersection, on the off chance I get isekaid.

Throwaway because partner knows main account.  
This is not my first rodeo, I survived abuse by my alcoholic ex husband, he whom cheated on me, raped me, hit me, abused me in every possible way. Anyways, I got out, took therapy and meds, got my life straight and cared for my kids. I started dating an old crush and he once said he thought drugs and depression meds were just the same, that resonated in me and while they seemed to help, i stopped taking them, i thought i was able to take life as it was, and for months, i was. Lately I seem to be going crazy, screaming at my kids, ( one of them was born from rape), stopped eating, stopped caring, always cranky, stopped doing stuff, and always creating problems out of nowhere with my partner, now he´s at his wits end with me and I feel like shit all the time, I feel suicidal, insomnia has kicked in, i just want to throw myself into oblivion, it feels like such a relief.I know this must sound so ridiculous to all of you, like it doesn´t even sound like it´s harsh or like I´m really struggling, lots of people sure are way worse than me, I´m just whining or something like that.It´s just i really want to die.

I currently work full time at a car wash trying to leave where I’m at right now. I have a amazing girlfriend who is the only person I care about at this moment. I have never been open about being depressed and have never told a doctor instead I have used every avenue I tried Kratom which helped but didn’t give me the “high” I was chasing I never really thought I had a problem till now because I never was hooked on illegal drugs at all. After kratom I doubt anyone know what this is my I tried something called phenibute it similar to something called gabapentin but like a dirtier medication it’s give you a huge euphoria that last almost all day but tolerance builds super fast which leads to having to take a huge amount. Well I learned the hard way and got hooked on it my tolerance did build and the withdrawal was awful and I couldn’t do it I kept taking it. I also would take my adderal with it which would only heighten the euphoria I would overtake my adderal to get immense happiness which led to me now having none left and now feeling so helpless and guilty. My girlfriend learned about my phenibute problem and told me if I didn’t quit she would leave me and I lied because I tried and couldn’t do that the withdrawal. Now someone anonymously sent her a message telling her I’m a addict and that she should leave me because I’m lying to her I have no idea who would know but I’m scared to death and have no idea what to do.

I grew up in a semi chaotic household but never considered it might be considered trauma before some of my own education made me curious.

Basically I grew up in a household where my parents were almost constantly yelling at each other. My mom would scream at my dad and call him names and so would my dad. It very rarely escalated to physical violence where on a few occasions they would grab at each other or chase each other up the stairs. There were quite a few instances where objects were damaged as my parents became angry (a fridge breaking from being slammed, stuff like that). There was never physical violence towards me outside being slapped or grabbed a few times when I fucked up badly in my teens. Sometimes my parents would yell at me as well, particularly my mother. She would sometimes belittle me about mistakes I made and at times call me names. I;d often be screamed at. MY sister and I would hide in our rooms and let them scream it out. Beyond that I was very well cared for as a child and spoiled with material things.

My parents divorced when I was 13 so I wasn't exposed too long to this.

I supported him as well as I could I also told him neither of those were his fault. He has also been dealing with some financial difficulties since he got divorced over a 1yr ago. He’s on a ton of medication that are dosed pretty high. He has told me before that he hates the job he’s at (restaurant server) because he works nights and his boss won’t let him work in the AM he’s been there for 5yrs. He just got a second job so he could help pay debt. 

And last night he was just so done with everything he left work in the beginning of his shift turned his phone and left without letting anyone know. The day before he was telling me that he was cutting again and wanted to 51/50 himself or he might do something. I spoke to him and asked what he thought would be best (meaning 51/50 or talking it through with his therapist in the AM) and he told me he wanted the talk to his therapist. So the next day when he disappeared from work we (his family and I) their the worst. And 5 hours after he had shut off his phone we saw he had driven 80 miles away. When he turned his phone off he went to a store and bought a knife and thought about hurting himself. 

When we spoke when he came back and I asked him why he did it he told me that he was numb. He was also saying that he wished that he was normal and didn’t have to take so many medications just to feel nothing. I don’t know how to help him I support him when he needs it and I’m always going to be there when he needs me. He never asked for help I have to pry it out of him.

I really want to message my friends again, and see them again. But I have no clue how to approach this since they haven't heard from me in months. I know they're all pretty worried, and that it won't be how it was before.

I will start with a little life story. I used to think my childhood was good. Slightly turbulent at times but I had an amazing mom with whom I had great relationship and we could talk about anythink. Well... over past few years I have realized this was just me not realizing how bad it was and thinking everybody had to deal with something similar. With the pink filter off I can say it was trauma packed on trauma with a cherry trauma on top. My father was an abusive asshole with anger issues and probably some narcissistic traits. He would be super nice on a normal day and especially when outsiders were present, but once he got angry dishes were flying and no language filter was applied. I remember once playing badminton with my sister, I sucked and it ticked me of and I threw the racket on the ground. It being made of wood broke. I hid it in garage and pretended like it never happened. When my father wanted to play with my sister and found out he stormed inside and threw it at me with full strength. It barely missed my head and smashed itself on the wall. I ran out and don't remember much after. I know my mom was in the room with me and they argued. Well my mom has married him because she got pregnant with my sister (half sister), not because she loved him. This life with him took huge toll on her, I haven't realized until I was at high school. She hated him, but couldn't leave him because he was making money and she only had highschool diploma and couldnt find a job and support two children on her own. She had high functioning depressesion, abused alcohol and sleeping pills and had three suicide attempts. On her sober day she was the best mom, but on weekends she would drink and drink and then in the evening she would take ambien and fall asleep on the counter trying to make midnight snack. Her first attempt was when I was 8. Father was at work and me and my sister were doing homework. She was drinking and at some point she walked out of kitchen and fell unconcious. We didn't know what to do so all I could do was use toilet paper to clean the blood of her arms (she broke a tea karafe) and wait till dad came home. I later found out from her that she took a lot of sleeping pills and tried to cut her wrists. This is only a tiny bit of the events I went through, which lead me to move to a different country. My mom drowned in our jacuzzi in 2020 after a day of drinking (we don't know if pills were taken) and I was the one to give her cpr. 6 months later my dad argued with my sister and changed locks after she decided to spend christmas at her friends. 

Moving to todays time, my sister lives alone and has a stable job. I don't talk to father. I lost my job when corona came and I haven't managed to land a new one till now. I have been seing a therapist in 2021 after the change of locks event and it helped a lot. I thought I was fine until fall last year. I am depressed and suicidal. I managed to get myself into outpatient psychiatric treatment, but its going very slow. I saw a psychiatrist once in december and got pills, but the haven't been working so I called in january to book an appointment with a psychiatrist, but it got moved from february to march to now mid may. I see a therapist there too, but we are still in the early getting to know the story stage since she can only see me once month for 45min. I can't afford payed therapist right now. 

I really struggle with identity and reason for living. It feels like I spent my life trying to get a good job abroad to help mom finacially, then to help my sister, but now that everything is fine I realized I have no idea about what I like and value. No interests from past seem any fun no, I have no clue what kind of job I would like, or even what are my values. All I know is that I feel the same way I imagine an 80 lady to feel on her death bed. Contempt with her life, no regrets and ready to move on.  I'm not sad I just don't have anything that would spark any will to live. I've been trying to not hurt myself because I don't want to hurt my boufriend and sister, but that just feels like I am being forced to suffer. 

My emotions are also weird. When I talk about my past I feel fine, even though I think I should cry. But then I see Tamy being aproved for surgery and feel the urge to cry from happiness. My days are just bleak and boring from waking up I just 'am' till I eat and sleep. I keep going back to toughts of wanting to die, how hard it is to die without pain and uncertainty and so on. I always reject it with an image of my bf finding me like that, but the thought are so overwhelming and tiring. I am just tired, numb and dead inside. 

Is there anyone who has been or is going through anything similar? I would really love if I could get my hands on anything that could help me overcome this state. Books, articles, whatever, even if it's just a diagnosis name. I am seeking a professional help to the extent I can afford. I will list few books I've read that didn't save me.

Is it something that can be bought with money or achieved by having a certain lifestyle? Happiness isn’t one size fits all; instead, it’s an ever-evolving concept. We’re here to explore the different aspects of happiness and how we can make the most out of our lives.

Happiness has often been defined as “a state of well-being and contentment”, however, this definition does not always suffice when trying to understand its deeper meaning. The idea of true joy goes beyond fleeting moments of pleasure – it requires us to look inwardly at ourselves and identify where we need improvement. By cultivating feelings such as self-love, gratitude, compassion, purposeful living, and mindfulness, we can begin to find balance within ourselves and lead happier lives.

It takes time and effort to achieve lasting happiness, but there are ways to get started on your journey today! In this article, you’ll learn about some practical tips for creating more joy in your life so that you can live each day to its fullest potential. So let’s dive in and start exploring the world of happiness together!

370,I need help,1,11j78bp,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/11j78bp/i_need_help/,1,"Hi Reddit, 
I’m turning here for help because at this point I’ve talked to friends and my therapist about it, and while there words are comforting in the moment, I can’t let this situation go. Four years, I had just returned back to my old high school after doing a year of boarding school. Truth be told I wasn’t in a good mindset; it had been hard living at home the previous year because of the frequent and intense arguments between me and my parents, and I was apprehensive about returning and living in that environment. I also was feeling very uncertain about my future at the time and doubting my ability as a student to finish high school, and I felt subpar to my peers academically. 
At my old high school the year started with this all school camping trip which lasted a few days, and it was no exception when I came back. Anyways there was a girl who started dropping clear hints that she liked me and I decided to go with it because she was smart and pretty, and flirting and being around her made me, and at that point I just wanted to be happy. 
Anyways, we hung out a few times after that walking downtown and talking. I quickly worked up the courage to ask her to a movie but we decided just to watch one at my house since the one we wanted to see in theaters was sold out.  
So she came after school one day, and we started watching this movie and it started out so good. We were cuddling together and then we had our first kiss, my first kiss and it was wonderful. We cuddled more and kissed again, and I kissed her forehead and cheeks and she did the same. It was going so perfectly. 
After a little bit more time watching the movie, I asked if she was hungry and she said she was so we went upstairs (we were in the basement) and melted some shredded cheese on nachos. After we had finished eating, we repositioned ourselves so she was lying on top of me, and we started making out more. At a certain point she slipped her tongue into her mouth, just once, and I took that as a sign to escalate things which was a huge mistake. No clothes came off and I never grabbed underneath her clothes, but I did grab her ass and I was French kissing her to aggressively. I should have asked if what I was doing was ok, if she was okay with it but I didn’t. After a couple seconds she pulled away, checked her phone, and said he had to leave soon but she did lay back on my chest and for the rest of the time we just watched the movie and cuddled. 
After that, I kept texting seeing if she was free but she never was, always saying she was busy. This was the first inclination I got that I fucked up, but I was so oblivious to what I did it didn’t register I fucked up at first. We didn’t share classes at school but she stopped talking to me in person, and my texts to hang were always met with an excuse not to meet up. 
For some reason, I asked her out after this, a true sign of how thick skulled I was. Mabye I thought it would make things better? Honestly couldn’t tell you my logic, I don’t know what I was thinking. Anyways that was right before the schools two week vacation for winter 2019. Over break I get a text saying she doesn’t want anything romantic or anything more which is when I knew for sure I had fucked up. 
Two weeks later she started dating one my best friends, which cut me deep. I have a vivid memory of them leaving campus together in his car, which I looked on. I never said anything to either them about it though. It was their relationship and they could both do what they wanted, but every-time I saw them together I could only think that it could have been me with her. 
Anyways a year passes and we finally talk about what happened after I contacted her and asked to talk. She said herself we could move past it but I just can’t. I probably just like the idea of us together and not her herself, the saddest part is I do barley know her, but I just over how it ended between us. I just wish we had a normal relationship, and broke up normally, it would have been so much easier to move on. But I can’t, and it’s been four years at this point and I feel pathetic about it all. I feel like I’ve wasted the last four years of my life, drinking and smoking to numb myself to the emotions I feel. I miss her so much, I just want to talk to her again and be friends but I know this isn’t a realistic goal. I wish I could just move on with my life, because I feel like she did  move on, the day I fucked up our whole relationship",1678041709.0

374,deciding to go the school counsellor for support. I don't want my parents to know anything about it. should I be careful about what I say? would really REALLY appreciate advice. [NSFW,2,11isv4p,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/11isv4p/deciding_to_go_the_school_counsellor_for_support/,9,"tw. Self harm, suicide(al thoughts)

I have posted this in another subreddit but got no response. I'm really separate because I have sent my schoo counsellor a message already. I don't think she has seen it yet so I have time to delete it, but I don't know if I should, but If I should, I should do it really soon.

In summary, I am a socially anxious student who thinks everyone hates me (this can go on and off at times, dependent on whoever) and I self harm from time to time because I hate myself a lot. I am not diagnosed with anything because I have never told anyone about how I feel. I am scared they will think I am an attention seeker, they won't care, they will hate me, they will give up on me, or think I deserve it.

I have decided to go to my school counsellor because I feel like I feel a need to explain why I act the way I act ; sometimes I feel like people think I don't put any effort in trying socialize or come to class on time, or not do my school work on time, when really I am anxious and scared of people, so I have to take breaks in between, or I sort of 'shut down'. Probably not the right reason, but i do feel this will take some weight of me and help me feel less stressed around people, knowing that people know that I AM trying my best (mostly speaking about teachers here. And my anxiety is definitely affecting my education. I also feel a need to make my teachers like me because my parents don't.

I feel like I sound so selfish and narcissistic for saying that...

Anyhow, I know that I cannot talk to her about my suicidal thoughts (to be clear, I have never tried to kill myself and I know I can't because of my parents, I just LOVE thinking about it, though I plan on killing myself in the future when both my parents aren't alive anymore, and if I'm unsuccessful in life) and that I self harm, because she will have to tell my parents by law.

Are there any other topics I should avoid talking about?
I really don't want her telling my parents. This genuinely GENUINLY will make my self harm issue worse, and no one will know about it.
Should I just avoid speaking to her altogether??

Should I mention to her that I hate myself or should I leave it  out? Would she tell my parents?
I plan on just telling her I think other people don't like me very much / hate me / hate even just my presence
 This will be the focus of the conversation.
I'm worried she will assume it is because I hate myself
Will she assume that?


Before you say that telling my parents is a good idea, it is not. HONESTLY. Nothing you say will convince me so please don't waste your energy typing anything to do with it down, or asking questions why. This is the first time I am asking for help, I need this to go correct.

I am planning to make a script before I talk to her because I find it hard to describe how I am feeling and I don't want to slip up anything I shouldn't.

I would really appreciate advice on what to say. Thank you <3",1678008542.0

Once when I was 13 she attempted suicide in front of me and drank phenyl. She fainted immediately. I was alone in the house with her and rushed to call me elder cousin (neighbour) and we managed to make her vomit it out in time. This shocked me pretty bad. I rarely used to cry but after that moment I burst out crying. But I told myself to get over it. He did not quit drinking until I was 15 I guess. He often told me after getting drunk that I don't love him, i don't care for him, I've changed while crying which used to break my heart as I shared a very close bond with my father.

I can’t see or find my “redeemable qualities”, so if I am not reaching the ambitions I set at my 10 years of age, I am failing myself, my mom, and wasting my potential. On the same note, once my mom finds out that I am gay, she will hate me even more. Because I don’t feel like I have redeemable qualities and everyone eventually leaves, if the one person that is supposed to love me unconditionally (my mom) no longer does, I won’t see the point in living. So I feel like my anxiety is trying to keep me on my toes, trying to make me be hyper aware of every flaw, hoping that I fix them so that I can find some way to be lovable because then I wouldn’t feel like my life will be over if I don't achieve my goals and then I will be able to rest. It is paradoxical though because it is that same anxiety that prevents me from being able to succeed in the way I’d need to reach my ambition anyways.

My question to you is to find out if you'd be interested in knowing what it is like to be a patient in a mental health ""care"" facility?

I'm not a behavioral issue patient; I am not a sociopath nor do I have any type of drug/alcohol addiction, and I have no criminal history.

I've just had a pretty rough life and am incredibly tired of trying to fake fine for others' benefits, which is why I ended up being a patient.
I have never harmed anyone but myself.

I've worked in healthcare in the past for many years with Developmentally Disabled patients as well as recently self diagnosing with autism and am quite familiar w how patients should be treated. It seems dignity and respect SHOULD be universal, especially when that is part of the job description, especially with patients whose only wish is for the hurting to be over.

Now, as I just left one of the psychiatric facilities in this particular state for wanting to ""not exist"", I am able to give personal perspective as a patient  as well as a prior healthcare provider which shows I know the general job description, and I can tell you that I did not leave any better than I went in. 
My lack of love for life, as well as a lack of hope for humanity, was only further proven by my stay in regard to many of the staff. I just did not want my death to end up being surrounded by the staff whose job was supposed to help me change my perspective rather than bully, intimidate, antagonize, gaslight and treat me and others as if we were a problem during things we struggled with when we were there to be helped while recieving treatment.

I do not begrudge the staff. Not all of them were awful, but more than half were and the ones who were, well, they were backed up by their peers on the same shifts. Many had patients they ""liked"" because they were not as much ""trouble"" for them as others, and it showed.  Admittedly, I questioned everything and knew my basic human rights so as I was struggling with my own personal hell, there were things I simply was not mentally able or willing to do which made staff angry and they made sure I knew it. (Attending an activity when I felt I needed to be away from others was breaking a rule that I was made aware they would ""tell the doctor about"" as a threat as well as not being ""allowed"" to watch tv if I didn't do as I was told.)
It was also met w a poor attitude when I didn't feel comfortable signing certain paperwork.
(Examples: I was asked to sign paperwork that said they were not responsible for any of my items that they held being lost or stolen and I would not sign it because those items were in their possession,  not mine so they should be accountable if the items were lost or stolen, and before I was released, I was given the paperwork to sign stating I recieved my property back before it was even within my eyesight to which I was met with eye rolling as if that was a problem. These were a lot of the types of issues where I was considered a troublemaker because I questioned everything when I didn't understand why I was being told to do something I did not want to do which made me a ""problem"" in the facility. I'm in my 50s, not a child. )
(The doctor I spoke with during my stay was kind, listened, and appeared to understand that I wasn't trying to be difficult so when I felt unable to participate, he told me he was not making it mandatory, which I appreciated. He did seem to be trying to help. I'm just sorry I wasn't able to tell him before I left that I really still feel like life is not the same for me as it is for him and that I had to say I was ok to be able to leave. I didn't like that. It felt dishonest toward someone who was trying to help, but he wasn't a patient there and most likely never will be.)

Some even stated they were not there for the paycheck because it wasn't worth it & they were there because they cared, yet their words and actions were clearly opposite.

No, I was not physically harmed in any way, so you're aware, but I was there for mental health help and was treated in such a way by several staff that I ended up with such a high blood pressure from the stress they had to incorporate a blood pressure medication in my system the day I was leaving and that should not have happened.(I do not typically have any issues with my BP unless something else is wrong, physically.) I could have had a stroke had they not just happened to be taking vitals that morning. If that'd happened,  I'm certain their story for why it happened would have been much different than mine.

I don't need their help. I was not there willingly. I could not care any less for myself, but I do care for others there, despite my use of the word ""I.""

I have been incredibly successful at masking my true feelings in front of others as it has been practiced & mastered since birth, which is how I ended up being released.

In all honesty, once I gathered up enough strength to be able to stop crying the first couple of days w the assistance of anxiety medication prescribed, I was able to put that same mask back on to get out of there. (Masking can be exhausting, and eventually,  anyone who masks will lose their mask at some point, regardless of how briefly).

Not everyone has that skill, but it's served its purpose for me throughout my life.

I got out, but I left angry for others who might not have the ability to access the same part of their brain as I do.

Also, I am not quite as articulate in speaking as I am when I type these words. My brain is not wired for public speaking with confidence.
I am, however, able to communicate this way.


I had to ""fake fine"" to get out of there, and I absolutely WILL NOT go back...as a patient, ever again. I still feel as lost as I did before I went in with the exception of a little perspective and a specific purpose driven mindset because of how I was treated.

The only things that were accomplished by my stay at that facility was to try to get proper help for the people in there, especially those who are NOT behavioral & make sure I am more successful at not ending up there again. I know what it is I am confessing, and I don't say it lightly.
At this time, I have no plans to take my life despite not wanting it, but if the time comes where praying for it to be over isn't enough, I will no longer tell anyone how I am feeling if there is any chance of going back to any mental health facility again.

This is not just one hospital that is allowed to treat people without dignity or respect.
This is a much larger issue as these staff are incredibly ""comfortable"" in their positions with the ""accommodations"" of their peers backing them up in the treatment of patients I only slightly described above.

They are not held accountable and desperately need more training and degrees on how to treat individual patients.

I don't know how else to make this happen aside from reaching out to people by writing this in the hope that perhaps you have had or currently have a loved one who suffers from depression or longs to not exist anymore.

We are NOT attention seeking. We are hurting and although we don't wish to hurt anyone else, the fact remains that when we do try to get better,  please believe it is ALWAYS for someone else's benefit, not our own!
We are guilted into existence because society has labeled us in so many negative and derogatory ways. 
Regardless of all the varying opinions of people who ""want out"" of this life experience, we are not selfish. I am not selfish. 
Anyone who doesn't struggle with this can not understand how exhausting it is to keep trying to be what is expected of us. To pretend we are fine and only sometimes show our vulnerability by trusting someone with these thoughts and feelings only to be met with ALL the ways we are either wrong for feeling this way, selfish for wanting the pain to end because ""someone else"" needs us here to continue pretending to be ok for their sake so they don't suffer while we just keep feeling dead inside already.
People with well-meaning advice on things we SHOULD be doing only make us feel lower when we are already feeling shackled, chained, and buried.

I, personally,  despise that I am this way. My living makes people I care about suffer. They think I'm fun and funny and all sorts of other things, but they never realize that it has always been an act... a mask for ""them"" to be ok, not me.
I don't want others to hurt this way, and maybe they can be helped in a way I can't, but it will not be in mental health care facilities as they are.

I did not write all the ways people with depression are disciplined in this letter. The point is that depression should not be disciplined AT ALL. 
Punishing people for not wanting to participate in life does not make them suddenly want to live, nor should they be put in a facility with other patients where certain rules and discipline are required. 
If this is where people like me are sent for help, staff needs to be better educated and trained to deal with this type of mental health so they are taught to be more sensitive and caring toward us as well as treat us with dignity and respect without telling us we will treat them that way first or we won't receive it from them because if we were getting those things in our lives from anyone else, we might not have the issues we have that put us in their ""care"".

I can clearly tell the difference between the internet while I was studying in college and the internet now. 

I feel like I am being forced into living a life that I have no interest in being part of.

Did someone intervene in what should have been nature and the end of my life just as it started? Is how I feel and how I have to live daily a repercussion from mother nature for the interference?

A 21 year-old F right here  :) I just need to get some things off my chest. I don't usually post anything, but now I reached a point in which I don't know what to do anymore, and so I need someone else's view on this. I am sorry in advance for my possibly broken English, this is not my mother tongue. And also thank you for taking the time to read this (It's gonna be a lenghty post). I will most likely delete this, because I already regret writing it.

Even though I've been in talk therapy (with an amazing clinical psychologist, I think we really get along well) for over an year, almost 2, I still struggle a lot, and lately everything has been very hard to cope with. At this point I'm just waiting for another day to pass and hope that I never wake up the next morning. I had some previous bad experiences with other therapists (I think one of these really traumatized me, bc since then I no longer trust my own mind and I no longer know if everything that I deal with is real or if i'm just a fraud, making it all up for God knows what reason). But the psychologist I am seeing at the present just feels right! Even though I've been feeling miserable for a very very long time (even prior to meeting this therapist), I've never been diagnosed before, I never reached for that kind of support because I kept finding excuses like ""It's just a phase"" or ""I'm making it up for attention"" or ""This is not so bad, I'm just exaggerating, I'm being too sensitive"" etc.

The point is, 2 weeks ago, at the very beginning of our session, my T told me she wants me to go for a psychiatric evaluation/assesment, as she thinks my condition has been getting worse and she also propossed an increase of therapy sessions (2 per week) for additional support. She said she thinks medication (which she thinks will be a temporary solution) would help me. She also assured me that meds would help soothe the symptoms and help me go through them easier and that she thinks we cannot progress with the therapy in my current state. This came to me as a shock, after all this time of telling myself I do not even deserve help... 

After a week of overthinking, I decided I want to trust her judgement and give this a try (even though I felt and still feel very confused, bc I suddenly feel like I'm just a fake and I waste their time and I don't nees help and I'm just a crybaby and seek attention). These intrusive thoughts made me rethink over and over and over again my decision (for a whole week I felt extremely nauseous, anxioous, tense, I had tremors and all sorts of psysical symptoms, so basically the usual stuff I go trough just got emphasized) but eventually I decided to book an appointment for the psychiatrist she reffered me to, because I wanted to find out if there is truly something wrong with me. 
My ""symptoms"" are: feeling sad/gloomy/empty, feeling insecure, worthless, hopeless, confusion, brain fog (or feeling like I can't think at all), I can no longer enjoy doing anything, mixed insomnia, self-harm tendencies, suicidal ideation (but now i'm not even sure if my thoughts count), intrusive thoughts, anxiety (tremors, sore muscles, random pains, random muscles twitching, eye twiching, back pain, stomach ache, restlessness, inability to relax, headaches/some kind of diffused or vague pressure on my head), I am not eating, having a very hard time to get out of bed, having no energy, being always tired, tendency to self isolate, dissociation, trouble focusing and keeping up with uni, irritability, sensitivity to sounds, lights that overwhelm me, self-hatred... I don't even know anymore. I don't even remember more than half of my life, only some quite bad/disturbing memories, some random, out of context (cause I can't really place them in time exactly, or order them) moments, mostly about my confusing experience of living with a bipolar parent and coping with my parents' divorce and its aftermath, also being bullied at school... I feel I was always in the role of the parent, as I had to take care of my mom and always be hypervigilant around my parents. I feel like a burden to everyone, especially to my dad, whom I currently live with. There would be a lot more on my mind and a lot more ""problems"" (again, maybe I just made up everything and I'm just lazy and I seek arguments so i can stay in bed al day and stare at the ceiling).  Some of these ""problems"" I listed I've been experiencing since childhood, at varying levels of intensity depending on the time periods... but they all really got worse since I graduated from highschool.

Anyway, I went to my psychiatric appointment and got diagnosed with mixed anxiety-depression disorder or MADD (which in my case has a stronger tendency towards depression), and also the psychiatrist told me I have a ""personality disorder"", but she didn't really point to a specific one. She prescribed me 20mg a day of Prozac, which I'm supposed to take for aprox. an year, and Bromazepam (only for two weeks, 1/2 in the morning and evening).
She told me I will probably need a long term treatment in therapy and that the meds will only help manage symptoms.
She explained my ""personality disorder"" is due to genetics (my mom is bipolar and my dad has been diagnosed with MDD) and due to my traumatic past (even though I didn't speak too much about this, only like a sentence or two), but she said it can be cured.

The problem is that I feel kinda invalidated?? It feels wrong and I am so frustrated and I don't know if it's all in my head or if it's just the shock of going to an evaluation for the first time. I don't even know how to explain what I feel. But I am extremely confused. I feel I don't need nor want any help and I am suddenly perfectly fine and nothing was ever wrong with me.  
From what I could understand form my searches on the internet, MADD doesn't even count as a proper diagnosis and is not in the DSM :) And i feel even more confused because of this ""personality disorder"" I don't even know the name of, if it really has a name.

Now I feel like she gave me this diagnosis just because :) it's astounding how easily you can get labeled in just 50 minutes... I think my frustration centers around the fact that there's not much info about this ""disorder"" and something just feels off. And i'm confused about that ""personality disorder"" thing as well.

During the appointment I couldn't even explain my symptoms ( I only mentioned the insomnia, the eating problem and she asked me about self-harm, which i admitted to doing, and sucidal thought, which she didn't cound as valid, it seems). I was so anxious and so absent-minded when sitting and talking to her that my whole body kept trembling and I couldn't really feel present or focused on what she was telling me. I felt like I couldn't think and i could't express myself at all.
I should've come more prepared... because I got so confused I couldn't even process the questions and I couldn't focus on giving her an answer. (Note: in previous therapy sessions I found out that one of my coping mechanisms is talking about random, unimportant stuff instead of bringing up what's truly bothering me, so basically I unconsciously avoid  to talk about heavy things). I couldn't open up and I couldn't concentrate. Now I feel sooo confused because i don't know if everything is just a stupid made-up problem or if my feelings are valid. I no longer know what is real and what is not. 

Also, I do not think my psychologist gave her any of her notes from our sessions, I do not think they really spoke about my circumstances prior to me going to the appointment. At least this is what I understood from what the psychiatrist said.

What can I do now? Do I ask my therapist to speak with the psychiatrist and show her the notes/the records? Can I tell my psychiatrist what I felt in regards to our first appointment? How can i fix this??? 
Maybe I am just a crybaby who exaggerates all this because i can't accept this vague diagnostic? I do not know anymore.

Please help me... I just feel the urge to hurt myself more.

Thank you for staying with me ;-; and sorry for being such a brat.",1677875468.0

It doesn't help that I'm also  extremely self-conscious of my appearance.

I know I'm not dumb and have the capacity to do well but I never study for exams and I'm stressed.

The problem is, whenever I sit down to study, I can't focus, or I'm too tired, or my brain feels like its going to explode from trying to understand the simplest of concepts. Recently I've come of the opinion that 'nothing matters'. In a way this has helped my body dysmorphia a bit and I am able to go outside slightly more than I used to, but I'm throwing my future away because I don't see why going to school matters. I just want to do nothing all day.

I think this is some type existential crisis or extreme dissociation because I literally can't comprehend the world around me or myself existing at all. When I talk to other people I don't even believe they are real. I don't get how everyone seems so ambitious to achieve something, what's the point if we are all going to die?

My questions: (I'm currently waiting for professional help so this is mainly asking for self-help advice)
1. How do I start caring about things?
2. How can I be consistent in what I do without giving up?
3. How to overcome the extreme lack of energy?

And I feel like I'm in school by the way they react when I haven't done it the way they would like. 

I also find it hard to do it with a full-time job, a wife, and a son that needs looking after. 
I suffer from anxiety and depression and also struggle with making conversation, which is why I thought I'd try CBT again, but I am honestly not sure if it's working. 

People may laugh, but I am getting anxious about doing this homework. If I had known what was expected of me, I wouldn't have started; I thought it was just the meetings. 
I feel like quitting, but before I do, I would like to know if anyone else has had any success with CBT.

I've been on so many anti depressents and anxiety medications, I think ADHD has a huge factor as well because besides pain the main reason I wanna kms is because I'm chronically, perpetually bored. Life is so extremely mundane.

Everytime I talk to a therapist they just tell me ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" or ""it gets better"" but no matter what I cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel, unless I'm extremely high on marijuana.

It's more or less, that I smoke when I'm seriously about to end my life. (About 1-2 times daily spread hours apart) yes it's that bad. And without it I think I would have ended my life years ago.

I'm 19, I live in small town minnesota, with no support system, family, good friends, or good healthcare which equals and promotes extrems chronic depression, and anxiety. 

Please Help me. I cannot possibly imagine not being suicidal, as it's all I've ever known as a teen.

I have no doubt in my mind, that I will be financially set and successful. But that doesn't matter. I don't care about the money, I just don't wanna be here. Everything is boring, and despite my health issues, I love myself.

That's the weirdest part.. I love myself to the core. Took a lot of break ups, suffering, and trauma. but I do in fact love myself. I constantly ask myself ""why do I have to waste a perfectly good soul"" 

Although I often times feel like a burden for complaining about my health issues that are severe and make me severely depressed. I don't really feel like a burden or a pretty successful person with a lot of skills that I can apply to make a lot of money. But it just doesn't matter. No girl or no amount of money as yet to succumb to this depression & anxiety. I don't wanna be here.

441,falling back into depression,1,11g8wh4,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/11g8wh4/falling_back_into_depression/,5,"I got into a diagnosed major depression in 2017. It was something that had been brewing for a few months.
Lots of therapy and antidepressants later I had a click and stopped feeling as shitty as before.
Just numb, I guess, but I no longer felt as if I wanted to kill myself every day. Not well, but definitely not as bad anymore.

Jump forward to October 2022. A friend of mine introduced me to a friend of hers, via video call.
I have no idea what happened, it just struck both of us. We clicked immediately. She had a thick mask, hiding a lot of family issues, cheating father, cheating ex, abusing ex, etc etc. She had left her country and was living and working abroad, by herself.
We started talking and I told her, I could see her mask. She felt disarmed, and I told her I could even tell when she was resetting it. The ticks. But I did it showing I was curious about her, not menacing, wanting to help and to offer myself as a friend.


 Things moved on, we were talking almost every day, with lots of looks, etc. I visited my friend and her twice. We got along really well. She had said multiple times she runs away when she feels cornered or stressed. She also said as many times ""don't give up on me"". I respected her as much as I could, literally not touching her until she would touch me.
She told me about her exes. Her father. Her trust issues. She sometimes drank to numb the pain. Lots of small rituals to feel better. Sometimes had sex with a perfect stranger never to see him again. No kiss, no feeling.

We got closer. We held hands. We spent the night sleeping side by side. We share secrets. Eventually, she kissed me. Everything from her own initiative . She said I was a unicorn, someone who respected her immensely, who wanted her, who loved her despite her issues, who wanted her as she is. I told her the same. She said ""I love you"" for the first time to me, in her sleep.

I invited her over to my country for a couple of weeks for Christmas and New year. She accepted, came over. She was so happy. Loved my family, loved the environment, loved being with me. We visited places, hung out, spent entire days just sitting or lying next to each other. Talking.
We started saying ""I love you"" to one another, as if it was a relief. Finally saying it. It was so natural.
Step after step it went, perfectly. She started getting closer and closer, feeling free, feeling comfortable. Trying new levels of intimacy, on her own initiative, always. She said she felt dirty for the way she had been before, with men. Didn't once crave any of her old habits like drinking.
We planned things in the clouds, not taking things too seriously. She said for the first time in her life, she felt home. Welcome. Loved. She started reconsidering her life choices. Men, her choice of country to move in ( we both hated it ), everything. Started considering taking a chance, moving to my country. Maybe with me. I offered her every choice. I'd support her if she wanted to move, until she found her own place. Or welcome her, if she decided to move in with me.
We were both SO happy.
At the end of those weeks, she went back with tears in her eyes.
We called almost daily, always texting, either romantic, sexual or friendly. 

Her job schedule got more intense. She started texting a lot less. I was having problems on my side, so was really stressed. I felt insecure and craved reassurance. I guess I pressed her. Until one day she just said she wouldn't move. That her current country may not be nice, but it's what she has. That she may not be as happy but that's life. That what we had felt like a relationship and that she had loved it. That she missed sex but would never do it on my back, so we should get a distance from one another.

My heart broke. Imagining her submitting herself like that to another man, no love, just...
I just want to tear my skin off, out of pain, dirtiness and disgust. I miss her so much. I can no longer sleep. The image of her body lying there with someone else desecrating it.. the discarding of so much love, complicity, closeness.. just to struggle to make ends meet, drink, stay in a country she doesn't like.

I just miss her. So much. Us together were so much more than the sum of us. She made me so happy.
I don't know what to do.
Please help me. Please. The pain is burning so much.",1677779072.0

I don't feel that way. And PLEASE. Don't comment ""It's all temporary"" , ""It'll get better"" or anything else like that. DON'T comment anything about God or religion. I'm sick of hearing all of that. Sick of hearing everything I get told on a daily basis. I don't want comfort about ""It'll get better"" because everytime I believe that, It just gets worse. ""Fake it til you make it"" I've been faking since like 2015-2016. Don't you DARE come after me telling me it's temporary. If it truely was, Why hasn't it gone away? Therapy doesn't help. My emotions are leaving. My sadness. Can't cry much anymore. It's all numb unless I have mental breakdowns or somebody manages to crack the numbness slightly. 

I can't anymore. I'm the problem. Just let me explain this right now. I've started becoming more closed-off again. And causing problems to my bf. Making his situations worse because of this. Twisting words without meaning too. Making him have worse thoughts. Making it worse for him.. And I don't have know how. When I'm sad, It makes him sad. So I pretend. My bestest friend seems to be a bit more distant with me. I feel I may be pushing him away. I want to cry but I can't. I want to scream so much and breakdown in tears. Everytime I feel like I'm going to cry, the feeling goes away..no tears get made. Just goes away and that's even IF I feel like I'm going to cry. All the time except once in the blue moon, I'm numbed. Happiness is no problem but some of that is going away too. People see me as some happy person but I'm a problem. I'm a monster that's creating problems, and making problems for those surrounding me worse. And I just can't anymore.

I don't want to die. I don't want to live. I want to be relieved. I want to be free. To be happy. To cry truely. To not ruin other people's lives. It's frustrating. See. I'm a teenager. And my parents are also a cause to these horrid feelings. Yelling at me for my poor hygiene because there's no energy. Finding anything to have a purpose to yell. While my father doesn't try to back me up. Doesn't try. My mother uses my friends as pawns. So I don't talk to her about anyone I hang out with. Or talk about what I feel because there's been times she's threatened to put me into a mental hospital if I didn't tell her trauma that I STILL am not ready to discuss. 

I have severe trust issues. There's only a few people I trust. But being anonymous like this. That's fine to me. I don't like to be abandoned (abandonment issues)..this happened alot by my friends. Fights. Yelling. I miss when I wasn't aware of the hellhole I'm forced to call home..forced to be at and not live like a real teenager. I want to leave. People say I'll regret wanting to be older. But I won't..because I have rarely any happy times at home. I can't wait to be older. To be an adult. And cut off all contact with this horrible place with these people who are supposedly my ""family.""....",1677771570.0

My family is pretty toxic and its really effecting my mental health quite a lot and I’ve basically just had enough and want my own place. Here’s the problem. I don’t earn that much, and house sharing is a thought but I was hoping for alternatives. I’m on a £10.25 an hour. Since working there I’ve had around 4 little pay rises so it could increase still. I’m contracted to 16h per week but I work 28-38 ever since I started nearly 1.5 years ago which is great. My job is pretty fixed. We get on extremely well and it’s not the sort of job you really get fired from unless you do something horrifically bad. So I earn usually between £900 (on a bad month)- £1,200 (on a good month) but most commonly around £1100. I have £15,000 saved. I have no drivers licence nor a car but if I can find a local place near my work place I can hold off on the driving until I can afford it. I was looking at houses but I don’t wanna just dive into it. I wanna know what I’m getting into. Apart from the % of the house I’d have to deposit what other costs are there that I need to know? I know some charity shops where I can buy furniture second hand. Food expenses, water, gas, electricity, Wi-Fi, tv license. What else? What would this cost me a month for a singular (or perhaps 2 people). I’m a decent saver when I need to be. People tell me to contact the council but I’ll be on a waiting list for years. I would rent but I don’t really like strangers being in the same house as me. I just don’t know what to do. If I don’t get out of this house soon I’m honestly not sure what I would do. It’s driving me mad. My mental health is really bad for many reasons at the minute. I live in Nottinghamshire near Mansfield 🇬🇧 so it’s not the best area to live.

I border on obsessively wanting to please them so they'll stay with me to a point where if I think their tone is slightly different, I spiral into extreme thoughts along the likes of ""they hate me. they're gonna abandon me"". 

I treat them as this ideal thing that fills the lonely void I feel. And so when they grow distant, I end up hurting myself mentally and physically. Once it got so bad I was constantly contemplating suicide and mentally breaking down almost every other week. My brain was filled with nothing but them and how I could've changed things, when really I couldnt. Even if they hurt me, I still took the blame, that it was my fault they chose to leave. Because either I was never enough or I was too much.

I was left recently. Surprisingly I'm not taking it as bad as I use to. But instead of obsessive sadness, it's obsessive bitterness and regret. However, I just want to feel nothing. I just want to be able to accept people not wanting to associate with me without taking it so personal, like a stab in the chest. I don't want to feel responsible for people's happiness all the time.

I've never been in a relationship, but I'm really afraid how I'll be if I were in one. How would I react if they broke up with me but I was still in love with them? I'm so tired of hurting myself over people. I never put myself first. And when I try, I feel like an asshole. I have no backbone. I feel no real self worth.

Im really worried because he has implied several times that he wants to end it and that he might do it before his birthday because he wants to ""to save us the trouble of buying him presents"". We dont know how serious he is about it though or if it was just one moment. 

My parents really try to help him with everything but he barely responds to it and gets irritated that they even try. He wont take advice. He has basically given up and always uses his diagnoses as an excuse to not try anything (though I also understand that they do make it really hard for him to do things)

Two years ago almost i bought a house with my brother for him, my mom and I. I knew one day i would regret my decision but at the moment I was focused on escaping a place that I couldn't sleep. Sounds like it is nothing but legit the noises were just so loud all the time it never stopped. I felt i was going crazy. 


I am here. Sitting writing this because I don't really remember feeling like this is a while. I feel anxious to the point i want to rip my skin off. Everything and anything details me. I am constantly tired. I cry. I complain. I lash out... Sometimes lashing out is called for but legit I'm not this person. Some things are to blame on my situation and my poor effort on how to react. For example. Like i said, I'm in nursing school i work at this awful place and my relationships aren't good. I feel constantly drained and my dog is sick. He unfortunately got a cut in his eye that turned into an ulcer despite me quickly taking him to the doctor. 

His eye wasn't getting better and i had already taken him to the vet like 6 times. There was a point were i felt so useless. He also has gotten more fussy as he has been aging, he had become so loud with his barks to the point that my ears ring. I try to stop him by sitting him down and not rewarding his behavior but my mom doesn't and he just continues. Anyways, yeah i just started to feel very alone in taking care of him. I asked for help. I asked my brother if he could help me make an appointment to a specialist and take him. I currently don't have a lot of money but like contribute as much as I can. 

He said yes but he never did so my mom made the appointment and said my brother would take him. My brother has let me down so many times. So on the day of my dogs appointment my mom calls me and tells me that i need to talk to my brother to ask him to go or i need to go with him . I told her I asked for help because i was very busy with school and mentally drained. My mom was working at the time and i have normally been the person to do anything they told me. Legit even being there for my brother while he was drunk in a random person's apartment... Meanwhile... When i needed anyone, and needed help getting home because i wasn't in a safe environment was ignored. 

Anyways, i guess when i came home i started shaking and i knew it wasn't going to end well. My brother is the type of person to be there for his friends but not his family. Normally, sure like if your family isn't there for you like i get it. But i had always been there for him. I would defend him when he would be having panic attacks, help him through breakups after he would cheat, reassure him that he was a good person and not like our father. Turns out he is just like our father. Selfish, egotistical, liar. Anyways, yeah so i came home i was already not feeling good and i had a lot to study. I still do. So i texted him that i was thankful he would be taking our dog to the vet. He said he wasn't going to do it alone and that i needed to go. I told him I couldn't because i had a lot to do. He told me that it wouldn't take that long and he really thought i needed to go. 

I started to get very annoyed and i barged into his room and yelled at him telling him how much of a piece of shit he was for saying he would help and like not helping. Like why is he like that ? That i was asking for help because i need help! He told me i didn't need any help. He told me that next time he would say he wouldn't help me. That triggered me so much i lost it. I punched his door. 

He pushed me away and looked at me all scared
... I know i would never hurt anyone. W.e i let him leave with our dog and i just started freaking out. Like i was still so mad, ashamed, sad, confused... I wanted the hurt myself. As i usually have done. To not feel that emotional pain that i couldn't touch. To make that pain visible. Or i was going to jump out the window. Everyday, not wanting to be alive just gets stronger and stronger. 

Im scared to do it for sure... But idk sometimes you just get this weird courage and you can't look back. That happened to me once. I cut so deep i almost his an artery. I do kind of know the regret that sets in... The regret because you know you don't want anyone to find you, to clean up your mess, that maybe you will find someone that does care about you. 


Anyways, yeah so all that happened but it is just hard to come back from it. I'm losing myself. I'm feeling worthless. Legit my mom speak with Onders of him. That he does everything financially but what about me. Yes i can contribute a lot but i help pay the bills. Yes he pays the bulk for right now but i did too when he was in school, to buy this house, to get her and him things if they needed it. Does that not mean anything ? 

I have always said my family values money more than any emotional support. I think the more money you have the more valuable and the most relevant you are. 

I wanted to be a nurse to help people, to help people have hope, to bring myself out of this and give me a greater sense of purpose.

I just feel so useless in everything.

I feel absolutely pathetic. I am a young adult. I have worked so tirelessly through my life. I racked up so many student fees and debts to get a good education, and because of the way my government is and my workplace specialism, I can't actually get a job anymore because they pretty much don't exist. 

So I earn next to no money. I barely make ends meet. I end up overdrawn every month, and I try and try so hard to get a better job, and I can't. I have 3 university degrees. I shouldn't be living in debt. 

I cut out non-essential payments a while ago. Got rid of TV packages, etc. I already claim as many benefits as I can to 'close the gap' between my wage and what the government classes as enough money to live on. 

As well as this, my son has been diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes, Autism and Coeliac disease all in the space of two months, and he is going through so much stress. His lifestyle has become more expensive and of course the cost shouldn't be important but when I can barely afford to heat my house, it is important. 

My cat also passed away last week and as well as costing me almost £1000 (which is equal to a month's wage), and it has left a huge hole inside of me. I've had him for so long, and he has been my rock. I feel like I've lost part of myself. 

My boyfriend lives abroad, so I don't actually have a person here physically that I can talk to or seek support from. 

I just feel like like utter garbage. I feel absolutely useless. I can't give my son the life he deserves. I can't get the support from anyone when I need it, and I just feel like I don't know what to do. 

I am not entitled to any more financial help (again, my country has laws around benefits that make the poor people poorer). 

I just feel like so much of a disappointment. I worked so hard for years, so my life wouldn't have to be like this, and yet here we are. I kept telling myself it would pass, and I'd move onto bigger and better things, but actually, it's just getting worse as costs go up. 

I don't even know what I want out of saying this on here. I just need someone to understand because nobody seems to.",1677702968.0

Long story short, I have a friend who I've been friends with since we were 12 (I'm now a year out of college). For as long as I remember, we've relied heavily on each other for support, and there isn't a single thing about me that she doesn't know, and vice versa. Our relationship is the type where we ""trauma dump"" on each other multiple times a week with no filter and we basically are each other's therapists. I've done my best to listen, tell her that I'll always be here for her, not impose on issues that I don't personally relate to, but make sure that she knows that she's got me. But honestly, I'm worried that's not enough sometimes. Recently, I've hit a wall with how much support and help I feel I can offer her because there are issues that she brings up that I don't think I have the expertise to provide her solid advice on. I tend to take on others' issues as if they're my own, and I also feel myself building an emotional barrier, which I hate because I want to be there for her to my fullest capacity. We've always had pretty weak boundaries because we've assumed that the other can take on what we're about to tell them, but especially now, I don't think I have the expertise and capacity to help her in the way that a professional can.

We've been friends since we were kids and I can tell that her mental health has been severely declining, especially over the course of college and post-grad, and I don't know what to do. I'm worried because I also know that I'm the *only* one she talks to about these things. I don't want to lose a friend just because I didn't have the necessary skills to support her. I can tell that she's resistant to seeking professional help. I've had a therapist myself, and I was lucky to have had a good experience with it, so I know how much it could potentially help. With that being said, I completely understand that finding a therapist and speaking with a doctor is a decision that's very personal, so I don't want to force it. 

If anyone has any advice or insight, I'd greatly appreciate it.",1677689356.0

All I knew it was pure hell and my relatives' reaction often made things worse (ridicule, dismissal etc.) 

I'm from a poor country and healthcare here sucks, *especially* mental health which automatically equals  ""schizophrenic"", that's if you can't afford a private clinic, then it's kind of okay, still, there is no cure to life. 

This traumatic event plus being abused physically by parents at an early age obviously did not lead to great outcomes, I didn't do well in school, which again made my life worse and my prospects for the future terrible. It's difficult to explain what it's like and I'm sure others have been through worse but it's just impossible to convey to others what it's like. I'm no longer a teenager and I don't think I'm angsty neither do I hold a grudge against anyone. I used to believe in God but witnessing the cruelty, indifference and prayers not being heard made me lost a lot of it. I don't know where I want to say really, it's rare for others to be able to actually empathize with you because if you're not going through something your brain just can't imagine what it's like, all of us included, and empathy costs energy.

I just want to get better, I'm sick of struggling and being permanently scared of the future and trying to block the past from memory, not being food/finance-secure and of all the hoops that society puts you through in order to just have a normal life. It all just says ""you're not welcome and we don't give a f*** whether you're dead or alive"", it's the 21st century and human life is really worthless, like your needs essential needs are adhoc, despite being as a species extremely advanced and having achieved great milestones.

What do I do? I just need a little break from it all, I'm sick of putting on a happy face and taking the bullshit, I can't find a job despite having a degree, which means I can't look after myself and I can't get better but who cares? My existence is objectively irrelevant.

If I have the means I would help as many people as I can who have been in that dark hopeless place and prove that life isn't meaningless suffering, but I can't, so tough luck.

i used to be passively suicidal for about five years, and (obviously) i never had the courage to go through with it. but i always wished for autonomy over entering death - not in a grandiose or painful way, more like just pressing a button and having it all just end, just like that.

and while i don't consider myself to be suicidal anymore, my mind can't help but linger on the relief of not dealing with life while i was under anesthetic.

491,Ideas for small activities to help with depression?,3,11ddic4,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/11ddic4/ideas_for_small_activities_to_help_with_depression/,6,"Hi! I've been struggling with depression for ca 3 years now. I don't necessarily want to go into detail on it, but for now, I'm on the road to recovery. Depression has stolen all of my interests and passions, some of which I've reclaimed, but most of which sit in my room gathering dust. My biggest hobby is drawing, but as you can imagine, I don't have to do much to indulge in it. I graduated not long ago, so I don't have any major responsibilities to worry about at the moment. Because of this I mostly find myself sitting around my room doing nothing. This isn't exactly great for my recovery and I find myself stuck.

At the moment I am trying to create a list of activities to fill my days with so that I might be brave enough to get off my butt and actually do something. So, I was wondering if anybody who personally struggled/struggles with depression had any suggestions for things they found helpful. They can be big or small, preferably not a huge event like travelling across the country or something like that. I'm thinking more: go for a walk, try to cook dinner one evening, go to a bookshop nearby and just peruse, do your makeup, etc. Anyways, this is my first Reddit post ever, and I'm grateful for any ideas at all.",1677509064.0

I grew up in a religious household that tore me apart. Mental health could be healed by God, and since I was suffering, I wasn’t faithful enough, and therefore I was and still am a disgrace. I spent all my time working with a father who couldn’t control his rage and disappointment in his son.

I spent all of my childhood alone, disconnected emotionally from everyone. That feeling has never gone away and it never will at this point.

I grew up being told the only people in the world I could trust were my emotionally abusive family and a God that won’t help humanity because he has a point to prove. I grew up believing the only thing about myself that truly mattered was the work I did. If my work was poor, my existence was acknowledged, but only to be demeaned. If my work was good, there was nothing.

I pushed through school, I was sharp, but I had an inability to handle deadlines. This damaged my grades, and enraged my parents, who would punish me severely. I barely managed to graduate high school in 2020, but shortly after graduating I attempted suicide. I failed. No one knew. No one believed me when I told them the truth.

I had a spark of hope shortly after and spent the next 2 years trying to be a better person, trying to help others a, to be a beacon of kindness in the dark and cruel world. It didn’t last long. I went to university to study psychology, but I’m about to be removed because I couldn’t handle all of the not-psychology courses I was taking by academic gunpoint.

I went searching for help, I wanted to treat my mind, find out what really ails me. Most of the people I saw said ADHD, MDD, Generalized anxiety, and CPTSD. I could never receive an official diagnosis. I searched for this in secret, my family will never know. I can’t afford what little help there is here. What help I can afford would not accept me as a patient, they were too full

I don’t think I’ll be around much longer, and even if I live, I’m beginning to be plagued by shadowy figures that follow me. I catch glimpses of them out of the corner of my eyes, and paranoia is creeping in. The people around me don’t look human anymore, they are all watching me. I’m losing touch with what is real and what isn’t. I can’t accept this as reality.

I can’t even begin to describe the other burdens I bear, but I’m ready to die. I can’t sit here knowing my future is over and there is nothing I can do to stop it. Hope for the future was the only thing I had, hope to save people from the very chains that imprison my mind. Now all that’s left is the hopeless desire for unconsciousness. 

I’m drowning in an ocean abyss, and I’m thalassophobic.",1677511230.0

And I can't seem to find a middle ground no matter what. I'm depressed by default but at this point I'm pretty good at appearing cheerful, funny, social. All the things that I'm actually not. And people befriend me for that, thinking I'm gonna be like that all the time. They find out later that I suck at communicating. That I can't speak my mind, that I avoid. That when they get too close I shut off. I can never be the good friend they need. They deserve better, and I want them to stay but I know they need a better friend. I just wish I wasn't this way. I wish I haven't been a social outcast for many years so that I could know how to keep friends. I wish I could change. 

It sucks that I ruin every good thing that comes my way in life. I'm to blame. I just really wish there was an immediate solution to this. Other than suicide. But there really isn't. I'm doomed to never have any meaningful or long lasting relationships. And it's my fault. It's my own doing. I should stop putting on a mask that makes people think that I can be good. I should just show my depression so it keeps them away. I should have done this a long time ago, for everyone's good. But I had to ruin another relationship. I had to disappoint another person.

I am almost 26 years old and my life just got swept from under my feet again. 
After 2 years in a relationship my person decided that he can no longer do this anymore. I suffer from BPD and the constant need of reassurance, always wanting to be in his presence turned something that was so pure in a such a toxic environment for both of us. 
The other night I couldn’t take it anymore, the thought of being alone once again the fact that I will never see him again that I manifested this once more made me want to kill myself and I almost went for it. I know it will sound stupid but once again I got scared. While I was holding the knife on my wrist and cum dripping out of me cause he just fucked me and turned around to go to sleep, I made 6 superficial cuts and then I stopped. I went back to the bed and started crying and begging him for help cause I know I was relapsing (not the first time I am doing this to myself). 
Yesterday we went to talk about what happened the other night. I couldn’t feel more shame guilt and powerlessness then that. He looked me in the eyes and told me that what I did was unforgivable and he wants me out of his life immediately. I begged and begged till we were back at his place were we lived together I got myself on my knees and hugged his legs and begged him to not do this to not leave me cause now more then ever I needed on last chance. My world, my dreams all my desires include him. He told me he is scared to be in the same place with me that after two years that he tried and offered me a great environment where I could had literally done anything the way I rewarded him is a call at 4am and me covered in blood. 
He then made me pack all my things all the memories we shared, we split the photos, the gifts and he helped me pack everything. Got me a hotel of a 3 days and told me he will help be by either renting me a place for a month so I have time to get my own apartment or by buying me a plane ticket to go back home and helping me send all my things there. 
The thing is no matter where I am I will never see him again, I will never hug him again never fell his lips on me again. And that breaks me cause every single person in my life till now left me from my mom and dad till friends, partners and all in between. I can’t live like this, I can even breathe one last time like this. I just want all of this to end in one way or another.

They advise them to take a break from their friends, to protect their mental health and keep their distance. If they notice that they’re depressed friend is making them feel depressed. However, I don’t see any articles out there or advice for the depressed friend-as the depressed friend, how can I help protect my friends from my depression? 

I do my best to keep my depression to myself. I never tell anyone what I’m thinking about or how I’m really feeling in depth, I keep all of that to my therapist. However, I can’t lie. If a friend asks me how I’m doing, I’ll reply “I’m not doing great, I’m afraid“. Even though I don’t go into any detail, and I will focus entirely on them and their issues to keep the attention off of me, I can tell that just the knowledge that I’m depressed makes them feel down. 

I’m never not depressed – I’ve been depressed for over 30 years and I’ve made several suicide attempts. I’m on medication and I’m seeing a therapist, but I’m hyper aware that my depression puts a dampener on my friends just by association. They tend to talk to me about their depressive issues, as if they’re trying to match my mood out of empathy. I bring out the sadness in them. 

What can I do? I keep my depression a secret from them — I never tell them anything I’m thinking or feeling, but I make them feel down too. I’m like a contagion. Obviously, I take full accountability and blame for my self-deprecating humour which I know doesn’t help, but when depression is your whole life, you don’t know what else to use as joke material and I feel so guilty after I crack a joke about me that is very negative. 

How can we protect our friends from our depression? I’ve been debating calling attention to it, telling them that I’ve noticed their mood when around me and it makes me feel awful that I’m the cause of that mood shift. As such, should I recommend they take a break from me? Or should I not confront it and just turn down offers to socialise so I don’t make them feel self conscious? What’s the best approach to keeping them emotionally safe?

Tl;dr: should we keep ourselves distant from our friends to protect them from our depression? Should we tell them we notice how our depression brings down their mood, or just distance ourselves from them?",1677461614.0

I have been spiritual since I was around 15yo (I am 26 now). I started with paganism and slowly developed my own sense of beliefs. Long story short I believe in some higher power, but I choose not to name it god. Some time ago, maybe 2 years ago, I encountered the work of Dolores Canon. And I can't describe the feeling, but it's as if something inside me already knew this stuff and simply rediscovered the truth. She talks about many things and topic, but the main one for now is reincarnation. And that leads me to todays question. 

I've seen some tiktoks lately that the so called tiktok spirituality can send some into state of psychosis. I have been depressed for years now, am currently treated by psychiatrist and seeing a therapist. For over 6 months now, I have been mainly struggling with a feeling of not wanting to go on. But not in the sad way, I just feel like I have lived what I wanted to live. I also have a slight feeling like I was meant to die, but an error happened that prevented that and thats why I feel like my plan for this life in no longer there. Tbh even writing this souns delusional. But that is why I am asking for your opinion. Could depression cause these kind of delusions too? I've read on google that psychotic depression most often causes delusions related to depression such as guilt and failure. This isn't necessarily that. I will bring it up on my next session, but I would like to get your opinions on the matter too.",1677463213.0

I do have a safety plan, but they are just going to send me to a psych ward. (I'm in out patient) They told me as such. As of right now I'm on a wait list for an eating disorder facility, but that's different to the situation I'm in right now.

I have moved across country in hopes to get away from horrible people that just caused me too much stress, but recently I'm just surrounded with constant stress. I don't have money to leave and I can't work. I'm so close to just go to a shelter, but I feel that will just cause other stress.

my depression is so bad right now that I'm having a hard time faking a smile around my family. They have definitely noticed and it's not that I don't want them to know I'm really depressed, but I don't want them to know. This is because they seem like they are helping, but they don't know what they are doing. I'm constantly exhausted and my health isn't good cause I'm not eating.

I suffer from anhedonia so it can be hard to do something I'll enjoy, but right now I hate doing anything. I know I should report this to my councilor, but I'm scared to. It's as if someone had to do it for me. And I'm slowly pushing away everyone. I just don't want to hurt them more than I already have. I tried telling myself that I'm fine and I'll get better, but the more I go through everyday, I realized I've been telling myself that since I was 13. I'm 20 now, it's been years with no progress, only going down hill.

I can't possibly see myself in the future cause I'm still suffering from the past, ptsd and all. I constantly cant find anything good about me. I truly hate myself. I constantly look for validation from others and when I don't get it I feel like shit for even wanting it. I feel undeserving of anything, I hate buying for myself even though I'm told I should get myself something nice every now and then.

Currently I'm suffering from horrible, vivid, nightmares. I'm taking meds for it but it's not working anymore and I can't raise the dose since it affects my health. Speaking of meds. I hate taking them it just makes me feel worse that the only way I slightly even feel stable is when I'm meds. I hate that.

Sorry for the long post, I just don't know what to do anymore.

Edit: Thanks for the reward. I honestly wasn't expecting that.

Edit: So I reluctantly talked to a councilor, we talked for a while and they decided that its true I shouldn't be alone right now, and they understand my concern for going to a psych ward. Their temporary solution until I see my therapist is for them to call me everyday to make sure I was mentally and physically safe. So far it seems to be helping so hopefully this means I can eventually find a long term solution.",1677451175.0

I suffer from chronic daily headaches/migraines with daily visual disturbances like auras, scolosis, back pain, neck pain, and a fuck load more the whole 9 yards. Life is so damn boring without my green. I own a business and work all the damn time. But I absolutely hate it until I smoke. After I smoke I get ideas I wouldn't have thought of in a million years! When I smoke I'll usually shut the game off or the show whatever I'm doing and get straight to work. I just love to get stuff done and smile about life when I'm high. 

One big problem. I've been smoking almost everyday for about 4 years now and in the past year or 2 it's been guaranteed to give me a headache / migraine. Like no matter what.

It tightens up my suboccipital in the back neck and makes all my other knots so fucking tight. It hurts like hell. I couldn't write on pen and paper on bad the pain is. I always get a pounding migraine. But on the other hand I'm less suicidal. Idk what to do. Every suicide attempt I've had in the past 5 years, I smoked a little weed and chilled the absolute fuck out. Tears stopped, cutting stopped, hung up the phone with Suicide Hotline. Everything.

It's depressing when the only thing that works make not one but all your physical pain symptoms worse.

I don't sleep without weed. My anxiety is always at an all time high! Like biting through my shirts heart racing after counting the hours I'm left with to sleep. Daily. Every single night.

What should I do? Why does weed make my muscles hurt so bad? Could it be forcing them to relax? That's what it seems like. I hope I don't have to quit my weed. I have a medical card and it took forever to get that shit.

TLDR: I get chronic daily headaches, and there's almost no way to avoid one. But weed escalates them to migraines. And every suicide attempt I've ever had recently in the past 5 years was saved by weed.",1677425133.0

Soon I began to experience a lot of emotional pain and very little joy. It is as if a profound sorrow was always lurking, but joy was temporary and hope against my intellect and logic.

I would dissect my worries and sorrows and wouldn't be able to come up with a logical statement to prove myself wrong. Until I find the one, which is: we can't know how our lives will turn out. But it makes sense that if we make changes, positive and constructive changes, the compound law will do its work and things will get better; eventually.

When we are suicidal is not that we want to die, we want to stop suffering. Sometimes depression is a logical reaction to a depressing situation.

Seneca said that we suffer more in imagination than in reality. And this is key. Reality doesn't make us sad, it's our thoughts that make us sad. It's our thinking about things that happened in the past, that we keep them present and allow them to hurt us now. If we were to switch off the thinking, those NATs (negative automatic thoughts), we would be able to stop our suffering.

It is only when I step back and realise that my thoughts and emotions are temporary visitors to my house and not who I am or what reality is, that I am able to cut off the pain completely, instantly. It's like a switch.

I get so immersed in those thoughts and emotions, in the movie, that I forget that I am that who is watching. I'm in the cinema! And the story that I am telling myself, the movie, is a lie. Even if there is some devastating truth in it, it is a lie that I will be sad and alone forever, that there is no way out. There is always a way out. Our job is to bring our emotional state to a place where we recognise this truth and are open to put in the work to get to a better one.

As long as we make progress, even if small, to get out there, create healthy routines and open our hearts a little bit to the world and others, we are doomed to get better.

Life never throws at you something that you cannot cope with. It just sucks that sometimes our biology forces us to stay alive when all we want is to die, to rest. Perhaps it does so because it knows that we are designed to thrive, to survive, and hence can cope with everything that life throws at us. No matter how devastating.

At the end, it comes to a choice.

To push a little bit more, despite of the pain, if there truly is something out there beautiful for us, and there always is, it is worth it. It feels worthy.",1677367382.0

But I realised that girls in my league (which is pretty high, Im confident in my look and Im way above average) are in their ""hoe phase"" and have such a big body counts and Im freaked out by it. I met several girls since then, and they all just love to be free. Now maybe I was just unlucky but when I google whats the average bodycount of 25yo girls Im freaking aout because those numbers are just so high.

I personally hate the idea of hooking up, I want to be with one beautifull princess and I dont need to go and duck everything that moves. But it seems that all the pretty young girls nowdays are doing it.

My family is broken. My parents are separated, my mom is very hard to talk to, she is locked in her own world. My dad is fine but Im strugling to live with him. He earns enough to support me but he doesnt. I had to go and work in foreign country to earn enough to support myself. My sister is just another ""hoe"" and even tho I love her, I know for a fact that her body count is sky high and ahe is only 20. 

I feel like I didnt say shit in this post because I actually have no motivation to got deeper and longer. There is nothing that brings me joy, I have 0 evergy, I have to force myself to eat and I have a hard time doing so, it came down to one small meal a day which I hardly eat. 

I should get my Bachelor degree in a few months, but I feel like thats not going to happened, I was always a good student, rn I dont even know and I done even care what happening at uni, I dont see a purpose to try. I cry myself to sleep. Im freaked out from a last night because I was really thinking about ending it. And I dont think its goning to get better",1677416684.0

I think it might belong here so yeah. Here’s an update: I’ve fallen deeper into this depression and I need to talk about it somewhere with someone so here it is. Enjoy my mental downward spiral.


Hey uh this is just something i wanted to talk about because I’ve really been bothered by it and well I’m starting to feel more and more burnt out and depressed. You see I’m currently in middle school and well my mental state is starting to plummet. My friends will just tell me to shut up if I even talk any, get mad at me for the smallest things, and well Ive tried talking to friends about this but I can’t because I think they won’t believe my because I’ve always seemed like a really happy kid with nothing below the surface. However I feel as if I were to speak about it they’d be like, “your not depressed bro shut up your faking it for attention shut up.” And im not faking my depressed state because well I’ve noticed a couple things.

1. I’ve ended up getting burnt out on a lot of things including certain media such as Modded Minecraft which I already made a post on.

2. I just feel a lot more sad all the time and my parents have noticed and asked what’s wrong and I can’t bring myself to tell them.

3. I’ve had a lot of uh how do I say this without this post getting slammed into oblivion? Uh I’ve had a lot of thoughts of wanting to end my life because I feel unhappy and also because of certain comments people have made about me always judging me and telling me to shut up.

I do think this might be depression but I’m not a doctor I’m a teenager who’s going through puberty I think (do you go through puberty in the 7th grade?) Idk but it could be a lot of other things like being a teenager going through puberty and having all kinds of emotions. I don’t know but if anyone has any advice please comment because I need some. Thanks for reading this post if you found it and have a great day.


A Quick Edit: And if you are wondering I don’t think I’m in a toxic relationship with my friends because they usually will support me however those comments of being like, “shut up stupid.” Or some other crap is really taking a tole on me.

And Another Edit: I don’t this is good by the sounds of it. I’ve thought more and more of suicide and jumping off my school building to do so. I’m being slowly tempted to and I don’t know what to do. I plan on talking with two of my friends about this and I hope they believe me. I’ve managed to tell one of my friends after a while of posting the original post. He’s understanding it but I still don’t feel any better. Will just see where life takes me. If I don’t post or update this for a long time I probably did the deed. I probably killed myself by then. If I’m at least still semi active I’m probably alive. Well anyways see ya guys until the next post.




Big Update:
So I’m getting better. I’ve told my most trusted friends and they understand. Thanks y’all for the advice and I hope that this depression of mine will go away eventually. Thx y’all you all helped me better than the people at r/therapy who ignored it and did nothing to help. Also I appreciate y’all. You all truly are helpful people and you all prevented me from committing suicide. I can’t say thanks enough but I’ll see y’all in other post of mine. Love y’all!",1677388788.0

Instead of identifying that feeling as ""depression,"" I'm trying to make a conscious choice to call it ""contentment.""  In my mind, I'm taking that ache in my chest, calling it ""contentment"" and then imagining my heart pumping that ""contentment"" through my body.  

And in that moment I start to feel better.  I literally feel contentment and serenity pumping through my veins, and the depressive ache in my chest eases.

How much of our daily serenity and happiness is actually a choice?  I used to think that life was simple.  When good things happen we feel good.  And when bad things happen we feel bad.  

But now I'm starting to question that.  Perhaps we can set aside all of the bad things and madness in the world and, right here and right now, make the choice and effort to still feel good.

I am truly grateful to be around people who genuinely care about me and would be devastated if I died but in my darkest hours I sometimes wish it wasn't like that so I could finally escape this pain guilt free. God I just wish I could be free of this turmoil. Sometimes I don't know how I'll be able to live the rest of my life living with mental illness. 

Als,  I hate talking like this and even feeling like this but even tbough i know my mum and other family members would be devastated if I died I still cannot say I have a 100% fantastic relationship with any of them. Only with my little cousin but obviously I can't really confide in a kid. 

I can't help but to desperately want more love in my life. I feel touch starved. I can't even remember the last time I truly was held and truly felt loved.

I feel like even not having something as simple as that can really effect your mental health. 

I'll probably always have something wrong with me. I think I'll always be a little depression, and my OCD and bipolar are not going to magically go away either. But God dammit I feel like I could feel at least a tiniest bit better.

I guess it may be almost a mid-life crisis at this point because I'm a 37 year old male.

A bit of backstory is that when I was a teenager I always envisioned myself crawling out of poverty and into the life of a writer, musician, and director of film.

I always loved medieval fantasy like Berserk, LOTR, and Final Fantasy so I'd daydream of some day making it big as a creative because just making people smile made me fulfilled. I was also a jokester-type because I loved hearing people laugh as well. The problem is that I was a problem child with a rough upbringing and very poor family (raised by a single mother and father who was schizophrenic).

This made it challenging to initially understand the value in getting education so I barely passed through high school.

Fast-forwarding to my early 20s I tried applying to film school multiple times with no success. 7 years later as a mature student and a relationship with my first girlfriend I was able to focus in on upgrading all my high school classes and enrolled into two different physics degrees where I graduated late at age 31.

I went into the tech industry with my degrees and after 4 years raised into a senior level position up until a few months ago when I was laid off.

Throughout this whole journey I've always attempted to integrate parts of my young creative side through writing, poetry, rap lyrics, and video editing. But it wasn't until this point that I realized how much I wish I had pursued music and video.

After the lay-off I've felt this overwhelming sense of urgency and utter remorse that I had wasted my entire life with a career, though I enjoyed, was not what I truly could have accomplished. I feel like I could have accomplished so so much more.

I've been working on a YouTube comedy-like channel for a couple of years now (even before the lay-off) but have only \~460 subscribers. I also started learning what kinds of music I'd like to write and am releasing some of my first songs in the next month.

But even though I'm finally getting some time to focus on my love in life I feel being 37 that I've missed out on doing so many things in my prime and that I have no hope for success now; especially because my comedy style is a bit rough around the edges which isn't politically correct these days.

I just feel so lost and so terrified of my future in my 40s that I'm paralyzed in tears sometimes whenever watching some YouTubers I see my young self in.

Can anyone relate or does anyone have thoughts on how to work through these days of deep turmoil?",1677291664.0

boredom, but it has become insanely bad.. so bad I constantly think about offing myself for a while. I feel as if all my days are just a haze of boredom and pure depression. I feel as if I'm dying for nothing no matter how much I accomplish. I saw someone smiling working at Arbys and I'm just wondering how?! I would have to off myself.. on my walk home I saw someone shoveling ice around the age of 50 for a hotel, and I was just like yeah I'd have to off myself. I guess this is the best I can explain it. [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UxNKD6AgXXs) When I complain about this to people, thev always try to suggest things they find interesting, which of course bore the living shit out of me. I should probably note I'm 19 with ADHD, daily chronic headaches, and a bunch of muscle issues so it limits a lot of things. But even before that, I've always just been so bored I wanna die. If I'm not constantly stimulated by food, weed, alcohol, jerking off (this one I can quit for months on end like alcohol I often force myself too when I'm not in the mood at all just to get 20 seconds of pleasure / happiness)
I spend tons of money on new,
promising hobbies just for them to bore me
soon after I begin.
Of course, when you say you are bored to
someone, no one thinks it's that big of a deal.
The only analogy I can make is my boredom is
to regular boredom as depression is to regular
sadness. I have such crippling boredom video games arnt fun, tv, friends, conversations.. only being constantly stressed or in tough situations. I have difficulty doing work or
motivating myself to do anything besides
browse the internet, which bores the shit out of me If I'm not high but at least it isn't expensive or demanding of my time. I eat constantly because it stimulates my brain for a short while. I don't know what to do or what is wrong with me. If anyone has had any similar experiences or has any suggestions for me, I would really appreciate it. It is bad enough feeling this way, on top of it I feel very alone since I've never heard of anyone else experiencing this and I live alone.

I’ve solved almost all my problems in life, yet I just don’t care. I’m just so apathetic about it all. I used to be so depressed with social anxiety, no friends, weak and over weight. But I am a warrior deep inside, all those things were just battles to fight and win. And I did, it took several years of constantly exposing myself to situations while also doing cognitive behavioural therapy and positive beliefs to overcome my fears and social anxiety. And it worked, I beat it, with sheer unrelenting warrior persistence. Now I have friends and a girlfriend and am never lonely, never will be again. Next battle was weight loss. This was a different fight, for with fear I was fighting something painful. But with food and diet, I am fighting something pleasurable, something that was my friend in time of need. 🍕🍟🍔🌭🥓🍿🍪🍩🍫<—- these guys, these delicious delights. I could just eat and eat till I had a heart attack and died, and I would consider that a happy life. I don’t want a long boring life full of work work work, I want a short fun life full of pizzzzaa! So logic was even against me in this, it seems more logical to stuff myself to death with pizza. So this was quite a hard battle. It took another several years to beat this problem, and I took some drastic action, action that only a madman would do, and it worked I got what I want. I’ve already lost 40 lbs, with more to lose. Now one last problem, and thats making some decent money. I know exactly what to do, and can do it right now, and I love doing it, yet I just sit here and do nothing. Day in and day out, I just do nothing. I’m so apathetic, I just don’t care, And I don’t know why I don’t. I wanna make a ton of money and use it to help people in need, and it would be so easy for me, I have a brilliant mind and theres so much opportunity to make money, all that money just sitting there waiting for me to take it. And yet, I just sit here....

You know depression is a real illness when everything is perfect in life, and theres nothing to be sad about, yet still broken and inactive and so so apathetic. Its like it doesn’t matter if I can have everything I want in life, I just don’t seem to really care deep down. People are suffering out there! Millions of people struggling and suffering everyday! Money could help them, it could mean getting therapy for them or feeding them or getting them out of debt, or getting them medical help. And here I am, a brilliant money making mind with a caring heart just sitting here and not doing anything! And why? I freaking love the work I do that makes money. I don’t understand, I did everything right, I got positive beliefs like believing I can do it without a shadow of a doubt and loving myself. My brain is trained to overcome any fear of anything and I nothing to be sad about. I’ve highly motivated myself by constantly reviewing the consequences of inaction, while also visualizing the benefits of success. What is it? What is stopping me? 

Anyways, I just needed to type this out, it helps me think of the solution to things when I type out the problem. Now I will go deep in meditation and spend some time with my mind to seek out the issue. I won’t stop until I figure it out. Depression can stand in my way, but the warrior will keep fighting in any way he can, even if it takes the rest of life!",1677281422.0
549,Am I Depressed?,1,11b4xo2,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/11b4xo2/am_i_depressed/,6,"Throwaway Account.

Well, I'm a 17 y/o straight male in uni. I honestly do not know where to begin. I've been feeling like crap for the better part of two years now. It does come and go, usually triggered by stressful situations, like problems at school or at home or the like. I was not terrible at school, just kind of fell off over the last few years. Just the thought of failing gives me terrible anxiety, which makes me not want to even open my assignments to do them. I feel like crap not doing what is expected of me. I feel like I'm failing my parents by being so useless.

While on the topic of my parents, I'd like to talk a bit about my upbringing. My parents are honestly not terrible, I'm sure others have it worse off than me. We're quite well off. My mum is great, a bit of a worrywart if anything, but altogether a great person. My dad, on the other hand, can be a bit of a prick. He has improved quite a bit over the years and actually feels a lot more like a dad now, now that I only talk to him over the phone. He's not too bad now, if not a bit quick to anger. But he can be a real arse if he tries. Due to some spats between my mum and him (pretty serious stuff I prefer not to get into) He didn't talk to me or my sister for a good couple years. His aforementioned short-fuse is not pleasant either, as he often blew his top on the simplest of things. He honestly terrifies me, and the slightest edge to his voice kicks my brain into fight-or-flight.  My 'depressive episodes' started off when he wasn't talking to us. I would perpetually feel like crying, and often did, although I didn't tell my mum. Nothing gave me any joy.  I also took to cutting myself, rationalizing it as punishing myself. I cut myself in the same spot several times so I could tell my parents I got it while fiddling with my pocket knife. I finally told my mum about this and she honestly listened (didn't tell her about the cutting though), which helped me feel a lot better for a while. But she took me to this absolutely horrid 'therapist' who just gave me a Rorschach test and talked to my mum behind closed doors (I wasn't privy to the conversation, but I surmise she told my mum that I was fine) Well, I tried to fix my situation myself, I took to working out and running and that helped for quite a bit (I did try telling my dad but he told me I was simply lazy). I was honestly not terrible for a year or so, if not a bit insecure and quick to mentally breaking down, but nothing too bad.

My problems have surfaced again recently. I recently have had trouble sleeping, as I often start ruminating as I try to sleep (might just be my terrible sleeping schedule due to college). I feel like crap again and have taken to cutting myself again. I cannot muster any motivation to get my work done and am falling behind. Well, I'm terribly sure if I'm depressed, but If I am, I'd like to get better.  Honestly I'm actually sort of hoping I'm depressed, which would mean the situation can be remedied and it isn't completely my fault, but thinking this makes me think I'm faking it. Could someone please tell me if my case is consistent with what actually depressed people feel like? If it is, I could seek proper help.",1677279877.0

551,Gaslighting at its finest ..,0,11b2qjh,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/11b2qjh/gaslighting_at_its_finest/,3,"I just recently found out that my older brother has been fucking my now ex fiancé for the past 8 or 9 months behind my back. Little back story, I met my former fiancé in 2017 in a different state than where I’m currently located which was my home state prior to moving where I met her. Since getting close around end of 2017 early 2018, this person was apart of my everyday life. I fed her. I put money in her pocket constantly, before we were even a couple.. I sat back and watched her be with another guy and have a kid by him and throughout that time I was still supplying her with money and making sure she ate and was twin care of, etc .. I few years go by and I drunkenly admit my feelings for her after about 2 1/2 years. We talk about it and we end up getting together. Because of who she was, everyone in my family dropped me because of it. No one wanted to support me being with her so all I had was her and my older brother(who at the time was in my home state whilst we were in another state). She moves in with me and we stay in my home for about 8 months before we move back to my home state. We end up in a roomate situation with a family member of mine until I can afford to get us into our own place. This was in December of 2021. We started having even more issues once we stayed alone around January or February. And from that point on she completely changed on me. Granted, I’m mature enough to admit I wasn’t perfect. I had my fuck ups but I never left her. I never abandoned her and her needs. I’ve been there through thick and thin no matter what. I notice she starts to pull away from me due to the fact that I had school and work full time and I didn’t get to spend time with her amongst other things. Nevertheless, I notice she grow extremely close to my older brother. A person whom I thought we both saw a just family, strictly family. But little did I know, for months right up under my nose, they were fucking and secretly in a relationship. All whilst I’m funding her life because she can’t find or keep a job. I’m doing everything I can as a man, I’m providing, I’m trying to be intimate, I’m still flirting and trying to continue to “date” my partner. All while I can see her pulling away from me, from the relationship. I loved her with every fiber in my being. I’ve never physically harmed her, never disrespected her, never threatened her.. I get there were areas I needed work on but I felt I did all I could with what I had. For basically the entire year me and her stayed together once we moved to my home state, she had me blocked on all her social media and I knew it was a red flag but I was so afraid of setting g her off because I felt anything and everything I say or do would be ammunition for her to just leave me. So I decide to deep dive and pay closer attention. I started to notice her crawling out of bed to be on the phone with him at 3, 4 in the morning. Her always wanting to be apart of his day in some way or always texting him or alway gaming with him, even got the point where he was always the topic of her conversation. She went from being a homebody to always wanting to go out and again she knows no one from here but my brother and his wife and they stay almost an hour from us at the time. My brother is never known to drive long distances unless it was for money or sex .. well she had no job, no income of any fashion. I stated to notice differences in her behavior. Her music. Her lingo. Her beliefs. It was all the same as his. I special yes for MONTHS they were doing things behind my back and they gaslighted me the entire time. She’d say “why would I want him, he beats his wife, he neglects his kids, etc”. Same for him, saying things like “I see her as a little sister, wouldn’t do that to you lil bro”. I’d hear them say this to me but their actions just showed so much than what they were willing to tell me. I knew it all long. I just had a strong gut feeling and they made me out to feel insane for even thinking that was a possibility. Fast forward to a few days ago, I find out they’re dating and have been dating the entire time I speculated. She had me blocked however I could still see our dm thread, I blindly notice she changed her pfp and it was a very vague yet point blank message. It was her cuddled up with my brother but I couldn’t see the guys face so even though I knew it was him I was in disbelief. I then find his page and his pfp was them again CUDDLED UP IN MY HOUSE. I read at least a few hundred of his tweets and majority pertain to her and him and how much they loved each other and how great the sex was and how they are starting a life together, etc. I confront both of them and there’s zero remorse, both of them basically told me they didn’t care how it made me feel and they’d do it again if given the option. It’s been a total of 3 days since finding out and I haven’t slept much. I haven’t eaten. I can’t stomach anything. I can’t even enjoy what I used to because I truthfully don’t want to be alive. I can’t seem to find anything that will take my mind off of how they betrayed me. I’m struggling and this is so hard for me to talk about. I’m drowning in my own sea of thoughts because I can’t fathom what they did to me. I don’t know what to do from here because I have zero motivation to do anything. I feel so weak. So helpless. So used. I say all that to say this, how do I get over this without having to resort to what I don’t want to do?",1677274361.0

I'm only 18 and this might sound like a lot but it really is too much and I don't feel like my life is worth it. This is not a bye bye note or something it just feels wrong for me.

My whole life i really didn't make a difference till now at least. I come from a small city, and i grew up there. Growing up my parents did everything for me, best teachers, good vacations love and everything and i really enjoyed everything until 6th grade. In 6th grade i stopped sports thinking it was for nerds and started gaining weight. Eventually i became fat, a laughing stock because that is how i was treated through my high school and now. My parents still loved me they were helping me at every point and silly me was retaliating every time they tried to help me. I also had a best friend, a friend who I used to hangout with, an academic genius and like minded. I enjoyed time with him but suddenly in 8th grade he started ignoring me saying I'm a distraction and short tempered. It hit me, it hit me hard and there started my downfall. My grades and my health started degrading and i got in with the wrong people. I wasted my 9th and 10th grade partying with the wrong people. I thought I was independent and taking my own decisions but i was digging my own grave.

I somehow passed all my classes and covid hit, which helped me pass my 10th grade. 

I always wanted to go to the US for my uni, but i didn't put in effort. I played video games slept late, but lost a little weight during covid times with the help of my father. I got a shit score on my SAT's and an average gpa which didn't really give me a good college. My parents spent a ton on application fees, counselors etc and being an international student it was expensive. My father didn't stop once from spending and happily gave me the money but instead i failed to get even a decent college. I cried again as i failed to fulfill my dream. Then here in my country my father told me to enroll in a t10 college for my bachelor's and pursue one of the most difficult professional courses known to an Indian. I came to a different city unaware of what is going to happen.

I came here cried missing my family for a month and somehow settled. Then cam exams i cried again and i passed. Now the professional course I'm enrolled in  has exams in June and my bachelor's exams is in apr. I'm not prepared and have severe exam anxiety. I have no friends, no female touch or any social life. I do t study i sit in the room and overthink and cry.

Leaving all this behind, I'm fat, not tall, not academically gifted, not good at anything and I'm just kinda wasting my parents money. I eat like a cow and cry about stuff. My parents try to fix it but they are kinda orthodox. When i asked them that should I go to a therapist, my mother was ok, but my father was like ""you wanna go to a doctor for mad people"". Whenever I talk to my father about a problem he always just gives me one solution "" work harder"". This doesn't really get in for me. My mother helps me out but it does not affect me.

I am a good for nothing son, I'm not good at anything, people don't talk to me, i feel excluded from my generation, i am judged and avoided by people, i have no talents, i have no social life or friends, not fit, not academically gifted or smart, I'm just a fat and short guy who cries cries and cries.

He feels like he’s a loser and can’t get a job even though he hasn’t been trying much lately, i think he worried about rejection. I also think not having a job has been stressing him out too though as he still has a car payment and he’s probably running low on money.. 


He’s been super angry and irritable lately with my mom, he won’t come upstairs to eat dinner so he really has hardly been eating and losing a lot of weight. He doesn’t believe in therapy because he went when he was younger and it didn’t help so and he says it won’t help and he doesn’t want medication either.. 


I’ve talked with him before about this all but I don’t live at home anymore and I’m the only thing he’s got it feels like. I’m worried sick about him, I struggle with anxiety so I’m constantly dealing with panic attacks about his situation. I’m planning on talking to him today but does anyone have advice on what to say or how to do it? I feel like I’m the only one who can kind of get through to him",1677246729.0

I wake up every morning not wanting to be bothered with the day, and I'm literally not getting anything done. I get anxious doing most things and I feel depressed feeling like there's no point in anything when I've wasted most of my life away doing meanless things and I missed out on my youth because I didn't have friends to do anything with.

I'm torn between staying in my family's spare apartment for free contributing sometimes where I don't like where I live or move somewhere I want to live and pay for it and I can't afford it, I have a poorly paid job and getting a job was effort for me as I didnt get a job till I was 26 due to helping my family with their business instead. I'm fine to do house work but I can't sort my life out.

Wherever I've been I can't make friends and I can't get a boyfriend but I turn guys away because I didn't like them and I do want a boyfriend. I want to seek out more opportunities to meet people, but I don't feel motivated to. I can't be friends with anyone without being jealous of them because they show off their awesome life's having great jobs, having a family of their own or they're travelling the world when I've literally done nothing with my life and my life is unexciting and boring. Back in school was easier to make friends when we were on the same path, we all literally had the same life that we can be friends unlike now noone seems to want to be friends. 
My education was messed up when my family moved me to spain and went to school where I didn't know the language and I left school with nothing.

I'm 27 and I want to get a job where I travel as I want to travel and I feel stagnant being in the same place all the time and it gets expensive to go most places. 
I need to get help to see a therapist, but I can't bring myself to and days pass by, I'm not near reaching my goals. I feel limited due to circumstances but I know its not true it's my mindest that I need to change with help and I've tried to help myself by googling answers but then I go back to being negative because I feel hurt by my past from people that upset me and I have regrets from mistakes.

# 

 

The reality is it's all my fault and it's all because I didn't work hard when I had to . I kept obsessing over useless things and now I regret that heavily . I know that visiting doctor make me feel good because it gives me the feeling of being a victim and reassurance that it was not my fault but deep down I know that I am giving excuses and running constantly form my fears instead of facing them .

Throwback to my school life when I was a talented and all rounder kid with great grades in class and was great in extra curricular activities and sports etc . But in my school , there was never any event or fest so I never got a chance to express my talents , So I developed a habit of daydreaming where people appreciating me for my talent and I behave like It's happening in reality , unaware of the fact that this daydreaming habit will become so addictive and dominant that It will lead to serious consequences . Soon I started prioritizing daydreaming instead of going outside and really do something in real like joining an academy or learning new skills . Today I am so addicted to daydream that my focus is so poor that it lead me to a failure in academics and being completely lonely in real life as I don't go outside because of daydreaming habit .

When I see my peers doing good in their lives , It makes me feel regret , guilt , FOMO and self hatred . I avoid talking to the, , talking about them . meeting them because I become so anxious and start overthinking , I start having headaches and so tensed and frustrated . I have a feeling of jealousy , self hatred and anxiety constantly feeling like a failure .

I tried about multiple things to find out my interest but they all were temporary obsessions , nothing else . Also I never had a solid aim or goal . I never had an idea what to do in my life .

I am in the last year of college and in three years , I rarely went to college because it's in my local city and my old schoolmates come there and I feel ashamed to go there . I don't go outside of my house because of the same reason. All my friends went to different cities and are in good college .

I am really conscious about my physical appearance as I have body dysmorphia and Maladaptive daydreaming but I know these things would have never happened if I focused on something productive and having a GOAL in my life .

Every night I have a dream of these thoughts constantly reminding me of my mistakes and everyone else doing good in their lives . Every single night .

I try to cope instead of facing the reality . I know how shit I am addicted to PMO , junks , mobile phone , social media wasting my time . I hate myself . I really do .

I know going to doctor will change nothing But It gives me reassurance . I know that nothing going to be alright but still I try to cope form my reality via daydreaming .

I wish I worked in a better direction that wasting my time on useless things . Buried in guilt and regret . Having no interest in doing anything . I don't like waking up in the morning and going outside .

I know everything is an excuse now . I am such a coward person who has no courage to face his fears .

I really regret missing opportunities in my life .

Sorry for the vent , just wanted to get it off my chest .",1677214815.0

Has anyone found a good starting point to end this? Sometimes I do things that put me in a bind, especially my finances and physical/mental health. Then worry and obsess over it until I find a bandaid solution. Those worries then consume my every thought. I could be wrong, but maybe it’s partially a way to distract me from deeper issues. At least finances are much more concrete and while I am struggling to manage them there is familiarity in it. But I’ve become miserable.

There i mean mike and kevin and they both go to the same school
So i have a pretty good relationship with them. They like me and i like them back though of course they are closer to each other since they are able to spend time with each other much more.

Now the 3 of us were talking and kevin said he had depression, he also thought about committing suicide and in the moment i let mike talk and didnt say anything because i didnt know what to say. Im very bad at expressing myself at time or finding the right words. There were also other people there although not talking to us but that did mess with me a bit. I did miss my window to say anything and we just kept doing our stuff like we always do.

But this is really on my mind right now.
I dont know what to do. I didnt really acknowledge him.

I never had depression myself so i dont know what kind of pain he’s going through but i want to help in some way.

Honestly im not that close to him because we just dont get to talk much. I could message him but i dont want to look like i pity him or something because i dont think anyone wants that.

Should just message him a bit just be a friend have a better relationship and not bring it up?

Or should i bring it up at some point?

Or should i just not do anything?
He didnt ask for my help and i dont know if he wants it
And what help could i even provide at all anyways 
I dont know
Im not a therapist/physiologist or whatever im just not qualified for that
But i genuinely want to help him if i can
I have no clue what to do

Never went to any dances, never dated, never had super close friends, etc. Some of the reasons that I couldn’t do these things weren’t just me abstaining from them - there were real reasons that I couldn’t do them, I won’t get into that.

I was depressed from a young age and grew up very fast because of it.

I went off to college. I wanted to get better. I wanted to actually start living and I gave myself a fresh start. Fuck academics, my only two goals were 1. make friends and 2. maybe start dating. Four years later, graduation less than a month away, I have achieved none of those things. Not even close. I have achieved a lot academically, but I would trade every single thing I have ever accomplished for just those two things in a heartbeat.

I grew up too fast and now I don’t enjoy the things everyone around me seems to enjoy. I can’t connect with anyone in a meaningful way. Acquaintances, sure. Nothing more. I go days without speaking sometimes because I have nobody to talk to.

I tried so hard. But nothing.

Every day I just feel more and more behind everyone else. So much I haven’t done and I will never be able to do. I had hoped to start finally living when I moved away and I didn’t. I made no progress and made myself worse. And now I’m watching everyone around me move forward, and I can’t even take a single step towards it. Nobody would want to slow down for me and I don’t blame them. There’s a lot I need to catch up on but I can’t do it alone, and that’s all I have. I can’t find any peace within myself because everything I’ve ever wanted was just to not feel so horribly lonely.

It isn’t even just me comparing myself to others, it’s that I wanted to have the experiences they had, and I couldn’t, and I didn’t. And it’s too late now. I know life isn’t over at 22 but there is no end in sight to this. And I don’t want to keep feeling more and more isolated. It just hurts. I’ve lived nearly a quarter of my lifespan and never actually started living. I haven’t done anything I ever wanted or achieved any of my goals. I never got the chance. And now, this has damaged me so badly that I can’t seem to make any progress anymore.

I don’t know how to live with this. Every single day it hurts more. My life is full of things I wanted so, so, so badly and I never got them. But I don’t know how to get it to stop and everything I’ve tried doesn’t work.",1677135333.0

It also feels like I want to cry, I can feel it in the pit of my stomach wiggling around but nothing comes out, no tears, nothing. It's just that nagging feeling in my stomach of needing to just cry my eyes out or scream at the top of my lungs maybe.

When I get like this I feel lonelier than ever, feels like I'm spiraling and have nothing to ground me. I don't have many friends or many that know i struggle plus I'm not really at that age where this would matter to them: they have careers, families, kids...why would anyone want to deal w me too?

A big chunk of it is definitely genetic, as a lot of my family suffers similarly.

I’ve dealt with childhood abandonment, sexual assault, abusive relationships, unhealthy coping mechanisms, death and suicide of close loved ones, and a plethora of health issues that have made it difficult to go about my life normally.

I try to stay as positive as I can, and gravitate towards helping other people, or making them laugh. I’m in the greatest relationship in my life, and intend to spend the rest of my life with my partner/best friend.

With that said, I’m drowning. I’ve been working anywhere between 2–5 jobs at once while going to school. Since quitting my retail job and focusing solely on graphic design, I’ve become incredibly sedentary.

I never want to leave my bed. I rarely take care of myself. I have no problem cleaning after others (like at my partner’s house), but I absolutely cannot find the motivation to clean up after myself. My room is a disaster.

I’ve been on SSRIs, and while they improve my anxiety a little, and have helped me stay afloat with recent traumas, it’s done nothing for motivation. The best I can remember to do is take my meds, brush my teeth and wash my face every day. Beyond that, I’m not regularly doing anything to care for myself. I only shower when I “need” to, because I’m always shut up in my room.

I’m on a break from school right now, and I still feel awful, because I have homework and obligations to my remote jobs—but I’m so exhausted, all I can do is stay in my bed.

No  income, and even if I did have income it's not like anyone around here  pays well enough if you're not willing to sell your soul, and everything  around me is way too expensive to be able to get out of mommy and  daddy's house and live. Told myself I'm tired of being taken advantage  of and I'm going to do something for myself, and tried working for  myself but I've done nothing but lose money so far with it. Feel like  I've tried everything, and my parents and I are in tears talking about  this stuff because we just have no idea what to try or do anymore.

I  feel like I don't have a life. I have no friends that live in my area  anymore; everyone either has a family now, a career that takes all their  time, moved away, is in the military, is in jail, or is dead. The only  people I have close to me are my parents. I'm so fucking scared that  I'll be in my 30's looking back on my 20's and not having anything to  look at; no fun, no friends, no life, no career, no passions, just  blank. I'm so scared that I was hyperventilating earlier talking to my  mom about this. I'd move to try and be closer to some people I know, but  I don't have any money/income, and I don't want my parents paying for  me to live across the state while I try to figure things out. What if I  don't figure them out? I don't want them to keep paying for me and  paying for me and paying for me, it makes me feel like a fucking loser. I  hate being the rich kid whose mommy and daddy do that, nobody respects  it, I know I'm better than that.

I've  been struggling with my mental health since I was about 14, and have  been in and out of psychologists/psychiatrists ever since. Currently I'm  taking medication and seeing a therapist, but I feel like that isn't  enough. I don't know if it's the meds or if the lady I talk to isn't  what I need or if it's my life situation that keeps me trapped in this  state but I need something else, anything. I feel like the only thing  keeping me alive right now is the image of my parents screaming and  freaking out over finding my dead body, and I couldn't do that to them.  Like I said my parents and I are in tears and at our wits end with what  to do now. I feel like such a fucking idiot because I'm doing the same  shit I did in highschool: being a majorly depressed loser crying in his  room who lives at mommy and daddy's that can't seem to figure anything  out no matter how much I try.

Geez, I hate being in personal crisis mode. Been unemployed for about two months, starting my new job tomorrow, so hopefully that goes really well. 

Haven’t done much for my social life at all. Had a really good friend really lay into me recently and they are gone now. which was my fault. 
I mean, I text my friends all the time, but it just gets left on read. Then they hit me up to hang like a week later. I get busy lives but they read the message so they are obviously in an easy position to say they are busy. Which would be fine. 
I have bad anxiety since the wreck, so I keep thinking something went wrong ya know? 

And I really don’t see anyone else. Single as hell,but I do not blame anyone. I am a disaster right now, it would definitely be a risky time for a  relationship with me. 
My guitar is falling apart and literally won’t stay in tune and I’ve tried a lot to fix it. 
Computer is on it’s last leg, hard drives keep crashing and stuff like that. Which sucks, I was getting into programming maps for my favorite computer game, Half Life and also emulation of old DOS based computer systems. 

So my hobbies are also all next to impossible to do well at an acceptable level that would satisfy me. I work hard at my passions and my tools are proving a hinderance for progressing forward. I have hit the limit on them.

I’ve also have really not been eating. Which is bad, do not do that. I mean, I eat here and there. But it’s not a lot. Mainly almonds and some pan cooked fish here and there. Definitely under a good meal a day. Very little nutrients. Also drinking next to no liquid either. Definitely not any water(also not good) I just have not been feeling great. I ache and I am sore and my brain is at war. Whoa that rhymed. 
I do want to eat, but there is no appetite or drive to cook. 

Bit of a rant but probably something at least partially relatable, so thought I would share. 
Feeling really down and pretty unhinged so any advice or even just calming words would be amazingly appreciated.

TL;DR- Lost my old job, 2 month’s unemployment. Got new job. 
Lost longtime friend after fight.
Can’t get my friends to hang out with me.

I tend to keep the photos recent (in the last year or two) and make sure not to include pictures of people I'm no longer friends with since that tends to make me mourn the loss of a friendship rather than be grateful I got to experience it.

I also try to go for walks I haven't been in a while since it's a big struggle to find the motivation to go out but if there's any field type place near you where you're not likely to see anyone it's nice to just sit there I like blasting my music just sat in a field for a while I guess that might sound a lil weird I'm not sure but sometimes it helps

I'm not one for self diagnosing as it can be harmful to people with genuine health problems if people aren't doing their full research, but ever since 2020 around when the pandemic started I started becoming so less happy than I usually was, I thought it was just from quarantine and having less human interaction but more recently of last year, my mom and who I thought was going to be my step dad broke up.

&#x200B;

I found out he was a total narcissist and was mentally and physically abusive to my mom, this really set it off for me. My mom in her teens was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and depression, which further supports why I'm the way I am. For the last few years I've become worse and worse, with this year being the worst. I've been having so many what seem to be episodes, I'll be happy then sad quickly, or angry, I'll usually lash out a lot and get mad at small things. For example, its gotten really bad with my boyfriend, I've been arguing with him for no reason, and while he doesn't argue back I'll still say mean and hurtful things to him meanwhile I fully know how hurtful they are.

While I'm saying these things I'll be aware how rude it is but I feel like I can't control myself enough to stop, and once I'm calmed down ill acknowledge it and apologize, my boyfriends super understanding and caring but I feel so awful for it. Sometimes though I'll sit in bed and cry over things, I'll just burst out crying and it'll usually be about family problems or school, sometimes over nothing at all too. 

&#x200B;

Even more recently I've been starting to consistently check everything to make sure my things are there, I always have to check if my ipads on charge, did I turn my computer off, did I put my clothes away. And I'll check multiple times even after knowing everything's organized and where it should be. It affects my time even, I'll be in class, on my phone after being on it and I have to check multiple times that I closed all of my apps so my battery doesn't drain, I'll spam the home button and clear button a few times and risk genuinely getting my phone taken from being held up on it, simply making sure it's cleaned. Like this is some sort of obsession.

&#x200B;

I researched a bit about that and all I get from Google is OCD, which matches up to that I guess but I'm still not even sure, I don't understand why I have to constantly check things over and over after I already know they're done. And even more so I feel like I have DPDR, I feel like every single day is going by so fast, like nothing. It feels like I'm not even here like I'm some robot. And I'm scared I'm gonna be called an attention seeker but all I want is help. I want to stop feeling like nothing, I want to be able to feel. Which is why I'm writing this now, I felt like I was having some episode, I felt so upset a few minutes ago. I never felt like that before, it felt like nothing, I felt genuinely numb, it's scary but at the same time I feel like, idk nothing. That's all I can describe it as is feeling like nothing, like I'm floating or something, watching my life flash by like a show. 

&#x200B;

It's a bit ridiculous I feel like, saying I feel like I have depression, bipolar disorder, ocd and dpdr but idk how else to put it, there's nothing else out there that describes what's wrong with me.",1677048551.0

It's been like this for almost two years, and it's only getting worse. Joy doesn't last, but sorrow and pain are always there for me.

I've lost too much in the last three years and I have nothing to look forward to. My dreams have become obsolete and the sweetest of thoughts, which is, having a horse or a pet, is objectively an irresponsible thing to do for someone young, who can be asked to change cities any day for work reasons and whose family and friends live in a different city of her own - hence alone to look after the pet.

All my life my dream was to have my own horse to get lost in nature, and founding an alternative educational program for all ages for society to mix up and learn from each other to build healthier communities. Getting a horse is doable, but too expensive to be justifiable; founding an educational program, well, I have enough energy to barely get by in my current job. 

I will soon be on anti-depressants as I am exhausted and giving suicide a serious thought. There's no way out for me. I don't have a family home to go back to, a partner, or anything like that, I am alone and my own company is not enough; it's too painful.

I feel I am very close to the end, to not have any reason to keep going, to have too much pain to carry and very little joy to enjoy. 

For those of you who have friends and families who did kill themselves, did they ever leave a note explaining how was the last straw? What was that last thing that made them do it?",1677012835.0

I know I’m intelligent, less so since the depression, but my years of just getting through in survival mode has affected my high-school experience, and grades. Ninth grade was spent in the deepest depths of anorexia and self destruction, and depression and the eating disorder were so isolating, I missed out on so much time, so many meals out with friends or birthday parties, and the opportunity to start thriving in school. 

The first half of tenth grade was spent addressing the eating disorder, to which I am still proudly recovered of to this day. However, I missed a huge chunk of school and found it difficult to keep up with my classes, falling behind even in subjects I adored (which was most). It didn’t help when my co-morbid mental health conditions + MDD left me unable to leave home or function at the beginning of last year, in which my social life was nonexistent, and I dropped half of my classes. Finally after a long waitlist, I was able to receive treatment and work to find the right meds for me. I spent my whole summer there, which subsequently prepared me for returning junior year. 

I returned to school junior year, my anxiety quieted, and I experienced a new outlook on life. I wanted to turn things around. The first grading period I earned all A’s and B’s, joined clubs I was interested in, and made friends. Somehow I have ended up here to which I am writing this post, 1.3 GPA, not involved in clubs, never socialising outside of school. I know I’m intelligent, I know I had the potential. I wanted to become a doctor to help other people going through similar struggles, I wanted to prove the people around me wrong. But now I’m stuck and don’t know how to get out of this rut.

I actually enjoy the work - it provides me with some mental stimulation, a routine to the point where I kinda depend on it. I work in science and I really love science!

Right now for several reasons I’m feeling depressed again…mostly feeling nothing towards almost everything, not just my job. I’m overwhelmed by several things in my personal and work life, including being the target of gossip and bullying in the workplace - this has made things worse.

It just came out of nowhere, although I assume it was probably out of stress from other things. My whole body hurts. The reason it’s this way is because off all the things weighing down on me.

My dream to make it in the film industry and one day be a director. Currently, I’m trying to make a short film, but I had no equipment before so I spent some money to get a new camera and lenses, but I still need other stuff too. One of my actors is leaving in April and I told him i would make this film so I’m on a deadline to finish it, but I’m scared I won’t be able to do it in time. I’ve also been watching a lot of Hong Kong action movies and used to think about them obsessively (my film is a homage to these) and now I’ve started to get sick of them.

Simultaneously I want to leave my city as there’s nothing here for me but I also need to complete this film as I’d promised those helping me out I would. I’m afraid I might end up dead from a heart attack or stroke the way things keep going or end up losing my mind and killing myself. 

I still live with my parents and they are constantly giving me shit, nagging me, and putting me down. It’s not helping and only making me more worried. I’ve been getting into more and more fights with them, saying worse and worse things (although they are the ones who always instigate it). I have never had a good relationship with them, and they’ve always acted like this to me since I was small, and I started retaliating in response.

Most of the stuff they complain about is me spending money, but I won’t be able to pursue film successfully if I don’t practice or even have equipment. 

I’m also still a virgin, never had a gf, and like I said don’t have my own place yet.

context: i was diagnosed with clinical depression, i am on medication therapy and that has helped me so much. i might not feel fully good (not sure if that is even possible) but i don’t want to not exist, i see some joys in this life. sadly i can’t afford also psychotherapy which could help me more deal with also my traumas that i haven’t dealt with because of my detachment from emotions.

I really know that all of this was fictional. I really do. Stuff like that happened to me when I was a child and crushed on Hermoine or Kim Possible but never as an adult.

It's not like I would ditch her if I had the chance or so. She really means a fucking lot to me. My girlfriend doesn't know the full extent of it, but she told me even if this would be the case it would be okay, since she has a character she is crushing on too. She even told me that she thinks me crying in titanic was the manliest thing she ever saw. No joke. But back to topic.

I have been depressed for years now and I am only 20 (diagnosed for much of the time, as well as with anxiety and ptsd) 
So much awful stuff and tragedies in my life has happened to make me this way that its not even worth going through.

The last few months especially have been hell, to the point where I am going back to the doctors as my spirals and my explosions and outbursts on my loved ones are making me think maybe it’s something else at this point - in short I just can’t go on like this really

I am trying to get help from the doctors but I have called 35 times to t primary care mental health team to make an appointment from my referral letter, but no luck. I have an appointment with the disability/mental health ppl in uni but not for another week and I booked it a while ago.

Everything is just too much for me now and it seems to be that I’ll never be able to get help for it as even when (and if) I manage to get an appointment it will be half an hour and then months before another appointment likely - anyone from the UK can confirm that it is HELL trying to get help here unless you’re very old very young or actually dying 


I’m not sure if I am even making sense at this point, it just seems like there is no way out of this and no help readily available . I am on medication and I text the Samaritans to try and pull me out of spirals before I destroy my relationships forever but it’s all just too much for me now. I don’t know what to do.

On November 10th through 12th, I had a traumatic and dehumanizing hospital experience, where I was held down and threatened to be restrained for trying to get off the gurney in a panic. Then forced to be locked in a big room, in scrubs with several actively violent people and security everywhere. 

Two weeks after getting out of that prison, I watched my father die after being taken off a ventilator and declining in what we believe was a brain-dead state.

I can not see the color of the scrubs I wore, I can't hear of things being taken away from people, can't hear about the ""rights"" people have in this country, I can't just sleep in peace without thinking about the ""hospital"" and what happened there. 
I can't go a day without thinking of my dad drinking himself to death over years and seeing his lifeless face staring at nothing. 

Why does being put in a hospital for my ""safety"" and ""help"" have to be so fucking disgusting?
I was laying down yesterday in an attempt to calm down from the shaking, and sleep it off, but seconds later I was on that damned fucking gurney, with my arms pinned down, and the judgment in everyone's face seeing this insane person with no rights. It felt like the doctor in the room was smiling at me, at the idea that she had complete control over what happens to me. I completely forgot I was here, in my house, in my room, on my bed. 

I can't stop these thoughts. I don't know how, my medication isn't doing shit, I am shaking just sitting here with my cat who I love more than anything laying on my shoulder. Sometimes it feels like I endanger her and her sisters because I get jumpy and angry when I'm like this.

661,A Quarter Century On SSRIs,1,1173h6u,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/1173h6u/a_quarter_century_on_ssris/,1,"

I had severe episodes of depression, anxiety, and insomnia starting at age 5. In 1990 they said it meant simply that I was overly sensitive due to being so ahead intellectually for my age. Looking back, I was already experiencing bipolar cycling, but only ever had very brief manic periods which usually had to do with me already being very attracted to girls and women. At 13 my Dad recognized my degree of disproportionate despair and had his doctor buddy put me on the SSRI Prozac. I should’ve instead gone to a psychiatrist weekly and probably gotten some sedatives to take no more than once every few weeks when things got overwhelming. Instead, the Prozac made me feel super stoned and happy for two days. Fast forward 25 years… I’m stable and doing well, but since my brain literally grew up neurologically relying on various SSRI’s I kept being fed and taking since I trusted my Dad, I can never get off them. The first time I tried tapering off Paxil at age 16 because I wanted to see if I’d improved, I had a fainting panic attack the day after I stopped. Then came the nervous breakdown hitting me like a truck. I’ve tried tapering off them a dozen times. Each time I have the same nervous breakdown. I vomit from anxiety, cry in sadness over nothing, my skin crawls inside and out with anxiety, my heart races. I’m moving at a million miles an hour in my mind, but too tired to get out of bed for a week, I have no appetite, no sex drive, and I’m agoraphobic. Then… 3-5 days after I get back on any high-medium dose of an SSRI - be it Luvox, Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, or whatever they’re pushing now that those Oder ones are all generic, I feel fine. I figure I’m okay after a quarter century of taking them without raising my doses and such an obvious physical need, but I fear that they could stop working eventually. Or if we have another pandemic and the supply chain just disappears. If I ever can’t get them, I will be permanently sick to the point of needing a caregiver and not functioning at all.",1676889262.0

I am unmotivated and can't be bothered doing a lot and feel a bit miserable about the future, but that seems pretty normal when you're exhausted and lots of things hurt and you're unable to do the things you want or achieve your goals.

I am 25+(m) and I have been suffering from depression and anxiety for the last 10+ years.

I have had an alcoholic father and he used to physically and mentally hurt my mom, me and me Lil brother. I have a pretty good memory and as far as I remember i only remember suffering. I often dont remember any happy memories growing up. The only thing I always remember is my mom's struggle for making sure that me and my brother had everything that we needed. I gained maturity pretty early and I understood my mom's struggle. I never asked my mom for anything in my life except for some financial help when I started working and started living on my own.

My mom got divorced to the horrible devil of a person and remarried to this wonderful man. He has been supportive to mom in every way possible. I am happy that my mom found someone so wonderful. Good things do happen to good ppl.

Ever since my mom seperated from my birth father (it was like 7 years before getting a divorce), I felt the sense of responsibility. I had to be the man of the house and had to atleast try to support and keep togather my family or what was left of it. The reason I called my birth father a devil is cuz not only he had tortured us but also used to emotionally manipulate his side of family (my uncle, aunt cousins, etc). He used to tell nonsense things to them about my mom and guess what, they actually supported him instead of realising what a horrible person he has been.

Coming to the current situation, a few months ago I started liking this girl. I usually am not that interested in dating. Yes, there are often times when I feel lonely. But I have a very particular preference when it comes to women. They don't need to be good looking or like the stereotypes that the society has set for women. She just needs to have a pure heart. 

From the life experience i have so far, i am a pretty good judge of character. The girl that I like is like the complete opposite of me. I am usually gloomy, i overthink everything, i don't show my emotions to anyone. I put on a tough mask to pretend that I am strong even i am feeling low. I am the kind of person who never cries. She is cheerful, always seem happy, she realises when I am feeling low and cheers me on. Whenever I am with her I feel the happiness that I have never felt before. Whenever I am down or feeling low, one thought of her and i start feeling better.

She is the type of girl I might be waiting for. But sometimes I have this feeling that am i the right person for her. I don't know if i can keep her happy. To make things worse, there was this guy who had asked her out a few months ago. To be honest, they were pretty close, he was good looking, and didn't have habits (i started smoking as a getaway from depression) like me. I feel like if anyone had any chances of going out with her was him. She rejected him. Compared to him i am basically nobody. I am not good looking, am usually uninteresting, and have developed some habits which are not appealing to anyone. I try to impress her often times and try to get close to her. But i got to know from some of our common friends recently that she's not the kind of person who will date anyone. To be honest even i have realised this while we spend time togather. But i don't want to live my life in regret that I found someone and i let her go without trying. I know that if I ask her out the answer will most probably be no. I won't be able to bear the regection. I am not dumb to end my lif but i might fall deeper into depression.

Now the situation is getting worse. As I said previously, my birth father poisons everyone's mind with nonsense, his latest victim is my little brother. Since I am currently working in a different city i don't know what exactly he is saying to my brother but i know that he is not behaving properly towards my mom and my step dad. Whatever was left of my family is slowly crumbling away. Now when I thing about asking my crush out or even try to, i am bombarded with these thoughts that what if. What if i cannot make her happy? What i i unknowingly hurt her instead? With my family crumbling, how can I think of being someone to her? 

I have even thought of getting over her and have tried to push her away. But the more i try to push her away, the more she comes closer. This is just how she is and not like she's attracted to me.

I recently started getting consultations for my depression. I usually don't share about my depression to anyone. Even some of my closest and longest friends got to know about this recently.

I have realised that I am getting hurt emotionally bu the delimma and might even hurt her sometime. To avoid this i have made a decision that I will tell her how I feel about her this week. I know the answer will be a no but i will tell her that I don't need an answer from her. Hopefully this way I won't hurt her. I won't live in another regret for the rest of my life. Yes I will be hurt for a while but hopefully I won't turn back to the stone of a person I was before. Hopefully the consultations help me.

If anyone thinks that I am not doing the right thing please tell me so.
Again I am not the kind of person who will end my lyf.",1676836835.0

I spend too much time in my room. I can't seem to care about anything. I take the smallest interaction and run with it,  creating the narrative that everyone hates me, making it easier to push them away with anger. I can't keep doing this. 
Recently, I cannot seem to stop thinking about how I was raised and how it shaped me. I cry at every confrontation, and my emotions feel fake. My mother was convinced that I was a manipulative, attention seeking child. Every time I cried, she claimed it was fake. Any time my father did something nice for me, I must have manipulated him into doing so. I grew up thinking I was the worst child.

Our background:
Me and my friend are both 24 went to the same middle school and live in Poland. We both are pretty competetive when it comes to life. Both dream of home ownership, good job and working relationship but we chose different paths in life. I got my engineering degree and recently landed a great job as a programmer. He on the other hand is stuck in low paying job since high school. 

His life:
I would say he lives a pretty good life. Because he lives with parents even with a low paying job he is able to afford most thinks he likes like a console or a drone, have enought money to go concert or holidays with us so he's never left behind. 

His problem:
He feels like he is falling behind in life. He have only high school diploma, no girlfriend and no savings to buy a hause. Getting these things is very important to him, he once got in a serious figth with our other friend for taking life ""too lightly"". He's on constant lookout for new side hustes, he tried many but none of them generated money so far, during our every meeting we talk about his new App idea or something simillar. 

Alcoholism: 
He recently started consuming more alcohol. He's drinking alone. He's getting wasted alone. His side hustles are all he is talking about while drunk.

Why I feel hopeless:
I feel like im in position where he wanted to be.  Thats why reaching out to him is hard I know he doesnt want my pity. He went to therapy founded by his employeer but stopped after all 5 free sessions saying it wasnt helping him in anyway.

I'll cut to the chase, then I'll share more info afterward.

&#x200B;

**The Advice**: When I get upset, stressed out, down, or whatever, I've learned to talk to myself. I didn't have parental figures myself, but this is a skill that every child should be taught regardless because you never know when you'll end up alone in life. It's so crucial for learning to accept and love yourself. I literally speak to myself, out loud, like it's a full conversation. It's not just comforting, it's talking through problems and helping me digest information and confront/close those obsessive thought cycles, at least temporarily. It's helped me a lot especially since I still don't have many regulars in my life.

Also, I sing and talk to myself constantly. I live alone, so this really helps me stay cheerful and take things less seriously. And I don't know what your diagnoses are, but for me, anxiety medication helped me so much more than antidepressants ever could. I'll explain more below, so you can compare to your condition.

&#x200B;

**Background**: I've been diagnosed with chronic depression, general anxiety, and pretty severe OCD. First of all, I've been depressed for a very long time. I'm only 22, but I've had these same symptoms since age 8ish. Last year, I was on the SSRI sertraline. Worst thing that could have ever happened to me. It caused serious fissures in my relationships that I'll never repair fully. I tried to commit suicide so many times, five or so of them were dangerously close. I went to the psych ward for nearly a week, which in my area, was very unsafe and distressing.

For 8 months, those antidepressants had my life in the trenches. Now, I'm on a medication not currently approved specifically for OCD and anxiety, but it's helped me *tremendously*. Guanfacine, it's used in ADHD patients from what I understand. Do some research and discuss with your med manager if you have similar problems to me, but don't take my word for it totally. Since I started 3 months ago, these have been the most stable, productive, enjoyable 3 months of my life.

One month into this new medication, I tried psilocybin. A little under 2g, in a lemon tek tea. Not enough for me to trip, due to my height and metabolism and all that, but enough to leave some positive effects which further pushed me onto the right track. Again, do your research properly before you take a risk like this. Make sure you take it seriously and follow all the precautions, and source responsibly. Starting with a microdose (<0.3g in lemon tek tea) is also pretty important I feel.

But yeah, 3 months so far. I think it's \~6 you have to go until you officially aren't considered depressed? I hope to be able to keep this momentum.

I can't imagine how you even begin to justify this in your head 
Especially after everything I did for you
I spent so much of my time and energy just trying to build you up, to be patient with and understanding of you 
But you refused to talk to me when you had issues 
You sat laid back silently while I sobbed in bed next to you cause you wouldn't tell me what was wrong or what you were thinking 
When I came to you and told you I thought I might be autistic you shut me down immediately 
You were the first person I told that when if been thinking it for years and I barley got the words out before you just shut me down entirely (fyi I got diagnosis, im fucking autistic) 
And finally you went behind my back when I came to you about how everyone, all of my friends, the people I considered family were flat out ignoring me when I was asking for help over and over 

I don't know how things ended up this way but please just talk to me 
Let us come to an understanding 
End this before I end myself 
Cause frankly I don't know how much longer I have at this point 
I've been on several different meds and none of them have helped 
Therapy is barley working 
The fucking suicide hotline is always backed up and puts me on hold 
The hospital staff makes me feel like a waste of their time when I go there 
I have nothing left 
No one left .

This realization came about when I was invited to go out to events and have what should be fun with friends. Before the events happen conversations happen as they do and I feel as if nothing I say is charitable to the people I'm having conversations with anymore. This used to never be a problem as I used to be unbearably sociable a ""fun annoying"", talking to cashier's about trivial questions, asking strangers for help if I really could not be of help to myself, talking to new people, making new friends, and conversations on a bus which absolutely no one seems interested in having with me, but I was enjoying myself in life and I was happier that way and now I can't seem to do anything because I simply can't feel. 

I feel that I have lost that ""social butterfly"" personality as now the things that I am currently doing or say are the complete opposite way of what I used to do. Now my days are just full of conversations that I cannot contribute anything to, I've become increasingly more antisocial over the past four years, and I don't feel the emotions in situations or conversation like I use to. I fear that I'm losing myself as a person. 

I'm boring and can't bring myself to feel the weight of conversations anymore whether the topic is a downer or an uplifting conversation. I have been trying to teach myself to become more ""sensitive"" to help with the numb emotions problem but it has not worked. It's strange trying to teach myself when the only thing on my mind is that these are things that I once I knew but are COMPLETELY numb to me now.

I have become a boring antisocial and I want back my social life and emotions, but I am very lost. I can't even feel the motivation to want something anymore.

I watched a phenomenal TV show which I adored but it makes me sad, not that the show will end soon but rather that I just feel weird about it. I think the problem is that I know that the real world won‘t be as interisting, magical and whole hearted as the show.
That kept me thinking that maybe my life is irrelevant, (don’t worrie I am smart enought that all life is a present,so I won‘t kill myself) I mean there are only few people that changed the world really and so many who tried to do it but failed.

Back in 2012, my father, a 32 veteran of the United States Air Force, killed himself, leaving behind me and my sister! Because he killed himself, his entire life insurance was taken from us, and we got nothing! Then, a year later, almost to the day, my brother-in-law, my sisters husband and father of her 2 kids, killed himself, in exactly the same way as our father did just to mess with my sisters head! This all sent me into a deep depression in which i started to use drugs. Big mistake! It wasnt long before I lost EVERYTHING! My job, my car, my house, I even lost my teeth. Well, in May of 2020, I got clean once and for all, thanks in large part to my wife! I was just starting to deal with the loss of my father and brother-in-law in the right way, and out of no where - BAM! September of 2022, my wife is murdered by some psycho that said that he just woke up and felt like killing somebody! The police keep telling me that she was just at the wrong place at the wrong time! I'm so sick of hearing that! My wife was EVERYTHING to me! I used to pry to God every single night to please let me be the one to die first because I didn't know how I'd react if something were to ever happen to her! It was my 1 and only job to make sure thaT SHE WAS SAFE AND I FAILED! I dont even know how to live without her! I can barely breathe! I went in to make an appointment with a therapist and they said they had nothing available for 3 1/2 weeks! Are u kidding me? I dont even think I can make it that long! But my wife's dog, who happened to be with me that fatal night, is with me, and she's all I got, and I'm all she's got now,so I cant just kill myself and do that to the dog! I love her to much! So somehow, some way, I keep on moving forward, living. I dont know how, God has to be carrying me right now because I mean it when I say that I can litterally barely feel my feet!

All I know is that I am completely lost. All my plans, all my wishes, and all my dreams have been taken from me, and I'm forced to wake up every day for the rest of my life where my absolute worst nightmare has become my reality! That really sucks! Please somebody help me!",1676673097.0

After the separation, I began seeing a psychiatrist. I’ve seen several therapists over the years, searching for answers to my anguish, but I was never tested and diagnosed until October 2022.  Diagnosed with OCPD, anxiety, and mild depression. Everything I’m been struggling with now makes sense. I continue to have my therapy sessions and I read as much as I can on the diagnoses.

My problem is how to repair my marriage that I am partly responsible for due to the things I didn’t even know I was struggling with.

Background: Christian upbringing left no room to consider depression ever. Only child, older parents. Cheated on in previous relationships, affected self esteem. Father became ill during mid-twenties and had to juggle trying to live normally with helping mom care for him. Self soothed through work which led to poor diet that led to weight gain. Felt insecure while eating spouse and affected sex life. He cheated months after getting engaged. Dad died less than 2 months before wedding. Miscarriage in 2019. He cheated again. Miscarriage in 2020.

His cheating is his fault and I know it was brought on by the distance my anxiety and depression created within our relationship. I can forgive knowing he didn’t understand and didn’t have tools to be supportive of an unnamed issue.

How do I come out of this now that I know what I’ve been dealing with since at least 2008, but only recently diagnosed??",1676660292.0

I had difficult childhood with an abusive father. I decided I have to work hard and get myself to a happy place. I spent 5 years in high school preparing rigorously for a competitive exam - No sports no social life 10Hrs a day studying and scored 99.5 Percentile (Asian). Got into a good college and joined mechanical engineering. This was the first time in my life I had some freedom and did enjoy a little bit, but not too much. I would spend at least 5Hrs a day working on projects other than coursework to build a good profile, But then COVID happened end of junior year. All the work I was doing got halted and projects that were on track to be research papers got ended. It was very hard senior year looking for a job in a competitive industry with oversupply of engineers. I anyway ended up in a startup worked 70Hr weeks trying to get myself ahead to get to a level my college friends who belonged to CS streams. But then even after  months of this company wasn't paying me full salary and trying to force me into a long term contract. With no plan ahead I resigned and later joined a big established company in R&D. Even though I only get paid less than half of what my peers in other streams are getting I convinced myself that it will be worth it because the work will meaningful. The company work culture was amazing but it was so repetitive and mind numbing every day there was miserable.  
After a year, I finally hit a breaking point, and quit came home to take a break.   
When I look back all I see is pain and misery and nothing to show for it. No happy at family to support , No deep friends because I always prioritized career over friendships. No girlfriend to sit with me while I cry.

I turned 49 as of Feb 2nd and have been depressed and suicidal for as long as I can remember.  I think my first ""attempt"" was holding my breath at age 10 hoping that i'd die but not really understanding what that meant... just a kid who knew that I was unbearably sad and that I hated my young life.  Home life was not great.  My parents split at age 6, which devastated me as I was a daddy's girl.  He ""went to the store"" one day and never returned.  I have 1 older brother, and we were both shattered.  My mother took it the hardest understandably, and was largely unavailable to us even though we were all under the same roof.  She also suffered from major depression and was confined to her room, in  bed with the door shut for most of my early childhood.  No hugs, no kisses, no ""i love you's"", no dinner most nights because we were so poor,  no field trips or gifts ... nothing but the occasional physical abuse if I got on her nerves for any reason....(afterall, you know how 6 year olds can be right?)... That cold dark life can be pretty tough on any child, much less a little black girl growing up in predominantly non black suburbia in the early 80's.*-(not harping on race at all, just painting a picture)*  My brother and I used to stay outside for hours and hours exploring nature, and those times became our safe haven for years... Creeks and brooks, woods and fields... it was all our playground.  

Fast forward to now... I lost my brother in September of last year.  I took care of him and his affairs until he took his last breath in my and momma's arms,  and arrangements after he died.  That was the hardest thing I have ever had to do.  I never knew what pain from death of a loved one was until this happened.  Anyway... I was also on leave from my job of 9 years at the time of his death.    In November 2021, I had a particularly tough depressive episode that landed me on indefinite medical leave from my insanely stressful corporate job 1 month before he took ill.  I had never been on any type of medical leave for mental illness before, as I had never been formally evaluated or diagnosed until now.  I was diagnosed with MDD, PTSD, and GAD and have been out of work for over a year.   My employer wants to terminate or force me to take a demotion.  NO!  I worked too hard to get a seat at the table.... I am a Lead Escalations and Coaching Specialist.  Meaning... I am tasked to fix whatsoever is broken on all levels of the company.  STRESS STRESS STRESS

***I want to preface by saying that I am grateful that I have a job that provides a benefit for Short Term Disability and now Long Term Disability, and I am TRULY blessed to have it*** but.... make no mistake... corporate America does not like mental illness.    They want me out of my current role and demoted back to an entry level incoming phone rep role because I am now a liability and that hellacious customer service phone rep role is the quickest way to get rid of me.   

I am internally conflicted about leaving -  I know the job is not good for me, and it will trigger my condition.   In fact, I have been debating not returning for a whole year .. and sometimes I am 100% positive this job is toxic and I am better off out the door.... but then I punk out again and want to return to fight for what is mine.    I think about how I worked my ass off to get there and how I  really need the benefits and money so that I can continue to take care of myself and others who need me..... currently, I have been receiving partial salary on LTD (66% of salary) ...  not nearly enough for my monthly bills, and honestly I have completely decimated my savings this past year bridging the gaps.    

I am no genius, but I am not an idiot either.  The tactics HR use are by design,  meant to intimidate and are borderline illegal.  They've called and emailed repeatedly with threats of termination.   Phone calls are disingenuous, fake surface greetings and small talk that quickly change into thinly veiled ominous verbiage suggesting that I will be unable to handle my job because it has *""changed so much since you have been gone""*...or *""hey, remember that even if you leave don't forget you have approved Long Term Disability and that's something, right?""* with a repulsive sounding smile in their voice......(*No bitch, it's crumbs)*   To add to the confusion, about 2 months ago, they tried to force me to return before I was ready and my doctors shut it down by reminding them that I was protected by the ADA.   However, now that I am being pushed to come back and am actually contemplating it, I get the ""you won't be able to handle it"" bs.  Which is probably true y'all but honestly I am scared to let them go.  

Tonight, I spoke to my manager directly for the first time in months, and she told me in no uncertain terms that *""she would be very worried for my health if I came back because the job is so much more stressful than it was before and I couldn't even handle it then""..*.. **OUCH!!!!**   .   Y'all I don't want to be destitute.  I can't just allow them to win.... (sorry if that sounds shallow)  Consider too that the benefits and pay this company offer are fast disappearing from the workplace landscape.  The economy is shit and corporate jobs that have these kinds of perks are all but gone.   My anxious mind tells me that I would be a fool to let it go.  I also feel so ashamed that I have mental illness to begin with.  Why can't I just be normal like the rest of my peers?  Why do I have to be this way?  I am feeling pretty low tonight, hence the rant.  I know my post is all over the place... im literally purging so as to relieve some of the mental pressure that is building.   You guys don't have to respond... just wanted to get this off my chest.

I(20M) never had much of a social life and it went away completely after I switched to home schooling sophomore year of highschool cause bullying and outside stress made me nearly commit suicide with a shotgun at 15 and now I'm still trying to play catch up and fix all my issues with nothing but difficulty and seemingly no positive change most recent example is I lost 100lbs. In the hopes of helping my back pain and to maybe feel less insecure about my appearance but it didn't help anything my back still hurts just as much if not more and physically I may be less round and heavy but it's been replaced with being saggy and wrinkles that look just as bad. All I feel like I do is wait, fail, or nothing happens no matter how much effort I put in to the point that I just feel like nothing gonna happen like I feel in disbelief anything I do will actually work out for example getting my GED yes I'm getting it but nothing will change after that there is still no job where I live that isn't a high stress physical labor work environment which I can't work because of my back pain and mental health. Then there's socially as I said it wasn't good in school and got way more negative experiences than positive then after I left it basically died except for my online group but that has basically died except for maybe 1 consistent friend and 2 spottier ones I hang out with but that's it that's the extent of my social circle not counting the 2 family members I got and there's no way to improve it because I live in a dying Midwest sundown town that has nothing to do except bars or slots. Finally there my non existent love and sex life I've never been in  a real relationship I've technically dated 4 people but it was always long distance and nothing ever lasted a week and ended once by me being dumped cause he was a friend experimenting, the others ghosted me and the last one was 5 years ago and then anything physical just seems like fantasy to me if not because I'm insecure about my body almost completely with loose skin, eczema all over my body except for my face, I am still fat, because I'm fat and my penis is average plus I'm a grower it makes it look like I have a micro dick when I'm flaccid, and all of that mixed with being average looks and no job, no car, no public transportation, zero income, poor mental health, and living with my mother still why would anyone ever be attracted to me and honestly idk if I even have a type or standards anymore simply because it seems impossible that some oned want me. I wish I could just not always be envious and frustrated and feeling like I'm trying and doing everything ""right"" but it doesn't change anything and it working out for others just infuriates me and I know it shouldn't and that I'm not entitled to anything but I can't help but feel like why can't that me for once and what am I doing wrong or what's wrong with me and it's almost on loop cause the things I want are every where and a basic part and natural mile stone of life most people have done or figured out by 15 to 17 but it only seems almost like a daydream to me.

I'm 19 M, and I've been feeling different for a couple of 
years now. I have been feeling alone for a while, but when I am with friends, I would feel fine for a couple of days before I went back to how I was before. Then last year I met a girl that I really had feelings for and she was my first girlfriend, and I felt like I had found myself, and then a month before I left for college (June 2022) she broke up with me, and it felt like she took that person that I found with her. The past 6 months have been rough, and I see myself not feeling anything anymore, like I am in a constant mood of just nothing. 2 months of this went by since I started college, and I found a friend, who I could be myself with, and since she was in a relationship already It felt like I could be myself, and not put on a fake smile for someone that I thought that I had to impress to get them to stay. Fast forward to today, we talk to about a lot of stuff with each other, and we have a lot of trust for each other, and she and her ex broke up recently, and we have been spending more time together, and I can't help, but feel like I am starting like her because I think I am noticing myself getting a bit jealous when she talks about other guys that she has become friends with. This leaves me feeling bad about how unattractive I am, how poor personality is, and basically every negative thing about myself that I can think of.

was great because I didn't have to be the one to say it was over and deal with it being my fault by the 20 somthing of July I had a message from a lady friend of ours asking why she had been blocked by j and we started speaking and decided to meet up so I met up with (c) and well we got on very well and we started a relationship c was still currently married and was trying to go threw a devorce within about a month we found out that she was pregnant I really did love c at this point and I felt that I was so in love with her cause I got the same love back and that wasn't something I had felt in my previous relationship so anything she'd ask me to do Id do it I wasn't messing that up having somone that actually loved me and didn't constantly make arguments up but c was at that point speaking to j and was trying to make me see my kids and any time I'd seen j she would argue with me saying I cheated and how I wanted to be with c the hole time I was with her and just arguments so I was reluctant to go see my daughter I love her more than anything but I just cannot stand j so I thought it was just best I Wasing in my daughters life as anytime I was j would be trying to argue with me infront of her about a week before my son was born c had decided to tell j that she was pregnant in my opinion was uncalled for as she should have atleast waited till some time after he was born I had been told my c to go see my son when he was born and from then on it got a bit weird with c as I was being told to go see my kids but then getting jellous that I was seeing them and being ""a happy family"" and then I then also had j having a go at me cause I'd have to leave and be told you don't care about ur kids go run off to ur slag at this point I just really couldn't care wat jenny would say I just didn't want to see the kids and then that caused problems for me and c cause j would get in her head how is he meant to be a dad to ur baby when he can't be a dad to the 2 he already has and in my head it was simple I'd be a dad to my baby with c cause I wouldn't be constantly shouted at and made to feel like shit I was happy to just continue my life as a happy family not having arguments every day in front of the kids so this seeing th kids went on for a while and arguments happend between me a c about it and she decided to leave me and told me she didn't was to hurt me and

out she might have placenta privia and from that she had decided she had it and that we couldn't have sex ye that's fine we had it just about every time we was together but it was OK no to have sex I didn't feel it was the only thing keeping us together but we had gone to bed and I was waathinng netflix and she was lying on her side gone to sleep I'd guessed a little while later she had started rubbing up against me with her hips and we ended up having sex she didn't say anything at the time or say no we can or we shouldn't have done that with the placenta privia thing but I'd gone home back to my parents And then went to see her the next night and got told that we wasn't together and that I'd apparently raped her she said she was sleeping and I'd said that she had been rubbing up against me and that I thought she had initiated the hole sex thing and that I was fine with not having sex cauae that was what we decided when getting told she could have placenta privia I then got blocked and wasn't able to speak to her and I'd been seeking to j again and she had said that she wanted to go see her dad 100 miles away and I said OK due to her dad's health condition on Christmas day j

I tried many things in those 7 years but never found enough motivation to get anything going to point that I'd not think about going back to a software job. Since I can't find any job, I went back to school for a Master's program in basically the same degree I did 20 years ago. My mother is pressuring me to finish this degree even though I don't think it's going to get me back to a job. If you asked me to have purpose, I wanted to make software that would help hospital patients but I don't know how to get started. The classwork sucks the life out of me and at the end of each day I am so tired I don't even have time or willpower to think about or work on the project. I want to stop the school altogether but I am afraid I will go into depression again if I stop.

If anyone has a story or some wisdom I would really want to hear it right now. I just feel so miserable.  I tried confiding in a friend, she replied in contempt and took the other person's side.  My mother called me a humiliation to the family.  My boyfriend told me I'm a failure at one point.

I suppose anyone who comes here is.

For a long time now, I have just seen myself as a boring person. Someone who, when they open their mouth, asks the most boring questions or makes the most boring statements. Someone who is incapable of making people laugh or forming new, deeper connecting friendships. This, as you can well imagine, means that I often struggle with speaking to people through fear of judgement. I have some past experiences of people outright making me feel or even stating that I was being boring and weird when I was speaking. Many of these occurred in my late teens, but still ring through to me as a 31 year old.

I constantly bounce backwards and forwards on this issue. I'm trying to develop hobbies, my mind, my body and a side hustle as well as balancing a full time job and 3 children. Even so, I still feel like I shouldn't speak. Whenever I do get involved in social interactions, I am so in my own head about what to say next. Matters of the mind baffle me, as it is all well and good to know the answers and what you should do *(open ended questions, FORD, HEFE, be interested to be interesting, conversational humor, genuine interest and smiles, shoulders back and open body language etc.*) but to actually change your belief so that all of this isn't drowned out by the loud voice that says ""*no, you're boring. Don't say that it's not funny. No-one cares. Shut the fuck up*"" feels wholesomely impossible.

I understand that, sometimes, what I say will be interesting and funny. Other times, I will not. This happens to literally everyone. But a single setback or negative experience cuts really deep. Any self worth I had built through multiple positive interactions get instantly blown out. This is totally exhausting. To keep doing this back and forth. To keep reading books and articles and reddit and trying to engage with strangers and my family and make new friends. It's total overwhelm. 

It's such an impractical way to look at the situation, but when asking people what to say, they give you a concept but not something to actually say. I have no idea how people develop these skills to adapt and say the correct things with each to form that friendship or relationship. Don't point out that I knew at some point how to do it because I have a wife. It's like waking up from a coma; I lost the ability to understand and perform.

I want to be able to talk for hours or be in comfortable silence. I want to show empathy when it matters and similarly be funny to entertain people or lift their spirits. I equate silence to failure, as I cannot think of something to say the majority of the time, even though I wish to know about people and form a deep connection with them.

The frustration of not being able to find the answers is turning to anger. Anger is turning to hopelessness. Hopelessness and the chest pain and shortness of breath that brings makes me want to kill myself. The fact someone can see this desperate search all over my comment and post history makes me feel ashamed. But I don't care anymore. I need to find answers or meet my maker. Nothing else matters to me anymore.",1676564311.0

My memory was going blank during the exam. I've had depression from a very long time, but this was a very serious consequence of it. Academics was something I thought I could count on as a constant, but that was failing.

I am also very skinny. I have incorporated (relatively) more protein in my food. As for exercise, it makes me miserable. I've had a bad experience with bullying and sports in my childhood. I told my symptoms to the GP, said I needed a blood test. There were a range of tests, and out of all of them, I was deficient in B12. I was 'happy,' in a wicked sense of the word. There was actually something to 'blame.' I have been prescribed a mega-dose of 1000 mcg B12 once a day.

I know that it isn't a magic bullet that will solve all my problems. I will have to put some effort in. But I want to know what problems will it solve, effortlessly? For one thing, I don't feel tired that much now, though it has been only a week since I started taking it. 

Also, how long after do the positive effects start appearing? And how can I make use of them?

I will list symptoms that I have

1. Easily distracted
2. Loss of interest
3. Muscle wasting (B12 deficiency has 'muscle weakness' listed as its symptoms, is it anyway related?)
4. Hair loss
5. Slowness of thinking
6. Slow/no memory recall

Will it partly/completely cure these? Again, it's not a magic bullet, but some physiological improvements might make life slightly better.

Hello, first off I want to say thank you for taking the time to read this and for any replies on this. 

My name is Gavin, I am a Teenage male suffering from depression, anxiety, and ptsd. 

My story starts two years ago when I met my first real “girlfriend” I was the happiest I’d have ever been and didn’t think anything would go wrong. During our relationship it went fairly good with little to no arguments or fights in the first few months, progressively after our 4 month mark the relationship got worse and worse, becoming more corrupt. I started to get abused mentally and physically by this women but couldn’t bring myself to tell anyone or leave the relationship. There where many days she would tell me to kill my self or days she would threaten to hurt me if I didn’t have sex with her or do something she wanted. This went on for about three months and on my bday she broke up with me. This hurt me in a way I’ve never been hurt, I have never been through break up before this and it was all new to me. I later found out that during our relationship she was cheating on me as well as using me for my money. (Total amount estimate was around 15k during our 8 month relationship). This made me really depressed and I felt like I wasn’t good enough for anyone. About a month later she told people I was close with and people from my campus that I had raped her and sexually assaulted her but the truth is that it was the opposite I had been used and abused sexually under my will. And her telling people that made me loose friends and almost had me kicked off of campus. 

Fast forward to now I’m writing this while crying, wondering what to do next. I am still depressed and have anxiety. I’m here for anyone that needs to talk about themselves or wants to talk about my life.

I need mental help from something that happened to me a couple months back.

I have created this account specifically to get help. I do see a therapist, but I haven’t really made a connection yet so I might have to look for another. However I figured reddits anonymous factor will be a good thing for me and my anxiety. I don’t have a car yet to increase my options for therapy easily.

I think I’ll be able to open up more and hopefully get help because I truly need it. Im truly broken and traumatized from this. I just can’t take it anymore I hurt all the time from it. 

My parents don’t know everything I’m about to tell you. I don’t feel comfortable telling them for many reasons. It’s really messed me up my self esteem.

So here goes my fellow redditors, please bare with me…. 

I live in a small college town, I go to the college here so I don’t have to pay for a dorm like out of staters. I’m lucky to be able to save some money by living at my parents. I’m grateful for that especially during times like this when everything is expensive. 

I (21m) thought I had finally met the love of my life (23f) we “hit things off” right away. Meaning we definitely shared some spectacular moments nothing sexual or anything yet. Sex doesn’t really matter to me in the sense of it’s not all I’m looking for in relationship. I look for what’s on the inside than outside (I’m sure you guys know what I mean). Although she certainly is attractive, next level pretty actually. I was constantly worried about other guys hitting on her (and yes some would, and some made comments about her ass around me). She was everything to me… 

My brother (23m) goes to the same college. Unlike me he is in the “national guard” as an MP so he doesn’t pay much for tuition. Him and i constantly get into arguments and fights. Are parents aren’t fond of it but since we are adults now they don’t do much. He is home going to college although that could change any moment since he is on call. 

One day though when it was just him and I at the house things got out of hand. For some reason he wanted me to “leave the house and leave him alone for awhile”. He was making comments about my girlfriend looks since she’s so attractive and how “they were meant to be together and should be”. I tried to get him to stop as I could feel my blood begin to boil, but he didn’t… I went to take a swing and he punched me right in the gut then kneed me in the groin. I went straight down to the floor. The door bell ran and my brother literally sprinted from my room but he just as quick as he sprinted out he was back in. He hogtied me, and put tape over my mouth. And through me under the bed. I did not expect what would happen next would ever really happen. I kinda thought this was just his way of calming me down until I cooled off since he’s a prick and always has been. 

Long story short it was my GF who came over and well they did the deed, and it was on my bed too. 

It was all planned…. 

I can’t seem to get the sadness out of my head that my brother would do this to anyone let alone his OWN BROTHER. And that the girl I’ve spent a couple months spoiling and adoring and getting to know broke my heart like that?!?! Come on dude….. she could of broken up with me first at the very least. 

I can still hear the “gurgling” of them kissing hardcore. I can still hear the moans. The climatic moans at the end right before they finished…It was like 20 minutes of some hardcore sex. And the things they were saying to eachother. I don’t even want to say it on here…. Oh my word, it sucks to think about.

When they finished they just laid there for awhile. Got up and got dressed and she left. My brother dragged me out and told me and I quote “that’s the best I ever had she’s so mine man, she’s way too good for you”.  

I was crying and literally had to take the sheets off my bed and put them into the washer because they were sweaty and gross asf. I did that all that still crying… 

I wish I could have beaten him…. 

Things will never be the same with brother and I and he knows that. He probably knew that going into it. I only consider him my brother because of blood. Family doesn’t do the things he’s done to me especially something this serious. It’s left more than just a little scar…. 

I guess the only things im grateful for is I know what kind of woman she turned out to be. She goes for whoever the most attractive person is i suppose (yeah that’s great for my mental health to say lol). And im grateful they didn’t break the bed when I was under because HOLY COW it felt/sounded like it would. The bottom of the bed frame was almost hitting me and that would have hurt. 

So I obviously left her no way could we stay together. I guess when she ghosted me she also stopped hanging out with him. She at least didn’t come over anyway (probably would be embarrassed and ashamed when she sees me). But who knows…

I just want support from you guys. Please help me, I know she’s a 10|10 for looks and I thought she was a 10/10 for personality but man was I wrong with the personality part. I’m leavIng a lot of details out because it’s hurts, EVERYTHING HURTS….",1676487599.0

I've lost everything, friends , family , school you name it. I couldn't even graduate on time and now I've tried going to school twice only to go a couple days and end up in bed for weeks. I have no motivation , nothing works or clicks in me, I wake up , eat ,social media, game if I'm feeling okay and sleep. My own house feels like a prison, my mom won't talk to me.

753,Afraid of being Hated and slowly becoming cold hearted and numb,1,112uz41,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/112uz41/afraid_of_being_hated_and_slowly_becoming_cold/,5,"This is one of the recent events that occurred to me.

I'm afraid that people will hate me, to the point that even when I'm angry at my friends, I'm afraid to let it be known when they somehow hurt or anger me. Recently, I was selected for a singing competition, and I decided to bring two of my friends along. Till the end of the competition, everyone including myself as sure that I'd win. Then comes the last contestant, she didn't have the best singing talent, but she had an amazing stage presence that drew people in. I didn't mind losing to her at all, because she was genuinely amazing at controlling the crowd. That was until, one of my friends, let's say Friend A, suddenly jumped up and started shouting to my face. They said to me: ""Oh, you are gone now. You are definitely not winning. She (the contestant) is definitely winning. Say goodbye to your award"". It really hurt me and angered me. I didn't really care about that contestant winning until this friend said all that. I was deeply hurt, and angered by how my downfall and loss brought them joy. Sure enough, I didn't win the competition. I wasn't sad by my loss one bit, what made me sad was my friend's behavior and also that the other friend didn't even react or try to stop my friend or anything. I gulped down my anger and forced myself to smile and laugh all day long after the competition was over, all because I was scared that if I said something, they would hate me and no longer be my friends. Fast forward to today, we have our own group on WhatsApp, and we were chatting there about our group project that was approaching its deadline. Then Friend A messaged that she was relying on us to complete the project and give the presentation, as their family member is very ill, and they might not be able to make it. But this was our final year project, so it was very important. so, I asked them to at least come on the presentation day. They then messaged ""Project or Family Member?"". I don't know out of where something inside me snapped, and I said, ""Do you want me to lie or Tell the truth?"", Then it went along the lines of:

A : Let me know the truth.

Me: Nah leave it, take care of your family member. (Me trying to keep whatever was wrong with me, inside)

A : No, tell me, now I need to know.

Me: I would've chosen project.

Now. let me be clear, I wasn't in my right mind, and I know what I said was absolutely insensitive, even I do not know what got over me. Of course, they snapped, and started saying how they were pissed off and everything, but my pent-up anger about this person made me absolutely cold hearted. Even I never knew I could be this way. This time the other person also spoke up, on how I shouldn't be giving my opinion in such crucial moments. That competition was crucial for me too, but they slammed me down on many occasions. But that angered me further because they didn't speak up when I was hurting, but they want to speak up now? I know how this sounds but somehow, I felt wronged. But I again gulped my anger and left it there and didn't say anything further.  As soon as I came back to my senses, I realized what I had done and apologized to them, and they forgave me. We are back to normal again, but somehow, things don't seem normal. Neither from their nor my side. They did let me know, that they thought I was being very selfish in that moment when I said that message. I let them know as well, that it was my opinion and had nothing to do with them, and that things aren't always going to be about them. Idk I'm afraid of being hated but at the same time I don't care. Bottling up my emotions for so many years is somehow making me cold-hearted and numb to emotions. There are many circumstances in my life which could have led to this, but bottling up emotions is the main culprit. What do I do?",1676456984.0

755,Friendship and romance,4,112fwh7,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/112fwh7/friendship_and_romance/,4,"**TL;DR:** Does anyone have any advice for how to deal with feelings of isolation and inferiority related to not having good relationships, whether it be with friends or romantic partners? 

Something I struggle with a lot when it comes to my depression is isolation. I'm often excluded from things with my peers. While I'm introverted and don't mind being s lone, it sucks being forced to be slone when you want companionship. Even if people say they want to hang out, if I try to initiate, invite them out, I'm turned down or the person ends up doing a similar activity with a different group of people. 

I know rejection happens and plans get cancelled. But it always feels like a ""just me"" thing. I can't help the overwhelming isolation and insecurity I feel when I see people from my school who started out as a hookup and now have been dating for 3 years. When I see a group of girls having Galentine's Day, cute couple pics, birthday parties, etc. 

Most recently, a guy I went out with promised me we could go on a second date. I've never been on a second date with anyone and told him about the struggles I've had, especially in the last year (fell out with friends, rejected by 5 guys who lead me on and then rejected me or started dating someone I knew. After claiming we could be friends, none of them talk to me). He kept reassuring me that he wanted to see me. What does he do? 3 days before Valentine's Day told me he doesn't think he can date right now but wants to stay in touch.

As someone who has tried so hard to improve my social skills, it really makes me sad that I can't seem to maintain long lasting, meaningful relationships like everyone else my age. SO, someone rejecting me so shortly before Valentine's Day (especially as someone who's a hopeless romantic and has been rejected in some really mean ways) has really sent me spiraling. Any advice on how to deal with this would be appreciated!",1676408125.0

I'm really okay, or at least thankfully in a situation where I'm only mildly not okay but have awesome professional help to count on ... dysthymia is a battle).

When it emerges, the thinking pattern, for me, goes something like this:

*- Life is a never ending series of challenges and continuing further sounds terrible because judging by the past only more hardships can be expected*

*- I'm really kind of tired of dealing with these challenges and would kinda love for them all to magically end*

Ergo:

*- It would be absolutely amazing to have some kind of a rock to crawl under and hide out from the world for a bit* 

Fortunately, for me at least, it never gets to the stage of wishing that I wasn't in existence. 

It's just kind of a vague desire that it would be better and more pleasant to be able to somehow skip out on life .. maybe indefinitely but certainly for a while.

(To be clear ... I'm not looking for a personal diagnosis .. I'm just curious if other folks with depression have found a 'name' for these dark thoughts. I still think they're examples of passive suicidal ideation but suspect there might be better descriptors!).",1676412705.0

Grade 5 - This is when 3-5 kids called me annoying and the B word for being really annoying and spamming this one song when playing among us.

Grade 6 - I realized I had depression and it eventually turned to great depression after assuming people talked behind my back (which they did). Everyone hated me and I started to cry everyday in class.

Grade 7 (current year) - I have moved on and slightly got less annoying, but kids from my old class still talk about grade 6; the kids I never knew existed know about my depression. There's this one kid who's depressed himself but trying to be cool like everyone else and bullying me. I only have two friends in my class and my other, so called friends, act like their my good friends but then treat me like garbage and telling everyone my secrets. 

Then everyone keeps talking about my depression, make fun of my forehead (making me insecure about it) and I have been dealing with this since the start of the year.

Pre-school - 12th grade, I was bullied at a private school my parents wouldn't let me escape

College I faired better, but I was still made fun of somewhat, and a lot of my friends thought I was annoying at first. 

Work life...I feel like I'm just scraping by. I hated my first two jobs and got fired from them. I worked at OfficeMax and liked the comradery, but I wasn't making anything, and even though I worked a year there, I didn't learn all aspects of the store. I was just at the print center, which is its own secluded hell. The job after that I felt like I just survived. I had a terrible boss at one point and I think the company eventually got rid of him, but not without making me look like a crybaby at first. 

I just feel like I put effort into just surviving life, and I'm barely getting anything. 

You can call me lazy, I don't care. The job I'm at currently I have to use a lot of brain power. It's a mix of data entry and investigative analysis. I have to do  everything exactly right for everything to work right, and I'm just tired of it. I've been at this job for more than half a year, and I've told my boss I feel like I'm not learning the job as well as I should. Lucky enough I just got to take a break and I came back to some easy work, but it won't stay that way. 

I feel like I can get fired easily at any time. If I don't put enough effort, that will happen. I feel like I'm putting effort into the job, or at least what I think is a fair amount, and it seems I'm just keeping my head above the water, but just barely. I'm tired of living like this. 

Another thing is that I work from home, and work by myself in my apartment. I never feel like I know what's going on at my job, and I feel like everything can go to shit at any time. I'm secluded, and I don't connect with anyone. 

I just wish I had a job where I didn't have to think much, and I could just exist, see the fruits of my labor, and get along with people. I'm not a physical guy but I would like to be. I'm tired alot. So you'd think I wouldn't want that but I just want something easier that doesn't make me feel like a dumbass. Something where I don't have to keep up with so much. I need to mention that I have terrible ADD and Adderall didn't work, vivance is too expensive, and no one ever tells me about other medications, and I don't even know if they will work with my current medication either.  

It just seems out of reach. I'm just so tired. I just want to exist and play games. I don't have enough energy to keep going, even at a subpar level. 

I've been to therapy, and I don't think I ever accomplish anything because I always talk about some sort of issue I've had. If they are trying to show me the power of self validation, I get it, and it's not enough. I take medication, and it works, but it's not enough.

773,Not coping with new job,4,111s794,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/111s794/not_coping_with_new_job/,3," (32F, suffer from anxiety, depression and overthinking). I'll make this post short. I have recently started my first ""real"" job at a high school cafeteria. We are understaffed and the work is very fast and we are expected to do everything. Serve hundreds of students, clean, set up areas, dishes etc. I am trying my best every shift but I've found myself breaking down crying when they called me in to work later today. I've gotten this job right as my depression was starting to get worse, and I think I am definitely not coping with this. I find myself thinking how long I have until my next shift.

I am not on antidepressants (never have been) and the wait time to see a psychologist is beyond ridiculous. It sounds stupid but I am hesitant to take antidepressants purely because I've heard they can make you gain weight. I've spent the last 2+ years losing over 130lb/60kg and I still have to lose more. But I am struggling to lose weight lately. I think because I have been so stressed from all these new changes. 

Is it a stupid reason not to want to take medication? I am also depressed because of another person in my life and don't think taking antidepressants would do much. I would be even more depressed if I saw that I had gained weight.

Just tell me straight if I am being unreasonable here.

I find myself wanting to cry every day at random times. I feel hopeless, nothing to look forward to, low self esteem, and physically and mentally exhausted. I'm constantly overthinking and making myself feel worse. My mood is always low these days and find no enjoyment from doing anything (for example, i have no motivation to watch or play something).

If I did take antidepressants, how would they help me?

Which medication would be best for anxiety as well? My heart is racing throughout my entire shift and I really hate that feeling so much.

Sorry if this post is all over the place.

I personally believe that every choice I've ever made was either the most logical one, or one made instinctually. I think that I'll always make the most logical decision because the other option is absurd. The exception is instinctual choices, which are usually stupid and put me in pain. 

I feel that every accomplishment I've ever done was done as a result of either natural inborn skill, or privilege. I was born white, male, upper class, had college paid for by a rich uncle, grew up in a good home, etc. I was handed a pile of privilege, and every accomplishment I've ever had was only done because I was given the position to do so. 

I don't feel like I have any option to step off the path whatsoever. I've tried to kill myself a few times, and the only thing that's stopped me was my inability to do so. I think a normal person might call it ""not having the nerve"" but to me it felt like there was an override in my head, keeping me on a certain path. The override cares nothing for me, or my feelings, but keeps me existing because I cosmically need to stay on the path. 

I routinely feel like an onlooker in my own life. I feel like any ""choices"" I make are aesthetic, rather than meaningful. I feel like I was damned into an existence where I am nothing more than a passenger in my own body, on a slow and miserable road. 

I have anxiety and depression, and I'm routinely in anguish over stupid things. I am terrified I'll be fired over mistakes at work. I'm terrified my landlord will evict me over something minor. But I don't feel like I have the ability to really work on the things I need, because I'll either instinctively slip up, or something out of my control will happen. 

And honest to God, I have zero examples to prove the contrary. I don't feel like I can disprove fatalism, for various philosophical reasons.

He even acknowledged that he hit me at that moment. Then later dismissed it by changing up what really happened at that moment saying that he did it on accident saying it wasn't a hit. It was a soft slap... (The slap left a red mark)

He has history of getting it on with people. He does the thing and leave them. He's been liking the photos of the person he did it with which he's allowed to.

I share what I'm interested with him he dismisses it saying ""does it matter?""

He has a history of always saying that he hated people and he hates other couples

I want to press the block button and avoid him at school(even if he comes up to me) I want to be happy again and the only way to do that if I cut him out of my life. I've cut people out like no problem but with this person I'm not sure. 



He's never there for me. When I cried in front of his face he just sighed and turned the other way. When I was fainted the other day he texted me later that he was annoyed I kept fainting when I couldn't help it. He got annoyed at me and told him I wasted his gas when he comes to pick me up(I don't ever ask for a ride he's always the one offering)

He puts time for his friends more than me. Felt like an object collecting dust in the shelf.. he didn't care about me like he always says he does 
""oh don't think I don't care about you"" he says ""I love you""

He hugs me everytime before we depart and I feel ugly inside and squirmish . I want to get away from him ,my brain says. ""Get away from me and don't talk to me ever again!"" I want to tell him. He doesn't care about me. He acts just like my narcissistic father.

I feel like I’ve hit rock bottom and I feel stripped from all my energy. I’m living day by day, paycheck to paycheck, and everyday there is an issue. Problem after problem. Something always comes up


(For context I’m Male almost 24)


A few years ago I developed epilepsy and it was very hard for me and literally changed my life. For the longest time I couldn’t listen to music comfortably because sound triggers my epilepsy and, sadly, music is my biggest comfort. I remember a bunch of times waking up in the middle of the night after having a seizure and being surrounded by my mom and sisters crying. When I was diagnosed I repressed my feelings and tried to not let it affect me much because my family is already disfuncional and everyone has a bunch of problems. My oldest sister always had bad anxiety and depression and she suffered from really bad anxiety attacks for many years. My middle sister has also always suffered from anxiety attacks and depression and has attempted suicide multiple times before, and she’s also diabetic which was really hard for her when she was diagnosed. My mom is the black sheep of her family and feels like she has no allies within her sisters as they are very petty and gossipy and backstabbers, and me and my sisters and cousins were bullied by them when we were little (now they’re low key mean but it doesn’t affect us anymore)


For those reasons I repressed my negative emotions when I was diagnosed with epilepsy. I didn’t wanna give my mom and my sisters more grieving, so I tried to stay strong. And then when I started taking seizure medication I went through what’s know as “keppra rage”. I couldn’t contain my emotions and I was angry and sad everyday, crying every night, zero patience. Luckily my mom and sisters were aware of the side effects, but my narcissistic dad couldn’t help himself and called me out on my attitude. That instantly triggered the resentment I’ve had bottled up towards him and I broke down and finally told him that he humiliated me when I was 11 years old and broke my heart and, instead of realizing he hurt me, he got mad, started yelling, throwing things, and saying it was my fault. I haven’t spoken to him ever since, it’s been a year


Also last year I started doing capoeira to distract myself and activate my body. It’s been one of the most rewarding and spiritually filled eras of my life. But around October last year I was having a lot of trouble sleeping and had a lot of negative symptoms. It took a long time, but just today I was finally diagnosed with sleep apnea, really bad sleep apnea and these bad news have me analyzing everything that’s wrong with me


I regularly have really high blood pressure, stage 1 hypertension. I also have really high cholesterol even though I’ve been avoiding things like salt, egg yolks, and butter for a long while. I’m also pre diabetic. I get stressed very extremely easily and it’s a humongous trigger for my epilepsy


To top it all off I feel very lonely, don’t have many friends, and rarely go out with the few people I’d call friends. My best friend moved back to her country a few years ago. I’ve been hardcore hooking up with strangers regularly for about a year now and my best friend says she’s worried about me. I’ve been hooking up with a girl from work and I recently found out she was cheating on her boyfriend with me. I made a sex friend on Grindr and we hook up regularly but I found out he’s married. Even though they’re in an open relationship it makes me feel empty knowing I’m sleeping with a married man


My doctor prescribed me anxiety meds, lexapro. Started with 10mg, went up to 20mg, and I couldn’t handle it. I was getting really bad side effects so I stopped taking it and now I have anxiety and stress again. My everyday life is a small bunch of medications, plus I’ve been getting really sick with the weather changing because I have sensitive allergies and I’m just so very tired all the time to the point where I haven’t been going to my capoeira classes since December and I feel guilty


I know I can talk to my mom and sisters because we have that kind of trust, but my oldest sister recently got married and I don’t want to kill her vibe. My middle sister is rarely around and I don’t wanna waste our time together with pure negativity. My mom is dealing with her sisters and my grandma probably dying soon, as well as her uncle dying a few months ago and my mom was really close to him. Last December my grandma went into a coma because one of my aunts who is her legal caretaker didn’t take care of her and let her not take her meds if she didn’t feel like it and let her eat whatever she wanted instead of following her diet. The doctors had given my grandma a week to die and my aunts were already fighting over the properties but she woke up the day before they were gonna disconnect her. She went back home with my aunt her legal caretaker, but she’s not taking care of her again and my mom is dealing with that. I don’t want to give my mom more problems

784,Nesting,16,1117myn,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/1117myn/nesting/,3,"Here's a technique I learnt from my therapist. Sorry in advance if this has already been posted here.
I call it nesting because it's essentially creating a sort of sensory nest for yourself.

Find things to appeal your senses and put them in your safe space. For me for example, I use a colour changing lamp and fairy lights for sight, a calming playlist for sound (gentle Spotify playlist specifically), herbal tea for smell and taste, and a stuffed turtle toy called Timothy (don't judge me lol) for touch. I'm also cold intolerant so I wrap up warm for extra comfort. Then, while in the 'nest' I do an activity I like  that doesn't take too much energy like playing house flipper or reading. Alternatively, you can just use the moment to do deep breathing along to music. Both work.

I rarely read books these days so I've set a target of reading 10 books this year (I'm a very slow reader) and I think that helps me keep motivated.

I use the 'nest' at night when I can't be bothered by other people, just before I go to bed. I've found it very helpful. It keeps me calm and happy in the moment - a nice respite from the depression- and when I'm miserable during the day I can at least look forward to it every night 😌

I hope this will be helpful for someone",1676293154.0

So, I am basically a dead person. I am entirely unaffected with anything that goes around me. Everything appears futile to me. I find no purpose in anything. Every single minute feels like a year. I barely eat anything. I even go through days on just water and some sandwiches. It's like I'm dead and I'm just pretending to be living.


I am young. My life was picture perfect. I had everything. I was great at studies and had endless opportunities waiting for me. 4 years back something traumatic happened with me. It broke me. After that, everything went downhill. My life went to trash. I even tried to kill myself. The pain and trauma was unbearable. It was getting more and more with each passing day. I lost my friends, ruined my studies and safe to say killed my potential. My teachers and family started looking down on me. I had none to hold me. I don't know why I kept living on. To this day, I have no idea why I wake up every morning. 4 years have passed since that incident but the trauma has stayed on with me. It changed my perception about life. I feel everything in life is extremely futile. I am fed up of everything. Nothing interests me. I feel a heavy pain. I feel myself being crushed by something.  I keep thinking of killing myself and sparing me off this pain but I don't want my family to go through the trauma and shame of suicide. If I talk with someone, they just say that things will get better. I don't care if they get better. I often pray of getting a cardiac arrest or getting electrocuted or getting hit by a car so that my death can come off as an accident. I'm 20M. I lost my friends beacuse I was too much occupied with my own sufferrings. I live alone. I try to do stuff to feel happy but I get back to being sad in just a few minutes. Like I hate happiness. I try making friends but I feel like I'll end up as a fucking liability.  I have no future prospects. I tried killing myself again 2 nights back. I had made all the necessary arrangements but at last instant, the thought of my family going through shame came into my mind and I had to stop. I can't even die. For the last 4 years, I have been hanging on but I think I'm done now. I don't want to continue anymore. Things won't get any better in my life, I'm sure of that. There's nothing good in my life. Not one damn thing. Where do I go or what do I do? How do I overcome the fear of my family getting shamed and ridiculed if I die?",1676275621.0

I have had depression for quite some time now. I don’t know when it started, but it definitely worsened during the end of 2020, leaving me with suicidal ideation and some time in partial hospitalization.  
My main concern as of now is my schoolwork. It has been tanked by depression. I *had* great grades, and I *was* diligent, but now instead of straight As and AP classes, I have Fs and Ds.  
It’s not like I can;t keep up with the work, as tests are going fine, it’s the fact that I cannot bring myself to do my work. I can stare at my laptop for hours, nearly crying at the fact that this assignment should’ve taken 15 minutes tops.

I got diagnosed when I was 15 but I feel as though I had it even when I was younger.  I had a hard family life when I was 10>, but my mother,  sister and I left that situation and moved on.  I was bullied in school, but it hasn't properly affected my self esteem much as I still find myself moderately attractive (not saying I'm a model or anything). 
The thing is, No matter what I do or get given, I just can't be happy. My mother and step father , which I'm close with both of them, constantly buy me new clothes and gifts. I have a loving boyfriend who lives far but we manage to still see eachother at least once a month, mostly more times. Despite all of this, I still feel so miserable. 
Sure, this sounds spoilt and I worry I appear like that; but I don't know what's wrong with me. I stopped getting help when I turned 18 because I was no longer a minor. I've battled with self-harming and suicidal behaviour, both of which I've mostly recovered from and my family know. 
Maybe they feel bad, and that's why they shower me with love and gifts. However, No matter what I'm given in life - gifts, love,  people - I still feel so sad. I've got the life I've always wanted, I'm in full time education with good grades and close friends, I don't worry about money and I have a loving family. 
Am I selfish for still feeling like this despite all their efforts? I have been given the world yet I still only want to cry and rot in my bed all the time.

Now that I have a 1 week break I won't even touch the outside. (not exaggerating)

I barely talk to family. Haven't seen my mom or some siblings for weeks maybe months. No communication at all. 

I have no one to talk to. I keep my emotions to myself until I break in the middle of night because I see all these people have a perfect life with beautiful girlfriends. Meanwhile im laying in bed with literally no meaning. I think about suicide very often but im too scared to do it.

Im very unhealthy, caused by my lifestyle (which doesn't really even exist since I do nothing) I am very skinny and have been my whole life. I've been self conscious about it my whole life. Recently I have been doing my best to eat till I almost throw up.  59.4kg january 22 2023 | 59.8kg January 28 2023 | 60.3kg February 4 2023

I have tried changing my life a couple times but at the end of the day I still end up at my computer endlessly scrolling youtube until I find something to watch. I watch skating videos and think of how fun it would be to actually skate around with friends but then my mind immidiatley thinks ""it's too late, Youll be too old by the time you actually get good. Should've started earlier.""

I have no friends. No life. No one to hug.

Life was tolerable but went very downhill after high school, when my will became more relevant. Tried some studies and jobs but I couldn't continue with anything for longer than ¾ year. 

I just don't have hobbies or dreams, never had them either. There's nothing I want in life. Nothing really touches my heart. And I'm so done with it. My therapists and parents keep me in the same cycle of trying new jobs and whatever, even if I don't like it since it's about structure.

Whenever I say I want to die, people only tell or try to force me to do things. But I just know that I will never be truly happy or satisfied. I don't want to keep on trying to live a sort of active life because it doesn't make me feel better. I just can't enjoy life. And I wish people around me would stop telling me to keep on going and to just ""accept"" and embrace life as it is. It honestly comes over like nobody understands me and that everyone has the same opinion. It comes over as if I'm wrong and that it's incorrect that I really want to not exist anymore. Fuck not having the right to die, tbh.

Whenever I look fine on the outside in terms of that I'm financially stable and have structure and can function in society minimally, my therapists talk about ending the therapy because then I'm cured. But that's also because they don't know how else to help me. I've been talking with several therapists there over the years, have tried several medications, mindfulness, group therapy, and they are specialised in autism too. They do acknowledge that the depressive feelings might not go fully away. I also wouldn't know what treatment would help me either, so I guess I don't blame them in that regard. But this isn't exactly motivating. They can give up on me but I'm not allowed to give up life unless I take the risk of suicide.

Why does this society seem to prefer to let me suffer for years? Life is not cut out for me. I want peace. I want to be dead. I feel so lonely and not taken seriously or understood. Giving me attention is not the same thing when what they say or make me do is unwanted. 

Is this relatable to anyone? Whether you're in the same boat as me or you did find a hobby or something that makes life actually satisfying, I just want to be acknowledged and understood by someone.

I go from therapist to therapist, getting bullied by one after another. I’ve been trying doctors to no avail. I don’t have a social support network and as a result of abuse, CPTSD and traumas, I’m hyper independent which is apparently making the therapists uncomfortable. 

I haven’t been diagnosed as clinically depressed but told I’m situationally depressed which means I’m in a hell hole of a life which has been improving over years and now I’m just at the point where I don’t have any toxic people around but no support either. I’ve been on medication for three years and while it may have helped at some point for a short time, it’s definitely been messing up with me. The latest doctor I visited recently told me to switch medication (stop lexapro 5mg, start Cymbalta 30mg) I ended up in bed for an entire week and after not being able to reach the doctor, I ended up reverting to lexapro. Nonetheless, I’ve been spending most days in bed and watching my life go by. 

While I’m feeling extreme tiredness and fatigue, I’m thinking that maybe all I have to do is to really dedicate myself to sticking to a routine for exercising, journaling, and staying out of bed to get back to how energetic I used to be in the past. But I’m not sure if I can actually do this or if I really need the medication. 

I have nothing against the medication except that I’m hyper responsive and it takes me so long to adjust and I cannot afford the time in bed to let them adjust.

I don’t really know if this is an actual disorder but I’ve felt this way my whole life and when I talk to people about it they say it is definitely not normal so I want you Reddit experts to talk me through this. I’m male, 17 y/o

Basically after I go to a party, social function, high school basketball game, etc., I get in a very bad depressive episode. Like I will have the time of my life at a social event, be so happy and cheery and meet so many people, and when I get home and alone in my room it’s like a switch flips and I get so depressed. Sometimes to the point I will sit and stare at a wall for an hour in complete silence. Often I will just sit in my chair scrolling through Instagram for over an hour before I even work up the motivation to sit up and press the on button on my PC or turn music on. No suicidal thoughts or self harm comes to mind, but sometimes my mind will drift on a sour relationship topic in my mind and I will stress myself to the max, yet still not finding the energy or motivation to do anything other than sit here and be sad. 

For example, today we had the FBLA Spring conference and I’m the District president. I played guitar and sang in front of hundreds of people, told jokes and made a lot of peoples day. I love doing that shit, I don’t seek attention but I love public speaking and love being the life of the party/class clown and i never have arguments or disputes with anybody. I feel like I’m loved by everyone and I love everybody I’m surrounded with. But when I got home about 3 hours ago, it took me an hour and a half to even get out of the chair I was sitting in and turn on my computer, to which I then just let go to sleep mode and not touch for 30 minutes. When I didn’t have the motivation to turn on a game or music or find a video on YouTube after that half hour, I began to write this post because this feeling is becoming unbearable. But even just making this post is helping me because I’m getting to talk and be social. The more I think about it, it feels like I’m going through withdrawals of socialization if that’s a thing.

I don’t have daily depression symptoms (even though I had severe depression and suicidal thoughts for about 3 years from 12-15) and I have tons of motivation everyday. I smoked weed >5 times a week for about 3 months, quit for 6 months, then started again for another 3 months, and have recently quit again about a month ago. No particular reason for quitting, just got bored of it. I never had any addiction symptoms or withdrawal symptoms, but I noticed smoking weed was making these episodes somewhat more frequent and worse. Now I trip 3g psychedelic mushrooms about once every 10 days and it’s made the episodes a lot better. However it has been over a week since my last trip and I am noticing the effect on my psyche. Thinking about microdosing instead of tripping. Been off of SSRI’s for about a year now. I’m not sure if any of this information is relevant to my situation since I’ve always had these problems, drugs or not, but maybe some expert has an idea.

middle school i went to was the last time i felt happy. the last time i felt loved. 
but it seems to me that everyone had already moved on. i went to a different high school than my peers, and i haven’t been able to make any friends ever since then, so i’ve been stuck in this cycle of wanting things to go back to how they were before for the past four years.

but today, i realized that there is no place to go back to. everyone has moved on. everyone has changed. except me. a lot of people that i used to call my best friends ignored me. 

i know it’s inevitable, but all my teachers didn’t recognize me. it just kind of made me think, this is how i’m going to be to everyone else eventually too. i’m just going to be forgotten. and that made me spiral more. 

everyone’s getting their ivy league acceptances and job offers and.. all i have to show for my high school career is an eating disorder, three suicide attempts, and mental health that keeps getting worse.

So technically Thursday morning in the early hours.

       My boyfriend decided to tell me his plans of an attempt. And he goes through with it. Yesterday I was so concerned. I didn't talk to much people. I hate being spammed but I was so desperate for messages from him. And then I finally got some. But they were quite.. not good. He couldn't text me without being supervised. How many times I told him how I loved him.

        Only a minute of talking to him. And then he was gone. 2 times yesterday I almost broke down in tears. Last night, I stayed up late hoping for messages. Any kind. But none. He gave me one of his old shirts as a gift. And so I used that as my pillow last night to sleep. To feel closer to him.. Today I brought that shirt with me. And brought the letter he wrote me. I couldn't wear the gifts he gave me. It just hurt too bad. It took half the day to be able to wear those gifts. (Lanyard and necklace). And the shirt. I used as comfort. When I felt sad. I took the shirt out. (Yes in public.) And I would cuddle my face into it.

You are not alone. Many Americans suffer from depression and are looking for alternative therapies to help. Ketamine treatment is an established depression therapy for many patients, with promising results. Ketamine treatment is an effective treatment for depression that has been proven to help reduce depressive symptoms. It works differently than other antidepressant medications, helping to regulate the brain’s glutamate receptors, which are essential for regulating mood. It is important to note that ketamine is not a “cure-all” for depression, but it can provide relief. 

Common benefits of ketamine treatment for depression include: 

• Rapid relief of symptoms – Its effects begin working quickly and can last for days, leading to longer-term improvements. 

• Fewer side effects – Ketamine has fewer side effects than other medications, making it a safer option. 

• Improved mood – Ketamine can reduce feelings of hopelessness and provide hope that depression can be successfully managed. 

• Improves quality of life – It may reduce the intensity of depressive symptoms and improve the patient’s overall quality of life. 

At KetAssure, we are proud to offer ketamine treatment for depression located in Central Illinois. We want to help you find relief and live a full life.

Most of my friends live out of state(5hr drive) but are still near each other. So when we hang out online lately I get to listen to every single person I know make plans with each other while I bury myself and my feelings about it. Hell the one friend I do have nearby I suspect doesn't want to hang out cuz they did the same thing right after a conversation with me.

Well this weekend they're all going to some event together. They know I have free time but I wasn't invited. So now I'm stuck in some feelings. Is there something wrong with me that makes it so I'm not invited? If so why do they even talk to me?

As time passes this is just getting to me more and more and I can't just bring everyone else down by telling them that them having fun without me is killing me

I need new friends but I don't know where to begin.

Hell let's add more. Few years back I was on top of the fucking world. I loved myself and my life. Then, as life does, it all just disappeared. Lost everything except the useless degree I earned and my electronics: clothes, books, supplies. Had to move back with my parents.

I was able to get that under control  but with everything going on I feel like I'm on the verge of losing what little I do have all over again, falling back into drinking to forget. I probably would have already if I didn't get violently sick drinking now.

I really understand her situation and I know she doesn’t have a choice. But I honestly feel like never trusting anyone ever again. I literally begged her I don’t need her money but she insisted me to get help and just take it and now suddenly asking me back, I don’t have a job and these last fee months i have been selling few of my stuff to repay her back. I understand that she also doesn’t have a choice but I feel like all the help i got during my treatment using her money it all went down in a second when she asked me back.

Now I'm back with yet another update, needing some support again.

In the 6 months since my last post, my oldest friend passed away suddenly, and as you can imagine I've been really struggling since then. Another one of my friends just totally dropped out of contact and I have no idea why (we didn't argue or have any sort of falling out, they just totally stopped talking to me, but I've seen them making posts on social media pretty often). So I've been struggling, dealing with grief, and even more isolated and lonely than before.

Some people advised me to try moving away from home, but because of disabilities I can't work full time and I'm stuck with minimum wage jobs, so I have very little money and honestly I'm pretty close to giving up on ever moving out of my parents' house. I've found learning to drive pretty much impossible as well since I have a visual processing disability, so that doesn't work either.

The last thing that people were recommending to me was trying to make online friendships and then organize in-person meetups, but honestly, I've really struggled with making any sort of lasting connections online. I've been going around Discord, Reddit, and a bunch of forums for the sort of things I'm interested in for the past 6 months and...nothing has really come together. I've talked to lots of people but haven't really been able to make any sort of friendship with any of them. I'm not sure, maybe the fact that I've been grieving for my friend for most of of it had something to do with my lack of success, but I don't know. One way or another, even the online stuff hasn't been working out for me.

And through all of this I've started just getting numb to it. Being lonely is just like breathing to me. It's constant, I can't even remember a time when I didn't feel this way anymore. This feeling of crushing loneliness has been so constant for so long that I'm starting to just not care anymore. I feel like I should just hide away from the world because every time I so much as try to stick my nose out the door I just end up getting hurt. Over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. I'm apparently meant to go through life alone, so maybe I should just fucking accept that instead of trying to fight it and continue being hurt constantly.

I appreciate everyone trying to help. I'm just a lost cause honestly. I'm meant to be alone in life and it's time to just accept that.",1676048642.0

The thoughts are putrid, the audacity of the mind creates the coalition against me, against the most vulnerable parts. It’s dark. Give up. Stop trying. Why must these permutations continually haunt me? Deepest of those are fear, why do I hold onto these fears? Is she ever going to break up with me? Am I good enough? Will I succeed? What happens now? Why hold the election to withdraw into the cave, then I remember. 

It is a cave, I only see what I can see, think what I can think, why can’t I release these thoughts which are begging me to an end. Why justify the radical notions of subliminal freedom. I’m in an elastic state, where the doors are open and closing, the fields are forever stretching and yet the soul is now wondering again. No direction, no decision, just existing in an obstinate stance. If there ever were words to describe such a tyrant leader, it would seem no matter the struggle to justify the means, The Mind; is the manifestation of disease and bitterness, cold harsh realities, punishment of thy self. 

Void of thoughts which were long ago, seem now to string along as the guitar guides the artist. I hear that unjustified criticism, those harsh rather resentful words, I pity the one who uses them, and the one who has to endure their wrath. It’s suffered enough already, why must it suffer more? What trick is being toyed with on the bench? But to sleep? To hear? To listen? To even think? How can these relentless exploitations go unnoticed, unheard, not comforted. A seething silence is almost impassable, why speak, when the words are just plainly spoken without the context of which they were addressed? 

It’s a flowing river of red, it’s a hallowed sea, and yet we gaze at its wonders, its beauty for hours. This to the end we don’t miss the moment, but no. Now we mustn’t be too late to the party. No more time is there to just breathe. A whaling mist is the cent that secretes mischief and agony, that light so far away it’s barely noticeable by ear. Alas though, one domain to another should the beast decide to roam, then that last place is sinking like the person who doesn’t have their cornerstone.",1676004409.0

I’ve tried so many different hobbies and so many different self-help shit and pushed myself so hard to do things and so much more, but nothing makes anything better. It’s all just distractions.

I know that I’m extremely quick to be suggested something and I’ll instantly say no, it won’t work. But I feel like I always have justification for why it won’t work, not that I’m just not willing to try. Because I am willing to try. In theory, I like trying new things. But the reasons I shouldn’t do it always outweigh any benefits I get.

Go for a walk? Great, except, when I’m left to think on my own for a while I usually start spiraling, hard. I end up in a really dangerous state without fail.

Start a new hobby, take a new class? I’m so tired and I have no motivation. The fear associated with taking a class feels way too extreme for me to tackle right now. I could force myself to go, but it starts getting extremely draining, and then I’m at risk for a spiral.

Exercise? Similar to the above, except worse, not at all within my capabilities right now.

It sounds like I just say “I can’t do it” to a lot of things and I probably am, but it feels so justified to me. I could say, just try it, see if you like it, but the risk/reward never pays off. I make myself sick and scared going to a new thing, and when I’m done with it, I don’t feel better, because all I ever feel is relief that it’s over with. I can never feel proud of myself for trying things because the only thing I’m thinking is “I just need to get through this and then I can go”. Which, that’s a fine mentality for some things, but it’s taken over everything for me, even things that are supposed to be enjoyable. And it might also sound like I’m going into situations expecting them to fail, and yeah, sometimes, but I can’t really afford to let myself feel hopeful just to be let down anymore. I’ve done it more than enough and I’m not in any state where I can handle much more of that.

The risk/reward balance is way off because it’s always risk and never any reward, because rewards don’t exist for me anymore.

I don’t have any friends, but I know it would make doing these things so much easier, and so much more rewarding. Because I feel so much more comfortable with friends than just doing things on my own. It takes some of that fear away so that I can actually enjoy something. But then we get to the issue of - okay, you need to make friends, except you have to go somewhere and be comfortable enough to be social, and you can’t do that alone, so the cycle repeats.

I just don’t know how to make anything feel fulfilling or rewarding on my own. The fear is way too strong and I can’t enjoy things or be functional because of it. Nothing makes me happy and I don’t know what to do.",1676001327.0
871,Advice on how to reach my sister.,1,10yf8bg,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/10yf8bg/advice_on_how_to_reach_my_sister/,1,"Hello. I need some help, sorry for the long post. 

Today I came home to bad news from my mom, who was noticeably shaken and shocked. She dragged me to the restroom, closed the door and sat me down. A little bit of context, before today, my sister refused to go to therapy, saying she didn't need it because she wasn't a crazy person. However, we were all shocked when she asked my mom to ask me for my therapist's contact information. I linked them the contact and somehow thought nothing of it. Not because I don't care or anything, in fact, I was a little happy that she was giving therapy a shot because my therapist was the one who brought me out of the worst pit I had ever found myself in when I was going through depression in middle school. 

Anyways. She went to therapy today, and that's where the bad news came from. My mom told me she was informed by the therapist that my sister had very severe depression, the kind that just shows up on your life without there being a cause necessarily. And it was hitting her hard. Won't go too into detail but yes, she has considered suicide before and yes, she has researched into methods. 

The therapist adviced my mom and my sister for her to stay in therapy and under constant vigilance for close to a year, and my sister ""agreed"" (However, my mom told me she looked annoyed or betrayed). 

During the ride home, my mom tried to talk about it with my sister, but she kept quiet. When they got home, my mom told her to keep her door open. My sister refused and locked herself in. This isn't unusual, both she and I usually keep our doors locked and our parents know and respect our privacy. 

Here's where I get split on what to do though. 

1. I don't want to suddenly shower her in attention. Our relationship has never been that way and to her it would feel like I don't actually care and am just pretending to make her feel better. 

2. I don't want to just... Stay the exact same. I don't want it to seem like I don't know or even worse, that I know and don't care so I won't do anything about it. 

I want her to know that I'm here for her, and that I know what she's been through and I know how frustrating it is for ""Everyone to know"" and ""Take pity on you"". I know what kind of destructive depression she's going through because I've been through the exact same thing before and know how painful everything that people do to help actually feels like. 

I want to give her advice, but then again, it would feel so patronizing? Or like I'm trying to guide her through a videogame I've already beaten while looking down on her. It just doesn't feel right to me and I don't want her to feel like what she's going through isn't serious or ""As bad as I had it"" which isn't even relevant because she's the person I know who least deserves any of this.

Please, tell me what I can do.",1676000321.0

I don't want to be with her anymore because I can't handle all the things. It's an emotional rolecoaster that I can't commit myself to. Yesterday, we talked and she blames me for a lot of things and I know how she feels and can't point it out because will make things worse for her depression. I don't feel I can add anything more, I don't think I can satisfy her demands about our relationship and, honestly, I am not feeling good about myself or about the situatuon. For me, being arguing everyday is no good and I already broke up with someone with the same problem.

I want to break up but I'm worried what she can do. She tried sycide yesterday after we've talked, and I fell blame about it, but know that it's not the way to resolve things. She doesn't accept my reasons for the break up, and I really don't know how to talk to her without hurting her feelings or put her in a worsen position.

The point is that I can handle anymore, I have strong feelings about her, but it's affecting my mental health too. I am not being good to her also, because she expect something for me that I can give it, so I think that continuing in the relationship will be a bad thing for both of us.

Can someone give me a little advice. I am lost.",1675961650.0
881,I'm extremely depressed & no one gets it,9,10xl4o1,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/10xl4o1/im_extremely_depressed_no_one_gets_it/,14,"So since Thanksgiving I've been pretty depressed, it's been getting worse and worse as the months go by.
I was doing horribly at work, so I saw my psychiatrist about it to ask her if she could at least let my work know that I'm struggling with my depression and ADHD if there was any kind of letter that I could provide my HR department and she was very harsh with me, she said that I have to try harder and I have to do my best because medicine isn't going to fix that...and while I understand that, I'm telling her that trying my best isn't working. 

I told her that I have no energy, I don't want to get out of bed, I don't want to shower, I don't want to brush my teeth, brush my hair, i don't want to get dressed and I can't concentrate on anything because I'm ADHD and it's never been like this. I can't read a book, I can't watch a show, I can't hang out with my friends without daydreaming or wishing that I was somewhere else and she just tells me that I need to try harder...

eventually she did give me a letter to give my work... and my work was basically like ""We don't really need that, that's not necessary. We just need you to do better"" (they denied my paperwork showing I'm doing bad cuz my mental state but that I'm on meds and working back to being at my normal work performance rate..
 So I ended up quitting bc they denied that and started treating me extremely different... and I've been off for about 2 weeks now trying to feel better and get my focus centered and try a new medication and see how that works for me with the side effects and everything but it's not working.
I see my psychiatrist every two weeks because I'm trying to tell her I'm the worst I've ever been. She has me answer that questionnaire that says things like:
""On a scale of 1 to 5 how hard is it for you to do daily things?""
""Are you easily irritated, low energy?"" 
""And how difficult does your depression make it hard to accomplish daily tasks""
For all of these I say EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. 

For the tougher ones:
""Do you think about killing yourself?""
""Do you think that you're worthless to other people?""
I answered no bc I don't feel that way.

But everything else is a 10/10 difficulty and it seems she doesn't take that seriously enough to help. Idk if she thinks I'm over exaggerating? But it seems that just bc I don't wanna unalive myself or hurt myself/others..that I'm ""fine""...but this is the worst I've ever been. 
I have zero motivation, energy, nothing brings.me joy, I'm exhausted and fatigued and would rather just stay in bed instead of seeing friends.
I have never skipped showering or brushing my teeth/hair my whole life and now I just cannot be bothered to do anything. I'm even not eating much...
Idk how to get her attention to understand that this is NOT ME or my habits or how I usually am...why do I have to be suic**** to get someone to take me seriously? I can be depressed and not be to the point where I wanna be unalive..that doesn't make me LESS mentally ill...it doesn't automatically mean I can handle my self and I'm ""fine""

Any advice would be great but I'm mostly just venting bc I feel like constant sad-shit and no one seems to understand how it's effecting my life to the point of me just wallowing, like a zombie...",1675916310.0

For the past 6 months i (M23) been unemployed and been lookin for a good job ever since... I have experience in woodworking industry as a carpenter and a manufacturing process manager because of the internships i took and jobs i've had. I've been on multiple interviews for similar positions and every single time it's the same. During interviews i'm told that they are amazed by the ammount of experience for my age and they will definetley call me even if it's gonna be ""NO"" but i always get ghosted after the interviews. I've even applied for the jobs that are paying minimal wage so i could barely pay rent. I've been getting money from state for all this time because i have been working before that. But it stops in April which makes me scared.

Today while being in the shower i almost had a mental breakdown because i'm just not able to get a good job in woodworking industry. The last interview i had was this monday (06.02.2023) in this amazing company which specializes in product quality checking and again... they were happy to see my experience and told me that i fit their company pretty well and also they will call me next week about their decision.

I just feel that i should not get my hopes up and am losing hope of ever obtaining a normal job that will make me happy and also allow me not to starve.

She’s heading towards a burn-out and seems to get more and more down. Recognizing how it feels, I seem strangely inept in helping her fight all of this.

Some things that I’m seeing:

- She’s switched jobs at the same time we moved to a newly built home. Her job is stressful, a new home is stressful. 
- She’s more down in the dumps and tells me she doesn’t know what she wants to do anymore, especially work-wise. She wants to do everything all at once, like finish things in the house, clean everything, work all day, be sportive, while not having energy. This causes a cycle of negativity because if one thing can’t be done, she feels she’s failing.
- I tell her time and time again she’s being too harsh for herself and there’s no reason to feel like failure for not being able to do everything at once. To take it one thing at a time.

This is my first time ever posting on here. I’m 26 years old and married with a great family but I am severely depressed and have been for a large part of my life, I have self harmed quite a bit in the past and struggle to control my emotions and my day to day thoughts. I am just not happy. I can’t find joy or happiness in anything I do, I don’t even understand why I’m depressed, I have a great wife, beautiful healthy children, good job and a house. What do I have to be depressed about? 

But I have always felt this way from I was about 12/13 I have never really spoke about it to anyone until recently but I feel it falls on deaf ears as everyone just says “it’s one of those things you need to get on with it and get through it, it will get better in time” but how will it get better in time? They truly don’t get the magnitude of my depression and how hard it is for me just to get out of bed and make it through the day. Everyday most of the day I think of killing myself, I would never do it but Jesus I would love to as I am just so tired of having to push on and live like this. 

I really try my best to not self harm anymore but there are times that I cannot resist the urge even if it’s doing something small like skinning my knuckles with a razor and then telling people I had fell as a cover story. I am just exhausted every minute of everyday and have no motivation to do anything at all, the smallest tasks are so hard like getting a shower or brushing my teeth, there are days it is impossible for me. I want this to just leave my brain and not haunt me anymore.

I currently take 150mg of sertraline a day along with 120mg of propanol but I really don’t feel any different, my mood is constantly changing one minute I could be feeling ok then the next I am so down in the dumps and overwhelmed with emotions.

I really need help, I didn’t even plan on writing all this. I had just wanted to ask for advice from people who have went through the same as me and to ask for ways to make me feel better or at least make a bit of a difference,

he’s just a bird, but i swear he is like a part of me. i know that if i went away it would be horrible for both of us to be without each other. he despises other humans, so i couldnt have someone pet sit for months on end, and even then i wouldnt be able to find someone i would trust.

946,Completely Debilitated and Terrified.,2,10v27te,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/10v27te/completely_debilitated_and_terrified/,2,"My life has been obstacle after obstacle. I ran amuck recklessly without support medically or personally for most of my childhood and adult life. I wasn’t diagnosed with bipolar disorder until I was in my twenties. This condition distorts time and self perception, the manic episodes feel as though they last months and years, anything is possible!—the depressive episodes are the same, but I can’t eat, or I over eat, I can’t sleep or I over sleep. Breathing is too difficult, I am in physical pain, when I wake up in the morning the burden of a single feather can send me down. 
I try so hard to live my life, but I have watched myself run through this vicious cycle of working so hard to survive, only to lose everything in the blink of an eye. It’s either the mania causing me to quit several jobs and sell all my belongings or my depression crashing and burning me, making me literally unable to walk from the burden and the pain. 
I began taking medication for the manic episodes after I got married, lithium works like a charm. I have encountered the awful realization, in conjunction with medical professionals, that I have treatment resistant depression. The only thing that ever worked for it was ECT (electroconvulsive therapy), but due to unfortunate circumstances I had to move out of state. It’s been almost a year since I’ve been in this new state and I have been painfully depressed 9.75/10 times. I will make it clear, I am not looking for medical advice in the least… I am just venting about this. 
As of recent, I was talking to a medical professional who deals in transcranial magnetic stimulation or TMS. My husband and I were trying to pursue this as an alternative to ECT because I would experience unpleasant side effects from the medical procedure (memory loss, difficultly learning new things, migraines, etc). We were informed that my insurance would not cover the treatments as they do not cover ‘bipolar-related depression’ for this treatment. I was devastated, completely dumb-founded and just cried my eyes out. These people are denying me a quality of life because my brand of depression doesn’t fit their cookie cutter requirements. We tried to implore them to no avail, they refuse to budge. We have decided to try and pursue Spravato as our secondary option, if they decline covering that I will have no choice but to become a brain-zapped, depression-less, happy zombie receiving ECT.
On top of all of this, I struggle with bathing and other self care. I just can’t do it, everything feels impossible. While I was manic, I would go to the gym every morning at 5:00. I lost so much weight and felt strong. Now I have gained all of that weight back and more. I am weak and when I eat, I do not eat well. I have fallen from what I consider was the pinnacle of my existence only to now be a poor-hygiened, weak, lazy, ambitionless woman. It tempts me to stop taking the lithium so I can experience the high of mania. Some days that temptation is irresistible, I just know it is dangerous. I once threw everything I owned away, bought a ticket to a place I’ve never been to and joined a cult-like organization while manic. I had never even been to an airport before, but I had no one to tell me I was going crazy. Now I do.
So instead of the high of mania, I live with my life threatening depression everyday. It’s unbearable.

I do hope it is okay that I speak about bipolar disorder, I apologize if I offend anyone.

Yesterday was particularly dreadful. It was my twenty fifth birthday. The only family I have is my husband and someone I considered to be my best friend. I didn’t really ask for anything for my birthday. We’re pretty poor, so not much can be done. All I really desired were loving words, something, some form of acknowledgement from the two most treasured people in my life. My husband told me happy birthday, he knows how difficult they are for me due to past experiences. I am so grateful for him. 
My best friend didn’t so much as give me a phone call or a text wishing me a happy birthday. I am hurt. I feel forgotten and disregarded. We chat on the phone all the time, I had even expressed excitement for my birthday a day prior. I don’t want my intrusive thoughts to win, but I’d be a liar to say I didn’t spend a good long time staring at the floor in my bathroom wanting to just disappear. It just meant a lot to me, that someone would think of me. I am usually up front with how I feel to her, but I don’t know about this one.

I'm miserable, anxious, stressed and full of regret

I havent had a relationship for four years, I'm lonely as fuck, but 3 years ago I met someone, it didnt end up going anywhere and it left me feeling even worse. And I dont know if it's because of my own experiences or because of the relationships I've been around (parents divorced, friends never seem to be really happy in relationships), but I dont think I'm ever going to be able to really allow myself to have something like this.
I'm trying to start a business, it is stressing me out to no end, I constantly have a headache, and its causing me financial ruin, but I cant quit on it, because without it I have nothing, I'm worth nothing, I have no other potential prospects in life, and my family would be immeasurably disappointed.
I dont have money/time/energy to do any of my hobbies anymore.

I'm sad because I'm sad, like I know that I'm wasting time being depressed, but at the same time I cant be happy, i just cant, I've really tried, and I'm getting worried that this is all their is, and at some point when I'm older I'll realise i just wasted my whole run, and i dont get another shot.
I dont have any super close friends anymore, it feels like everyone has drifted away.

This is the first time I've really put all my problems into words for someone else to see, I hate doing it because when I do I feel like such a weak, pathetic piece of shit, like I should just be able to man up and deal with it, and this makes it even worse, I cant get any proper help because I'm completely incapable of communicating.

My family fragmented when I was a young child. There was physical/emotional abuse in the home that only intensified and mutated as our family fell apart. My siblings and myself ended up in different homes that were each subjected to various unhealthy circumstances. 

I was never the A+ kid at school, but I did well enough to not really stand out. I began to really struggle during my parents divorce. I was shamed for doing poorly in school and was not given an opportunity to have any additional tutoring to catch up, most specifically with math. Even to this day I get anxiety when certain things are explained to me, as though I can consciously feel my brain not absorbing the material.

I ended up being removed from my father's house due to physical abuse (although there were different types of abuse occurring in both homes) and I went to live briefly with my mother and then eventually with my older sister due to my mother's inability to be a functional parent. 

In all of the chaos I dropped out of high school. I was able to get my first job at 16 and obtained my GED at 18. I went to Job corps due to being on the verge of homelessness at 18. I got my CNA license, but found that type of work was too much to handle on top of my depression and anxiety. 

I worked various jobs in the food service industry and retail before committing to Welding at my local trade school. I struggled at first, but was able to graduate after about 15 months with a certification in TIG welding. I was extremely proud of myself for completing such a difficult program. I think something like 40 percent of people that started the program actually completed. 

I was not prepared for how poorly I would do in the field. My struggles with math suddenly became extremely apparent, and I felt like I was trying to read a different language when I looked at blueprints. I was let go from 5 or 6 jobs before I accepted that I had wasted almost two years in pursuit of a career that was ultimately a complete waste of time. 

Since then I worked for 6 years in customer service. I have always been a very hard worker and I managed to get promoted several times before being laid off in Jan 2021 due to the company sending our jobs to the Philippines.

I am currently working night shift in a rehabilitation facility. While the job itself is tolerable, I am still barely scraping by economically. I don't really know what path to take at this point to get into a better position for myself and my family. 

Does anyone have any recommendations for jobs/careers that are good for those struggling with anxiety/PTSD/depression? I don't have time for full time school right now between work and my other responsibilities. I think I could manage something part time or possibly some type of certification course. 

Again, I apologize for the length of this post. Any advice is very much apprectiated.

In my case the depression started a year and a half ago, I had very low energy and was almost bedridden. This tiredness was my only symptom, I wasn't sad or anything. I was put on Venlafaxine at first, which worked for about a year and then it stopped working. When it stopped working I was again tired with no energy. And then last summer I got hospitalized and was put on Anafranil(a much stronger antidepressant) and this also worked until December of last year, when it stopped working. Again I had no energy, but on one of the days I tried eating **sunflower seeds** (it's a romanian habbit) and after a few hours I saw that I had more energy.

It was easy to narrow down as I was eating a very restrictive diet. I immediately started eating about 200g of peeled sunflower seeds every day for about the first week and then started eating less and started taking **tryptophan** (the tryptophan I'm taking also has b6 and magnesium if that somehow matters) with the seeds to try to boost my serotonin and for now it's working and I have energy.

Hope this helps others too.

IMPORTANT, be careful if you start taking tryptophan when you are on antidepressants because it can cause serotonin syndrome. I asked my doctor and he said to start taking it in small doses.

975,I think I have depression,4,10thi65,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/10thi65/i_think_i_have_depression/,3,"Im a 16 year old male and i've only talked about this with my sister and I want to tell my friends but I don't want to say anything without it being an actual problem. I don't want to tell them and it turns out I don't have depression. Most days i don't get out of bed, only for food, toilet or drumming. Even if I do get food i don't eat much.

Last year my dad got overheated and shouted at me to get out of his life, over the years i've had a few problems with him, arguments, fights although at the time I didn't know he was autistic. We didn't talk most of that year and I got stressed. I started to vape, but stopped as soon as things with my dad got better. Now things with my dad are really good. But i've started to vape again, I have gone back to it before but thats only been in fights with my dad.

Im part of a friend group of 7 and yet most days I feel alone and sad. I love my friends my life would be so different without them but I feel like i'm there but not when we hang out. Most of the time instead of hanging out with my friends i'm out drumming in the music rooms.

Out of my 6 friends i'm only really good friends with 3 of them. (I'll use fake names) Leo and holly and dating while my other good friend Amber is also in a relationship and her girlfriend is also in our friend group. Amber is bisexual and I feel as though she pulls me into reality most of the time. It took me a while to realise i have a crush on her. She makes me happy.

But this dynamic of my 3 best friends all in relationships makes me feel alone, of course they're not doing it on purpose. I want to tell them whats going on with me how i've started vaping again, how i feel, but i don't want to make a problem where there isn't and i don't know if there is a problem.

My sister says that the reason i cant tell my feeling properly might be because of my dad. Because of his autism he can't tell emotion well at all and can't control his own emotion well. So when he would shout or scream at me he would see it as talking at a normal level and when i would start crying he would instantly switch up and be comforting. My sister says that because I was at such a young age i got confused about my emotions and so that is why it's hard for me now to tell if i have depression or not.

It's been a few months since reconnecting with a group of friends of 15 years. Last year I had a nervous breakdown and lashed out on/cut off everyone I knew while caring for a couple of terminally ill relatives. My best friend Dee is the only one who reached out after a year, even after our bad argument. One of the first things she said was that her and John had dated while I was gone and almost got together. John is one of the guys in the group. We've had a crush on each other for years but there was always something about him that held me back from dating him.

My intuition was right it seems because last month I saw him groping Dee then pull her behind the wall of the next room. He was groping and kissing me just minutes before but I pushed him off. We were all dancing/drinking one night at her place with her brother Rod. I had noticed Dee and John flirting all night but ignored it. Though others in the group notice it too, they both insist that they are just friends. I saw him pull her behind a wall after they were arguing/flirting, then they became very quiet for a bit. Moments later Dee asked me to go buy more alcohol with her brother Rod. Part of me felt like they wanted to be alone but since I wasn't paying for anything that night I knew that my contribution was driving. We take turns like that in general or if one of us is broke. John bought the first round, Dee had to stay home since her daughter was sleeping, and Rod was going to pay so this is how I justified her asking me to go with him at the time and she said something similar later when I confronted her about this. I started crying on the drive with Rod and confessed what I just saw. He was comforting me but also proposing that we should kiss too. I think this is because he's always liked me, had some liquid courage in his system, and/or maybe was upset hearing about his sister and best friend possibly fooling around. I felt like a gullible idiot and I admit, wanted to get back at them. Since I was buzzed and very emotional (got my period the next day) I kissed Rod. I did not mean for Dee and John to see but they walked out to the car once we got back and saw us. For a while everyone acted like nothing happened until John angrily slammed my car door and walked home across the street (they are all neighbors).

When Dee first reached out to me she said she wanted to be a good friend and told me that during this year i've been gone, her and John dated and almost got together. I've tried telling them both that I would be so incredibly happy for them if they got together but they insist on just being friends after all. At first Dee told me that I didn't see what I saw, then that they were just dancing, then that he kissed her but she pulled away. John told me that they were just dancing, but told Rod that they did kiss. I am trying to respect my friend's privacy because at the end of the day we are all single and that is not my man. Dee had been pushing me to give him a chance, saying that he has always been in love with me. The week prior John and I slept together for the first time but were drunk and it was not good. He was also talking about starting to date. That is why I've been so confused/upset but I believe maybe that night we all got caught up in the moment and alcohol. The way Rod puts it is we all have our urges. That is why he does not mind that they are not telling him everything, but he is upset with John for trying to get with his sister and me, her best friend, at the same time.

Dee and her brother have helped a lot with my depression - for supplemental income they vend beer and other stuff at sports events/concerts. They invite me and other friends every month so we can all make money and memories. They also invited us to a family vacation in December. That we should all get an airbnb and spend the week together. Does this mean they are my real friends and Dee is just trying to save my feelings? When I slept with John he proposed that it stays between us. I agreed because I was embarrassed about being seen as promiscuous since I have been involved with many guys in the group over the years. I found out later that John had told Rod about us sleeping together and he told Dee. When Dee asked me what happened that night with John I guess she had already known and was waiting for me to tell her but I did not. Since I was not honest with Dee when I slept with John that night should I just let all this go? At this point I just do not know who/what to believe or who to trust but maybe it is none of my business anyways right? I've heard that we can have different types of friends like some we don't completely trust or share every single value with, but we have a good time with them and enjoy other activities/outings together. Then others that we do confide in and tell everything to, etc. I thought these were those types of friends but maybe not?",1675476076.0

For me, I can understand because I too have depression but a lot of the things that trigger it/cause it are life experiences/situations etc. 

In the case of my grandma her depression is purely a medical thing, I mean to say she has had little to no trauma in her life and she lives a relatively stress free life with loving family although more isolated now that she and my grandfather cannot drive. 

My mother is planning on flying out to stay with her and my grandpa for a while in hopes of comforting her. But here's the thing... This is not the first time my mother has had to stay with them because of my Grandmother's depression and my mother feels quite hopeless sometimes to help. 

When my grandmother talks she goes over the same things she's said for years but my mother never feels like anything she could say to comfort her makes any real difference. My mother and other members of that side of the family can be quite reserved emotionally and not very physically affectionate.

This is just a vent post about people who try to help but when they notice how bad the situation really is goes quiet or just stop talking in general  


I've been kinda fucked up for about 3 or so months not being able to sleep or such and I've decided to just post this on reddit and see how it goes, I'm not looking for help (not really that kind of post considering the point of this in the first place) or am actively suicidal and thinking of ways to kill myself, so please don't assume anything bad too much.  


grammar is gonna be bad, its just a quick vent post

  
I've had 2 situations during these shitty times where I would get people who noticed I'm fucked up one way or another and say things like ""say anything"" or ""ill be here to help"", etc but when I vent to them and actually try their tips and whatever it just feels like they try to disassociate from me the moment they know its worse than they think it is. It just makes me super mad because they try to pry for help, I accept it and when I vent or such I just lose a friend i've known for a while. Every time this happen it just gets worse and worse and I kinda just think, ""Is it really worth it venting to people in general? Shouldn't i just keep it in like i've done before?"" The thing that's keeping me sane are those same people and I'm losing them if i really tell them the problems i have if they pry in.  


For example, the first situation was a friend who saw my cuts and I was venting to them after they wanted me to talk about it, afterwards I've noticed they've stopped talking to me at all. I should've learned from then to not talk but I guess I was really desperate for help and that lead into the second situation  


The second one was when they noticed I haven't slept much, they said they would help and gave me some tips and such which i listened to. They said that if i'd ever need to vent thats fine but I truly don't know anymore since when I did vent it's just no response like the other person.   


Maybe it's just me, and I don't really say too much when im venting since it's noting crazy and I really don't want to go to a professional or therapy for it (moreso cant) and it's not like I always think about killing myself (mainly because i've accepted that I'm just gonna be fucked for a while now and if it happens it happens)  


Eitherway, maybe it is my fault and I should keep quiet, maybe i just should shut up and say ""ok but im fine"" it makes me wanna fucking scream when i lose someone i actually had a great relationship with but they just go quiet and leave me after i talk about my problems.  


Just venting, nothing much :P hope everyones reading has a good day, at least better than mine i guess... It's probably kinda ironic to post this in the help subreddit
