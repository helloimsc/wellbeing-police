0,Trolls and general internet safety,326,upnx11,selfharm,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/comments/upnx11/trolls_and_general_internet_safety/,32,"Hi all,

&#x200B;

We have been getting an increase of reports about trolls, creeps and overall horrible people dming users, and we just want to jump on this ahead of time

**Tl;Dr** \- stranger danger, don't believe everything you read on the internet, don't feed the trolls, we love you - Mod Team

&#x200B;

**Not long enough,** ***will*** **read (Nle;Wr):**

First and foremost **do not feed the trolls**. Trolls want a reaction out of you, they want some sort of feedback that what they've said/done has upset you, and responding in any way, *even to mock their attempts*, feeds them, and that's not what we want. 

1. Ignore the troll
2. Report their account (you can send a report on [reddit.com/report](https://reddit.com/report))
3. Block them so they can't continue to message you
4. (Optional) If you want, you can message the modmail with their username so that we can keep an eye out for them, but our advice will usually be to report to the admins and let them deal with it

The same applies for creeps who ask for pictures or in some way sexualise harming. **Do not engage with them**. Report and block them, don't interact with them in any way shape or form. They want to upset you and if they know they've got to you it'll motivate them to continue and maybe encourage them to look for another target

&#x200B;

In terms of internet safety, you shouldn't really be talking to strangers, you don't know who they are and anyone could lie about their age/gender/sexuality/location/species/opinions on [pinapple on pizza](https://imgur.com/gallery/tinP4)/etc.

You should always steer on the side of caution; don't reveal information about you that shows you're a potential target and take anything said to you with a pinch of salt. This doesn't mean that everyone you speak to is trying to hurt you, but it's better safe than sorry when it comes to your wellbeing and safety

&#x200B;

This goes without saying, but I'll say it anyway: you are worth so much more than those trolls. You're amazing people and we want to make sure you're safe. Your safety is the reason why this community was made in the first place and the best way we can ensure that is if we all look out for each other, and look out for ourselves too

/r/selfharm is a safe space and we will do everything in our power to keep it that way, but we need your help keeping it the emo-paradise that we have come to know and love so much. Report, block, and keep being awesome!

Love, 

The mods",1652554825.0
1,"""just go to a doctor"" is horrible advice in a lot of situations",110,11uteo2,selfharm,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/comments/11uteo2/just_go_to_a_doctor_is_horrible_advice_in_a_lot/,18,"Whenever anyone asks for medical advice, particularly if it's a moderately deep cut/etc, all the comments are filled with people saying ""go to a doctor."" While I understand that sometimes that is necessary to prevent further harm, IT IS NOT ALWAYS AN OPTION. Financially, situationally, geographically - or even just the fact that it puts the poster at risk of institutionalization, which would compromise them or hurt them further. If the poster stresses that going to a doctor is not an option, people should respect that and give them other possible resources/options to help them. 

YOU DO NOT KNOW PEOPLES' SITUATIONS, so stop repeatedly telling them ""go to a doctor!"" when they have already said that they can't. They don't owe you an explanation, either. You are not helping if you are giving them 'advice' that they already said is *not an option.*

People just forget I exist. I've said things in groups and no one responds, then someone else says the same thing and people respond to the other person. I'm fine to people individually or in 3s, but any bigger and I just get drowned out and forgotten.

On friday in CS class someone randomly asked where I was, he looked around the room and realised I was sat 2 seats down from him. He said he didn't even know I was in the lesson. That would be fine if I was quiet and not talking to anyone, but I literally debugged his code for him half an hour earlier. It's like even if people listen to me, I make such little impression they end up forgetting my existence minutes later.

In one of my classes I'm sat in the front row with friends. My teacher gossips and goes on massive tangents with my friends but just kinda forgets I exist. I feel she sometimes gives me pity questions, she spends ages talking with everyone else and then asks me some really and dry irrelevant question, but when I answer she just goes ""ok"" and then continues talking with everyone else.

Most of the counselors, nurse practitioners, and psychiatrists, I have talked to believe I probably have BPD, and possibly bipolar.  I’m not sure what’s true but to be honest I believe it all.  I’ve had counselors say they believe I may have some childhood trauma but I don’t recall anything particularly bad happening when I was a kid, just the usual shit growing up.  I have some extreme regrets from when I was early teen, but I have been told that’s normal.  I also have done some things in recent years I am not proud of either. 

Last week I was released from a 5 night long stay in the psych ward for self harm. I have tried many meds over the last year, but I decided to harm myself again. (currently on: buspirone, lexapro, Hydroxyzine, and lamotrigine.  I also smoke weed and occasionally use mushrooms.) Sometimes I want to just be done with everything and tonight that thought was extremely overwhelming more than most.  I almost checked out.

I haven't been able to laugh genuinely in so long and when my partner of two years came to visit me only a few weeks ago I felt it more as a nuisance than anything (don't get me wrong, I love them with my whole heart but all I was thinking is ""why the hell are you here with me right now? don't you have anything better to do with your life than hang out with a self-destructive loser?"")

It's terrible, I know. i just don't understand how people have it in their hearts to even tolerate me.

I'm pretty well acquainted with self harm whether it be cutting, burning myself with scalding water, smoking weed until I throw up, or starving myself for days on end. I understand that what I do is harmful, I understand that what I'm doing to my body is just killing me faster, but I can't find it in me to stop.

Everytime I self harm I feel bad- mentally and physically. I feel bad about harming myself in the first place because there are people in my life that wouldn't want me to do that. They'd want me to get help and support and do whatever I can to make myself feel better. But why do they care? Why are there people around me that want to help me and be friends ""just because""? They can't see anything, I'm still alive, so why the hell do they care about what I do in my free time?

I guess my question is: Is there anyone that knows and acknowledges that what they are doing is wrong, knows they should stop and wants to stop but just can't/doesn't. I am not addicted to any of this (at least I'm 90% sure I'm not), I hate how it makes me feel afterwards, but I just can't stop.

TL;DR I got hella depression and am borderline abusing myself because... why not. Just wondering if anyone else has similar experiences?",1679176079.0

Not only because well there wasn't an intent of living or maybe how there was some questionable factors that made you unsure of how long you would survive. 

it gets so much harder to hide as you get older, at this point im not almost 1 year clean for myself. ive only lasted that long because being an adult just makes this entire thing feel so much worse. yk... with relationships and everything. i don't wanna make anyone feel guilty just because i exist with issues that can be physically seen.
there is nothing more i want than to relapse every fucking day. no, i don't care about progress at all. some days sure i can forget about its existence but others not so much. it feels like im getting closer and closer to doing it every time i have an urge. sure i have a kit for harm reduction for when i do so happen to do it, but I'd rather have that kit than cause life threating infection. 
i don't want the people i fuck to see, i don't need coworkers or family or anyone to see. i don't mind the healed scars, its just the bright red that screams at people that im mentally unwell. i wish i could just magically snap out of it. ty for reading if u got this far ♥️",1679196640.0

I would love to hear from those who have overcome self-harm and what their journey looked like.

I am aware that self-harm is a complex behavior influenced by different triggers, thoughts, emotions, and addictive tendencies. Specifically, I'm curious about the specific thoughts and emotions that can lead to self-harm, why it tends to repeat, and whether it serves as a distraction or replacement for overwhelming feelings. Additionally, I'm interested in exploring the sense of agency and the addictive nature of self-harm, including why it becomes an urge or a source of dopamine release.

Ultimately, I'm eager to understand what happens before and after self-harm, including the specific triggers, thoughts, emotions, and feelings that may follow and the path to self healing. I welcome all perspectives and insights on this topic.",1679183082.0

When her mom picked her up after school she rushed to get answers.

""Mommy, do you know a lot about Vincent van Gogh?"" She asked. Her mom was startled. Her girl asking about her favorite painter at this age?

""I actually did a presentation about him in sixth grade."" She looked at her curious daughter, not sure to tell her the gruesome detail everyone already knows about.

""You know he was really poor right?"" Mandy didn't know that. Everyone buys his paintings, how can he be poor?

""He also cut of his ear, and wasn't happy. He tried to end himself in one of the beautiful fields he painted.""

This happened last evening. I yelled sharply from the window for her to come inside. She came in crying but I told her I was sharp just so I seemed like the “bad guy” and I just wanted to remove her from the situation fast. 

She was still a little upset and blamed me for not calling her in sooner. I explained that no one can read her mind and she needs to find her voice and speak up once she was asked questions about her scars. “You know what? That’s kind of personal and it’s dinner time anyway. See you tomorrow.”  She nodded and at least seemed to be listening. 

I continued that we have a responsibility to protect innocent kids and we can’t glamorize these things. I reassured her it’s nothing to be ashamed of and again, not mad at her. 

But I am scared as hell. Scared that she’s unknowingly grooming these kids to become cutters.  She likes to hang out on the front yard and the younger kids all flock to her. I mean, I can’t tell her that she can’t go outside. 

So, I’m looking for advise here. When she wakes up, I expect she’ll want to talk because it happened close to going to bed. I’ve never punished or judged her self harm, but that was before younger kids who aren’t mine were involved. Should I tell her counselor? Should I let her outside only with supervision?

Anyways my older brother and I where going to get checkups and vaccines updates but for some reason my mom had a tendency to make both appointments at once so we shared the room. She also always came in and didn’t let us answer the docs questions. So we do the normal weigh and height shit and go to the room where I volunteer my brother to go first.

The funny things is the last questions were if I felt suicidal and if I felt ok and if life had meaning. I kid you not right after I answered they went straight to the vaccines update and lifted my sleeves.

The nurses stand back and look at me and my mom gets up and says we are leaving. We leave the room and my head is swimming and I’m back to the dream state but 10x worse. I felt like I wasn’t there, I don’t it’s hard to explain how I felt. Anyways my brother keeps saying what’s wrong with me and the car ride home is silent.

It doesn't seem that deep or big, so I'm surprised it looks like it goes down to the dermis, and I'm scared, especially with what this means for the future. I bet it's going to hurt later and I'm going to have to walk a lot...

Can I take a shower? If I can, should I avoid getting soap in it? Should I wait for it to stop bleeding (wouldn't it start bleeding again)?

And what would happen if I didn't take care of an infection? How painful would it be if I let myself die?

What if I left it open (no bandages or dressing) and let it scab? Would it even scab? Would it get infected, even if I'm careful (can't be careful because I'd have to hide it, meaning that pants would rub on it)?

My (28m) partner (36f) has self harmed this evening and I’m not sure how to move forward. I went and had a shower and then came out to her in the living room covered in blood with a blade in her hand. I took the blade off her and fetched some paper towel to stem the bleeding and clean some of it up.

She was triggered by us watching an old creative work of a friend of hers that in her words “had a character based on her that put her on a pedestal”. (For added context we’ve both been drinking since early afternoon, with this taking place around 10pm)

We’ve been dating for a little over a year and she has never mentioned self harming in the past or any previous struggles with it until this situation tonight. I have also never noticed any scars indicative of previous self harm. 

I have some understanding of the reasons people self harm and what they’re going through (I’ve self harmed in the past when I was around 16-17 years old while struggling with depression and have had past girlfriends who self harmed as well) but am at a loss as to how to deal with this.

I am all fit now. I do wish all of you the best, but for a brief moment in time I did feel your pain and I want you to know that it does go away. You are loved by so very many — even if you do not realize this. 

I am a scientist and graduate of M.I.T. — along with with universities — and I owe my life to two security guards whom noticed me acting strangely and had I not gone to the hospital that day I would’ve died that evening or the next day. I am now recovering from the ~5 weeks of damage to my body that first began with me falling and fracturing my skull on a marble tabletop. 

I revisited the scene recently and there was enough blood that I could have easily died from blood loss, but I’ll never know why. I have having the entire place renovated and then signing a 5-year lease to a Ukrainian family. The first year they pay no bills, receive a new van, and attend ESL courses at the local community college. I am actively purchasing two apartment complexes where one will be converted into a 16-room condo complex from a 38-room apartment complex. This will be income that will pay for the 32-room apartment complex that will house more Ukrainian families with the same conditions as the prior families. 

I do hope the best for all of you. I may have degrees in Chemistry, Computer Science, Physics and Psychology, but it is the latter that I am willing to utilize to assist anyone in need. 

If you’re a world-traveler like myself, you’ll know the numbers you are to reach in the event of a meltdown.

But now I've fucked up again and it's all my fault. I feel like I've done something terrible. I wish that when the urges got too bad I was able to remember how much worse the guilt is so I didn't give in. 

My mum triggered me again. I asked her for bandages the other day, and she freaked out on me, treating me like shit. So I talked with a mental health assessor about it. About how it made me feel really crappy. The mental health person tried to explain to my mum I might feel insecure about my cuts and that's why I wanna cover them with bandages and my mum laughed. She said I did this to myself, so I have to deal with it, because its all my fault. Which is true. 

But then she said something that really stung. She was like ""Oh your cuts aren't even deep enough for bandages anyway. They're barely even scratches. Theyre just paper cuts, arent they? You just need to air them."" And then she started venting about proper self-harm. About how my sister was so much worse than me and that she'd even had to take my sister to the hospital a bunch of times because of it. I wish she'd stop always comparing me to her. In her eyes, I'll never measure up.

And then in the car she kept on going on and on about how at least my sister tried to hide hers and come up with excuses instead of asking for bandages. My mum actively bought my sister medical supplies. I'm relying on stuff I've managed to steal from school. And she was saying how my self-harm isn't even real because I only do it because my dad used to make me watch him self-harm. I've told her I don't like her talking about that. But she does it anyway. 

I tried to get her to stop, and she just yelled at me. By some miracle, I managed to suppress my urges. But then today she picked me up from school and I was in a good mood. So I started telling her about my day, and how it went, and I mentioned literally once, that my knees hurt a bit. And then she went on this whole rant about how it's because I'm so lazy and I never use my legs and I never walk anywhere and it's all my fault that they hurt and how I never do enough, and I should complain because its all my fault. I wasn't trying to complain. I was just trying to tell her about my day. I tried to explain what I mean, even tell her about when I go to the gym, but she said I don't do that enough either. That basically nothing I do is enough. 

And it hurt. And then all the urges from yesterday came flooding back. And now I'm sitting here, just staring at what I've done. I cut a lot deeper this time. I know in my heart that it still won't be enough for her. My legs were shaking so bad I could barely control what I was doing. They're all gaping. They're not deep enough though. Not for her. I don't think they ever will be. I'm almost out of plasters, so soon enough she'll find out about my thighs when I bleed through by accident. Force me to show her. I don't know if I'll do if that happens. 

I've tried to get her to stop. I can be doing so well, things can be going great. But then she'll say or do something. Or she'll get mad. Or she'll threaten me or talk to me about how I'm not good enough and how I never will be. And then the next thing I know all I can see is red. But the red is me, coating my hands, my blade, and I'm shaking and I'm scared and I have to just pretend I'm not or she'll get mad again. I have to force my tears to evaporate and paint the perfect smile on my face which is forced upon me. 

The guilt is a lot worse than I remember it being. It really hurts. And I feel even worse because my friend asks me if I'm clean, and if I am they tell me how proud they are of me and really hype me up, but I haven't relapsed since they found out, so I don't know how they're going to react. I'm worried they'll be disappointed, or they'll start hating me too. 

I just wish I could make her stop. It's not like I can really blame my relapses on her. But she contributes to them. I've tried to put it gently and explain how much some of the things she says hurts, but she just gets madder. She treats me like shit every time I relapse. Giving me harder chores, ignoring me, yelling at me- she sometimes even gets my younger siblings involved. And now I don't know what to do. I was having such a good day and now I've ruined it.

Sh distracts me, it makes me feel like the emotional pain I feel is just a wound that will heal in afew days to weeks. It’s stupid and I have to stop. 
And life has given me so many loving people in my life but I’m losing it. 
My home is just falling apart and the insurance company is just taking its sweet time. Seeing everything my dad built, the only place our family lived at just deteriorating, is just so painful for some reason. One day I’m home chilling, and now I’m just never home. I’ve never been so homesick in my life. 
I’m thinking I’ll try and distract myself when I get temptations and let myself have cries and shut during showers, then once it’s the holidays I’ll take a break for myself. That way I’m not going to be stressed about study and such. But yea just needed to get it off my chest. Thank you guys.",1679065949.0

I loose control, fall back to the dark
Am scared to show and ask for your help
Why is it so easy to let you down
Slide to the floor as I’m bleeding out

The cold tiles burning my skin 
My throbbing veins crying within
The blood runs hot onto the floor
As I seek the relief of the blade once more 

Cutting again to not feel the pain
Bleeding out slow, feeling faint
Fall asleep crying tears of blood 
Cause all I want is the pain to be gone

Waking up at 5 am
Beginning to panic what if they see
Grab a rag start scrubbing the floor
Turn to make sure I locked the door

As I clean arms caked in blood
The panic sets in what have I done 
When they find out I’ll have let them all down
The guilt stings but the pain drowns it out",1679017532.0

I genuinely thought I was over self-harm, so it really goes to show how little you can trust your own thoughts and convictions. What's true for you one day might not be true the next day.

I frequently get the urge to hurt myself when I'm feeling upset, but I never act on it. It's almost like an intrusive thought - I rarely actually want to do that. But for some reason, I finally acted on it today and didn't even try to fight the impulse. I don't know why I did. Maybe I had the lingering desire all along and this was the breaking point. I don't have any regrets, it just got the job done and that's fine by me. I don't even feel anything to be honest, I just don't want it to develop into a full blown addiction again. At first, it was just a light scratch, but before I knew it, I grabbed a tool and inflicted so much damage. I suppose my biggest issue will be having to hide the wounds while they heal. Oh well.

They provided a bunch of links below including 1 for group therapy. They said I can do group therapy in the meantime before I have regular 1 on 1 appointments. 

Basically I have no idea how long my referral will take to get approved. It could take weeks or months, and because I didn't see what he included in the form I can't even make a guess. The stuff I said could either be taken incredibly seriously or not so seriously, it depends on how the doctor worded it.

Both seemed very disappointed, my mom asked questions about SHing (if I tried it before, other spots where I've SHed) and didn't really talk to me after that. My step-dad told me that I'm an idiot and that he had been through worse at my age and didn't harm himself. He also makes mean comments on purpose, checks my my arms everyday which annoys me 

Because of all this it makes me want to cut again but I'll get in more trouble.

I can't see my parents in the eyes because I feel so ashamed.

I thought that I could tell my honest unfiltered feelings to them but no, they've had it worse, I don't have any issues. 

Normally my parents are nice to me, my dad's really cool, he's a goofball but sometimes he's strict. He is quick to get angry with my mom when drinking though. My mom's kind and treats me good for the most part.

I tried my best hiding the marks on my arm. 28 cuts on my arm elbow down, they weren't deep cuts though, they would've healed in three weeks (if I could've hid them). 

They also took my knife:( I slept with it sometimes.",1679025785.0

She took the news well and was very kind, but I’m worried about how she will act around me. I finally decided to let her see them today because it was warm and I wanted to wear a t-shirt in the house. She’s seen the scars on my thighs, but they aren’t very noticeable because they were all surface level/epidermis. This time, it was my forearm (very stupid in the moment decision I made because it was easiest and I felt invalid not doing it there before which I know is wrong but it’s too late now lol), and they were all dermis. So, obviously, they’re fairly noticeable. Still reddish/pinkish even after months of being clean. 

She gasped when I showed it to her and said my name all sad, and she touched them (my brother was also in the room and he kinda just grimaced and looked away which is understandable but painful). This didn’t make me uncomfy because I have a good relationship with her, but it made me anxious and sad/guilty seeing her so upset and knowing I caused it. I thought it wouldn’t bother me to be uncovered around her but now I’m terrified that she’s going to treat me differently or be upset any time she sees me. 

I don’t know what to do - whether I should stick with long sleeves as long as possible/until they aren’t noticeable (which will take a long time) or just accept that my family will be uncomfortable and wear the T-shirt anyway. Very conflicted because I don’t want to disturb or throw off my family simply by being in the same room without long sleeves, but also don’t want to deal with being overheated 24/7.

I feel sad and upset at ourselves more than anything on this earth really, seeing my friends begin to destroy their physical body the same way we have, become aggressive at me for accidentally noticing, just because I value them as people in my life and can’t stand the thought those we consider our very closest friend(s) doing those same things to themselves. causing themselves possibly permanent irreversible damage too.

Knowing it could get worse for them too and even if they don’t ever intend to guilt me about it and are having a hard time, every time it makes me think we must be the worst person on earth for being unable to help them understand that I’ve gone through similar and felt similar anger towards others etc. about it and all that.

I haven't cut myself maybe 6-10 months now, I haven't really been keeping track of it. I started a few years back. First with the punching, then thumbtacks, then blades. Whenever I don't feel normal, I would cut, whenever I would feel happy, I would cut, whenever I would feel sad, scared, anxious, I would cut. It went on like that for months, started with once a week, who would get addicted to something you do 4 times a month?, maybe 2-3 times isnt that bad, 4,5,6, it went on until I wasn't counting how many times I have cut, but how many days I managed to stay clean. I still remember wearing pajamas and hoodies, I never imagined or even thought on how far I have traveled down the hole. 

&#x200B;

That was me, can I consider living a better life now? yes, ""you're fine now, you're ok"". good at studies, sports, and extracurricular activities, I am now good at everything I have to be good at. I feel comfortable for once. I always read about people here sharing their stories on how ""There is indeed light at the end of the tunnel"", people who had been doing it for years and managed to stay clean for a week, a month, a year, and a decade. I always envied them, with my life. 

&#x200B;

Maybe its not ok, maybe you're not doing so good. I have become a version of myself that is nothing inside, I dont feel like im a real person. No matter how many awards, money, attention, praises from strangers, love, or anything good. I just don't feel anything. At the start I treated this version of me as a strength. ""I went through everything a human can go through"". I feel pain? ""you have endured hundred of cuts"" Anxious?"" You have passed out before"" scared?"" you have voluntarily put a cold blade within your skin"" it was great. maybe not so much, I didnt notice it personally until people around me mentioned it. last year, I was on the 99th percentile the whole way, wake up at 3am- study until 5:30am, go to school at 6:30am, go home at 4pm, sports training until 9pm, study until 12am and repeat. Im still doing it now but I know I cant keep doing this, I am clean but at what cost, Im surviving on 3 hours of sleep everything, who knows how many mg of caffeine, I treat people around me shit, I have gone the whole way of not even knowing that my father has cancer, I dont feel love for anything, even those who clearly loves me, I dont feel happy or sad for anything. Every conversation I have is fake, every laugh, every movement. Even when Im alone. I want to laugh, I want to cry, I want to feel excited, and maybe just this one I want to cross the tunnel once again to even feel something.

I can't barely remember the original reason I started, 10 years ago when I was entering high school. I wanted to hurt myself to express some emotions I didn't understand I guess.

but now I'm an adult. whenever I feel really down, or drink too much, or just feel hurt about something, I want to do it. I want to feel it. I've been mostly over with it years ago but every here and there go back to it, or at least want to. I can't figure out why it still crosses my mind, why it sounds satisfying. 

I have some more permanent scars and have on some level (though I try accepting it) feel ashamed and even more ashamed of the idea of adding to it. so why would I feel like I want to? is this feeling addicting?

When I found this out I was already doing horrible mentally and was with-drawling off Xanax. My girlfriend at the time was ignoring me Bc I was mad she was ignoring me in my time of need. 

I had already cut before but only superficial lil baby cuts when I thought my problems were bad. This time I really went for it.

47 cuts in 5 days. Many of which are still red today. 6 on my forearm, 20 on my shoulders and 20 on my thighs. One of which is quite deep and bled for a entire night. I stopped for a while after that. Then I was having troubles with my new girl and cut once or twice usually not deep. But then I found out she fucked my best friend and my other friend and promptly had another break down and carved 6 more into my forearm. Life was shit for 2 months after. I didn’t feel anything, didn’t interact normally with anyone and generally isolated myself. It was largely like that for much of the year after the first break down too. I was a shell of myself. A once popular kid reduced to nothing. 

However, I’ve now moved out of my hometown. I have no girlfriend, no attachments, no nothing except a passion for ENVS and Ecology and I longboard and snowboard when I feel tempted to cut. I feel I am starting a new and better life and it’s largely Bc I haven’t been cutting myself recently. I hope once they fade I can get tattoos and try to forget this aspect of my life. I hope everyone going through it reads this and finds hope. 

Ik it’s still early but it feels different this time. Last time I knew I would do it again the next winter but this time I won’t go home and will stay out west and I really want to beat this addiction. My best advice to y’all is to try new shit and expeirences and find a passion. Don’t go back to old stuff like exes or people you once hated. Find new people and find something you love and put your all into it.

They helped me look, they didn't have any at the stores with self checkout, other ones we had to be ID'ed. But they were so helpful for looking for one.

Then after college, I asked my older brother for his spare hobby knife set. Using the art project excuse and he said yeah no problem u can keep it. I was like, excited at first?

It cuts stupidly easy, I'd used a pencil sharpener blade for a long time. With no pressure, the knife can cut to the same depth I had to press a bit on with the sharpener blade. I was relieved that I had this, and sorta got really light because I fucking got a knife to use.

Though I ended up crying before even using it because I saw myself in my bedroom mirror, ecstatic over getting a proper hobby knife with several different blade ends. My friend supportively helped me in search of one earlier thinking it was for art. my brother GAVE me the current one I'm using now thinking it was for art.

I'm scared I've gotten to this point.

Didn't wait a few weeks for proper healing, and just went to my arm. 

upper inner arm, at least.

I started self harming at 12, with scratching, hitting or scissors. The cutting I think was at 14/15? always sparingly. maybe every few months. Now I'm 17 and it's weekly or monthly. I can't wrap my head around the concept that I've realised in a few more years, I could probably cut to a point of hospitalisation.

Her reasoning is that she wants to see how much there is - which i don’t think is THAT important at this point… 

I don’t want to show because I’m already an insecure wreck of a person and I think my scars are kind of ugly, also I lied about being clean to her so I can’t let her see until and the scabs and shit are gone.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for being so kind. Everyone here is valid, and I mean no disrespect with this vent. It’s how I felt about myself at that current time, not about anyone else. You deserve love and support no matter what. 
.


I feel so inferior. 

My sc*rs aren’t even “real” ones. They’re flat or indented and barely have any color to them. Plus, they disappear so quickly and easily and it makes me feel like it’s not even “real” sh. 

I know a lot of us have posted about this, and I do apologize, but I really need to get this off my chest. I was taught by an ex roommate that “real sh is permanent” and my sc*rs “weren’t even that bad or real”. Once, I had given up on trying to get better, and had been actively trying to get the “real results”. But I know it’ll never happen. Besides, the more I push it the more it becomes difficult to quit. 

I feel so selfish for wanting permanent ones, yet at the same time, it’s been ingrained in my mind by someone else that I’m an imposter. The more I think about it the more guilty I feel for not “punishing myself enough”. 

I question my own reality and what I’ve been through, and whether I’m just dramatic or not. And the last few days have been really difficult. 

It’s as if anything that happened to me to cause the urges in the first place was all my fault and I am just pathetic. 

I had a dream twice that it got super bad, and I don’t know how to feel about it. Could it be related to how I feel? I don’t know. It’s just tiring.

287,I just fucked up hardcore,8,11sh5vl,selfharm,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/comments/11sh5vl/i_just_fucked_up_hardcore/,1,"TW: drug use, talk of wound

So I've got bipolar disorder, and for the past 8 weeks I've been in a severe depressive episode. It's one of the worst depressive episodes I have EVER had. I was diagnosed at 13 (but started showing symptoms around 10yo), and I'm now 37. I've been self harming regularly, by cutting, by starving myself, and by taking loads of illicit drugs. I'm also married to an amazing man who is trying so fucking hard to support me.

So on Monday I took a shit load of meth, and just let myself forget about how fucked everything is. I stayed awake until 5am yesterday. I managed to sleep for 2hrs, before having to get up and deal with a real estate agent, then go to a drs appt. After my drs appt I decided to spend the last of my money (which was supposed to be for groceries. Luckily this will force me to fast until tomorrow at the earliest) on buying some more meth, because when I'm high, my brain shuts the fuck up. So I got high again.  Because I was so exhausted, I spent the whole night laying in bed on the internet. At around 2am hubby came to bed, and went to sleep. By 8am the meth had worn off, and the depression came back with a vengeance. I spent 2 hours listening to my brain scream at me that I needed to cut. I tried to resist, but looking back I didn't want to resist, I wanted to cut. Cos if I was seriously wanting to resist I would have woken up hubby who was laying next to me. At 10am I gave in. I did a couple of deep styros on my forearm, which is just the depth I like. Then I decided I wanted to cut my thigh, so I did. But I fucked up. I cut WAY TOO DEEP. I hit beans. And not just a little bit of beans, this was a bean fiesta.

And I began to panic. I jumped up out of bed, trying to hold the wound closed so I didn't bleed all over the bed, and in the process I woke hubby up. Now he has self harmed in the past, so he doesn't judge me, but when he saw what I had done he freaked out. He started asking me why I didn't wake him up, and I couldn't give him a good reason. He immediately got the first aid kit, and began cleaning it up. Which was basically 45 minutes of trying to stop the blood. Then we put some steri strips and a dressing on it. 

Now we are sitting down watching tv, and I can just feel how upset he is that I didn't wake him up and see if he could help me, instead I cut really badly. He must feel like he is useless. I hate myself for making him feel this way. I know that if I had woken him up, and if we weren't able to stop the urge, he would have understood, and I would have still been able to cut. But instead I shut him out.",1678932845.0

She's 14, my grandparents adopted her when she was 3, and we took over her care when they passed.

I've become her favourite. This is not just me saying it, it's everyone. My dad says she looks at me completely different compared to everyone else. She was nervous when she was first adopted, and I was the first person allowed to touch her ears, the first person she barked at to sit on the floor with her. She acts completely differently to me compared to everyone else.
(Tw suicide here, nothing graphic)

She's the only reason I didn't go through with my attempt last year.

We had just had another dog put down, I had failed a medical for a job and it was just the last thing that ticked me over. I had a plan, stayed up all night to leave early in the morning. I went downstairs into the living room to leave my letters, and she came up to me headbutting me for strokes. I sat on the floor with her, she looked up at me everytime I stopped stroking her. It was then I released I couldn't leave her. So I made a deal with myself, I wouldn't go through with the plan until after she goes.

I think part of me was hoping things would get better then, that it'll be a couple of years before she started suffering.

Well, now she's going to be gone this time tomorrow, I was talking to my counsellor just last week about how I am dreading her going because shes the only thing I have in life that I feel like needs me. Obviously my counsellor was concerned, she said it is something we are going to have to work through.

Welp, we're gonna be working through it during my appointment tomorrow, have a feeling she's gonna be a lot more concerned about my safety now.

My crush told my friend that he did it with some girl and you know I'm not mad about it but more so I'm upset because I got my hope all the way fucking up for the second time over dumb ass crush just because the slightest bit, and I mean the tiniest bit of ""affection"" or ""interest"" he shows me, I just take as something.

I don't understand why I do that, maybe because I just want to experience something like dawg, I don't fucking know why I get so worked over something like that. I want to feel like someone fucking likes me but I know that probably won't ever be the case. Hell, I can't even bring myself to like myself. But I'm trying hard to present myself well enough and put myself out there in case somebody does find me at least a bit interesting.

But I just know that won't be the case at all. But I'm tired of dealing with these types of feelings if imma be honest. I'm trying to keep well because the urges are coming back, and so much has happened and I've been piling up a lot of stress for a while now. But I feel like this might be my last straw. I don't know what hell is wrong with me or my feelings but I don't want this to be my last fucking breaking point. 

I haven't done it for almost 5 months now and I don't wanna break that but I just don't know what else to fucking do.",1678940798.0

Basically, I normally self-harm at the top of my arms in spring/summer so it can be covered by short sleeves but I've got a trampoline competition on Saturday which requires me to wear a leotard. (Before anyone says it, yes I do have to wear it.  I'll get penalised if I don't.  I hate it so much and all my friends think that a boy wearing a leotard is weird).  I obviously don't want any fresh cuts on show while I'm competing so I have been self-harming on my leg for the past few weeks.

Truth be told, I CANNOT WAIT for Saturday evening when I can self-harm on my arm again.  I feel awful that I'm excited about it, but I am.  Cutting my legs hurts much more, and I don't do it for the pain, I do it so that I can turn my thoughts into something real.

The other issue is that, while I won't have fresh cuts, I will have scars at the top of my arm.  Scars that my parents don't know about.  I'm half hoping that I don't win anything so that I don't have to be presented anything in front of everyone, and that no photos will be taken of me.  I'm more nervous about my scars than I am about the competition, which is saying something because I'm absolutely shitting myself over this competition XD",1678918476.0

And we both have our own mental problems. I know she has some kind of emotional things going on but sometimes shes makes me want to die. The big problem is that shes my favourite person. I know the concept of a favourite person is somthing a person with bpd or bd (i cant remember what one) has, and im not trying to self diagnose but im so obsessed with her. I always want to be around her and talk to her and make her happy even if it hurts me or others. But recently she and i kinda had an argument. I have autism and adhd so im extremely impulsive and one night i was realy tired and  impulsive and i thought that her being my favourite person was a crush so i messaged her and said “her this is one of “op”s friends and they like you. After that i fell asleep. She obviously was confused and said “uh k” and the next day i read over it and apologised alot. Ill copy what i said from the convo so you know what happend. What i say will be said like “this” and what she said will be said like :this: 

“Hey mercy i just wanted to say that the person who messaged you that was me i wanted to know your reaction and i did it with some others too. Im sorry idk why i did it i was tired and impulsive im realy sorry if i made you uncomfortable” 

:I thought it was you bro, it was obvious but it’s okay:

“Im so sorry idk why i did it ive been wondering what your reaction to that kind of thing would be for a while i felt like i played with your feelings im so sorry i hope this doesn’t ruin anything”

: What? I don’t like you, you haven’t done anything? :

After that i said sorry a bunch of times and she stoped responding. A day later i asked her if everything was ok and she said i made her feel awkward. I felt terrible and when i went to school for the whole week she ignored me. I thought she hated me and relapsed so many times thinking she hated me. I tried to kms so many times cause i couldn’t live without her. It went on for about two weeks and i talked to a bunch of my other friends about it and they all said she was being toxic and rude but to me this was normal as she usually ignores me if i do something wrong. But today she waved at me in class and sat next to me on the bus. That was the most communication i had done with her for what felt like months. I got so exited and started stimming from excitement a-lot and people started staring. Then on the bus ride home i sat on a two person seat and tat one the window side. The bus was really full and she asked if she could sit next to me. The problem is that i love her so much and practically cant live without her but the other problem is that she made me relapse. And i mean the didn’t make me personally but she stressed me out so  much that i did it. I feel like that one song called step on me. If you don’t know the song ill link it.

to sum it briefly, when i feel my emotions a ton at once, i feel like there isn’t much to do but hit my head on things or smack it until the internal pain subsides. i don’t really do it on purpose because when i think clearly i think about how stupid i look and how i acted. but i cant control myself when i feel an immense amount of anger or sadness. 

sometimes i think i hit it a bit too hard, like when i hit it against a wall or something, and i’m scared that the way i feel now is gonna impact my brain in the future. 

there aren’t much options in regard of receiving help, like a doctor or a therapist, but i don’t know how to fix this given i feel so lonely 24/7 and my emotions are constantly taking control; ultimately making me despise myself way more.

I thought I'd feel pretty bad after doing it, cuz last time I felt like shit (guilty/stupid/..), but actually this time I felt kinda ..nothing? Like, I don't care anymore.

I have many undiagnosed mental issues, and many of the symptoms from those are my reasons for cutting, scratching and biting. 
One of those symptoms is... I do not believe we live in reality. 

So, when I first started college in 2017, a philosophy teacher told the class about the theory of dualism, and his example was ""triangles"". In the realm of the soul, we all know the concept of a triangle, but in the physical world it cannot exist because once you draw a triangle, it is not the concept anymore, but a specific one.
Long story short, I started drawing triangles on the hand of my SH dedicated arm and it helped me feel grounded in this ""physical world"".

Last night, I cut a triangle into my arm. 
I had been trying to quit for a while, that was my longer streak, 2 weeks I believe. I feel so ashamed of myself. 
I'm scared of myself and don't want to hurt my body but my obsession with triangles bled into my baby cut syndrome.
My boyfriend doesn't know I SH and told me explicitly he never wants me to do it.

332,I just relapsed (sh trigger),1,11sjpus,selfharm,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/comments/11sjpus/i_just_relapsed_sh_trigger/,0,"I’m so sick and tired of my life. I don’t want any sympathy just need to get this out because I feel like there’s no one I can tell this to. Everyone around me sees me as this happy person who loves herself and sees the best in anything. I’ve never so much as even cried to anyone. I’ve been so good at faking this for so long I feel like if I tell someone they wouldn’t take me seriously.

Im writing this post sh. I feel really stupid that I relapsed but today I just feel like shit and I don’t know why. I haven’t done anything like this for years. I really thought I was doing better. I’m diagnosed with adhd, GAD, and my bulimia has recently become anorexia.

Day after day I’m losing any motivation to do anything and I feel more useless than I’ve ever been. I go to a really good university that is the best school for my major. I used to be a straight A student. I used to be president of clubs and played sports. This was in high school. Now I almost never leave my house. I can’t get myself to do anything I don’t want to do, and all my friends have just been saying “you just need to do your work”, and I can’t explain why but I just can’t. I can’t focus or concentrate on anything and I hate myself for it. 

I think I want my friends and housemates to reach out and ask me if Im ok. No one has but I can’t blame them because I never talk about my real feelings. Recently I’ve been starting to think they don’t like me either. I know this isn’t really true but it’s a thought that’s constantly in my head. I feel like I used to be a lot closer to my friends but recently I feel like they’ve been excluding me from things. They go out to eat, study, shop, and party without me. All of them planned different trips and didn’t invite me. I know this is all in my head and that they love me but I just can’t shake off these negative feelings.

I don’t want to tell this to my family too. Ik my brother would tell my parents and this would break their hearts. They love me so much and I feel like I’m the worst child. I’m constantly falling short of their expectations but they always tell me how much they love me. I remember the look on their faces when I told them that I’d been purging and I never want to see that face again. They were doing their best to not cry but they just said they loved me and would help me get better.

I do have a therapist, but tbh I would never tell her this stuff. I’m really scared she would send me to a facility. I just want to finish undergrad before I commit to any serious professional help. I know I need it asap, but I can’t throw away my education. 

Anyways thanks for listening if anyone does, just writing this out made me feel better. I’m in a very safe and loving environment. I’m not a threat to anyone or a serious threat to myself I promise I  will get help before it’s too late. Just needed to vent.",1678939755.0

Safe to say after taking the drug test I was given medication to prevent seizures and was sedated almost immediately. I woke up the next day in the ICU after being given two drips that were solely about Keeping me sedated so I wouldn't go into shock with my condition, I was told by almost every nurse I talked to that I was lucky to have made it. I was in a very critical condition and if I took any more than I did or waiting any longer before calling 911 I probably wouldn't be here right now typing this. After all that I spent 4 days in an inpatient unit in the same hospital which was given due to the severity of why I was at the hospital in the first place.

I just feel like I don't take my self-harm seriously(?), I've been clean from cutting for around a month, yet feel like I could relapse at almost any moment. And back when I did cut (more often), the cuts weren't even that deep, just enough so I would start to bleed and feel the pain. The scars aren't too visible, if you look closely you can see where they were. I just feel like I wasn't even trying to inflict any pain, just doing it so I could feel something. But I knew that I did it because I felt like I deserved it.

But cutting isn't the only way I harm myself, I usually starve myself (quite often), mostly because I don't like myself as I am & I know I deserve it. It's become a habit, I usually skip breakfast and lunch and try to ignore the hunger until dinner, because I feel like I don't deserve it and that I would waste the meals. 

And whenever I do something wrong, whether it be a math question or I say something slightly mean, it's a slap/punch in the face to remind myself not to make another mistake. It has also become a habit, I've done it so frequently it's starting to annoy classmates, teammates and other people around me. But they don't really try to help, they just get angry at me for doing it and tell me to stop and never do it again. If only it was that easy.

I used to cut out of an escape from my depression,  I'd cut deep. I'd cut so bad that I'd need bandages. I stopped for 3 years.

 Now instead of orderly lines across my thighs that bleed through things, I'm making haphazard paper thin cuts across my chest, just barely drawing blood.
 It's exhilarating, but I know it's wrong. The problem is that the way I convinced myself it was wrong before was to say I didn't deserve the pain and that it wasn't a good way to criticize myself. But now that doesn't apply, I'm doing it out of masochism.

but also guilty in the sense thats im not going deep enough. its never gotten past styros but in the back of my mind its always ‘what happens if you go deeper?’. the thought never leave, im to scared that if i go any deeper ill get attached to it and i will get even sicker in my addiction. i cant talk to my parents because its somehow socal media made me start cutting. im to scared to bring this up to my psychiatrist because i feel like im to young to be dealing with this and he will tell my mum, ill end up being threatened with professional help which i stated multiple times i do not want to my mum when she found out i relapsed in sep 2022.

Her crush hasn’t been treating her well a week ago, though now her crush is treating her better too. She also has recurring headaches and anxiety attacks, and constantly felt that she isn’t enough, ugly, and a burden to everyone, though everyone told her she isn’t.

I worry about her so much, and I care about her so much. She isn’t taking care of her wounds, nor is she disinfecting her blade, which is old and rusty. So I bought plasters, alcohol wipes, and new blades (because I know she won’t stop self-harming, though I keep comforting her and told her she can come to me for anything and tell me anything, and she does, but she still does it). I tried to make up for every other best friend that she lost, I spent time with her whenever she wanted and whenever I could. I am better at studying so I taught her anything she didn’t know and made her study resources. She said she does it to cope, and to de-stress, to calm herself down, and to regain a sense of control.

I want to start creating more openness to talking about self harm, not at all in a glorifying way but in a way that might be easier for people who do sh can find support, feel heard, and maybe even help to learn how to stop one day if that's the goal. 

I have been self harming since 10, cutting since 12 but am now 25, had a 3 year break from 18-21 and now I'm coming up on a year planning to stay clean. However I have tried researching self harm as I always felt I wasn't ""like everyone else"" until I found reddit forums where I realized there are so many different kinds of self harmers out there, but then why isn't there more discussion on it? 

I would love some book recommendations if anyone has some, but how would you all feel about a social media page dedicated to approaching self harm more openly, again not going to glorify or share pictures etc, but rather to investigate and help others like myself to self reflect? I just don't see any representation like there is for other addictions and figured if i knew people were interested, I'd happily start something where we can all work together to grow and heal ♡ 

My idea is to talk about my experiences openly, which will be a little scary, but then also have open discussions (maybe anon calling in or email readings) with individuals who are also wanting to learn, heal, and grow together.

I'd be happy to hear any thoughts, opinions, or anything else on this :)

401,I had to show my teacher.,37,11r989x,selfharm,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/comments/11r989x/i_had_to_show_my_teacher/,5,"It was humiliating having to strip in front of the doctor the first time I attempted and everyone found out about my self harm. There was only a thin curtain hiding my body from everybody else in the A&E waiting room. It was humiliating again to be told they were only scratches. I know it's medical terms and stuff. But being told ""Oh they're not so bad, they're only scratches"" isn't really something I needed to hear right then. 

Having my sister and mum gape at me was worse than the looks of the doctors. I mean the doctors see people like that all the time. But that was a few months ago now. I relapsed last night, tried to get bandages because some of them were gaping more than I was used to. Kept on reopening. So I asked my mum if she could get bandages. I did everything we agreed on when I was clean last time. In case of relapse I take her aside, away from everyone else. She's supposed to respond calmly to me because if she doesn't it makes me feel really bad and like she doesn't actually care. She's not supposed to force me to show her, and she can't, under any circumstances let my little brothers and sisters know, or let them see. 

But I was stupid. We made those rules in front of someone, which was the only reason she'd agreed to hear me out. She broke every single one of those rules. Yelled at me for deciding to do that again and betraying her trust. Tried to yank my sleeves up and all that. She tried again today. But I ran away from her and refused, no matter how much she yelled. So she called my school. They all know now. They know. 

It feels so humiliating. They were all giving me funny looks when I arrived today. I was confused. A teacher pointed out a burn on my hand and asked me if it still hurt. I shrugged it off. Until another teacher took me into her office. I assumed it was probably about my attendance. (I skipped yesterday because I couldn't leave my bed) She told me my mum had phoned my school and that she said I'd been cutting myself last night. 

And it was like my heart stopped. I tried to shake it off. Pretend like it wasn't true. But this teacher knew about my suicide attempt and stuff. So she could tell I was lying. I spent  over 40 minutes in her office. She tried to be nice about it. I like her, she is nice. But I didn't want to show her. She told me she couldn't let me leave until I showed her. I tried to protest. She said they could be infected, and I countered with the fact I'm trained in first aid and I know what I'm doing. She told me they could be too deep and I assured her they were not. She asked how many? Big or little?
 
It was all so overwhelming. She started to believe my original lie. Told me it was okay if I lied to my mum about hurting myself to maybe scare her, or if I did do it and there was only a few and they weren't deep. She said it was okay if they were bad too. She just needed to see. I had to close my eyes when I finally showed her to stop myself from crying. I showed her only my best wrist. I refused to show her any further up my arm where the deeper ones are. She asked about my legs and I lied again. Said there weren't any, because that's where the worst scars are. Ones I don't ever want anybody to see. 

I tried my best not to cry. She said they weren't that deep so it was okay. I must of pulled a face or something, or she must of realised her wording and quickly backtracked to not hurt my feelings. She asked me if they hurt and I just shook my head. They do a little. But they're not from last night. They're two days old, so they don't hurt as much anymore. I hated showing her more than anything. It took everything in me not to cry. She told me I did the right thing and gave me a sticker for my troubles. It almost felt like I went to the dentist and got  all of  my teeth ripped out with no anesthetic and was given a sticker in return.

But I love stickers. She gave me a hug and sent me to class. I couldn't really concentrate for the rest of the day. And my mum was still mad with me when I got home. She's told my whole family too. I hate having everyone know. I hate letting people see. But now they all know. Everyone knows I've relapsed again. I could see the disgust in the look one of my relatives gave me when I got home today. It hurts. But I guess I'll live. I just hate having people know.",1678807779.0

I have a healthy relationship for the first time ever and we’re even celebrating our 2 month anniversary tomorrow. I got triggered by my roommates family coming over. They have a great relationship with their parents and seeing their non dysfunctional relationship just makes me sad and envious. I couldn’t take it anymore, why can’t my parents love me like that?

# So this is what i've been like for the last 6 yrs of my life,

Basic stuff: s.h; sewerslidal thoughts; anxiety; not being able to do basic things e.g brush teeth, get out of bed, shower for days; no energy; feeling hopeless; feeling like ppl love me and then hate me suddenly, im annoying, i should leave, im a terrible person etc.; feel like im not real sometimes? ik that sounds weird but sometimes i hold my hands out in front of me and have to check; copy ppls, there characteristics, mannerisms etc. without realizing sometimes, but mostly i do realise; get burst of rage really suddenly; second guessing sexuality, (maybe unrelated, who knows); feel like everyone will leave me, or just abandon me out of nowhere so i usually leave first; feel gross w/myself; think ppl shouldn't look at me because im so hideous, (I used to have a 3 second rule, lol); spending money/giving stuff away without really thinking about it; bursts of intense happiness/joy; i have 'my person', dunno if that makes sense, maybe favoritism; impulsiveness; unstable relationships/idealizing ppl im not even in a relationship with; feel like I drain ppl; massive, intense guilt; i don't know if it's normal to feel like this but when I'm sad (not a strong enough word but...) I feel the pain in my body, like physically; I feel like non one will ever love me as much as I love them; there is kinda multiple of my thoughts, yk like a sweet compassionate person who is great and i (hope)/think is the real me and then there's these other thoughts at the same time who is ugly and rude and so angry and just wants to hit someone or kms; I have like, imagionationships with ppl (lol what is that word) if u get what I mean; really loud in my head, like omg i have and assignment...i can't move my body im gonna sleep all day...and hopefully die...vibing to hamilton soundtrack in my head...throw the cup at her...hit smth...be kind you're a good person; GUILT GUILT GUILT; su!cide; acting normal; lying...!

I used to do it when I was younger, I don't have much 'to show' for it over my body, but I found the scratching hurt more than deep cuts, so that is what I did when I was bad. 

I recently have a life event which has left me rock bottom, unable to leave the house, and always in pain. If I'm being honest, I want to hurt myself. I need something, it's the draw of taking control, maybe of the only thing in my life I can currently take control over. 

I have held off doing it for so so long to protect my partner, not to trigger her or leave her feeling jealous of the fact I had. 

We had a big blow up the other day, and I did it, and now there is nothing else I can think of. It is all I want to do and it has control over me. 

I spend a lot of time on my own, me and my partner because of COVID became very isolated, and it was just us, then I got long COVID, and been trying to sort a wheelchair so I can leave the house, it's been months.

My partner now has a new group of friends, and is spending a lot of time socialising with people, whilst I am stuck at home. I feel jealous, I feel like I did when I was 13/14 again, like no one wants to spend time with me, even that my partner would rather be anywhere but with me, because when she is here she is sad, but when she is with other people she is happy. She tells me every day multiple times not to worry, but it seems so obvious that I should.

Sorry for the ramble, is it selfish of me, to do something I want to do to myself, when that is what I am telling my partner nearly every day to do, even though it hurts me? 

I dunno I am just so alone, I enjoy nothing anymore, and all I want to do is just stop existing so maybe the people around me will be happier. Because all it feels like is they deal with me because I'm here, but would be equally as happy if I wasn't. 

I wish anyone could help, but they can't or won't, and this is what life will be,

My family kept telling me i was their only hope and that i should make our family proud. All my relatives knew me as the 'smart one'. 
They then sent me to a hostel when i was just 11 years old, for the sake of better education. All the other kids in the hostel were 17 or 18, and i felt quite alienated. It took me an year to get used to the situation. I became the class 'cry-baby', crying almost every week over small matters. To make matters worse, i never had any friends either. I was always bad at socialising. I never really had anyone to confide in. Whenever someone tried popping up a conversation with me, i get overwhelmed so as to present myself as someone friendly. I still got good grades though. However, whenever i lost 1 mark or so in a test or exam, my mom would scold me and ask me where that one mark went. Being the 'smart one' no longer seemed like the rainbows-and-unicorns that i imagined it was like. It was pressurising. My mom once told me she hated me so much when she was pregnant because i was causing her so much pain, and she only thought of me as a blessing once i started getting good grades (she said it so as to encourage me?). Back then i didn't think much of that statement. However, now that I'm in 10th grade, i feel so hurt. 

COVID has ruined me, and my entire family is disappointed in me. I also came out as gay to my mom, grandmother and aunt, and they all hate me for it. My mom isn't as strict about my marks as she used to be. I'm the one setting the high standards for myself. 10th has been overwhelming. I began SH last march because of my annual exams. This march, I'm having the most important exams in my entire life as a student, which decides my future, and I've been having breakdowns every day or so. I've realised how stupid i really am, and it's killing me from the inside. I have terrible memory and focus. Im working so hard, but it feels like it's of no use. I studied for 7.5 hours continuously, with no breaks, and still only finished a single chapter. My friends, who have a social life and take breaks often while studying, can study more and get better marks within that time. The academic spirit which motivated me all these years is slowly killing me, and i don't know what to do. My entire family is putting their expectations on me, and i just want to kill myself at this point. I often go days without sleeping just to get good marks, and seeing my friends get better marks by procrastinating all day long hurts me. 

My mom is also forcing me to take the medical stream following the exams, even though it's one of the most stressful streams out there. I won't get time to pursue my hobbies either, like art. I, on the other hand, prefer the humanities stream because it would give me time to pursue my hobbies, which is the only thing driving my will to live, but my mom says taking the humanities stream is a waste of intelligence. I think at this point it's settled that I'm never going to live a happy life.

I didn't want to.  But I'm out of medical supplies and my cuts are getting deeper. I did try to be discreet. I have no income of my own, and last time I tried to steal bandages and other stuff from school I got caught and had to play it off as a joke. So I took her aside and I quietly asked her if she could buy me bandages like she did for my sister when my sister used to self harm. 

And she immediately shouted ""why have you done it again?"" And my little brother and sister ran in to investigate the yelling. I tried to play it off, as just a question. She started proper yelling at me. For betraying her trust, and that it was all my fault because even though I said I wouldn't do it again I chose to cut myself again. I guestured to the kids and tried to get her to shut up. But she didnt. It only made her madder. She shouted it so loud that my little siblings got involved. They yelled at me too. Telling me it was all my fault. They didn't know what was my fault. Just that it was, like everything else. 

They're mad at me too. It hurts. I didnt mean to make everyone mad. It took everything in me to keep my tears in and now they won't stop. 

She was trying to pull my sleeves up and force me to show her again, and my baby brother and sister were standing there, watching. They would of seen. I don't like her seeing either. My dad used to hurt himself and make me watch and clean them for him when I was younger. It makes me feel like I'm becoming like him when people see them and I hate it. It makes me remember things I don't want to. I've explained it to her and she said it's stupid and she's my mother and I have to show her. 

I pulled away and she was yelling so hard the whole house, probably the whole street could here. ""You cut yourself again, how dare you!"" ""You betrayed my trust!"" ""When did you do this!?"" And it hurts. She's really mad with me. She won't stop yelling at me about everything, and when i try to explain she ignores me. When my mum gets mad at you she takes it out on you in every way possible. And now I'm struggling not to relapse again. 

I've sat her down before and explained it all to her to the best of my ability, countless times. Begged her not to shout, just to listen, to care. But she doesn't. She doesn't care about my feelings. None of them do. 

She can probably hear me crying right now and I hate it. I said I'm sorry. And now everyone knows I've relapsed again. She's going to text my whole family about it again, like she does every time. I only wanted some bandages. I was trying to be good and do the right thing. Why does it always blow up in my face? It really hurts this time. I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

It’s still pretty bad, a thick, pink line that you can feel, making the skin a bit „bumpy”, and the little pink dots from stitching are also still there :(. I take very good care of it, and it healed relatively well for how little of a shit the nurses in the psych ward gave about what the ER told me to do with it, but still…it’s ugly and it would probably get „what’s that”s if shown in public.

I’m very self consious about them and don’t like anyone seeing them. Even when I’m just at my own home, playin some video games, I cover my arm just in case my mom enters. She knows but I’m just super uncomfy with the scars being visible.

I cried this time. Sitting there, staring at my thighs. My arms. My stomach, my legs and my shoulders. All red, stinging and bleeding, covered in scars. Nobody is going to love me now. No matter what I do to myself, nobody is going to care. I broke down, just sitting there and staring as I washed the blood from my hands. Nobody cares what I do. I mean this is me were talking about.

I tried asking her from 2022 from nowdays and she just keep forgetting and doesn't book one for me, just for my sister.
I know she doesn't really care about how i feel, she just cares when she feels guilty because i show my anger, stress etc, but damn I'm asking for so long. I never really showed or expressed my honest feelings because she makes me feel guilty for them
I live in Brazil so it's literally free. It takes a while to book one but there would already be one available if she tried

I tried asking her for a reeealy long time, talking to the school so they can call her to help booking an appointment with some trustworthy professionals, i even tried booking one by myself (I'm a minor so it obviously didn't work)
She always tells me she is going to book one but she never does. She did one time but on the first appointment she had to talk with the psychologist, she didn't go because she forgot and it was cancelled 
This makes me feel kinda bad because she always does everything for my sister and she doesn't even have to ask for it, and my sister is going to be 21y very soon
There's a whole story about my sister and why she always have all the attention etc, but i hate talking about that because it makes me feel like a clown for always helping and being forgotten and i prefer not remembering all of that stuff

The 1 times i tried opening up with her she just kept saying how her life was hard and she didn't do/needed all that stuff and she kept threatening to beat me up if i sh again. She did beat me some times when i was little and sometimes recently (on the last 5 years), but it never really was that bad and i deserved it, but this time she said she would beat me up untill i had to go to the hospital and then be hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital like my sister
My sister used to beat me up when i was little and she did a whole lot of bad things that mostly i had to deal with the consequences, and yet she has all of the good things

I know my sister NEEDS all that attention, patience and good stuff (she was bpd), but that doesn't mean i don't need any
My family are all so patient with her but when it comes to me they call me a fucking bitch, demon and worthless because i defended my mom when my sister was beating her up (i grabbed a knife and pushed her away from my mom, but i didn't hurt her). I was the only one who consoled, hugged, helped her and my sister, gave her meds when she snapped etc, and still she doesn't care enough
Yk, I've always been the responsible, the one who takes the first step and the mentally strong one, but i want help to! I'm not asking her to take away attention from my sister, I'm just asking for f_cking help

I could keep talking about this forever, telling every single detail and everything that bothers me about that situation, but i think you got the idea. And no I'm not all that good, i did bad things too but not that bad, the baddest thing I've done is threaten my sister with a knife trying scare her away from my mom. I think I'm a good person in general
I don't like to vent, and normally i can handle things on my on, but I'm scared of being beaten up, so i want a way to tell her that doesn't make her thing that i'm mentally ill, suicidal etc
Also she isn't the type of mom that gets mad and screams on your face, she's calm and makes you feel guilty because you feel a little sad, she makes the situation be about her, but she doesn't notices it and nobody cares to tell her that when I'm the one she's doing all that stuff with

I don't have any trauma or mental illness and i don't want to be diagnosed, honestly even if i had something i wouldn't want to know. Ive been through some stuff but they're nothing I can't handle
I'm a healthy and normal person, i just want some support, everyone needs support 
I didn't seek help before because i had a bad experiences with my previous psychologyst, but now I've made up my mind

This is kinda long lmao

I’ve struggled really badly with cutting again after I was clean for awhile, and theres a lot of guilt and shame that comes with it.

Your in pain, and when your hurt emotionally and your used to coping by hurting yourself physically, slip ups are likely to happen. Don’t be too hard on yourself. Messing up and SH again might seem like a huge deal, but give yourself a break and just try and get better from there. Loving yourself and not being too hard on yourself will help you a lot. Instead of thinking about your SH as how many days you were clean before your relapse, try and think of it as apart your journey to being happy. It can get rough sometimes, but keep fighting and focusing on improving little by little and loving yourself until you can say that your living a happy life, and you love yourself. Because even though I dont know you personally, If your SH I know your hurting and probably deserve a lot better, even if you don’t believe it yet.

My questions are: To what extent are massage therapists in the State of Illinois required to report suspected self-injury? What does this process look like?

Alternatively, I am comfortable enough with my massage therapists that I am considering just having a frank conversation, that I am engaging in self harm and am also in mental health treatment. To reduce risk of exposure, my arm is wrapped in gauze with a self-adhesive bandage wrap on top. 

I would like to continue massage therapy, but I am concerned I may be exposing my massage therapists to secondary trauma in witnessing my self injury. 

Any insight you may have would be deeply appreciated.",1678690927.0

Before that session we had this other thing where they asked me and my mom a lot of questions like why I'm going and like My relationships with people and stuff but they also asked me If I self harmed and i said no even though i do. I said no bc yk she was right next to me and my mom also Self harmed before too and I didn't want to make her relapse or make her sad but moving on I was js wondering If I told my therapist I self harm would they be obligated to tell my mom? Would it make a difference if i lied and told them ive stopped? or would they have to tell my mom regardless? I am a minor btw,1678680580.0

I'm not too sure, I can't pinpoint the exact point. I'm 19 now. I think a lot about if I would wish away my scars, but I can't imagine myself without them, since self harm unfortunately characterised a lot of my teenage years. Who would I be if I hadn't started? How would I have dealt with things instead? But then I thought, if I were to wake up as my younger self, would I do it all over again? Would I willingly get addicted again? Would I upset my family all over again? Would I sabotage my dream of doing medicine all over again? (Ik some medical professionals do have scars, but I feel like I have too many to wear scrubs, and I also was definitely not clean when it was time to apply for med school).

This thought just made me sad. Imaging 13/14 y/o me cutting for the first time. I don't even remember why. What made me sadder was realising I've let SH define me, how I cope and how I think. Even if I get clean, I'll always have the scars to remind me of what I've done. I think SH becomes so normalised to us because it becomes a habit/coping mechanism, but when you think about what it takes to get to the point when you intentionally hurt yourself, draw blood, leave scars, hide from family/friends... especially at a very young age.

That was until September when I cut my left forearm and I accidentally cut it too deep and I started bleeding severely. I was rushed to the hospital to get it stitched up, and afterwards I was sent to a mental clinic. I was supposed to be there for a week but I was lucky enough to get released after only 2 days.

Since then, I’ve been free from self harm for about 5 and a half months. I was still severely depressed during that time and I had many urges to start self harming again, but I tried my best to resist in fear of being sent back to that mental clinic. However, today I just couldn’t resist anymore.

I couldn’t use scissors since my parents won’t let me have those anymore, so instead I unscrewed the blade from a pencil sharpener and started making cuts on my shoulders and chest. As much as I hate myself for saying this, I admit that I felt proud and nostalgic for having done this.

The burning sensation and bleeding made me feel relieved for a few reasons. 1: It distracts me from the mental and emotional pain. 2: It gave me a sense of endurance. 3: the release of adrenaline.

I’m most likely going to continue self harming from now on, although I’m obviously going to be more careful not to repeat that same incident that happened before.

Lastly, I ask nicely not to try to encourage me to stop self harming. Although I took a 5 month break from doing it, my mind and body are still used to the feeling of self harm and it’s become one of my 3 main coping mechanisms. As bizarre as it may sound, I just don’t see why I shouldn’t be allowed to self harm. 

I understand that it’s a very sensitive action to take and I’m not glorifying it or encouraging it to others, but for me personally, it just helps to distract me from my severe emotional pain caused by depression and loneliness.",1678655057.0

I’ve really been having to urge to hurt myself and I’ve almost went to a therapist a few times but I’m terrified of being institutionalized. I have an appointment with a psychologist to finally try and get diagnosis for my mental state. But I feel like it’s not going to do anything. Im afraid they will tell me I’m just making everything up and that I’m fine and over reacting to everything. The only thing stopping me from self harming rn is that my bf might catch me because he’s in the other room. Will the urge to want to do it ever stop? I feel like it’s the only thing that makes me feel better other than binge eating but I’m trying to stop that too.. ugh I just want it all to stop.,1678655168.0

I don’t do this for attention, I do it because I suffer with severe  bouts of depression and I have for years. I try not to do it, and I realise that it is a very unhealthy coping strategy, and that it understandably really upsets my mum. She cares a lot about me, and I love her more than anyone in the world. But sometimes my mental health problems just get too much for a few seconds, and I just fall into cutting myself. I feel very guilty about it. 

My mum and I recently had a big fight about it, and she says that it is completely insensitive, selfish, and irresponsible to go to work with these self harm scars visible. I really understand where she’s coming from, and I would absolutely hate it if someone were to see them and become upset while I’m trying to serve them (I work as a cashier). We have to wear a T-Shirt as a uniform, but are permitted to wear a long sleeve shirt under it if we want. She says that I simply can’t go to work with my scars showing, and that she won’t let me go into work without a long sleeve shirt.

I can’t help but feel that she is making me feel guilty about something I already struggle to feel comfortable about, and that she is shaming me for the very real pain my mental health causes me. I also feel that I would hate to upset people with my scars, and would prefer to cover them up (as I have meticulously in the past), but the fact is that it is extremely hot where I live, and it simply isn’t functional to wear two layers of clothing all day.

So… am I the asshole? Should I just suck it up and do the right thing, and wear a long sleeve shirt even though it causes me great discomfort from the heat, because I am responsible for the mistakes I’ve made, and I need to be extremely careful for how my scars might effect others? Or is my mum being hurtful and unsupportive?

For me, self harm used to be a very common occurrence. However through the years my usage of it has decreased, and I don’t do it as frequently as before. I also don’t cut as deeply or as dangerously - I use a mechanical pencil’s tip and the most it does is rip or graze into the skin like a bush branch would.

And since I know that for me, self harm isn’t something I want to do to danger myself, my methods are not as “physically” harmful to me as others. I’m sure that I know how to control it, because I also know that that is the only form of self harm I use that will make me feel better. So added together the low frequency of me actually doing self harm, with the fact that I don’t cut as deep or as dangerous, leads me to the question - why should I stop?

I don’t have any scars, only a few trails as the wounds heal, and it’s not a thing that consumes my daily life, only a stress reliever in certain situations. But still, people close to me tell me that I should quit it entirely. And while a part of me does want to quit, the other part of me is confused as to why I should - isn’t my method of self harm bringing me more benefit over drawbacks?

Shitty coping mechanisms make me feel better. I know they don't help in long run, but in the moment I can force my emotions to do a 180 so I don't feel the way I'm feeling. I feel more in control.

After cutting I feel better. The first time I do it after a break from SH, I get really anxious. But even that feels better because _I_ did it. _I_ changed my feelings, not some disorder.

Loneliness, a fickle foe That never seems to want to go A reminder of our mortal state And how we all must meet our fate.

But in the midst of all the pain There is a beauty that remains For when we face our deepest fears We find a strength that's always near.

So let us embrace this friend And see what lessons it can lend For in the depths of loneliness We find a strength that can't be missed",1678599726.0

One of those things that is on the card is self-harm urges, and my therapy office goes with a stopping standpoint, not harm reduction. Meaning their gonna do everything to make sure i dont.


This is triggering the hell out of me-
I haven't had self harm urges this bad in such a long time.

The fact i 'can't' selfharm by their program standard is killing me. Asking me to take razors out of my bathroom to get them out of my space. The fact i have to sit and think at the end of every day if i had an urge and then bring it up in therapy and go through it heavily. Its tough, and i dont know if this is the correct approach for me.
The big big BIG thing is, when we self-harm we arent allowed to talk to our therapist through text or call the coaching line for our program for 24 to 48 hours.. Cant remember which it is right now. They say its another thing to discourage us from harming. But to me it feels like a massive punishment.. I dont really rely on coaching rn or texting my therapist.. But i know if i were to self harm i would be in a very vad state and probably need support.. Would maybe need that coaching? Idk.

I probably need to bring this up with my therapist but i dont see them till later, and i dont know how to bring this up and have it not feel like an excuse or me trying to get out of something. I dont know how to properly explain that.. Its genuinely making things worse..

Seeing the blood and the scar on my skin fascinates me though. Is that weird. I always get this slight feeling of happiness after. A slight relief. Diverts my attention. 

I don't do it because I feel like I wanted to do it like all the time. I noticed from before, when I feel extremely sad and upset and has no other way of expressing it.. I just get anything sharp and scratch my wrists with it. Even tried doing it with a ballpoint pen before because there was nothing sharp around. No intention to die. Physical pain before death scares me. People seeing my dead body scares me. But I still cut myself. Just to feel a little something other than sadness/emotional pain/etc.

Last year was one of the worst times for me. I never felt so excluded in something. I cut myself while at work with the small box cutter I bring in my bag all the time (it's literally the cutest thing, i bring it everyday for emergency purposes). That was the first after 10 years.

Annoyingly because of confidentiality rules for underage people I didn't feel comfortable giving full context. I downplayed self harm saying I only do it extreme circumstances (half true) and I feel suicidal but not actively and not currently. 

I said just enough for them to take me seriously but also not to get wheeled away in a straightjacket. The doctor was actually really nice, he seemed to be experienced as well saying that he saw 5 young people last week with similar issues. Even though I didn't feel comfortable explaining all of my issues (eg - my crippling porn addiction), I told him at least 80% of my issues. 

It was scary at first, my mouth wouldn't say anything. Literally for the first 5 minutes every time I opened my mouth I just rambled bullshit and kept changing the subject. Despite me stalling and being nervous at first, he was genuinely patient and understanding.

Also, I'm not going to CAMHS (my fear). I'm getting referred to a local non-profit charity that has really good reviews and moderate to small wait times. They've also partnered with my school and they imported some of their workers to be the school therapists.

I don’t usually cut on my arms ever, but a couple weeks ago I did for some reason. It is only 1 cut on my very upper arm and it’s not very wide but it was fat. It’s healing and scabbed over so I’m not wearing any bandage over it anymore and I was wearing a short sleeve top but also had a cardigan over so I really didn’t think anyone would see it let alone bother to ask. To me it doesn’t look that bad but a lot of sh’ers (myself included) struggle with believing their sh is “enough”, so I guess to people outside it probably looks a lot worse. To make it worse I have patches of scaly dry skin around it from the adhesive of the bandages from when I was covering it.

Anyways my cardigan fell off my shoulder and she saw and asked with so much concern what happened. I tried to ignore it and kind of froze but she kept asking and someone else joined in and was like “yeah what happened??” I felt so stuck and couldn’t respond, thankfully I have a friend who is aware of my sh and he stepped in and made a silly excuse for me and took the attention off me. I’m so grateful for him doing that and I thanked him then and messaged him after but I don’t think I can express how much it really meant to me. I feel so ashamed that I’m 20yo and cut myself and that I almost outed myself for doing so. It makes me scared to go home from uni bc what if my family finds out?? I don’t have a very healthy relationship with my mother, but now I fell like telling her about my sh just so she doesn’t find out herself, if anyone is going to expose me or make me look bad I want it to be *me*.

I love my job. Today I had a horrible experience and frankly it’s something I feel happens too often. I had to help pick up kids today from my local elementary school with my coworker (it’s an afterschool program we have). There were 4 kids missing off of our list. I had to go inside to ask where they were so we didn’t get in trouble. This was something I only done one time (picking up the kids and all that) and it was when I started working there back in August. I walked in after being confused with their front doors. The first time I did this, the doors were just unlocked and wide open so I assumed I could just walk in like I did before. I got confused and my coworker from the van told me I had to buzz in. So I did and I still got confused when I walked in cause there was another set of doors.

I turned around for a second to look at my coworker for what to do next and he pointed towards my left. There was a receptionist lady to the left of me who was completely silent and i didn’t even know there was a space for her there. After I noticed her, I was gonna ask her for where the 4 missing kids are. Before I could say anything, she said to me, “You seem too happy to be working with kids”. As soon as I heard that my smile from my face diminished and my heart dropped. I just asked her “What?”. She didn’t respond to it and just asked me who the kids who were missing are. When I got back to the van/bus, I felt so depressed. I felt like that the whole time I had to help watch all 70 of the kids. Plus my group which is +12. I’m just so tired of this, everyone treats me like this. I haven’t even done anything to suggest I’m doing anything wrong. I felt like I was doing something wrong the whole time I was working.

However I am not going to tell anyone. Not my online friends and noone in real life. It's going to become my little dark secret again. 

I don't feel good about breaking my streak because it's the longest I've ever been able to stay clean but right now it's all I can think about and highly necessary. 
I hope noone finds out, because they are so proud of me right now. They think everything is okay but it's really not. I sometimes want to unalive and it's been getting really hard to just get out of bed and do shit. If I didn't have to be anywhere I would legit not shower at all. 

Thing is that I do not have a mental condition causing my selfharm, I'm just plainly addicted to it which makes it even more awkward. There is nothibg there to treat and I know it's not gonna get better.

I can’t really talk to anyone else, but a few minutes ago I just relapsed and I’m coming off the feeling of numbness. I used a serrated knife 22 times on each of my thighs.
I don’t know what the purpose is of coming here to share, but I guess I want to share my story with the void of the internet. That way I can feel heard in some way.

I’m just hurt deep down. I’ve had severe suicidal ideation and self harm tendencies from the age of 6. I was also diagnosed with chronic anxiety and depression at the age of 8. I have struggled with mental health problems for a long time. I’ve tried to get help in the past, but accidentally pushed everyone who has cared for me away by sharing my calls for help. I’m at a loss. The incident that caused me to self harm was a random panic attack from an unknown trigger. I think it might’ve just been an overflow of stress from recent events, but I don’t know exactly the reason. 
I recently moved to a place I loved and finally had peace for a few months. I’ve been living in the Midwest since the beginning of Covid. Then I traveled west! After I moved I was working as direct care staff for a mental health company and I was loving helping people. I even got promoted to supervisor! Which was amazing and I was so proud of myself. Then my roommate invited me out to a sponsored roller skating event. I was pumped to go. I was trying to relearn how to skate, but in doing so I accidentally broke and sprained my ankle. The soft tissue in my foot is now severely damaged and I need surgery for it. Funny enough I would’ve been covered completely for the surgery if it had happened 30 days later. I was right in between coming off my mom’s insurance and going onto my company’s insurance. L + Ratioed. 

Now I’ve been terminated from my job right after my promotion due to my injury. That means I no longer have income. So I have to move back to the Midwest and live through another long period of isolation. Luckily I’ll still have my mom at least, but I know that won’t be sustainable for long. I’ve suffered a bit throughout my life. Not as much as others, but I’ve been unhappy for most of my life. I was finally happy for a short time, and now it’s time to return to all the familiar feelings. I don’t have too bad of problems compared to others, but I’m tired. I am ok with death now too. Every time I try to escape my suffering through self improvement and better habits I end back at square 1. I can’t even afford a therapist so I guess I just got to deal. It’ll be fine eventually with whatever has to happen. All I know is that I’ve done my best. If anyone read through it was probably a bit difficult to read, but thank you. I needed to feel heard.",1678533386.0
808,have you ever self-harmed with a friend,6,11oekgx,selfharm,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/comments/11oekgx/have_you_ever_selfharmed_with_a_friend/,1,"If so, how did you feel?

I self-harmed with a friend for the first time today. it was an interesting experience but not really what I expected. I didn't really feel sadness while it was happening. I feel like my social mask has ingrained itself so deep into my identity that it was hard to feel all of the emotions I usually feel while cutting. I could tell my friend felt more depressed. it was interesting to see depression manifested, a direct expression of that. We didn't really talk about it, but I felt a stronger connection afterwards. I think that we both truly realized how fucked up we were. I could tell but the way that he looked at me, it was different. The expression had a lot of sympathy and understanding.

We're both 22 year old men, too... kinda just getting through life as an adult and exhausted at this point. Overall, it was interesting seeing more emotion than usual. I think that although it was 'unhealthy' to share that, it was meaningful.

(BTW I'm not glorifying this nor do I plan on doing it in the future.)",1678522377.0

I had a break down a few nights ago and I almost relapsed, not going to get into why because it’s long to explain but thankfully I didn’t do it. 

But it made me realise, I’m 18 now, I need to take this shit seriously and be mature about it. I need to tell people around me about this to help myself stay clean. 

This is something I’d never done before but I told my boyfriend over face time about it all and I cried. But it made me feel better about it. 

I’m now even considering to tell my cousin and my mum. Because I NEED their support. I know I need it because I love them and they love me and they can help me, problem has always been I’ve never allowed anyone to help me before. 

I’m now allowing others to help me and it feels so weird but I know that these steps towards getting clean are going to be so important.

I think I need an alternative. before I was working out instead of cutting but got carried away and hurt a muscle so now I get worried every time I try to workout again, rubber band thingy doesn't help either because my parents can hear the slap against my wrist. 
I also don't know how to start taking myself seriously without cutting. my brain refuses to acknowledge that maybe there is something wrong even when my psychologist or family or friends or even groupmates at college point at fhe fact that I need help. even when I cut I still feel like I'm just lying because I don't cut deep enough often enough ect ect. 

what alternative could I use? and how to stop invalidating myself? i don't really have anyone to vent to and idk how to vent, I've also stopped talking to my psychologist because the urge always got much worse after talking to her.

I’m pretty sure i hit dermis, the cuts gape a little and I can see a white layer, but the gape is pretty small and it fills with blood pretty quickly so I can’t really inspect it. 

I’m pretty sure it’s dermis though, because it bleeds a lot more than the normal ‘scratches’ I do 

I tried to use steri strips and I find it almost impossible to put them on one handed, but I think I was able to get it right for one cut. (If anyone has any tips they’re much appreciated)

The other cuts seem to get filled with dried blood very quickly and so I can’t pinch them closed. 

1) Is it okay leave the cuts without without the strips?

2) Do steri strips go bad after opening the peel package? I haven’t peeled the actual strips off, just the plastic wrapper. I have a few left and I’d hate to waste them.

 I really tried for a long time to forget about it but I finally relaps no long for been 4 years clean, and I'm so disgusted with myself and with her for that. 

The thing is that I SH not because of depression (even if it started for this) or because I'm sad, but because of addiction, and now I can't stop. 

The worst part of this is that after all this, my friend just straight on left me without a reason or anything, and I'm just so upset about that.

It feels like I'm being manipulative in a way. Someone upsets me, all I can think about is suicide and how badly I wanna slice myself to shreds. It's not like I show anyone, but it still feels like I'm being a complete and utterly manipulative asshole. I struggle with sleeping and got two hours of sleep last night, and so desperately wanted to stay off school because I've been throwing up and other stuff, and my school refuses to send me home no matter what. Like I could throw up all over myself and beg to go home, and they still won't let me. And in general I just feel like shit, wanna take a nap. But no my mom yells at me that everyone's tired, which is all she does. If I literally have any problem, it's oh; 'everyone is [blank!] Everybody feels like [blank!] That's life and life is unfair! Grow up and deal with it!""

And it drives me fucking mental. She only pretends to care about me when I do something for her, or there's other people to show off to. Like I feel like shit and everything is horrible (I have health problems but she won't book a doctor's appointment for me even though we literally have free healthcare) and she says I'm exaggerating or I need to push through it because that's life. 

With the things she tells me is just how life is, does she really have to wonder why I'm so desperate to off myself?

And now I'm in the bathroom, doing things I shouldn't be doing, yet again, instead of getting ready for school because I just want to lie down, but apparently no, even though she promised if I didn't sleep she'd let me stay off to nap, I've got to drag myself off to school, even though I am really not fucking well today, and do not hold the mental capacity to deal with this bullshit. I have no choice, because even if I throw a tantrum and force her to let me stay off, she's already said she'll take all of my electronics away for a week, including my phone, when half of my homework is online and I'm already behind anyway. 

I'm just so fed up and I feel like shit and now I have to go put up with school and I just can't. I know the moment I get there, I'm either going to blow up or shut down, because I'm grouchy where my stomach hurts and I'm tired and I've got a headache, and when I looked for a tiny sliver of comfort all I got was being yelled at, so now my arms and my thighs hurt. 

I just don't know what the fuck I'm supposed to do. I just want to curl up into a ball and cry, and I fucking abolished my clean streak again. I can't even stay clean for one fucking day and all I want is some fucking sleep and something to make me feel better, but no I can't have that, so I'm going to end up crying in the hallways instead of going to class, and slicing myself to pieces in the bathroom. 

And it feels like I'm being manipulative and a horrible person because I'm hurting myself because of how she's made me feel, and if I found out something I did pushed someone to hurt themselves I would probably breakdown (and I've experienced weaponised self-harm before) and now I'm late for school, I'm not even the slightest bit ready because my stomach is killing me, and I've been writing this dumb reddit post, trying to stop myself from cutting any more than I already have.",1678437535.0

I’ve never made a post here before because I really didn’t think I was “valid” enough to post here for a long time. But I’m realizing I need advice now so it doesn’t get any worse later on. I used to cut (shallow) and scratch (a LOT) at my wrists when I was in my teens. For a while that stopped, and I was clean more or less for years. 

I’m 24 now and for some reason I feel like all of my hard work has gone down the drain. I’ve started scratching regularly again and have had to hide knives from myself. I know where this ends up.

I’ve tried the rubber band and holding ice, but neither seemed to work for me. I have troubles sleeping and the urge usually hits at night when it feels like I’m out of options. I get this almost burning, craving feeling on my wrists and rubbing them only last so long.

I guess I’m asking for alternatives. Something that would help the feeling specially. I don’t want to go down the road of snapping a rubber band and telling myself it’s okay because that’s how scratching started. Harm reduction for me would be something I could feel but wouldn’t actually hurt me? If that makes sense.

Any advice would be appreciated. I can’t really afford therapy right now haha",1678430312.0

I've had wounds that smelled so bad other people noticed, because of infections, that leaked so much puss I couldn't keep up with changing bandages before leaking through my clothes.


But worst of all, I have traumatized countless of people. When I had unknowingly hit a vein and it started bleeding again at work, causing a pool of blood on the kitchen floor and other people had to mop up my blood. My parents who had to rush me to the hospital again and again, who where told that this would kill me some day, not knowing how to help me. The nurses that cried seeing me again, hopeless. The resident doctor that told me six months after treating one of my wounds that he still thought about it and found self harm cases very hard to deal with.


Even after cutting so deep surgeons where called to see if I needed a surgery, I still felt like it wasn't valid. I was never satisfied with the amount of stitches I needed, once I left with a total of 30 stitches in one wound and hated myself for not making it bigger. I can't cut without risking my life, I am never as relieved as I was not going deep. I fear a relapse, because I know one day I'll cause irreversible damage that will make my life even harder.

When I sit down in class I feel like everyone is paying attention to me, like everyone hates me, because I’m not good enough. Not to mention my moms been treating me worse and many of the friends I thought I had don’t want to be around me anymore, I’ve never felt more alone, I just wanna be told I’m good enough, I just wanna be appreciated by someone, I wanna be able to appreciate myself, I just can’t.

943,My awful Christmas,3,11n7gor,selfharm,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/comments/11n7gor/my_awful_christmas/,3,"For Christmas, my parents went to their friends, I was left alone and noticed a bottle of vodka. At first everything was fine, I'm wasted, dancing to the music, but suddenly I decided to take the chance while parents were away and start cutting myself the way I always wanted - on left arm from the very hand to the shoulder.

It was all like ""fun"" or ""hobby"" until I started thinking about my boyfriend who repeatedly SA'ed me (I just wish him death so that no other girl would go through the same) & other traumatic, experiences eventually having the most insane breakdown I've ever had. I ended up switching to my right hand a bit and finished with my left breast.

I sincerely wanted to die, I really wanted to reach the veins, but the blade was too dull and the pain was unbearable, so I couldn’t, didn’t even come close to losing consciousness, it was just harder for me to walk, I felt sick, especially from alcohol and I was lying at home still, several days, because of weakness and terrible pain technically almost in a half of my upper body (jesus, there were probably around 200 cuts in total).

I just can't WAIT for the psychiatrist to go offline, I have so much to tell. For example, I've never told anyone that I was raped nor about this Christmas situation except my parents, for some reason it's embarrassing.

Also I was recording everything the whole time, after watching half of all the videos I wanted to cry so bad, couldn't bear it and deleted everything, videos, photos, even old ones.
It's so hard for me to stay clean right know and everyday, but I'm holding for 2 month and 8 days.

I can't forget my parents reaction when they saw all what I've done, their facial expression, scared voice, I feel so bad but also I liked the way they cared about me back then.

I also can't forget the fucking pain of healing those wounds, the way bandage was sticking to them, not being able to fully move or normally sleep because of it, not taking a bath for 2 weeks, not washing my head. And I STILL wish to hurt myself.",1678404177.0

My parents are disappointed, so much I do seems to be not good enough or bad or something else. If I do something good it seems like it either doesn’t really get counted in or I just realize it and then feel treated badly, maybe I deserve it.


TW: SA, Bullying, parents, describing cat scratches

Welp my story you don’t have to read but yea. I’m 16, from Germany. I’m straight, nowadays at least, I could have been bi or pan or something like that but it was destroyed for me with 13. Classmate, approximately 1 or more years older than me had a birthday party with a sleepover, like 10 people that will sleep there. In short: I break some expensive lamp in the kids room (they are super rich) and get called down by the parents. They call me egoistic and say that I lack respect and all that, this goes on for 15 minutes. Then me and the “friend” go back up. He says “Feels bad huh, I know something that can fix it”. I don’t wanna describe anything but he was down there going for liquid. I didn’t say no, I was scared because his parents talked about me having to pay this 400$ lamp. That’s probably the reason I don’t even know why. I don’t even know if it has anything to do with my actual life nowadays.

Jump backwards a bit, I was bullied for 2 years, but I can’t even remember much of it. Like my brain blocked these memories. Only small bits of it pop back up: Me sitting on the bathroom floor crying, hiding from them. So it doesn’t impact my life. 

Ok forward again; 15, fucked up sleep schedule, a nerd. Finally finds friends, has a group even. This group will split, it seems like the part that actually does something together doesn’t want anything to do with me. 

A bit later; Ok all good they don’t hate me. My mental state has been declining since the “SA” (I don’t even know if it was, I didn’t say anything against it). I have a fucked up sleep schedule, I sleep for 5h a day when having school (I have to stand up in 6h at the point of writing this), mostly feeling down. One night, I have an argument with my parents, I can’t take it. I take the scissors and try to draw blood on my wrist. It’s only scratches but it was so cool to see. It was like I had done it before. I’m directly hooked. Since then it has only worsened, going deeper, spending more and more time on these subs and getting even less sleep or then 14h at some point. It switches, either not enough or too much. 

THen some day my parents find out, I didn’t even remember self harming that last night but apparently there was a bloody towel. Father want’s to see my wrist. Completely ticks out, gets angry, hits me. Then after having me dragged around the room on my arm and seeing them he takes photos screaming “oh this is what you want right, attention here let me take pictures and send it around, that’s what you want”. He proceeds to compare my situation to kids in the Ukraine and Africa. Then he vomits. Nice. I had an appointment with a therapist but basically there didn’t much happen because actually I don’t even have reasons to feel down, which is right. I don’t have PTSD or something, I’M just lazy.

My parents realized that, my sleep schedule is getting even more fucked up, they hate me. 

Another longer story shortend, basically my father did something I didn’t ask him to do, yes it was generous (or smth like that, not native), but ok yeah thank you. He was ticking out, said he expected me to be more happy about it, then gets angry. I left out some parts, yes they have reason the be mad. Idk it’s getting too long no one will read it anyway <3.

That’s my vent or something, most of it probably didn’t even make sense. 

All in all I’m just a lazy fuck that is selfish and will be a huge failure later in life - me and my parents

So, I have a friend who has been utterly fantastic when it comes to my self-harm.  She always knows what to say, she always knows how to make me feel better, she always knows how to calm me down.  She's prevented me from hurting myself so many times and she doesn't actually know it.  She's my go-to when I need advice.  I'll admit I was oversharing to her, I feel incredibly guilty for it but I've very much toned it down now.  Anyway, as you can probably tell, this friend is very important to me.  

Today she told me she wanted to kill herself.  She didn't think she was going to.  But she said she wanted to.  This was, of course, devastating to hear.  And earlier I'm fairly sure I saw self-harm cuts on her wrist.  I may not have seen correctly, but I'm unbelievably worried nonetheless.  She's going through a heck of a lot at the moment when it comes to her physical health and I know it's having a horrendous affect on her mental health, but I can't help but feel as though I've contributed to this.  My past oversharing, and reliance on her (which you don't have to tell me is a bad thing) might have caused this.  She's now all I can think about.  I know it's not necessarily a bad thing that I'm worrying about her, but it's causing me some serious problems.  My brain is affectively preparing for how I'm going to react if I find out she's died.  I'm convincing myself that she is dead so that I'm prepared if she is.  She said she'd spoken to her therapist about it (which I am so thankful to God for, and it means I don't have to do the horrendous thing of telling someone what she said to me) but it doesn't make it any easier.  I'm still worried sick.

I know the only thing that will stop me worrying for a while is hurting myself.  It's the only thing that has ever helped with this.  It's a bloody quick way (pun unintended) to ground me in the here and now and to think about things rationally.  Although thinking irrationally enough to injure myself in order to think rationally is rather ironic.

973,How do I stop venting to everyone?,2,11n1t4t,selfharm,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/comments/11n1t4t/how_do_i_stop_venting_to_everyone/,2,"

I’m not sure where to post this but I really need some advice. 

All my life I’ve had a huge problem with venting my emotions and thoughts to friends and family. I’ll admit when I’m suicidal, when I hate myself, when I’m struggling, when I’m annoyed, and my opinions on everything. 

I’ve recently cut off all my friends because I know it was hurting them. But my parents and siblings are still suffering from my suffering. 

I want to tell myself to just shut up but it’s like I NEED to tell someone. And the thing is, I never feel any better after I do so. I’ve tried writing my thoughts down, but I always end up sharing the note with someone - or I write it and talk about it anyways. 

I wish I didn’t care about myself so much. I wish I could stop talking and stop eating and stop resisting self harm and stop giving myself so much comfort. I feel like all I do is give myself comfort - I wear the same comfy clothes, never trying anything different. I spend money of tasty food. I buy myself things I want when I can afford it instead of saving. I take naps instead of doing homework. 

All I do is preserve my own comfort and happiness and I feel insanely depressed without it. Even with it I feel depressed. Even if I have the most wonderful day in theory, I have suicidal thoughts. But it’s all ironic because I care too much about the happy things to kill myself. 

I just want to stop caring about myself so much. It’s hurting other people.",1678391401.0

I don't selfharm, however, my friend does and I'm seeking help because I feel totally lost. She is really important friend to me and seeing her struggle with mental health breaks my heart because she deserves to be happy. She has been open about her scars and selfharming to me and I've tried to support her as best as I can but I feel like that's not enough. This year she started antidepressants and tried to stay clean. I made sure to always tell her how proud I am of her. She was clean for 35-36 days at least but few days ago she relapsed while I was asleep next to her. She told me in the morning. Now it's bad again and everytime she mentions it I just don't know what to do. I just scold her but she seems so proud of it and just laughs and tells me it's normal and okay. It just breaks me how she shows it off and I'm supposed to act like it's all normal and do nothing. Yesterday I just broke down myself because I felt so helpless and useless. I understand that you can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped but I can't just stand there. I need advice. How can I convince her to try again because right now it seems like she just gave up on herself. Maybe you can help me understand more about the need or thought process why people do it or idk just something so I can help her or get the help she deserves. Her parents know about her selfharming but not that she relapsed. She told me that she will kill me (not literally ofc) and hate me forever if I told anyone. She trusts me and I don't want to break that trust. So help me. What can I do, how I can educate myself more about it or literally just anything that can help even just a little bit.",1678388387.0
