Anyways- I have a had a few drinks and when I drink all my stifled emotions bubble to the surface. And my husband is a very logical, type a person.

He went manic today and there was a huge fight, then he told me, I started sobbing, told him I'm so sorry I didn't know - it was the son of a  ex friend (for other reasons) who had been a sister to me my while life, an aunt to him, her son was about a year older. I'm guessing this was grade school, I don't know any details after that he went to his room. I've tried to tell him in here and checking on him but I don't know what to say. Saw him after and asked him what I could do and he said leave him alone. He's had a friend over today thankfully they are watching sports, grilling, whatever, in the basement. What do I do when his friend leaves? How do I talk to him what do I say? He is going to refuse help. He said that we are the worst parents we never taught him anything and don't listen to him and we hate him and lie to him. I know that he gets manic and the anger takes over, he had said in the past he wishes he was dead. But not recently enough to have him committed for help. He'd never forgive me for that anyway. My husband and older son are away this weekend. So it's just the 2 of us. I can't stop crying, I'm devastated and I feel like I did this to him because I dropped him off over there or she would pick the kids up from school and I'd pick him up later.

I did a bit more cursory research this morning and read the noted ENIGMA study that shows brain cell loss in people with BP. All the P values in the study (except a couple) are really high. A P-value is a statistical measure indicating the likelihood that an observed effect wasn‚Äôt due to chance. An acceptable P-value is conventionally less than 0.05. In the ENIGMA study some of the P-values are as high as 8.0, meaning the differences observed between the bipolar brains and the ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù brains could have been random chance and nothing to do with bipolar. It also showed lithium stimulated proliferation of brain cells (but again, with a high P-value). So really the study didn‚Äôt prove anything, the brain differences observed could have been due to chance. I also found similar studies showing memory damage for garden variety ‚Äúsocially acceptable‚Äù depression and anxiety. So it‚Äôs not just us with BP that need to carry this worry. It‚Äôs anyone with a mental health issue really. Plus it‚Äôs normal to lose brain volume as we age, all humans will. I‚Äôm going to try and take this information and live my life day by day without constantly fretting about brain damage, because brain damage is real but it‚Äôs also just the reality of the human condition and not unique to BP.

18,"To preface, this probably belongs only in a diary or in the depths of the folds in my mind‚Ä¶ This might be a mess.",8,11v2wa0,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11v2wa0/to_preface_this_probably_belongs_only_in_a_diary/,3,"How are you supposed to tell somebody, be it a mental health provider or a friend to confide in, that you‚Äôd rather be dead than have to live with bipolar disorder? I‚Äôm NOT suicidal. I‚Äôm just exhausted. The help I‚Äôve received has been minimal at best. My original diagnosis was 10+ years ago, and the treatment was and still is a joke. 

I was never the best patient, but my doctor told me that I was the bipolar poster child. 

I lived at home with my single mother, who moved to a different apartment at least once a year. She was a victim of domestic violence. The incident occurred around 2004, and this man (the abuser) played a minimal role in her life in the following 13 years. Even though he‚Äôs out of her life completely now, she will still ‚Äúplay the victim card‚Äù, as she‚Äôs likely consumed by thoughts of the event. That being said, she refuses to confront her trauma. She played little to no part in helping me get any help for my mental illnesses or her own. 

Due to constantly moving, when I could get any kind of professional treatment, it was never long lasting. I wasn‚Äôt able to stay in therapy/psychiatry and I surely wasn‚Äôt able to stay on a medication long enough to tell if it was beneficial or not. This led to episodes of mania and depression that then led to hospitalizations that shattered my trust in everyone. 

My mother moved out of the apartment we lived in when I was 17. From that time until I was 20, I rapidly cycled through manic, hypomanic, psychotic manic, and crippling depressive episodes with great intensity. I wasn‚Äôt able to tell where the mania ended and the depression began. I was mostly manic, which meant I didn‚Äôt need treatment because I felt like a god; completely untouchable. I got arrested, lost my job, and totaled my car. My mother had put me up in my own one-bedroom apartment. After losing my job, I didn‚Äôt have any income with which to pay my rent. I lost the apartment, too, and ended up homeless. 

I started to get back on my feet with a lot of help from friends, family, and my boyfriend at the time. I started self-medicating with cannabis and the symptoms actually started to subside for a little while. I certainly won‚Äôt say that it‚Äôs an effective treatment method for bipolar disorder because I was still cycling, but I wasn‚Äôt moving through episodes so quickly. For the past 5 years, I‚Äôve noticed annual depressive episodes with shorter, less severe hypo/manic episodes. 

I currently have a psychiatrist whose not willing to give me anything other than Abilify and Hydroxyzine, which is basically just Benadryl, but at least it helps me sleep at night. 
I‚Äôm on the waitlist for therapy, with no openings in the next 90 days, at least. 
I have a stable job, steady income, a car, and a place to live. I try to get to the gym 3 times a week. I do yoga almost every day. Things should feel better, but they don‚Äôt. 

I‚Äôm tired of taking care of myself. I‚Äôm tired of babying my mental health. I‚Äôm tired of trying to learn about bipolar disorder on my own because nobody ever educated me about my diagnosis. I do not have it in my anymore to keep doing all of this.",1679178465.0

""What relational therapists often find is the root of bipolar tends to be relational, through the manic defense. As a T and a client Ive had clients who I can see exactly why they developed their symptoms and it's relational in nature. That doesn't mean they don't have bipolar, but what it does mean is it's possible to treat the root of it through talk therapy and re-evaluate meds/dx down the road. ""

""Many therapists who are psychodynamically inclined think bipolar is a defense mechanism  stemming from relational trauma, not a physiological disorder of the brain""

I used to smoke about half a pack a day fairly reliably, but in the wake of a very stressful cross-country move, my consumption spiked to 20-25 smokes a day and I haven‚Äôt been able to get it back down yet.  I have BP1 with psychotic features and my own therapist said he doesn‚Äôt know anyone with a psychotic mood disorder that doesn‚Äôt smoke, so I‚Äôm not sure if actually quitting is in my future.  I‚Äôve tried before using patches and after two weeks I felt like I had a rabid rat scratching around in my head.  However, I do think getting back to half a pack or less is doable.  My current plan is two-fold: replace some of my daily smokes with nicotine gum, and instead of having the whole pack with me out on the porch where I smoke, I keep them inside and only take 2 with me outside.  When I‚Äôm done I‚Äôll set a phone timer for 2 hours and not smoke until it goes off.  Hopefully this will get me down to around 15 or less a day at which point I‚Äôll either smoke every 3 hours or only have one at a time (perhaps both!).  My therapist is a big fan of the harm reduction method of dealing with substance use.  Yes, I know that any smoking at all is bad for me, but so is completely losing my mind and raging: it‚Äôs a balance.

https://neurosciencenews.com/high-protein-diet-depression-22760/

""A new study that focused on nutrition and mental health of adolescent athletes found an association between high protein consumption and a decrease in symptoms of depression.""

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19841581/

""The indicator amino acid oxidation-based requirement values of 0.93 and 1.2 g protein/kg/day and the reanalysis of existing nitrogen balance studies are significantly higher than current recommendations. Therefore, there is an urgent need to reassess recommendations for protein intake in adult humans.""

https://examine.com/guides/protein-intake/#references

""higher protein intakes increase¬†satiety, which is particularly helpful if you‚Äôre trying to cut calories as part of a¬†weight-loss diet""


https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-much-protein-do-you-need-every-day-201506188096

The RDA is the amount of a nutrient you need to meet your basic nutritional requirements. In a sense, it‚Äôs the minimum amount you need to keep from getting sick ‚Äî not the specific amount you are supposed to eat every day.""

As you can see, making sure you eat enough protein improves depression symptoms, helps weight loss (but is not a panacea) which we struggle with, and is generally deemed to be safe. 

The mainstay advice is *at least* 0.8g protein per kg bodyweight. It is generally recommended to get this protein from plant sources and also engage in physical activity.",1679148982.0

Hello people,

I am writing to you because I need help.

Please excuse me first of all because English is not my first language.

I am desperate, I am destroyed.

I am bipolar and borderline.

I am in a relationship with someone who was perfect for me at first and has since neglected me, disrespected me, ignored me, and blamed me for everything because of my disorder.

Before I met him, I had managed to rebuild myself, to go back to work after a 2.5 year break (I was diagnosed in 2019).

Since then, I have been living in hell.

He lived far away from me (950km/690miles) and we tried life together but that's when my disorder revealed itself.

He was constantly on the computer, talking down to me, having horrible outbursts and insulting me.

He even threatened to kill himself and jump off my balcony and I tried to hold him back and that's when I had my first ""boderline"" crisis where I started screaming in pain and wanting to end my life.

I called him parents to warn them of his actions and when they called, my boyfriend said everything was fine while I was crying in the back and they could hear me.

A lot of things happened and I asked him to go home (he lives with his parents).

Since then, it's been hot and cold between us.

One day I'm ""his Queen"", the next day he barely pays attention to me and when I criticize him for not even asking if I'm okay, he says ""because you think I'm your knight in shining armor?"" when for me it's the minimum for any social contact.

You should know that from the beginning of our relationship, I was threatened with a knife by one of his family members and insulted and while we were abroad in a remote place I didn't know.

His family consults a lot of medieums, psychics, card readers and all of them say that I am the devil and not made for their son while I have never shown anything but goodness, kindness and compassion despite what they made me go through (recently, I learned that they would be persuaded that I raped their son and that my first goal is to ""kill him"" while I have never raised my hand on someone).

They even told me while her sister wanted hut me with the knife that it was ok because ""the devil is INSIDE HER' and so it means that it's not her fault and they didn't event ask if I was fine once ?!

Last week was the worst of all, I hurt myself, I hit my head multiple times during his present and I tore my face off + hit myself with an alter because I heard his parents on the phone saying again that I was going to kill him and he did nothing to stop it and instead he left when I could have killed myself.

I am stuck in this relationship, I don't know how to get out of it.

I feel like I can't see any way out because I feel like no one will want me because I'm ""crazy"" and I don't want to live with someone like him, nor do I want to start a family with him because of the principles he may have and his family (I can't tell you everything, but the story of the knife already tells you a lot)

I need help, my caregivers don't tell me anything, they listen to me and that's it.

No one understands me.

The more I talked to him about my illness and how to help me if I was neglected, the more he did nothing.

When we lived together and he insulted me, I took it upon myself at first and went to him with a big smile and hugged him as he pushed me hard and said ""YOU DISGUST ME!"" to then tell me ""sorry, I love you more than anything, you can't even imagine, I will never leave you alone again, I will do the work for both of us as you have done for the past 7 months, everything it's over I'm not going to abandon you anymore, it's up to me to make sure that you become again the one you were before my family and I broke you"" then suddenly it's ""you're responsible for everything, it's is because you are hypersensitive""

His family hates me because I'm ""too pretty, too nice, too cuddly to be true"" when I'm just me!

I can't take it anymore, yesterday and this morning I wanted to end it, I can't tell myself that I'm going to get out of this, I can't tell myself that I'm going to manage to escape of him because I'm hooked in spite of myself and I don't know why because we no longer live together and it's a daily suffering.

He's h24 on his computer, he just plays, he has nothing to talk about, we don't share anything anymore (he was different at first, it was amazing then he showed his face when he moved in with me).

I just asked him again if we could call because I need help because I'm in pain, I'm taking xanax for the first time in my life in addition to my usual treatments when I've always managed to do without (and even with that, it doesn't work)

I'm begging you, help me, advise me, I don't know, but I need help from people who understand me.  
Thank you very much",1679175188.0

How do others navigate relationships while undermedicated/still finding out which meds work for them?,2,11uumnt,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11uumnt/bipolar_disorder_type_ii_is_compromising_my/,4,"I have recently moved in with my partner from across the nation. We had known each other for a long time since we were in the same community-focused nonprofit organization. We had spent a substantial time building an intimate rapport with each other and we began to fully believe we were madly in love with each other. Unfortunately when I moved in the true depth of my mental unwellness quickly forced its way to the surface. My bipolar disorder shares a dangerous comorbidity with various other mental injuries to include combat PTSD from my time in the Marine Corps, community trauma from being raised in poverty, and general childhood trauma which has resulted in an additional major depressive disorder diagnosis. 

My mood cycles rapidly as in several times in one day rapidly. The resulting agitation fills my head with various examples of why the relationship will never work despite her initial fervor to cater to my every need. Now she‚Äôs exhausted, beleaguered, and on the precipice of lapsing back into previous trauma behavior‚Äîshe has PTSD from witnessing her ex-fianc√©e shoot himself in the head right in front of her. I have become the single most stressful thing in her life and I‚Äôve repeatedly attempted to leave the relationship as a result but she would refuse to let me leave. 

I‚Äôm exhausted and I have a maelstrom of dark thoughts swirling through my head. Our relationship has devolved into resentment, petty squabbles, and she no longer has the energy to convince me to stay when I feel compelled to flee from the relationship even though she states she still wants me to stay even if she doesn‚Äôt have the energy to stop me from leaving. I can‚Äôt seek solace in my partner because we have become a point of contention in each others‚Äô lives and if I keep venting to my best friend she‚Äôll begin to grow resentful of my partner for being what she may perceive as unhealthy for me even though I share a large portion of the blame for causing our relationship to devolve to this point.  She constantly states how she needs support and cannot withstand the capricious nature of my mood swings on her own which breaks my heart to hear because now I‚Äôm fully convinced that I am far too much more trouble than I‚Äôm worth and that I am no where near at a point in my mental health recovery to be a healthy boyfriend.

I (f25) was diagnosed in mid 2021, but never categorized in 1 or 2. I was doing therapy (combo biofeedback with the intent to get to emdr) for a few months and taking 200mg lamotrigine and 10mg Lexapro, but I haven't been to therapy in months because of distance and cost, and I've been off my meds for months because the lamoteigine (I think) was causing me sleep problems. 

I work 9 hr days and 6 days a week most weeks while also helping my husband (35m) with his online business (usually don't get home most nights until 9:30). Here's where my problems start.

My husband wants sex a lot. When we first got together, we had sex every day for like a year. Then it started to slow some but was never really an issue. Now we have sex maybe once a week and it's putting a strain on our marriage. He feels like I don't love him or want him or want to be around him anymore. None of those are true and in my mind I have valid reasons for not wanting to have sex when he initiates. I have the kyleena IUD so I get some pretty painful cramps sometimes, or I'm tired, or it's late when we get home and I have to be at work a 6 am. Recently an additional pronlem is that I've become self-conscious about how I look again. He says I don't initiate enough or respond when he tries to get me in the mood. I tried to explain to him my reasons but he said I'm making it sound like a chore, and sometimes it does feel that way until I'm actually in the act and enjoying  it. It feels like too much work or too much sleep loss in exchange for little. I've gotten to the point where if we do have sex, I prefer quickies. He also says that when I initiate when he's tried, he doesn't turn me down unless he's exhausted.

Things are very strained. I feel like I'm sleeping in bed with a stranger, like an old fashioned we've never loved together or had sex before marriage type of relationship. I hate it and I hate that I can't pinpoint a cause or how to fix it. 

Is it mania? Depression? Stress? IUD? Exhaustion? Something I'm missing completely?

How to cope?,4,11ufemf,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11ufemf/why_do_negative_social_interactions_give_me_such/,0,"I‚Äôm posting here because I‚Äôm technically diagnosed as bipolar and I suspect it could potentially be related in the form of overthinking.

Overall I‚Äôve had pretty stable mental health since I graduated college and started working. College was hell and now I occasionally get hypomanic but nothing extreme. Even less frequently do I ever feel depressed. All without meds (has bad side effects, didn‚Äôt really help, felt like it kept me in a ‚Äúsick‚Äù mindset but I digress). So I think I‚Äôm doing great overall. I feel privileged in that way.

But something I still struggle with is this feeling of existential dread I get when I mistake a mistake, am wrong, or am just being trolled.

I have many examples, but one today was someone on an academic subreddit telling me I‚Äôm wrong about something and implied I‚Äôm an idiot that doesn‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about. All when this person couldn‚Äôt refute what I was saying and was generally being a d*ck focused on me being wrong instead of trying to discuss as a community.

Others have been related to feeling secluded in my field of work because I research a type of illness our product exacerbates to find preventative measures. So sometimes I have to trigger people and if I try to find colleagues to talk to ‚Äúit could harm the business‚Äù which my boss is annoyed about (not violating any NDAs)

But I digress.

Basically, anytime I get shut down by someone one way or another, I have thoughts of just not wanting to continue on. Just being unable to cope with other people. 

I don‚Äôt perceive them as being s*icidal, like I wouldn‚Äôt act on it or plan or anything. But just a feeling of anxiety and fear from making social mistakes (like fearing being canceled for a misunderstanding). I just feel like I don‚Äôt know how to move on. Then I think my hypomania kicks that overthinking into overdrive.

All until I sleep and wake up the next day. Usually, but not always. Sometimes it does lead to dysthymia or depression.

I‚Äôve never really had a lot of friends. I‚Äôm married in a great relationship with great (international) in-laws but I don‚Äôt have regular friends I hang out with (mostly friendships of convenience, like classmates) nor do I have a good family. I guess I generally feel like I don‚Äôt really have people to support me.

Despite being able to get by in most social situations fine, I don‚Äôt have a real social life and always feel lacking or like I know how to talk to people in personal. Like I only have enough social skills to survive and pass as normal but maybe awkward sometimes. But the awkwardness and not knowing what to do in social situations is what Sara me up",1679117197.0

Now this is where my question comes in:  I started on latuda 20 in early feb (which seemed to work for like 3 days a week in then stop).  Then Feb 22 I got upped to 40 (as well as wellbutrin being doubled from 150-300 o_O).  Now since last week (almost exactly 2 weeks after upping the two), the pattern has started doing something extra weird....


Now, instead of just going up-down-up-down like it was before, there's a day ""break"" between the solid up and down ... and it's not euthymia it's like a funky mixed thing going on where it rapidly switches back and forth between lighter versions of both sides, with each side ranging anywhere from a couple minutes to an hour.  Then it switches into a 'full state' for a day to continue the cycle (usually it goes in order but it doesn't always).

So my question is ... I really can't understand exactly what this means ... does this mean it's getting better or worse?  I'm trying to figure out if maybe the med changes are in the right direction or if this is actually worsening ... in some ways I'd say better (since the number of 'full' cycles is technically slowed a little) but for more obvious reasons it may be worse.  Also, these bouncy days are pretty obnoxious when it comes to doing things like work because I can't actually maintain a flow since it keeps changing on me.


Has anyone had any sorta situation like this before?  Do you think this is a path toward better, or is it actually getting worse?  I would think a question like that would be obvious but ... it isn't for this o_O",1679113761.0

It has been 18 years since I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. That I live with this is no surprise to anybody who knows me. This disease is so much more nuanced than the typical ""extreme ups and downs"" description it usually receives. I have survived two absolutely devastating depressions, and approximately twenty manic episodes. 
Attempting to describe what mania is like is the worst frustration. It happens gradually and then comes upon me like a brick to the face. First I stop sleeping, then the creativity comes. The blank page beckons to me the way freshly baked bread might entice the starving. It is soft at first, subtle even, but the persistent pen-to-page prevails and soon I am unable to make sense of, or even put into context, the hasty and paranoid puzzle of words. Grandiosity accompanies the writing, then the delusions come, and I believe that this puzzle of words is worthy of a Pulitzer. Other things happen too; reckless driving, substance use, rage, impulsivity, irrationality.... Ultimately I surrender to complete psychosis. Saying it is ""a lot"" is an understatement. 
I have destroyed and lost relationships with family members and friends because of this illness. I have said and done unforgivable things. But it is my deepest wish that people understand that becoming manic is not a choice, it has happened to me whilst on medication and off alike. I would never choose it. 
I'm simply reflecting on all of this today because earlier I read this: Bipolar disorder results in 9.2 years reduction in expected life span, and as many as one in five patients with bipolar disorder completes suicide. (National Institute of Mental Health).
That's the reality. It's my reality. I do not want to ever become a statistic and I want to live as full a life as possible.
Here is what I'm grateful for: I have an incredible support network. I have doctors and therapy. I have the most loving and supportive family and friends, ones who are able to look beyond my illness and recognize that I am not ""me"" in those manic moments. 
And I am grateful for the ability to empathize with all those who struggle.  We can do together what we could never do alone.",1679058621.0

this made me analyze my behaviors and realize when i was manic. 

movies and shows make mania seem fun. it makes it seem like a drug. it can be fun. it can be euphoric. but it‚Äôs usually so unbelievably painful. it‚Äôs excoriating. 

when i told my friends i was probably bipolar they didn‚Äôt really bat an eye, they saw me being reckless and doing risky things and they thought it was fun. 

mania is so much anger. it‚Äôs such a deep anger, i can‚Äôt explain it and i‚Äôve realized that‚Äôs a symptom and not everyone feels it. it‚Äôs such a trip. all the things i thought were normal were probably symptoms. 

my friends thought mania was fun, they saw movies of people going out and doing drugs, they saw me going out and doing drugs but when i explained what it‚Äôs like they were terrified. and they should be. this isn‚Äôt fun. 

bipolar isn‚Äôt fun. mania needs to stop being romanticized. your perception of reality shifts, you‚Äôre angry, and even more angry that no one can help you. you do reckless things because you just don‚Äôt care. you‚Äôre filled with so much self hatred and if the consequence isn‚Äôt immediate death than it doesn‚Äôt matter. 

it‚Äôs not fun. i can‚Äôt explain how un fun it is. it‚Äôs so unstable, you can‚Äôt control your emotions, it‚Äôs constantly changing. 

it reminds me of Vampire Diaries. when they‚Äôre in transition their emotions are magnified. it can be fun but they‚Äôre usually a mess, hurting themselves, being destructive, drinking, hating themselves.

Now when I try to eat I feel so disgusted by food I‚Äôll start gagging and have to spit out the food or else I‚Äôll throw up. I‚Äôve been living off ensure drinks and trying so hard to make myself eat in between 

I messaged my psychiatrist about everything that‚Äôs been going on and she said to see the doctor to rule out the flu. I went. Don‚Äôt have the flu. They did every blood test imaginable- everything came back great. I did a Covid test and that was negative. 

After telling my psych the updates she thinks it‚Äôs that I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot absorbing latuda effectively with my GI symptoms‚Äù I don‚Äôt think I fully understand what she means. She also suggested that I switch to Zyprexa / olanzapine instead of the latuda. 

I messaged my therapist today hoping for something else I guess and all she asked was if I started the zyprexa.

I was recently diagnosed bipolar 1 but am sitting in the tattered remains of my life, wondering how I could have believed what I did.

I first felt symptoms of mania and intense narcissism this summer (I‚Äôm 28 yrs old). I had recently gone through a breakup with my partner of 6 years, had fallen in love with my female best friend (first queer experience) and she did not reciprocate my feelings, and my workload had become incredibly overwhelming.

I started losing weight and hair, had a stress rash on my body and was experiencing fluctuating feelings between paranoia to believing the universe was speaking to me directly.

But theres a delusion I am struggling with the most, that has left me feeling horrid and unforgivable. I believed my wonderful boss of 3 years had emotionally abused me, and was the reason I was experiencing mania and psychosis. I believed this so hard I convinced myself and my therapist/psychiatrist I had PTSD, and that my boss and workplace were all to blame. I told so many people this was what happened to me, because I truly believed it. I blocked my boss on everything and didn‚Äôt talk to her for 6 months.

This January I finally looked back at the texts that I thought ‚Äúproved‚Äù I was abused, and found nothing but support and concern from a woman who never did anything but treat me with respect.

How the hell does this happen? Has anyone ever experienced anything similar? Honestly I‚Äôve been feeling suicidal since the realization- I got fired from my job for other mistakes I made while manic, but I don‚Äôt know how to tell I everyone I talked to that what I believed for the last 6 months was a total lie.

This post could be triggering to others with imposter syndrome, so I want to start off by saying that these are my own anxieties, my goal here is to know if anyone else has felt this way and if they've been able to circumvent it.  


I was officially diagnosed with BP2 by my psychiatrist in the fall, but had previously been diagnosed with a general mood disorder and major depressive disorder, and a suggestion of cyclothymia from a therapist. Bipolar 2 makes sense to me, it tracks with situations and periods of my life where I was feeling unnaturally confident and ""fun"" in a dangerous way, and more often, the periods where I've been unable to get out of bed or the house for weeks.   


Still, I have this weird fear of learning more about Bipolar Disorder, because there's a part of me that fears that if I read about it in-depth, I might start mirroring symptoms that I don't usually experience. Sometimes this includes even browsing or participating in this sub and r/bipolar2.

I think being medicated with varied success also plays into that, but I also think that's just a common bipolar experience: you find good meds and then you wonder if you're even bipolar. I feel that way when they work, but I keep on taking them. And then I will have breakthrough depression after years of being more stable on meds, and I wonder if it's a sign that I have something else wrong with me.

Where the Squibberpops squibbered, and the Flobberjops flew,
A creature named Zeebie lived high in a tree,
Where it twisted and twined in a squiggly spree.

Now Zeebie was special, you see, my dear friend,
For the way he would feel seemed to twist and to bend.
Sometimes Zeebie would zip and would zoom,
Like a rocket ship blasting straight past the moon!

""I'm on top of the world!"" he'd exclaim with great cheer,
Bouncing high on the clouds, without any fear.
He'd giggle and wiggle and dance all day long,
Singing sweet Zeebie songs in a voice loud and strong.

But there were days when Zeebie felt quite the opposite,
His energy vanished, as if swallowed by a Glopit.
He'd mope and he'd grope for the light in the dark,
His once-sparkling eyes now a mere flickering spark.

The creatures of Whippety-Woo began to see,
That Zeebie's behavior was not as it should be.
They'd all gather 'round, full of worry and care,
But their words couldn't lift him from his deepest despair.

One day, as Zeebie lay down in the shade,
A wise Flippety-Flop hopped along and displayed,
A great book of wisdom, with secrets so grand,
It could help Zeebie balance and finally understand.

""You see, my dear Zeebie,"" the Flippety-Flop said,
""It seems that your feelings are not in your head.
A thing called Bipolar has made you this way,
But I'm here to help, so please don't dismay!""

The Flippety-Flop opened the book with a grin,
And as they read, Zeebie's eyes widened within.
He learned of the ups, of the downs, and the swings,
And how he could manage these challenging things.

""Take time for yourself, dear Zeebie,"" it said,
""Find comfort in quiet, and rest your sweet head.
When you're feeling quite high, try to harness your glee,
And channel your energy through art, dance, or a spree.""

""And when you're feeling quite low, in a pit of despair,
Please remember, dear Zeebie, that we'll all still be there.
Reach out to a friend or a Whippety-Woo,
For they'll help you get through, and they'll see you pull through.""

As Zeebie absorbed these new lessons so wise,
He wiped away tears that welled up in his eyes.
The Flippety-Flop smiled and patted his back,
Then hopped off into the sunset, his bag tightly packed.

With new tools in hand, Zeebie set out to try,
To find balance and peace beneath the bright sky.
He'd still have his ups, and he'd still have his downs,
But he knew that his friends in the Whippety-Woo town, Would always stand by him, through thick and through thin, No matter how high or how low he'd begin.
For Zeebie was loved, and he'd always be so,
A creature with feelings, and a heart that would grow.

So remember, dear reader, this story so true,
When life gets you down, or your feelings construe.
There's always a way to find balance and peace,
In a world full of love, where friendships won't cease.

Before that it was either really depressed and a bit of mixed and latest major hypomanic episode in summer 2021. 

So it had been a while and the thing is, I'm still very slow and sleep a lot, but compared to before when I slept 10-12 hours a night every 24h now I still sleep 10-12h but  I stay awake 24h+ multiple times a week.

Last friday I went to my psychiatrist and he asked me if I had any hints of impulsivity that could indicate hypomania, specifically spznding, sex and substance abuse (ya know the usual menu).
And I thought about it for a moment (in retrospect I was making up excuses that would make things logical) and then said no, just spending but for necessary stuff.

And here I am exactly a week later, wearing one of my two new wigs that arrived from aliexpress yesterday (I had only bought one super cheap one before), been smoking weed since monday and unpacking my new dildo in my newly fairyland garden themed decorated kitchen. Oh also received 150 bucks worth of beauty products (I've never done skincare before in my life except sheet masks and face creams from aldi).
For clarification I bought it all before seeing my psychiatrist and smoking again.

I have been seeing the same therapist for almost two months now. While I think we are working well together, I am getting the feeling that I am repeating myself every session. 

I just can't help but overthink my whole life. This tends to obsessively question my career, constant negative self talk, and occasional suicidal ideation (although I could never take action, so its mostly more self torture).  I'm eating maybe 1 to 2 meals a day, inconsistently showering, never doing laundry, and so lethargic that I mostly just lay down and watch tv/YouTube whenever I get home from work. I don't take walks, I don't try to think positively, I don't really exercise, I don't practice gratefulness, etc etc. I feel like a loser, but the thing is...I don't make any effort to change or feel better.

My therapist keeps clearly telling me this rumination is simply not beneficial. I know this is true, but it feels impossible to stop. I can't feel better without taking action (again, total agreement with my therapist), but taking action is so hard. Its getting to the point where I am thinking I am comfy in my misery. I no longer have hypomanic phases thanks to medication, but at least when I was hypomanic I was putting in effort to better myself. This nonstop depression is so consistent, I am beginning to hypothesize that its not really depression, but me continuously self sabotaging myself and always blaming it on something external.

Or maybe they're strangers, or maybe I lied.

and maybe the plans of today will fall through.

I wallow, I'm slow, It's dark and I'm blue.

I stare at the ceiling and hope that it moves.

stretches it's hand out, welcomes, approves. 

maybe in there I will find what I'm missing 

like an orange plastic bottle that I end up kissing

I take a deep breath, there's no need to vent.

the inside of my body is filled with cement.

the strangers are uniform like an aisle of slaves.

when I see my friends, they smile and wave. 

When I see the ceiling 

it's flat and it's white

when I see the sky

its only a light

stains on the wall 

blood on the floor

This show is cool, lets watch some more

in the thick of it all, sometimes I see

a small glimpse of beauty 

a bird in a tree

It tells me to free the mind of its sorrow 

So I go and pick up that orange plastic bottle

my old plastic toys, would dance and they'd battle

now it's a racket that shakes and it rattles

I empty it out

it's been a few days

I don't see the sky but a million sun rays

the ceiling just needs some potential and color

I want to call Billy, Jane and my Mother

except they aren't real

and I'm so alone

Yes the world has beauty 

but not from this throne

I ask who I am in a small paragraph 

the same one I write every week and a half

I'm sorry for the little men

who keep things running to break again

I take the white cap off the orange 

like missing berries and gripping thorns

So what a shame it is we fill

our empty bellies with nails and pills

I like to sing

I like to dance

a champion

a broken lance

relying on what once was great

the king of fools

a dinner plate

we're empty like a rubber tire

roll around

dumpster fire

collecting dust and severed bones

the people watch inside their homes

a man who once was filled with joy

be whisked away

by a plastic, rattling, noise.",1679011807.0

I just want to come to terms with it. I don't know what my abilities are, how smart I am anymore. I'm certainly not capable of any kind of degree or a job anymore. I can't learn a trade or skill. I couldn't be an electrician or an engineer or a programmer or a writer.

All I want, more than anything, is a purpose. I would take a job even if I wasn't paid. I can't volunteer though. I'm simply not smart enough anymore. I'm dumber than a rock now.

195,Manic for 6 months ending up in jail where I had a suicide attempt.,6,11t9ixl,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11t9ixl/manic_for_6_months_ending_up_in_jail_where_i_had/,3,"38m.  February 2022, I finalized my divorce.  I had been trapped in a dysfunctional marriage for 7 years.  During those years, I was incredibly stable, but incredibly over medicated.  Towards the end when things were at their worst, I was alone self medicating with alcohol.  During those years, I was on Venlafaxine, Seroquel, and Lamotragine.

In February, with a fresh start to life, I started exercising and eating better.   I stayed away from my phone and computer, and I would go out and socialize.  I started looking better and feeling better.  Knowing the side effects of the meds, I started tweaking the dosages.  Seroquel in particular is incredibly sedating, so I thought I could go down a natural route, managing my bipolar with healthy stress management.  I saw improvements.  I had more energy, my rest was better.  I kept lowering the dosages and kept seeing improvements with my mood and energy.  I was aware of the risk of mania, so I was very acute in getting enough sleep, and if I needed to, I would use seroquel more as a PRN.

Fast forward to June, and this slope lead me to a path where I was completely off all medication.  I was making strides in all areas of my life.  In particular, my relationship with my daughter.  We were having a blast and an incredible start to the  summer with my motivation and optimism for life.  All while this was happening, I was keeping watch on my mania, never denying that it could pop up at some point.

It would be about when July hit that the first occurrences of mania became apparent in retrospect but wasn't obvious or out of control at the time.  It was the beginnings of losing touch with reality.  Passing interactions with other people, I would sometimes get a hint that I had a larger purpose.  But they were fleeting and rare, so I didn't take notice.

By the end of July, I was semi-regularly battling against these thoughts that the strangers I would come across would be part of a conspiracy, and that there was some purpose behind their being there.  I was in conflict with myself.  90% of me didn't believe it, and thought it was ridiculous, 9% thought that it was my duty to be humble with getting recognition and attention, and 1% was feeding into the delusion.

By the end of August, I was getting exhausted with the notion of being at the center of everything.  I hated the idea that I had to be studied, admired, and protected.  I ""knew"" that something was happening on the outside world, and I didn't know if I was seen as a reconciler of religion, science, and all cultures.  I was seen as the person to bring the whole world together and the inspiration of a movement that could potentially solve any problem.  It was seen as the opportunity for aliens to finally make their presence known.

By the end of September, I knew there were reasons that ""the movement"" couldn't directly come to light to me, and I being in a sort of partnership with the movement, I started giving my personal belongings away.  I would donate my clothes, my coin collection, my golf clubs, my old baseball glove, and most of my other stuff.  It was my belief that each item would go to a person in need, and every item would be cherished by someone.  I sort of expected to get something in return, but never did of course.  Or if I did, I stole it thinking I was meant to steal it.  I was also writing and doing art at this point, which I was also leaving behind on purpose in public places.

When October rolled around, I quit my job because when the world was following me, I saw my job as a way for me to feel normal for a while.  I didn't want to give up my old life, but I had a higher calling.  It would have been around October 24th when I was completely exhausted from all of this.  I couldn't handle the pressure.  I couldn't handle the fact that most of me still didn't believe this shit, but that brainwashing-propaganda-part-of-the-brain that kept feeding me these thoughts, I was exhausted fighting that all those months.

I had the idea to go find some weed.  I never smoked it before in my life.  So, I went to a vape store and asked if they had anything that could get me high.  They gave me a canister and a battery.  I didn't look at it or do any research because with everything being planted and all information to my phone being filtered, there was no point.  I went home, and smoked it.  I went into a panic immediately.  Thinking I was going to die, I called an ambulance.  They came but they didn't seem too concerned when they got here.  I was getting frustrated because they weren't taking this ""emergency"" seriously.

I was out of my mind psychotic.  I fell to the floor ""devolving"" from a human to a werewolf, to smaller and smaller mammals up to and including being a microorganism.  I remember ""going offline"" and coming back online a few times.  I remember seeing a coordinate graph where the line kept splicing off the edge, and it felt like I kept dying.   It felt like I was shedding timelines where I actually died there, but I kept surviving in this one.  I remember being in the bed in the ambulance with the EMT, and he would turn from male to female, and I wrestled with the idea of ""male"" and ""female"" at the most abstract level (almost like properties of the universe).  I remember re-living my life organized in different ways, and coming back to the EMT each time, thinking that this is the infinite cycle of existence.  I have only small fragments after that, but apparently I had a ""freak out"" moment in the hospital, and they saw it as me being aggressive to one of the personnel.  I was arrested, handcuffed, and brought to jail, charged with a felony, simple assault on emergency personnel.

In jail, my parents were not willing to bail me out without being on meds.  The jail system here is completely dysfunctional, and there's basically no mental health support, so there was no way for me to get on my meds.  After about 3 days living in an open dorm situation, the other inmates took notice of my behavior and obvious mental health issues.  They're bored and destructive people, so they preyed on my mental weakness, and I stayed strong as best I could.  I can't go into every thought I had, but there was a night that I thought my family was kidnapped and were being tortured and murdered one by one.  The inmates were feeding the thoughts, and when it got to my daughter, I couldn't hear anymore.  I went into the bathroom, got as high as I could (about 8 feet), jumped, and pushed off the ceiling trying to land my head on the concrete.  I didn't lean back far enough and landed on my spine.  The pain was intense and I threw up the shampoo, soap, and cleaner that I drank about an hour earlier.  I shit my pants and was writhing in pain.  The officers rushed in to check things out.  I pleaded for them to shoot me telling them it will save my daughter.  I kept begging them to do it.  They told me to get up.  Walking to suicide isolation, I felt reassured that what I did put an end to them murdering my family.  I was in suicide watch for 20 days, which, if someone weren't suicidal, would make someone.  I had no clothes but a velcro towel, and I had to shit in a hole and smash the turd down with my foot so it would go through the bars.  I couldn't have more than a few squares of toilet paper.  Nothing to read.  My bed was the concrete.  I'm not complaining because it is what it is.  It's jail and I was there.  But what was the worst part is the back pain lying on the concrete.  No position felt good, it was simply finding the least painful position and last as long as I could before that became too much, and just keep shuffling to find something that's tolerable for just a moment.

After 28 days, there were enough people who got involved that I was finally able to get released on bail with a treatment order.  I got back on my meds, and I've been on them since.  I've slipped into a real bad depression.  The charges were dropped 10 days ago.  I'm resuming my job search (it's impossible to find a job with 'assault' on your record).  The arrest itself can still be found if an employer does a certain background check, but nothing I can do about that.  I slipped into drinking semi-regularly, but I've pulled out of that the last 2 weeks.  All in all, I'm holding on by a thread, but there is hope.

Oh, I forgot that the night of the incident.  I had all my money, $20k dollars in cash, stolen from my apartment.  I have no proof, but my intuition tells me that one of the officers took it when they were searching my apartment.",1679008218.0

I messed up, and there was an order I did not place by mistake, I forgot about it, and I even forgot what I had spoken to this particular client about.

They did not seem thrilled that I asked for help and  didn't even get a confirmation on whether or not they'd help. Perhaps I'm making this bigger than it is, but it was hurtful to see how unwilling they were to help me while I was panicking. I rarely ask anything of anybody bc I have learned to be self-sufficient, and bc with bipolar I have 0 friends.

And then the Abilify was added, very low dose. And it was like nothing worked??? I‚Äôm so afraid of mood stabilizers now because no, I don‚Äôt want to get rid of my hypomania, in fact I‚Äôd love to just stay there. I had a bad experience with is what I‚Äôd expect to be one of the most well tolerated mood stabilizers‚Ä¶. No I don‚Äôt want lithium I don‚Äôt want to have my blood levels checked so often and I don‚Äôt want to be sedated. And no I don‚Äôt want a medication that‚Äôs going to cause weight gain as I struggle enough with self esteeem and body image issues as it is after having three kids! Idk what to do. Going to start the 300XL and see how it goes but sometimes there seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel. I don‚Äôt want to have to gain weight in order to be happy again.

Who in your life do you tell that you are bipolar? (I think this might be a bit of a generational difference here too.) I work in healthcare and hear the way people talk about bipolar patients all the time I don‚Äôt have many Gen-Z coworkers for context most Gen-X, boomers, or millennials and it‚Äôs abysmal. (I‚Äôm a millennial for context). They talk about us the same way people would talk about people convicted for domestic abuse, or a hit and run or a violent crime. Just disdain. So I would never tell anyone at work that and broadly speaking these people are supposed to be empathetic and nice healthcare workers. So I feel like I have a pretty good idea of what people actually think of us when they don‚Äôt have to be politically correct about it cuz they know they aren‚Äôt speaking to people who will be directly hurt or offended by what they have to say. 

I‚Äôve noticed younger people like people on tik tok or like just in general not only talk about it but put it front and center as a key piece of their identity. They put it in cover letters that go out to job applications and to me this just seems wildly na√Øve. I wish we didn‚Äôt live in that world but we have negative stereotypes about being late being unreliable or substance abuse issues and even though a lot of us don‚Äôt do those things often or at all. 

People who have power to dictate important parts of our lives like what jobs and opportunities we have will go with default assumptions like those and will go with the ‚Äúsafer pick‚Äù the person who doesn‚Äôt specify that or the one who doesn‚Äôt have that info readily available on tik tok youtube insta Facebook.

i know it‚Äôs best to stop and see where it gets me. the fact that i‚Äôm irritated about stopping proves to me that it‚Äôs a good idea. in the past i‚Äôve had issues with extreme boredom during sobriety, and i‚Äôm also worried about stopping since it has become sort of a band aid for the pain. i am worried that when i get manic, sad, or bored my resolve to stay sober will crumble. i would really appreciate tips or mantras. maybe something to replace the sort of feeling from any of those? anything is appreciated.",1678981812.0

It took a mental health nurse to see something was really wrong and she got my seen by a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with unspecified bipolar and I‚Äôve now also been referred for an ADHD assessment. 

I don‚Äôt feel any better though. Well of course not, nothing has actually changed. I have been taking Lamictal but not feeling any positive effects yet. 

I had been told for years it‚Äôs depression, anxiety and one doctor said it sounded hormonal. I thought that I would get better. I thought that I would recover and live a healthy, normal life. I feel like I have to mourn the idea of this now. 

I‚Äôm not getting much help behind this diagnosis. They say because I‚Äôve never been hospitalised and I manage to hold down a job and maintain relationships I don‚Äôt need it. I get it but it hurts. I feel invalidated, confused and alone.

I managed to get myself a good job at a company I could have only dreamed of working for. I am fucking it up though. I do nothing most days. I‚Äôm so consumed by what‚Äôs going on in my head whether it‚Äôs good or bad. 

I‚Äôm going to have to go back to a less demanding job which breaks my heart and I feel if leave it will trigger an episode. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll impulsively quit one day too like my last 4 jobs. Maybe I‚Äôll get fired first anyway.

(If anything I say is not allowed please let me know in a message even if you do remove the post so I can be more mindful in the future)

Kinda nervous moving forward but today I finally went to a Psych and after about an hour of talking about different thing's she settled upon one sure for diagnoses of BP2 and immediately prescribed Latuda 20mg at night during dinner. I had spoken with a therapist years ago and was on Trintellix and also tried Zoloft which did nothing but give me headaches and the other made me rage out (respectively). I found out many of the things I do in my daily life are actually Symptoms of both Mania and Depression and that I'm going through episodes of both Multiple times a day for the past 4 years that we covered.

I also have Chrons disease and I saw how it can affect weight and appetite, so I'm hopeful it can boost that as well as get my Racing thoughts, Insomnia and Hyper Productivity to a normal/manageable level. Im very leery about taking it with the experiences I've had with antipsychotics in the past, but my Dr also works with my wife who is ADHD and BP2, and I've seen how our Dr has helped her by listening to her and not just her diagnosis.

I'm on a Month trial at the 20mg so hopefully no severe side effects or medication interactions and this does what it needs to. And I apologize ahead of time to those on this Sub, I will most likely be spam reading a lot of your posts in the coming days just to understand different perspectives of this, cause I won't say I love it but I have a special thing about researching all I can about new things, especially medical.

I feel like my psychiatrist at my most recent appointment was talking to me in a way that made it feel like I was being stupid or taking myself too seriously on what my problems could be. 

I'm diagnosed with a mood disorder and my previous psychiatrist strongly suspected I may be bipolar due to the symptoms I experience. I've been open and shared a lot of my issues with my psychiatrist, but he doesn't seem to care.

What really grinded my gears though was him saying ""well I'm not sure if you really are bipolar because you don't show one of the most common symptoms which is the lack of need for sleep. And I don't mean only needing 5 or 6, I mean more like 2."" To which I had to tell him that no, I have had that back in high school most prominently. I never was diagnosed with bipolar and didn't know what it was before I started my mental health journey, so at the time I didn't think much of having little to no sleep when younger and figured it was normal to go a day or two without sleeping. 

To which he asks me ""well how did that change over the course of time?"" It's called forcing myself to get tired by mentally or physically exerting a lot and also becoming a single parent helps with getting tired a lot faster.

 I felt horrible and hurt because it felt like I had to justify to myself that I'm not crazy, that it's not normal to struggle going to bed before midnight, that feeling crazy swings back and forth isn't normal. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow and I feel like expressing to him how the psych treated me made me feel like I'm being stupid or blowing things out of proportion. I hate this and I hate feeling out of control of my own emotions most of the time, and I just want to be taken seriously. I see now why so many women struggle to get diagnosed; ""it's all in your head"" or ""that's just normal for a woman to be moody""

That being ADHD. I was on Medication for it for about eight years, until last year, when I began to feel... different.

My ADHD used to consist of hyperfixation, hyperactivity and inability to concentrate- so normal ADHD stuff, but last year before I graduated high school in May, I noticed something was changing. I assumed it was my ADHD, just evolving with new symptoms as I got older but towards Graduation time and shortly thereafter, I realized I was wrong. 

It began to get worse with huge depressive episodes, I would cry, or feeling like crying some days, and be fine the next. And I would feel worthless, like I didn't mean or contribute anything, and then have confidence that soared through the roof. I started snapping on people and then being okay the next second. 

The anger and mood swings problems got worse within the past few months. I work retail, and I've been showing attitude and anger and even hatred one moment, and then I'm super happy and energetic the next second. Even outside of work, I snap at my parents, my best friend and have constant negative emotions. I have started talking super-super fast without realizing, and feel like my thoughts are going a million miles an hour. (MY Psych mentioned this to me yesterday). 

One of the biggest things that coincides with the anger and mood swings is my impulse control and motivation. One thing I lack is impulse control, I know something is wrong, but I still choose to do it anyway. This has affected me with porn, gaming too much, and most importantly- spending. I have credit cards and I paid them off a month ago, and once again I have a huge balance on both, because I know I shouldnt be spending money, but in the moment it feels like I should. Also the lack of motivation issue is *huge*. I want to go to the gym, I want to go out and do things, but I just *can't* no matter how hard I force myself to try.

After an argument with my mom about how she's worried about me and how she knows something is wrong, I came clean and told her that I've been keeping how I've been feeling from her, my dad, sisters, and my psychiatrist and therapist. I was afraid to be on new medicine and to be diagnosed with something new. My psych told me that sometimes ADHD can evolve or even be mistaken for Bipolar, since the two share similar symptoms. I was put on Latuda yesterday, and I feel no difference yet, since it takes 3 weeks or more to do so, but I'm hopeful. And hopefully I can learn to live with this since it's a part of me now.",1678943208.0

I feel like I can't turn to anyone. My psychologist and doctor understand but damn the nights are so long, and in the day, I have to be around so many people I can't tell what's going on for me. Some professionals even don't understand me unless they know me very well. I'm a serial masker and even when I'm wanting to throw a chair through a window I'll just casually say ""I'm raging right now"" and they don't take notice lol. So some professionals don't take notice and others say things like ""I'm very alarmed"" at my behaviour. I just can't be that person I used to be anymore; exploding rage and emotion. Luckily a have professionals that see the signs clearly but talking to others can make me feel invisible.

I feel like everyone in society, the world around me, online, is watching everything I'm saying and doing, even people in cars or shop assistants. Which I know sounds ridiculous, but I feel like I can't move a muscle or say a thing, it's constant. It's even hard to post here.

It was fun with the spiritual and sensual bliss but now it's just hell. I made the mistake of having a nap before midnight and I won't sleep tonight. I got an exam today, I'll see my nurse thankfully, then my therapist, but right now I just see this long stretch of night ahead of me. The house is so quiet, I'm worried I'll see ghosts if I leave my room lol. I just feel so very alone.

College helped so much, they're very supportive there, my classmates are amazing but it's getting confusing for me there, too. My mouth is starting to get me in trouble. I feel like my world is getting smaller section by section. 

My psychologist said it was ok for me to go to a Buddhist centre for a few days as long as I don't drive there, as long as I stick to grounding meditation rather than the transendental stuff lol. So maybe that will help me a lot.

I don't even know what this post is about. It's just all crumbling down, now. I might try to switch channels in my brain rather than hyperfocusing on my phone. Have something to eat and drink. Maybe try sleep again.

I'm focusing so inwardly; thoughts, feelings, etc. I need to get out of my head and into my body. I try to do the mindfulness 5 things but I'm too paranoid about ghosts right now. I wanna listen to my headphones but can't for the same reason. I think I'm literally too afraid to leave my bed or do anything but type, and too paranoid to ring a hotline. I'm dreading 3 am but hopefully I will be asleep by then.

This a clinic, not a personal relationship like with all the p-docs before, and I don't think the lengthy computerized questionnaire is set up to flag the nuances of my requirements, like weight neutral or not mind numbing. I just want to comfortably exist in the world, able to think clearly enough to get things done and without the paranoia edge that I live with now, but if muscle jerks, increased hospitalizations and diabetes are the price I have to pay maybe life as a hermetic loner is something I have to just accept.",1678939490.0

So I am a bipolar and I haven't actually told anyone but few about my bipolarity. Anyway I believe being a bipolar affects the way I am thinking and the decisions I make according to my emotions which are instable and which will eventually lead to a feeling of regret and guilt later.

So my problem is that now while the usual and frequent depressive episodes trigger, this depressive episode is the WORST so far, I live in this paradoxical loop and cycle between my past and all these nostalgic moments I am always recalling in my mind that could make me sometimes happy but also crying because I miss these moments so much and miss the people that I don't see anymore but have been a great part in my life nevertheless left me for either no reason or with a reason that I couldn't really do anything about it, my present which is affected negatively by my nostalgia and emotions for the past and taking a great amount of time just living in the memories, living in the past and dreams instead of living in the present time, and my future which l do think about but don't care about it anymore, sometimes I used to think about my future to forget about the past but failed to do so. 

Thinking about what I could do in the future makes me a bit happy nevertheless when these nostalgic moments hit me, it just converts me from a happy person to a sad, desperate and disappointed person again that eventually lead to deep depression which cause suicidal ideation, mostly to overdose to death, but ends up with failed attempts to commit suicide. I can't even determine if these memories are good or bad by now cuz it depends as well, sometimes I just get the good parts of the memories while other times I just get the tragic parts and events that happened to me as for getting bullied recently at the university, losing my best friend, losing my boyfriend ...etc. I just believe by now that good memories are even worse and more hurtful than the bad ones. It just feels like getting stabbed in the back.

These many emotions and mixed-up thoughts I get give me a headache and usually panic attacks, that sometimes I cut myself with a nearby sharp thing as well.

I also have ADHD, social phobia and severe trust issues. I now feel so bad that I wish this world to stop and my life ends. Thinking about suicide already makes me more comfortable to end my struggle you know. So I've been asking if I am alone on this. Does anyone relate to my experience?",1678928566.0

So long story short, i‚Äôve had 3 manic/psychotic episodes in the past year. One of them I was completely sober and still got psychosis.

my problem is i really want to smoke some fucking weed. my psychiatrist says no weed or alcohol and my family i‚Äôm living with obviously says no weed. i also really really hate lying. i‚Äôve smoked a few times since this and been completely fine except for some derealization the first time (which is normal for me if i smoke too much/heavy indica). i WANT to just get a pen again and only smoke at night to sleep or at a friends house or something. i feel like i can much better monitor my use now that i have to hide it/know what it can do. it immensely helps my creativity as an artist, my intense anxiety(that my psych won‚Äôt prescribe antiaxiety meds for), and my sleep (that i now need pills like ambien to help me sleep). 

i‚Äôm sorry for such the long ramble but this is just the spark notes summary of my life this past year. i just want to feel whole again without sending myself into a psychotic break. am i OK to smoke a little while on mood-stabilizatiers and antipsychotics? i smoked a LOT before (unmedicated) and only had an episode when i was undergoing extreme stress and was triggered again.

How can I assure I wake up so I don't lose my job?)

Hi everyone. I will start with some background.

I (24 f-ish) have had various sleep issues literally my whole life. Mostly sleeping too much and at the ""wrong"" time, which when I was a teenager wasn't a big deal; and even through all of my adult years until now, I could get myself out of bed in the morning when I Really Needed To.

I have been in and out of therapy and psych treatment for half my life, including antipsychotics consistently for 12 years now. Even then I could get up when it was necessary.

Last year though I was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder (saw it coming; runs in the family; knew it would catch up to me someday). I have it decently managed med-wise finally! I became stable enough to get a job after spending over a year coasting on savings.

But now, I cannot for the life of me wake up on time. Yesterday (my first day) I managed-- but today I would have slept right through the day and lost my new job if my partner (who took the day off and could have easily slept later) had not woken up by chance half an hour before my shift and woke me up. Even at work I was literally nodding off for the first two and a half hours despite having drank 3-4 entire cups of espresso.

I have a million alarms on my phone. I'd turn them off in my sleep so I tried leaving my phone across the room at night, only to adapt to sleeping through the alarm completely.

For reference, I take seroquel (600mg), lamictal (200? 250?), and just recently we added lithium (300mg and increasing slowly).

How the hell do you guys get yourselves up when you're so sedated? These meds have finally made me stable but now I literally don't know how to get up in time.

ETA: I take other meds unrelated to my bipolar‚Äì cymbalta and lyrica for pain, klonopin for PTSD panic and rage.",1678924881.0

I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 10 years ago. It's only now that I started getting treatment (Long story but it has to do with some heavy denial). 

I experience night terrors at least once a week if not more. I used to think I was over dramatic but now I'm starting to pay attention to my tightened emotional states. The self-loathing and suicidal ideation have always been a factor for me. I was used to experiencing chronic depression.

I had more hypomanic episodes when I was younger but not so much now. They're more mixed episodes than anything else.

Things have gotten better for me with my quality of life, quality of people around me, meds, therapy, and holding myself mostly accountable to what I need to do. But this constant struggle, and people always thinking or assuming I'm doing better than I am because I'm luckily relatively ""high functioning"" is so frustrating lately. Or, being told by family members that ""you don't seem bipolar"" when they've barely talked to me for years. This affects relationships, finances, work,¬†opportunities, being in the moment and embracing ""life."" So many people think I'm doing well and even doing better than them, say I've worked so hard and should be proud of myself, but I just don't feel it because every day I'm still battling and it sucks a majority of the time. 

I don't hide or shy away from general discussions of mental health because I believe it should be more normalized, but I still don't feel comfortable taking about how I truly feel, my symptoms, etc. When I try to talk to my people about my more severe symptoms that aren't bipolar, I get strange looks, ""I've never heard of that,"" etc. So then the fact that those around me still say I'm doing so well etc frustrates me even more. So I just stopped sharing as much. My journal and therapist know my deepest turmoil instead of my partners. 

It's just a few of those days right now where ""I wish this would end, I wish this would heal, I wish I could focus"" is replaying over and over in my head.",1678899090.0

1.) Get some sunlight (real or sunlight lamps with 10K lux) within the hour of waking up and during sunset. There‚Äôs some scientific shit like the photons during those times set circadian rhythms.


2.) Blue light blocking glasses after sunset! Extra points if you can set your screens to warmer tones. iPhones do it and my TV has a dark calibration mode. 


3.) Get tf off your phones around bed time (I fail at this every time lol).


4.) TAKE YOUR MEDS!!! Take them earlier, take an extra sleepy dose if that‚Äôs in your care plan. I take L-Threanine with them and it helps relax me more but check with your doctor. 


5.) If you‚Äôre able to, get some exercise (gross, I know). It really does help me even if it‚Äôs a 15 minute walk.

I know I haven't gained as much weight as other people but it feels horrible. I'm technically not overweight and apparently it isn't that bad according to other people, but I am struggling so fucking much not to slip back into my eating disorder. I had to go through a hospital program to treat it and can't afford a relapse. Literally. I can't afford to quit my job for treatment again.

Every time I get back into exercising and healthy habits, an episode fucking hits and I lose all of my good habits and eating and everything gets thrown to shit. I literally have only one other med option since I've been battling this disorder since I was 7 years old and either cant go on certain other ones because they stopped being effective, they react to other meds, or the side effects were too severe. The one other med option I have has a higher chance of gaining weight too. To boot: I've been told that even on proper medication and lifestyle changes, I will still experience episodes because of just how my disorder affects me. It's exhausting.

I know I should be counting my blessings that I havent gained a lot more than I have but it's just so fucking hard to handle when even though I only have a few ED slips here and there, I'm still cursed with the mental thoughts of it plaguing me all the time. It's such a challenge to not fall into problem behaviours.

351,On The Receiving End,6,11rqh7a,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11rqh7a/on_the_receiving_end/,1,"Something happened to me in the summer of 2017. I won't go into a lot of detail, but a lot of years of repressed emotional pain poured out of me all at once and I almost committed suicide. Then, untreated for two long years with the full onset of my disorder pressing into me, I teetered back and forth from giving up and pulling through. It terrified the people closest to me and drove away those who weren't. I would settle and plan on it when things got to be too much because the pain was too much. Then I would back off from it and try again. I didn't realize how much I was hurting people until towards the end, then I forced my way through the barriers preventing me from getting help. I spent a year on lithium and got on lamotrigine in 2020. I rebuilt my life, mended the wounds.

In 2019, I made a friend. We became close very quickly. I felt like she knew me right away as well as anyone ever could. I opened my heart to her, and she shared things with me too. We spent time together, we had fun, I cared about her. I could go on forever, because the memories will stay with me forever, and I felt so many things that I could never put them all into words. Then she made a change in her life, fell on hard times, shifted to where it was harder for me to reach her. At the time, I used the distance as an excuse to get out of doing more to help. I was still pretty young, things were hard on me as well, and I was bitter in an unfair way - I felt abandoned. She slipped into the negative aspects of her environment more and more and I just let it happen. I could have done more.

I would have never admitted it at the time, but shamefully, I admit now that I wasn't so entirely surprised. She confided things in me over some of our late night conversations. There was a stronger history there than even I had because she made an attempt that - according to her - only I and the hospital knew about. But I was so angry over her seemingly abandoning me that I didn't try to reach out as often as I should have. When I did, it was usually stuff about me, or about our friendship, but all too little about her except when we actually got to talk. In a way, I didn't want to know after a while. In my mind, I'd all but lost her. It was only after I lost her for real when I realized that I had no idea what it would truly be to really *lose* someone. Because now there's nothing left to to mend.

I have spent a long, long time blaming myself, making a false peace with it and watching it all slip away, wishing I had the chance to go back and say something to myself - to tell me to get my head out of my ass and help her. To be there when the time came. And wishing I could speak to her, myself, so I could beg her to come back around, so I could tell her of the hurt she would leave in her wake. To tell her how I mourned her. To try and take the chance I had while I still had it to at least *try* and give her a way back. Because I would have given anything to help. If I'd have known what I know now, if I'd have felt the pain I still carry today, I would have worked tirelessly, I'd have given it a greater all than I've ever known myself to give. But I didn't. And now it's over. And I have to live with that.

I knew that I loved her. I still do. How I love her, and how I did back then, I'm not really sure. She'll forever have been one of my closest friends, I do know that at the very least. Maybe there is more that was left unspoken, but I'll never get to explore those feelings. I'll never get to talk with her, confide in her, share a tender moment, have a bit of fun, share artwork and inspiration, make plans for the future, create dreams with her, nor any of the other beautiful things about life. It's just over. That's all there is. And although I'd like to believe I'll see her again on the other side, I do not know that. And even if I did, what would I say? What would anyone say? When all the people she ever loved come back having lived full lives, having moved past her long ago. Left to an eternity alone.

I wish I could have helped her as she once helped me. I wish she could be here so I could show her my meaning for togetherness, support, friendship, and love. But she is not, and those she left behind live on with that bitter, bitter fact. Yet, despite it all, I do not live bitterly. I look into my mirror every morning and I say to myself that today, I will give those who rely on me for support and friendship the best effort I can make. I will continue trying to give myself the best life I can live. I will struggle through whatever comes my way and find my happiness in each day. I live decently, today. I make promises on my being there and I come through however possible. I let people trust me because I know today what I once did not - that I could not hurt them as I was hurt.",1678869550.0

Recently got diagnosed with ADHD after years of being treated with massive amounts of bipolar meds. I was agreeable to my new psychiatrist trimming my bipolar meds down (fuck me was I grateful) but she sadly took it one step too far after Christmas and made a play for the lithium, which I‚Äôd been on for 10 years. 

During the titration I:- 

- got really depressed to begin with. I could deal with that. 
- missed out on a day with my kid which was awful. On that day I started smelling things that I knew weren‚Äôt there. 
- I then started to get super paranoid and delusional, to the point of almost hurting my SO because I thought she‚Äôd stolen money from me. 
- Everything became too real for me. 
- I had visual hallucinations, became very frightened of being in the house on my own. 
- I then got really manic, incredibly unpleasant, verbally hostile to people around me. I couldn‚Äôt work and my SO and family didn‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôd compose lengthy emails and messages about conspiracy theories and stuff I really don‚Äôt have much interest in when I‚Äôm well and I ruined a few fairly stable friendships because I was so fucking grandiose. 


After missing time with my daughter, being incredibly unpleasant to my family and generally being a mess my psych finally increased the lithium back up to 1000mg. For reference, the major relapse happened at 600mg. I held out for about 10 days before giving up and putting it back to 800, then 1000 with my primary care doctors approval. 

Now, my psychiatrist has agreed not to touch the lithium for now. She feels that my relapse was due to autism spectrum, not bipolar. I have agreed to an autism assessment but she is totally unphased about the lithium. I‚Äôm still on low dose quetiapine, klonopin and my ADHD medication. She has refused to reintroduce lamotrogine even though I‚Äôve said numerous times I am depressed and struggling to do things. My work situation is precarious and honestly, I just want to get back to normal. 

I‚Äôve seen psychiatrists since I was 19 and have always known I have bipolar, and have been treated for a mood disorder since I was 20. I agree with the ADHD and I‚Äôm willing to explore autism. I don‚Äôt want to have bipolar, but I know 100% that is what I have. I‚Äôm currently dealing with depressive symptoms, lethargy and still unable to work, all of which I feel are concordant with someone who‚Äôs had a pretty nasty manic episode. I don‚Äôt want to be a victim about it but it feels so invalidating to have to go through this knowing I‚Äôve had a manic episode. 

I‚Äôm frustrated that my psychiatrist is being so dangerously negligent here. I don‚Äôt want 100‚Äôs of new meds, but it‚Äôs kinda insulting for my family to be told I‚Äôm autistic when I‚Äôve struggled with bipolar symptoms for over a decade now. I‚Äôve gone from seeing a psychiatrist who told me I had very severe bipolar and medicated me way too much to the complete opposite. For what it‚Äôs worth, all of my family (myself included) work in mental health, some clinically, others administratively. Put it this way- my SO knows what a manic episode looks like without question. 

Is there anything I can do? All I want is to not be unwell like that again, for my families benefit, and to even have an open door to explore getting rid of this depression. I guess I just feel totally invalidated, and I want to get on with my life. Any words? I feel like this is the first time I‚Äôve been so unwell I‚Äôve actually lost sight of myself, and I‚Äôm struggling, big time.",1678897761.0

Oh boy, okay. I‚Äôve been with my bf for almost four years, before we got together we were friends (best friends honestly) for a year. Met at work, I dated his toxic friend and he really help me get out of that situation. Also, I was struggling with addiction bad, I was in a really horrible group of friends and he was my only escape. It started off really rocky, he‚Äôs two years older and never had a girlfriend before. He was a hermit most of his life, that was even his first job. But he was a sweetheart, he was so gentle and patient (we both worked in mental health if that tells you anything!)
I was a mess, this was my first healthy relationship and I had just got done being in a very traumatizing situation but he was there every step of the way.

Fast forward, we both leave that job and eventually move out on our own. Now we‚Äôre here, nothing really to mention in between since I got clean, got a nice job and continued to work on myself for the both of us.

Now, last month was really hard. Recently I had been struggling with my depressive episodes, he was very aware but I wasn‚Äôt very present in our relationship for the last couple months. I honestly was mean, I had stopped talking about wanting kids with him and changing future plans. Last month he had become very distant and I immediately noticed, valentines passes and he comes to me in tears. I immediately knew what was going on, many people have walked out of my life and that look was all over his face. He cried to me saying that I no longer wanted the same things, he had been thinking for the past month about us and that our relationship had ran it‚Äôs course. I was devastated, the love of my life hadn‚Äôt been shown the love he deserved. I had always wanted the things he wanted, kids and evrything. I‚Äôve just been feeling so down I hadn‚Äôt cared about anyone else, I really haven‚Äôt been feeling like I‚Äôll make it past this next year. 

I of course apologized, we cried and I reassured him I‚Äôd do much better at verbalizing my wants with a future with him. I‚Äôve got to be better because he deserves it. He said after that day he felt so much better ‚Ä¶ but I keep reliving that day. Ever since I‚Äôve had bad anxiety attacks which I have a history of, used to take meds for (on meds for bipolar) and he‚Äôs witnessed a few. I keep having nightmares about him breaking it off, I need more reassurance than ever. It just replays in my head over and over.
The only advice I‚Äôve been given from my therapist is to just trust him and try getting back on meds.

i am not asking for a medical advice or a diagnosis! This is more a question about accepting what the doctors say.

I am wondering if anyone can relate. I am constantly questioning if I was misdiagnosed or if my meds are working well and I'm simply in denial.

I was diagnosed two years ago with ""unspecified bipolar disorder"" at the age of 18, I think they have settled on bipolar 2 since. The reason for the diagnosis was psychotic symptoms and sudden phobias between two depressive episodes where they ruled out everything else and concluded hypomania. Whatever my true disorder is I have always been high functioning which I am very thankful for. Now comes the problem.

They have treated me with lamotrigine 200mg for two years and they recently increased the dose to 300mg. My current doctor is very good and I trust him but has told me the meds are working which is the reason that I haven't had any hypomanic episodes since. If that is the case then I am lucky that they caught it so early. 

The few people in my family I've told don't believe that I have it, they believe in my depressions but as I said earlier I am high functioning even then which masks the problem a lot. A private psychologist has concluded that I am not bipolar, while multiple doctors have said that I do have a mood disorder and they have pinpointed bipolar (unspecified or type 2).

Who am I?
 
The biggest question for us is, ‚ÄúWho am I?‚Äù As humans, we start this thinking in our earliest memories of who were are and how we relate to the people around us (usually family and close friends in childhood).  For those of us with Mental Illness, the question of who we remain throughout Adulthood.  After our diagnosis, we must question who we are compared to the person we were before. Do the jumble of letters and names of the diagnosis matter? Am I now cursed with this illness I may have had for most of my life? 
            I have no idea if I am the same as before the diagnosis, but I know that after over 25 years of untreated mental illness, I was at the end of my rope.  I had expended my energy being ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù or what I thought was normal.  During this time, I always felt that I was the best in the world or the world's worst person.  Never an in-between. There are days I can't remember and nights I wish I could.  In that element, I am a completely different person on medication.  However, I am still very much the same person as before. I love the same, hurt the same, work the same, and talk the same (maybe a little slower and with a better tone). My emotions, or my ability to control and regulate my emotions, are drastically improved.
            What's in a diagnosis? Well, I can say that I am terrified that people will find out; it's like my secret identity.  Clark Kent is at work, around others, and a Super Mental Illness guy when the glasses come off. Would people look at me differently if they realized I was Bipolar, had c-PTSD, Anxiety disorder, substance use disorder, Panic Attack disorder, and ADHD? I think that they would, and I hope that they wouldn't, but one's ability to lead seems to hinder on their ability to be ‚Äúhealthy,‚Äù and even treated mental illness is not considered healthy.  
            I know I am a great father, a good husband, and a great leader.  I have led troops into battle, players on the field, hoopers on the court, and teachers in the classroom, and I will not let the mash of letters and dx codes define who I am.  Will I struggle some days? You betcha ya.  Will I need time, love, and acceptance? of course.  But I refuse to allow this diagnosis to define who I am.  There are mornings when I cry out, ‚Äúwhy me‚Äù why do I have to put into place all the safeguards for my triggers? Why do I have to do therapy, go to the psychiatrist, to group, live by a schedule, and take all my medications?  It's hard, and it's hard almost every day.  But when it comes down to it, I am still the same old me, and I hope others see it the same",1678848201.0

Or maybe just another manic thoughts?,3,11rnh0k,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11rnh0k/i_suddenly_dont_want_to_have_kids_or_maybe_just/,5,"I‚Äôm (f29) diagnosed of bipolar disorder for almost 7 years. I‚Äôm happily married to my long term partner (m31) and we‚Äôve always wanted to have kids someday.

Recently, there‚Äôs been so much stress in my life because, I don‚Äôt know, life happens. I get episodes from time to time but now it‚Äôs manageable and I believe the meds I take are the reason behind it. I‚Äôve been taking them religiously because aint no body got time for another relapse!! 

With all the stress comes the promotion at work, everyday working out in the gym, etc. For about 3 weeks, I feel so pumped and productive... I feel like everything‚Äôs falling into place. So much drive and excitement for the future! I was diagnosed in my early 20s and was in and out of the hospital for it. Now I‚Äôm almost 30, I feel like I‚Äôm only starting to ‚Äúredeem‚Äù myself as I call it. But I don‚Äôt consider this as manic, maybe just the right amount of optimistic. It does not in any way affect daily tasks, so there‚Äôs no harm, right?

I started to worry when my thoughts would lead me into some selfish conclusions like- I‚Äôd sacrifice having a baby/family to achieve all my goals and dreams. 

But, what if this I what I really want? What if this is not just another manic thought and this is what‚Äôs best for me? 

I started dropping hints to my husband about it. He‚Äôs being very supportive but that just hurts me more; I don‚Äôt want to take away the chance for him to be a father just because of my sudden decision. He did not sign up for this. We‚Äôre supposed to have kids once we‚Äôre financially stable- that was our plan. He even have a list of baby names. See? I‚Äôm so unfair. 

I feel like I‚Äôm having mixed episodes because the anxiety is crippling. I listed down a lot of reasons why I shouldn‚Äôt bring a baby to this cruel world (that‚Äôs one). Relapse is a high probability because of the big change. Proneness to postpartum depression. Of course, no meds for a long time. Relationships can be destroyed (again). On a more selfish note, I do have a lot of goals like traveling the world, starting up my own business, etc. I might be 45 before achieving all that. Oh, I‚Äôm also scared I will pass on the bipolar genes. 

Hmmm, I‚Äôm not sure where my thoughts went. But that‚Äôs all, I guess. No questions. I‚Äôm more on asking for your thoughts, please.",1678859253.0

What was happening was (during the medicine)
‚Ä¢ severe hair loss
‚Ä¢ longer sleep time (12 hours) which made me tired during the day
‚Ä¢ weight gain
‚Ä¢ trouble focusing and studying

I have been trying countless medicine and I can't afford to sustain them anymore. It costs us thousands monthly (in usd, about $100). I can't afford the side effects of the medicine as I am a student, plus the cost is too much.

I try to avoid interacting with others to avoid letting them experience my manic episodes. Instead I just keep my support system closer to me because they know how to handle me. I know this is a stupid decision and all, but I'll try to get back to therapy as soon as i can save up.

Any suggestions on how i should release my manic and depressive episode? 

So far, i try to watch films and series to keep me from being too depressed. As for mania i try to do arts to release the hyperactivity and impulsiveness. 

Please be kind :(  I already know how bad of a decision this is, I have been reading posts about this behavior. But I can't seem to think of  other solutions to finance my therapy and meds.

Hi everyone - this is my first post here. I was diagnosed with bipolar in 2017 and have worked really hard to build a mostly functional life. But as I‚Äôm sure y‚Äôall understand, I don‚Äôt handle stress as ‚Äúwell‚Äù as other people, so I try to mitigate stress as much as possible.

Anyway, for some context, my best friend of 11 years moved in with me and my husband in November. It was supposed to be temporary, but she‚Äôs still here. It‚Äôs been really hard for me to adjust to less alone time, but that‚Äôs on me to deal with. But she is INCREDIBLY messy. She has been her entire life. I‚Äôve repeatedly told her to at least contain her mess to her room and to please keep her bedroom door shut, because I have three dogs (one of which is a puppy) and they could get into shit in her room. She never remembers and it‚Äôs a constant thing I have to remind her of. Well my worst fear happened - last week, I was cooking dinner and my puppy wandered into her room, and ate a bunch of pain meds she had left out on her bedroom floor. My dog started to aggressively vomit and was overall just extremely sick. I rushed her to the vet ER, and she‚Äôs okay now, but it was EXTREMELY stressful. I genuinely thought my puppy was going to die. She was sick for days after and the vet bill was over $1000. 

My best friend basically sent a quick apology text and then expected us to go back to normal. Meanwhile this level of stress is making me severely depressed. I can‚Äôt get out of bed except to take care of my dogs. I haven‚Äôt gone back to work. My husband is very supportive but nobody else in my life understands why I‚Äôm so angry and taking this so hard. I feel like I just can‚Äôt get over it. It‚Äôs been 4 days and I can‚Äôt bring myself to even speak with her. I‚Äôm so angry and exhausted and I‚Äôm getting depressed again. Any advice for getting through this?

I had really shitty doctors for the entirety of 2020-2022. They told me that I would never be able to do what I was capable of before and that the mood swings and constant episodes were the best that I could do. 3 doctors told me that. (I was having episodes at least twice a month for two years. I don't think I even hit euthymia once). In October, a 4th doctor heard my story and changed my meds. I'm doing slightly better now. 


After my first episode, my parents went from¬† ""he could go to Harvard and be a doctor"" to ""we've decided not to support you through college."" If I went to school, I wouldn't have any support financially, and my university requires students to be full-time. 


Basically, I don't think I'm even capable of 1. School, 2. Work, and 3. Staying stable. This is literally the closest to #2 and #3 that I've ever been, and I've been trying for 3 years now. I don't know how people succeed with this diagnosis. 


Was anybody here able to achieve their dreams? How did you do that and stay stable? How does someone even do that without support, even when they don't have this diagnosis? 


I cry about not finishing school at least twice a month since I dropped out. If I appeal the barred enrollment decision, I was told that I'd likely be welcomed back (they said that they shouldn't have kicked me out because of a bipolar episode). I don't feel like I could ever get that back, especially with the debt I'm already in. 


I don't relate to anything about my life. I have 2 friends, a job in a random field, my partner, and my house. I don't feel like me anymore. It doesn't even feel possible to do what I want to do. I don't know what to do about it or how to believe in myself.

My job in healthcare was what set off so many awful episodes in the past and I'm scared to go back. There's a lot of death at my job, especially in regards to infants and it got to the point where I was crying before, after and during my shifts.

We have been dating for two months, and I believe she went to their church sometime last month. She also had me think that she is not using Facebook anymore when we met. But, when I got to be close to her family, I found out about her Facebook. I stalked it, and found a guy liking and commenting on her photos in the past. I confronted her about who it was. She said, it was her ex that she had been telling me, but it was just a different person.

I actually don‚Äôt give a fuck about her past, it‚Äôs just that, it hurts me knowing that she made me believe it was a different person. So now, I‚Äôm starting to think she might still be in love with him, or she might have seen him sometimes. But she told me it had been like a year since she saw him. She said she had trauma with that person that‚Äôs why she had decided to forget everything about him. She just doesn‚Äôt want me to know about him because I‚Äôm telling you, the way she said to me about that guy in the beginning was really traumatizing.

Last night, I gave her a chance to explain everything to me because I want to continue our relationship. I told her to explain everything to me, no lies, just all truths. I asked her about the timeline because I don‚Äôt know, the timeline of her breaking up with him seems pretty essential to me. I was squeezing her out about the details, I sounded like a fucking creepy investigator, but I just wanted to tell her the truth.

She said she told me everything and she‚Äôs telling the truth, why don‚Äôt I just fucking believe her. If I won‚Äôt trust her anymore, it‚Äôs better to end this relationship.

I understand it takes a real truthful mindset to deticate yourself to actually really making that step, and unfortunately I know I'm not ready for that.

I just wanted to talk about it in depth for a minute to someone, it's nice to rant but I don't want to waste a therapists time with my silly rants and not really solve anything again. 

Despite being 17, I've been talking to counselors, therapists, and psychologists for 10 years now, seeing my first one at age 7, where my first therapist told my parents I wanted to runaway and/or hurt myself.

I'm not officially diagnosed, but bipolar runs in my family and I'm the exact same meds at a higher dose than my family members with the disorder aswell. My psychiatrist told me he wouldn't see me again until I was visiting with a therapist again, but after years of therapy with no results I just don't see the point anymore.

I guess it's my fault, I was never able to actually use the suggestion they gave me. As soon as the meeting was over, I just forgot everything they ever said, in CBT especially. I've seen some really great people who really liked me and found my case really interesting, but I couldn't bring myself to see them more than a handful of times. I'm not sure why, maybe I came in and they were busy, or I felt like I couldn't commit to it. 

I've had a very stressful and traumatic life ranging from all kind of abuse until very very recently when I finally moved out of my house and in with another family. I was failong highschool horribly and was on the brink of dropping out and attempting again. I met my boyfriend, and I hospitalized myself because of it. But, because of the system here, they kept me there for 17 hours and told me I was going to the ward and then just sent me home, I was pissed honestly. I was set for change, I was going to help myself, but they dumped me because I voluntarily admitted myself. 

I don't know, I'm not ready though. I'm a teen, and the idea of being manic again after so many horrible lows of depression is honestly such a dream come true. I bet you can see it, I've struggled with depression and suicide attempts and brutal self harm for years and years to suddenly break and change so suddenly and just feel ""better"" of course I was fucking delusional as shit with it being my first episode and it was a long one. I got into another depressive episode after and nearly killed someone out of pure jealousy, I'm not even kidding. 

I know I'm really really REALLY bad without therapy, and my medication is EXTREMELY high because of it, literally above the highest prescribed dose of lamotrigine to make up for it. 

I have been trying to keep track of myself, using dailyio has bee good for mood tracking and keeping notes of mood swings, but whenever I see my mood go up, I get more excited. I want to stop taking my meds I want the feeling to stay I indulge in every little thing I can go keep the feeling, but then BOOM the universe fucks me up and spirals me down again and fucks me up like shit man get out of here let me do my thing. 

Like man it's a terrible mindset but can you blame me? I'm 17, I have such a huge life ahead of me what's the worst a few years of having fun can do to me? It's not peer pressure either, but I want to party I want to drink I want to smoke o want to have fun while I can. I've been depressed and isolated from the world for YEARS. The second I got a taste of freedom I yanked it my way and went crazy, it was literally the best time of my life despite the outcomes. 

Luckily, my mind's defence mechanism (and drug use and ADHD) is to literally forget EVERYTHING. I can't tell you shit about last month and no way in hell ill recall anything before that. I don't remember the consequences of my actions, and I know that's the worst part.

 There are a few cool things I've noticed for down->up switches.  The most common is that if I'm listening to music, I won't really pay attention ... but just before I switch, I start whistling to the music.  Two other neat ones I've caught lately are kinda related to each other... whem i'm down i'm more sensitive to sound and light and commonly drop phone brightness to 0.  But sometimes just before switching I have to turn my phone brightness up because it feels dim.  Today, I had the reverse(?) Happen ... i was laying there in bed when for no reason, the whole room lit up like i turned on a whole nother set of lights.  At first I thought it was just the sun popping from clouds but I confirmed it wasn't.  About 10-15 minutes later I switched.

Another probably stupid trick ... because I switch so often, I take 1-2 delta9 gummies every 8-12 hours when I'm depressed.  They do absolutely nothing when I'm down, but suddenly kick in as I'm about to switch, like a marijuana powered alarm system o_O.

As for up->down it's boring, I usually just get an overwhelming need to take a nap.

I am deeply hypersexual, I think about sex often and I masturbate a lot. But also, I am not good at making friends, much less relationships.

I am a virgin, and although girls have been ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù with me, I have never been in a relationship.

Making male friends for me is hard enough, but getting into a straight relationship? That just feels impossible.

My brain is constantly in a flux, I desire physical companionship cuz bipolar but I can‚Äôt seem to get it due to Autism. My social anxiety is high, but so are my feelings.

Does anyone else feel this way? I feel it all of the time and it is torture. I don‚Äôt hate women or anybody! But I feel this all of the time! Any advice would be appreciated!

I've been dealing with bipolar since my early 20s (diagnosed about 7 years ago after being hospitalized for a mixed episode). I always assumed it was type 2 (or NOS) because it was mostly depression though I didn't ask and was never told.  Today I finally asked my provider and she said it was type 1 because of being hospitalized and that my high moods sometimes included psychotic symptoms. She has not given me the feedback that my symptoms were psychotic throughout our time together and for me I always wrote it off as intense levels of fear that drove me to weird beliefs because I got so scared or spiritual experiences during hypomania but I'm very touchy about mental health issues or labels so she's had reason to dance around it, I guess. She's always recommended appropriate medications and I've been on antipsychotics most of the time. She just never spelled it out. 

I don't know if the type matters or why it does to me right now.  I don't want to play the comparison game or say one type is more severe or whatever so maybe my reaction isn't reasonable. I know everyone's experience is different. I  guess I feel the hope of getting better slipping away and more fearful of the future. Any thoughts on how to digest this would be appreciated.

When we decided to move in together it was discussed at length. I cannot have disrupted sleep. I‚Äôm bipolar, I already struggle with radical nightmare and wake up drenched many nights. 

He‚Äôs always cold so he‚Äôs running the F-ing hair dryer at night, so it‚Äôs on and off all night. Which makes the air dry and hot. Which means I can‚Äôt breathe and am sweating more than I usually do. 

He can‚Äôt sleep so he‚Äôs up and he‚Äôs down and he walking around or he‚Äôs standing at his side of the bed on his phone. 

Last night it was hair dryer on, hair dryer off, he woke up startled, he woke up and thought I was mad at him, he left our room so I woke up because he was gone, then the kicker is he‚Äôs in the kitchen at 6 am asking Alexa 42 F-ing questions which every time makes the bedroom Alexa pause white noise so now it‚Äôs silent and I can hear him repeatedly asking her if there has been a fucking time change. 

He knows RSO helps him sleep but won‚Äôt go buy more because it turns out to be about $4 a day. He makes almost a quarter million per year. He knows hitting the gravity bong helps him sleep but forgets to do it. He doesn‚Äôt want be on sleeping pill because it makes him drowsy in the morning. He doesn‚Äôt take his magnesium/melatonin as he‚Äôs supposed to.

I am diligent about my medication, I eat well, I exercise, I‚Äôve always taken sleep really seriously, I go to therapy, I see my psych regularly. I do all the ‚Äúthings‚Äù that we are all supposed to do. 

And now he‚Äôs mad at me because I‚Äôm irritated with him. Jesus. So am I supposed to get on yet another F-ing prescription because of his sleep bullshit??

Edit: We talked and I laid it all out for him. I told him I wasn‚Äôt going to risk going into mania, which causes brain damage, because he won‚Äôt do the things needed to sleep. He said that he can‚Äôt sleep because of my snoring and that the hair dryer is to drown out the sounds of my snoring. Although he used to do it in his previous marriage so that doesn‚Äôt track and he has RLS which is 100% known for sleep disturbances at night. My best friend lives two doors down. I‚Äôll sleep there for a while.

Edit 2: He did mention my snoring about a month ago. I immediately researched solutions, bought mouth strips overnight delivery and have worn them, maybe falling asleep without them a few times. He hasn‚Äôt mentioned that it‚Äôs not working.

Edit 3: Thanks everyone. I‚Äôve stood my ground and not got sucked into any distraction type conversation from the real issue. I appreciate all the validation.

I've been trying for a  proper diagnosis for a long time now. and one of the reasons many doctors didn't want to diagnosis me is because i noticed the mood swings and i recognized the intense highs and intense lows.

I've always been really self aware and recognizing patterns whether that's due to trauma or something i just recognize ill never know. I didn't realize that I could be bipolar until someone brought it up a couple years ago. I'm frustrated on the amount of knowledge the internet has. I researched a ton about being bipolar and easily recognized that i have a lot of the symptoms. When i brought it up the first doctor they said that there's no chance I'm bipolar because I'm too self-aware. The first fact is I'm not that self aware. After doing weeks of research yes i knew more about me but in the times i was manic or depressed did i recognize that? of course not. It took me having a full manic episode with the worst psychosis I've had in my life for them to even think of diagnosing me. I had brought up a week before that how I was starting to feel paranoid and how my friends had brought up that the week before that I was really active, speaking fast, not sleeping but they didn't listen. 

One of the most frustrating parts is even at the hospital a lot of the doctors brushed it off because they said I wasn't hospitalized enough times. TW. I've attempted 12 times in the past 5 years. My parents didn't bring me to the hospital for my mental health because they're abusive. I wasn't hospitalized not because it wasn't ""bad enough"" it was because no one cared. Im sorry for ranting. Its just all the doctors who I've talked to are invalidating and don't listen. If I'm wrong I would love for someone to explain there experience.",1678682502.0

A few weeks ago I had two job interviews in a day (not a good idea in retrospect haha), and in between while I was driving to the next interview I was turning left and I almost ran over this man. I didn't, I saw him and stopped, but because my adrenaline was already so high from the job interview it has just really stuck with me.

I genuinely feel like I should not drive for awhile but I'm mid-move right now so I literally have to so much. 

My psychiatrist said that its normal when stabilizing to notice more anxiety because my mind isn't focused on being hypomanic or depressed or anything else that comes with that.

I actually logged onto reddit today to relax and read some trash talk about an incredibly silly survival reality show I am watching. It was not supposed to be deep. And on the 1st page  I encountered numerous comments and posts accusing the villain of having bipolar disorder. And this character exhibited absolutely no signs of bipolar disorder, none. And I am pretty sensitive to that. What she did do was behave like a terrible person, sabotaging others and stealing their items. All while sleeping regularly, speaking at normal speeds, and contextualizing everything she did within a conscious, rational strategy. The worst part? One of the commenters claimed to be a psychologist, and wrote several comments, one of which was ""Jill reminds me of every bipolar, (classist slur), angry (sexist slur) I've ever met in Appalachia (and there are a lot of them!).""

I have bipolar disorder, and both of my abusive parents have/had bipolar disorder, so I have been on both sides of it here, and I just do not want to hear it anymore. I don't care what individual experiences someone had, they shouldn't make these statements. It's not like we are not predisposed to behave ""badly,"" but being abusive, cruel, or violent is not part of the diagnostic criteria. And there are so many assholes in the world who do not have bipolar disorder! Being a jerk isn't some unique quality that only we are susceptible to.

Most of us are just trying to live our lives.

And now I'm wondering, as I look for a new therapist, how many of them are going to think I'm a ""bipolar, angry (sexist slur)?""

How do you guys deal with this?",1678672241.0
526,I was used because of my mental illness,15,11psniw,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11psniw/i_was_used_because_of_my_mental_illness/,5,"SO i just remembered an old story, I haven't slept in 4 days pardon me for any rambling. It's about a boss who threatened to fire me when I was hospitalized (not related to psychiatry care)  


I've been working this job, they paid me jack but demand me to work for something that worth like 4 times that. I was freelancing before that and my ex (bless her heart) introduced me to this asshole.  
So my job was, I had to draw a picture a day, no break, pics range from 4-13 people a picture. I was young and a moron apparently so I accepted it. Also I was in debt from all the shopping spree so desparate times.  


So, the people who hired me, knows that I have some mental illness, but they didn't know it was schizoaffective disorder. The owner talked to me directly, something like ""look around the company we have so many people like you this is not a normal company I created this to guide people like you"" and ""you're lucky you found us, I bet your online friends won't do anything for you like we do"". Though I stayed quiet about my bipolar until a year into working there. Worst decision of my life.  


One time I was feeling depressed and someone called the owner in, I said I'm scared to go to the psychiatrist because I don't wanna be hospitalized. I was hospitalized before after my suicide attempt. Owner decided to ask me for my years old hospitalization paper when I was still a minor, when I said no he began to belittle me and say things like ""you think you know more than my FRIEND who is a doctor?"". He uses this friend that is a doctor argument a lot whenever I want to take a day off for my health or just couldn't work because I cannot move, literally (keep in mind I don't even take weekends off). Whenever I say something that he doesn't agree of he would pull me aside and lecture me and I have to listen to him because he has been through hard times too he said. After all I was lucky that anyone would hire me at all.  


After more than a year of working there, my body finally caved, I was hospitalized. I didn't answer their phone call and texts because the reception there is awful and there's no wifi, but when I did get to contact them I did told them that I was in the hospital. They only asked if I can work. When I got home I was greeted with the text ""If you didn't contact us in 24 hours we will terminate you"" (paraphrase bc different language). I call it quit right then and there. And that was probably the best decision of my life.

I get, what I think of as false mania. My anxiety does things in my mind like when I was manic but I can tell it's fake. When I talk to my partner they describe me as 'not manic, you make sense, your speech patterns are mostly normal but you seem very on edge'

1. My mom tells me I can‚Äôt move to a city an hour away because I‚Äôm mentally ill. I am 24 and have been planning to leave my hometown for over a year... I have only recently been opening up about my mental health struggles because I did have a pretty bad manic episode recently that led to my diagnosis. But my mental illness has been so much worse than she‚Äôll ever know. I‚Äôll never tell her cause she can barely handle the milder stuff I tell her.
2. My friend calling me crazy when I describe obsessive and hypersexual behaviors I experience during mania. Saying I need help and to stay away from certain types of people. Ouch. I am in regular therapy and trying Lamictal, which I told her, and trying very very hard to take a break from dating. This interaction left me speechless.
3. Almost all of my friends and family demanding that I check in with them regularly if not daily and spam texting me when I don‚Äôt reply. Good god. I am recovering from a months long manic episode and am sleeping a lot and catching up on homework. 
4. I actually cut off my sister indefinitely because she was emotionally abusive and controlling, always judging me especially when I was manic, screaming at me and telling me what to do, who I could date and spend time with, etc etc. Stupid shit. She‚Äôs done much worse but I‚Äôd had enough after I got diagnosed and it only got worse. It‚Äôs like she thought because I was more mentally ill than she realized that gave her a pass to invalidate every decision I make because I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot in my right mind‚Äù and can‚Äôt make my own decisions. Phew there was an explosive fight.
5. Now when I‚Äôm just casually talking about something my family is constantly asking, ‚Äúwere you having an episode then?‚Äù ‚ÄúWere you in a right state of mind when you did (insert typical young adult behavior)?‚Äù and it is absolutely sending me.

I cannot fucking stand people telling me what to do! I am pissed off and feel infantilized. I was already nervous about moving and getting my first full time job after graduation and it‚Äôs like all these people think they‚Äôre supporting me but I just feel like they‚Äôre doubting my capabilities. My mental illness is more visible now because I decided to be more open about it, but goodness it has been 100x worse before but no one knew.

I'm curious to hear some insights from other BP folks on my current job situation.  I've been working in project management with the same company for nearly two years.  Frankly, I'm underpaid, but the work isn't terribly demanding and my team and the company are pretty understanding about my BP and allow me quite a bit of flexibility.  I could probably move into a promotion for a \~10% raise in the coming months.

I constantly see online and hear in person people talking about needing to switch jobs every year or two to get the best pay raises and that loyalty to employers is bad news.  I know there is some truth to this and I have been applying for positions and receiving a lot of interest in my applications.  These positions could come with 15-30% pay increases.  However, the job search and interviewing gives me severe, debilitating anxiety and I really worry about switching to a new company only to have to learn completely new systems and work with new people.  The company I switch to may also not be as lenient or understanding about my situation.

I suppose I'd like to hear any opinions from other bipolar folks on their career development.  Do you think its worth it to just stick it out for lower pay and peace of mind?  Or should I really force myself out of my comfort zone for the potential significant salary increase? Any other thoughts are very welcome. Thank you!",1678660869.0

553,the coolest shit ever is about to happen,6,11pq8j7,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11pq8j7/the_coolest_shit_ever_is_about_to_happen/,3,"The backstory is a little long but necessary 

Ten years ago my ex wife left me and I went to my friend's birthday party a couple weeks later to get out and do single guy stuff. That night I met my friend's roommate who was so stunning to me that I didn't care she was a total bitch to me for spilling beer on her kitchen floor. I'm not sure what happened but I know I left my shoes there that night and the next morning her roommate answered the door when I went to get them and threw them at me then said ""please leave my house now""....I became absolutely infatuated with her immediately. After some weeks of finding excuses to hangout with my friend, the girl saw I wasn't ALWAYS a belligerent drunk asshole. We became friends. In fact we found out we had much in common. We found out that we had so many of the same thoughts and feelings about life and the world. We empathized with each other in so many ways. We fell in love. 
Unfortunately, it couldn't have been worst timing. I was still legally married and not done with the divorce process. She was joining the Coast Guard to finally find direction in her life. We were at two different crossroads in our own lives. We broke up amicably and remained acquaintances.
In August of last year I was having a breakdown. To this day, no one has made me feel more understood than this woman does. I reached out because I needed a friend. Mind you we rarely talked and certainly not deeply. Well we did that day. For weeks she was there. It doesn't take much effort for me to feel cared for and it felt so good to be cared for. We quickly rekindled the friendship we had. She's moved to a different city that I've wanted to visit for a long time and did so in December to see her. 
Turns out we were both undiagnosed bipolar and self medicating with alcohol 10 years ago. We also both have ADHD as well and we laugh that we get along because we're ""all the same types of fucked up"". We have both grown and changed independently but so similarly. I was planning on seeing if there was still a spark when I went to visit. We kept it casual. We hadn't hung out in years and this was our first time hanging out since both getting treatment. I guess I'd hoped for some romantic movie reunion but I had hope as she had planned on making a trip home in January (which she did). I don't even know why I was clinging to the idea of something happening with all this new distance between us but I did know when my heart wants something it wants it and I'd do whatever I had to to follow my heart. Even if it meant moving. 
Here's where it gets awesome. She decided in January she wants to move back home after 10 years of living all over the country. She'll be back in less than a month. We talk every day unless one of us is self isolating. When I'm manic and weird she doesn't care and when she is withdrawing from the world for a day or two I completely get it. We even have the same dreams of living next door to one's spouse and retiring to a gigantic dog farm now. 
I'm trying to not get too excited. I don't want to get my hopes up about it romantically. Either way this woman that makes me feel accepted and supported is coming back into my life and it's just so exciting. I'm a 33 year old man and am currently feeling like a teenager. I can't say for certain where this will go, but wish me luck.",1678656079.0

There's just too much bullshit but to sum it up: debt, drug use, lost jobs/friendships, criminality and so much cringe. God the cringe.   


&#x200B;

I agreed to do a wide evaluation regarding my mental health to spot symptoms of personality disorders, ADHD, autism, bipolar, schizophrenia, etc. I didn't match any disorder or neurodivergence. They suspected bipolar disorder but couldn't conclude the episodes were related to the disease or my drug use and therefore didn't give me a diagnosis. They offered continued medication after my ward visit since I was deemed high risk if I continued using drugs. After my evaluation though I am now deemed healthy and capable of working.  


&#x200B;

I have been without mood stabilizers and antipsychotics for months without any symptoms at all. Although this is without any drug use whatsoever.

&#x200B;

Anyway to the point. This experience conflicts with what I've read on this subreddit and my overall understanding of bipolar type 1. Afaik one destructive manic episode qualifies one to be diagnosed. Technically I am healthy and my doctor doesn't require me to take medication. I am feeling confident I won't get sick again unless I use drugs recklessly. Is it stupid of me to just let time tell if I am genuinely bipolar or not?

\--

Hello all. This is a bit of a ramble/story wrapped into a question. Last week, my psychiatrist diagnosed me with bipolar II. Since then, I've done a lot of reading and thinking, and I'm feeling quite conflicted about it all.

My entire life, I've felt that something was 'off' about me, that something inside of me is utterly rotten no matter how kind or normal I pretend to be. I've hated myself since I was about 12. I've always struggled to form lasting connections. I was a very moody, yet high-achieving, teenager. In times of high stress or in fits of self-hatred, I have self-harmed (but never in a 'serious' way that causes lasting physical damage, I have told myself). I've only made a suicidal gesture once in my early 20s, but I have spent countless hours 'ruminating' on suicide--but, at this point, I don't think I'd ever do it. Now I am a more emotionally stable and high-achieving, but still fundamentally self-loathing, adult. I've had years of mostly fruitless therapy; I've tried about 10 medications, mostly SSRIs, and none of them has done anything except make me sleepy.

The thing is, I don't fit the diagnostic threshold for depression. I'm more blank/empty than actively unhappy. Until recently, I had never been 'diagnosed' with anything, except (I would tell myself) being a whiny piece of shit.  I just thought it was my lot in life to never be satisfied. I *know* that when I have my 'episodes' of despair, which might last a few hours to a few days, that I will get over it soon enough. I know that when I go days without taking proper care of myself, when I am going through the motions at work, that I'll soon enough have a period when I am motivated to tidy my apartment, do laundry, pay bills, catch up on email, text the five people I've left on read, etc. It is the knowledge that my mood will improve that keeps me mostly functional during the darkest times, distracts me from (what feels like at the time) the unavoidable fact that I'd be better off dead.

A couple years ago, the struggles of returning to work in-person motivated me to seek help, and I was diagnosed with ADHD (inattentive type). It took some time to accept this diagnosis as well, but I thought finally! *this* was the breakthrough I needed--at last an explanation for my inability to stay 'on top' of my life, for always feeling out of place, for my mind working in strange ways that delights some people but seems to repulse most. Adderall has improved my stress levels, especially at work, and helped me from getting sucked as deeply into those brief obsessions that can take up all my attention for days at a time.

So, I saw this psychiatrist only so that I could have access to Adderall, nothing more. My mood has been much better overall since I started, with less severe lows.  What got my psych thinking about bipolar is that I've had one manic episode (SSRI-induced, last year).

Being a 'moody' and very online teenager, bipolar is something I've read and thought about over the many years that I've had to self-analyse and obsess about my deep sadness/emptiness, but I've always dismissed it. Since last week I've done more reading, mostly looking for personal testimonials of what it 'feels like' to live with bipolar II and to have developed coping mechanisms into adulthood. Where I am still struggling the most is that I don't relate to descriptions of hypomania. When I was briefly manic last year, I *did* feel fucking amazing--euphoric, creative, energized. Before I started fully losing my mind, it was actually really great. But in my normal ups & downs of life, I never feel like I have an 'elevated mood' or 'grandiosity' (how could I, when my self-esteem is consistently shit?)... unless I am misinterpreting what these 'feel' like.

**For those of you who have bipolar II and have thought more about the nuances of how it feels and presents itself, do you think it's possible that I've been properly diagnosed even though I am never happy or have inflated self-esteem?** I've tried googling this obviously but haven't found any accounts that totally jive with my experience. I have periods where I am slightly less sad (like, 7/10 instead of 5.5/10), where my mind feels more creative, and I have more energy to be social and motivation to attend to timely errands such as grocery shopping or laundry. I have brief periods where I feel consistently agitated, like I can't stop my mind enough to go to sleep, especially when I have an obsession of the week--but this is *tiresome* more than invigorating, and I self-medicate pretty heavily with weed. My everyday mood, even during those periods, averages 5-7/10 with occasional dips to 2-3. I would go so far as to say that (to me, it feels like) my mood is fairly stable, but it‚Äôs *motivation* (drive, optimism) that is perpetually inconsistent, which is why the ADHD diagnosis made sense.

I know this is long--it's very helpful for me just to have written this out and sent it into the void, even if no one can help. But if anyone can relate to my feelings, I would appreciate your insight or recommendations for YouTube videos/articles/ books that might resonate with me.",1678652550.0

579,World Bipolar Day: social media thoughts?,2,11pmza0,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11pmza0/world_bipolar_day_social_media_thoughts/,6,"This past year before I found my perfect medication regimen and really got my disorder under control, I became a lot more in tune with my bipolar II disorder & the stigma associated with it. 

I made it a point in my daily life to talk openly about it, to people close to me and sometimes strangers or coworkers- and although it was hard, I started casually mentioning in conversation that I was, in fact, bipolar. It was scary at first, but I found it important to make a part of the conversation because I‚Äôm outgoing, and so many people that know me would not ‚Äùever think that‚Äù - whatever that means. 

Which is why I think it‚Äôs important to talk about and be more open about, because this disorder does not have a face.  

That being said, with world bipolar day coming up: what are your thoughts about social media posts on personal accounts regarding this? I know social media has changed, but aside from pictures of myself, family, my pets and boyfriend, I don‚Äôt get too deep. 

I guess I have fear of putting this personal information on the Internet, and it being tracked back to me and potentially used against me in the future or even the present.  

For example, I do not have the greatest relationship with my boyfriend‚Äôs family unfortunately, and I‚Äôm afraid this would be ammunition in their guns (‚Äúi knew she was crazy‚Äù etc).. and that‚Äôs just one small example. 

On the other hand, making a post about my personal experience may inspire at least one other person-either with bipolar disorder or any other sort of mental illness- to destigmatize it and feel more comfortable in their day-to-day life, in which case maybe that would be a difference enough in and of itself.

When I do take them, I vomit so their practically ineffective anyways, I think it‚Äôs more of a psychological thing than a side effect as the nausea and vomiting is quite abrupt. It started with me forgetting to take them multiple times in a row, then when I realized I wasn‚Äôt going into an up or down, I just didn‚Äôt re continue them. Literally the only ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù I have are increased appetite and irritability, the anger of which is only directed at one person, my grandmother, and even that is not increasingly dangerous or violent and with cause. She‚Äôs been nagging me more, getting upset with me for taking forever to do laundry when I physically can‚Äôt because her washer won‚Äôt wash my clothes, and more. On top of it all, she‚Äôs been in more chronic pain lately and has been sick on top of it so I think she‚Äôs just getting upset with herself and taking it out on me, which just makes me more upset. I don‚Äôt know what to do, she literally threatened to contact my dad and tell him this shit as of he‚Äôll actually believe her and do something. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm in the wrong here.

Obviously it didn't work . I'm now unwell, from being in hospital too long, I gues I picked something up and for the first time in years I self harmed to the point I'm not sure it'll ever truly heal. I'm so angry and I'm desperate to do it agsain but I'm too weak.  It's not even that I'm massively depressed, I just can't deal with living like this for the rest of my life. I'm getting worse the older I get and you know what the sad thing is?  I would beg for help right now, not that it's worked in the past, but if they put me in a psyche ward I won't get my driing licence back next week, and yet here I am talking about ending my life. 

I really don't know what to do. I'm sure eveyone will say go the th ER, get help etc but what if I hang in there just a litle bit longer and then the mania will come?

When I came back from hospital i opened my computer and apparenlty I'd written what's below: Am I going mad? I understand if no one reads this, it's way too long really.

&#x200B;

She'll wait in the shadoes of the corner of your reverie , never tangible but alwyas there. In the dark the nightmares stalk a forever restless brain like a lion, patiently waiting but  never puouncing, His flaming orange stripes reflect the beliefs of Iccarus but the deep purple-blacks fleck between,  always a  reminder.  You try to escape by taking another pill, all the gouls snd ghost are, fot a while, silent and slowly it can all melt away, the blackness taking you in it's arms away for a that short break where  you can be free for those few predious hours before reality comes streaming through the windows again.  The rising of the sun brings with it its own spectres, the ones that have entangled themsleves around you into this twisted, symbiotic relationship; a co-dependency of madness. So I pray for just a few silent minutes where I can esape myself and be numb, yet unfrotunately these are infrequent and fleeting.

More powders, poisens, pills and tinctures, supposedly one for breakfast, pudding and tea will allow me to lead a normal life but I can feel my mind shutting down. One file at  time, slowly losing the hope and possibilities that once drove it forward.    A mind which used to burst with creativity has now become unbearaly numb, with he last reminients clawing and scratching at the inside of my skull. I've lost hope that they'll ever find a way to escape. I go though the motions of being a person in this meat suit but my skin crawls night and day because I'm still in there, I've just been chemincally labotmoised.

We can't be something to everyone and be true to ourselves.

The devil has the best lines.  I'm searching every crevice that could possibly, just maybe hold a remnence that might still be me: I'm not here. My reflection, where once shone back eyes full of passion and excitement.. now they are dead and lonely.  Where there was once a swirling pallette of dreams now sit two pieces of coal.

I try to find meaing in the faces around me but all I see are sucken sockets within pallid skin, eyes like mirros reflecting a drudgery we all try to pretend is not there. Pores filled with different shades of orange, desperate to be young again, desperate to be loved.  We all need to rember a time when we were in love with the world, when we saw it for the beautiful place that it is but minds are masters at consuming your thoughts, desires ..and when it comes to lyig to you they are they win the championship.  I miss the person I was beore it was stolen from me.

OPEN YOUR MIND

All time warped in to one. A cosmic reality , infinite possiblities, time twising into a loop and where do we stand before that ? This unimaginable vastness of space that we know so, so litle about filled with  matter, anti matter, dark matter, the things we can't even comprehend even exist. What do we truly understand? Nothing! We're pawns in a dream and we're arogant enough to actually believe out of infinte possibilites that we are some how different, special.  We are no  more than matter existing alongside eveything else. I wonder sometimes if sentience and conciouness are really a gift or a curse.  Not a new philosophical concept I know but still it nags at me

HIDE YOU'RE THOGHTS AWAY. IF YOU TRY TO TELL THEM WHAT YOU SEE, WHAT YOU HEAR ,WHAT YOU KNOW; iF THEY REALLY KNEW YOU THEN YOU WOULD NEVER ESCAPE.

You think you hide your sins but eyes can't lie, shining with make, trying to flutter the parts of you that you hate away. So scared to be seen as someome you'll do anthing to hide the shame and the guilt.  Covered in paper cuts that tell of your misgivings. All you really want is to leave but the noose is too tight now.  Fumbling to reach out and touch what everyone seems to agree is reality but you don't know what you're looking for.  You believe the best part is the best of you and no one is telling you that the best of you is the worst of you.  

So you want to know mania...? Here's an exerpt..

My mind is racing , the endless thoughts. The grandiousity because I know I am greater than everything anyone can comprend. I'm trapped in this body but I will achieve greatness and soon people will start to see that sanity confines us .  I see the truth, I can see what you wish you could see.  Every soul vibrates, the colours are unexplainable, I have no words for them.  It's a new spectrum. Everything brighter, more beautiful and the need to escape to where I'm really from overwhelms me. I can't express the constant surge of elation.

Come with me, I can open your mind to the reality that exists outside of what the majprity will never see,  Two minds, we can see together, intertwined , sanity left behind . You can hold my hands and the energy will shake and will flow through you. The vibraions freeing you from common law. I know it's time to leave and the tiger who waits to pounce with the contraints of depression, he doesn't scare me because I know I can easily out run him, I can outrun everyone so don't try to catch me because I will be long gone.

52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52...it's found me and it's everywhere.

THe portals, why can't they see it? The beauty is beyond compare.  The jazz has stared again, wherever I go but theres that speak easy jazz; threre's worse things to hear. WHY CAN'T YOU SEE AND HEAR WHAT I DO? The worst thing is I've lost what's the illness, what's the medicatio and what's me.  I hear the sounds that no one else hears.I see the thoughts that no one else hears. Orocole to the gateay but i can't pass though it because I.m stuck in this body. If I can peel away these confines I can move to the next realm.

Is a thought a reality? Do we create ourselves or are we created with the ability to  mould ourselves within the confines of the life we've been handed down?  Is it wrong to want to see the light leave someones eyes? Morals and ethics, the key to a stable society. Is it an innate chip hidden our fractured, new born skull or is this our one last gift from God in his desperation?",1678620926.0

About a year ago I found myself in the care of a slightly ‚Äòtrigger-happy‚Äô new psychiatrist. 

She believed from the get-go that my diagnosis of bipolar disorder was wrong, and that I had ADHD. She referred me to the ADHD service, I got on medication, and she was right- I do indeed have fairly crippling combined ADHD. 

It seems that my new psychiatrist wasn‚Äôt content with my being well on my previous meds combo (2 antipsychotics, 2 mood stabilisers), so they set about taking them all away. Coming off the Lurasidone (Latuda) was unpleasant but no relapse to speak of, same goes for the Lamictal (lamotrogine). The Seroquel (quetiapine) 150mg to 50 was a bit unpleasant but again no real relapse to speak of. I then saw her in clinic and she told me that my lithium 1000mg was ‚Äòoverkill‚Äô and dangerous, that I didn‚Äôt have a psychotic or mood disorder, and that I didn‚Äôt need to be on it. Both my partner and I were very dubious, but we went with it. 

Oh boy. 

1000mg-800mg was alright. I got a bit depressed at first, then everything became a bit too ‚Äòreal‚Äô for my liking. I began to have an obsession with people‚Äôs eyes, and the ‚Äòshadow people‚Äô started appearing in our bedroom. I began seeing things at night and believed I could sense auras and presences around people and locations.

800-600mg I became super unwell. I started having very intense night terrors and my paranoia reached the point of me almost hurting someone because I thought they were trying to harm me. In amongst this I rapid cycled in between hypomania and quite severe almost catatonic depression. 

When I increased back up to 800mg the vast majority of the acute psychosis went, but I was still very anxious, manic at times and when I wasn‚Äôt manic, very depressed. It would be a rapid cycling type deal, but I was surprised how intense the psychotic symptoms were. I‚Äôd had them before before I was on lithium, so lo and behold they came back when I tried to come off it. I‚Äôm now on day 10 of 1000mg lithium and I‚Äôm back to baseline, admittedly shitting myself about seeing my psychiatrist tomorrow.

Now, I‚Äôm sure my psychiatrist means well but this whole ‚Äòit‚Äôs just ADHD‚Äô needs to stop, now. I don‚Äôt want a diagnosis, some words on a piece of paper are meaningless to me. I‚Äôm not seeking any kind of validation, but I‚Äôm now on day 10 of an increase back up to 1000mg lithium and I‚Äôm finally resembling my old self. I haven‚Äôt been able to work and I‚Äôve really struggled to get anything done aside from a few household chores. I‚Äôve also been a pretty nasty bastard to be around- the paranoia and the mania have driven me to some fairly extreme behaviours. Nothing criminal, but I‚Äôve got some apologising to do.

How do I approach this whole episode with this psychiatrist? My primary care doc has made it very clear that if the psych tries to mess with the lithium again I‚Äôm to ask for a second opinion. 

Has anyone else dealt with similar before? Any nuggets of wisdom?",1678612420.0

I have Complex PTSD from medical trauma so this whole thing is extremely triggering. I keep making great progress in therapy and calming my anxiety, and I just get dragged back down again.

**Incident 1:** I had extreme nausea with a new medication so I took extra Zofran like 12 hours apart from my Promethazine. When I called asking about the med side effects, the nurse called me back in a full panic telling me to go to the emergency room and get my heart checked or they wouldn‚Äôt see me again. The ER doctor was SO chill, he said I knew my meds well and my heart was fine, and to lower my Zofran since I was taking more Promethazine. 

When I saw my psychiatrist, she said the nurse told her I basically panicked and took a bunch of meds. I told her that NEVER happened, and explained exactly what did. I told her I didn‚Äôt want to speak to the nurse anymore and she said I could message her directly instead. 

**Incident 2:** A few days ago, I wake up to a call from my psychiatrist‚Äôs nurse that I‚Äôve violated the controlled substance agreement and my psychiatrist could drop me. I was SO confused and told her I‚Äôd been given permission from my psychiatrist to use an old refill. She mentioned that people sell Xanax and said she couldn‚Äôt say whether my intentions were good or not. (I have trauma with people not believing me in an abuse situation, so this has also been an absolute nightmare.) 

I called the pharmacy and it turns out they had second prescription but never told me, and they were the ones who did an auto refill from the wrong doctor. The pharmacist was just as confused because she said they would never let someone take out two of the same prescription. She said to have my psychiatrist call her and she‚Äôd tell her I‚Äôve been getting refills appropriately.

My psychiatrist is out all week, so I‚Äôm terrified about what the nurse is going to tell her. I‚Äôm trying to get help from these people and literally shaking from stress. First I‚Äôm recklessly taking meds, then I may or may not be selling them?! 

My psychiatrist knows I can‚Äôt stand the nurse. I told her the nurse makes me cry every time we talk and is incredibly triggering. You know those people who act nice while saying mean things?

I plan on telling my psychiatrist how upsetting this was but that‚Äôs it.

Does anyone have advice on how I can handle this mentally? Especially since I have no choice but to know this nurse professionally.

This is not really a new thing, I have already experienced this at times in the past and I've already talked about it with my psych who did not seem to be alarmed by that fact.

It's becoming a bit annoying though, and I've also been feeling quite stressed / anxious for a few days.

I sleep really well though, much better than I have ever in my life as far as I can recall.

Like, I can easily sleep 12 hours a night, and I'm not feeling depressed at all. To the contrary, despite this anxiety (that I attribute to an upcoming positive event) I feel like my mood is rather good. Maybe too good, I'm not totally sure.

My current sleep pattern is in stark contrast with a period of maybe 2 or 3 years of near daily crippling insomnia that was mainly due to horrible nightmares following a very specific trauma that I think I'm finally kinda getting over.

I am not taking recreational drugs, I am not in withdrawal either.

The only change in my medication there's been recently was the addition of methylphenidate to treat a recently diagnosed / supposed attention disorder and it's working well. The mood lift / anxiety is circumstancial I believe, because it started after a very specific event which happened already weeks after the introduction of the methylphenidate to my medication regimen. The methylphenidate did not have any adverse effect that I could feel after the first few days.

613,I survived jail,47,11oq766,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11oq766/i_survived_jail/,26,"

Six months ago I shared my story with this community right before I went to jail.  I made it through to the other side. It was an interesting and at times terrible experience but it's over. To give you an idea I had a better time in Iraq. 

When I first went in, they didn't give me my meds for 5 days. I went into perhaps the deepest depression I've ever had in my life. It was awful.  I could barely speak without crying. Once I restarted my meds I had a couple days with mixed features followed by nearly two weeks of hypomania. A jail cell with a crack addict is NOT a place you want to experience hypersexuality. It was downright dangerous trying to stay sane, but I made it. (I wasn't attracted to the crackhead, just felt the urge to masturbate almost constantly).

After that episode I stabilized for the most part. I had several ""mini episodes "" of hypomania that lasted 3 days or so but no more major issues. I was very frustrated that my meds were nearly never on time. I was on a working unit and had to be up at 4am but often wouldn't take my zyprexa until 9:30-10, which made for some tough mornings. My wife fought all the way up to the jail superintendent to get us family counseling, which was great and amazing but also happened with just 5 weeks left.

Now I'm home again with my wife and son and I'm starting from scratch in a way- I have no insurance and my old psychiatrist discharged me when I went in. I've got a month worth of meds left, so there's limited time to figure it out. I am seeing my pcp next week and I'm hoping she will bridge me. Once that gets squared away I get to try to find a job with a record and as a registered sex offender. The good news is that I have a really incredible wife and my extended friends and family have all been extremely supportive as well. The future is uncertain but I won't face it alone.",1678556789.0

i've been going to the wrong people for help. oh my god, it's so humiliating. i've absolutely harassed a guy i knew online. spammed him with messages he NEVER replies to, until one day i joined him in a call and told him i was gonna ""do something bad"". he tried his best to talk me out of it for 2 hours. that's the last drop i care out of him. which i get, alright? i was harassing him! i sent him pictures of the bad thing i did. that's MESSED UP. straight up emotional abuse. i'm a bad person, so i deserve what happened next. he told me i shouldn't keep messaging him for help or whatever it is i do, and blocked me. that.. yeah, that fucked me up a lot. there was like an hour there i thought i'd just die to show him what he did - messed up thoughts, i know.

i feel better now. him blocking me absolutely triggered a crash but it was gonna happen eventually, so not his fault. he showed every hint he could that he didn't wanna talk, and i just refused to pick up on it. like, he never replied. for months. he told me he didn't like when i spammed and wouldn't reply when i did. he didn't read the messages. he muted my calls. i just ignored all that stuff and continued messaging. i needed someone to talk to.

anyway, my new strategy is one i call the ""DON'T THINK ABOUT IT DON'T THINK ABOUT IT DON'T THINK-""

basically, i don't think about it! i'm trying to just accept that this is for the best. maybe he unblocks me in a few days to see if i'm okay and have calmed down, maybe he doesn't! it's fine either way. good, really! this was emotionally abusive for me to do and while i'm in a really bad place i absolutely can't give that to others. except a therapist. i'm gonna ask my mum if i can go back to therapy. she'll say yes, it's just a matter of organizing it. and i'll get clean. i was clean for a while but relapsed like a week ago. spurring this, obviously.

I take a good med combo that works for me (geodon Wellbutrin lamictal), started working out, changed my diet to whole foods only.

Even though I‚Äôve come so far I can‚Äôt help but be upset at my situation. I miss being in school and having my freedom. Im stuck at home all day doing nothing, which don‚Äôt get me wrong it‚Äôs been so nice to not worry about exams, but I‚Äôm someone who has been consistently an excellent student my whole life. This is really, really hard for me to deal with. Sometimes I feel like my whole future is ruined because I needed to take an alternative path. 

I‚Äôm worried that my friends see me as stupid and a liability. I know my school knows I‚Äôm a liability which is why they‚Äôve been so supportive about me taking the semester off. I got a case manager through my insurance unannounced because of how many medical bills I‚Äôve had since September. Like a crazy amount. I don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs possible I‚Äôve come so far, been the best I‚Äôve been in three years, have everyone around me see how much progress I‚Äôve made, and I still feel like I‚Äôm not doing enough.

I have 3 children, 13, 12 and 5 and I am separated from their father. My 12 year old has numerous health conditions and disabilities so I am a registered carer for her. 

I also have bipolar disorder and anxiety which was undiagnosed until 2019. I now take antipsychotics, lithium and a tranquilliser which have helped immensely - I no longer up-end my whole life in the throws of mania or sink into long episodes of suicidal depression. I have a care coordinator who comes out to see me at home every few weeks to monitor my mood and check I'm doing okay. 

I feel like a failure. I see everyone around me moving forward with their lives and careers and I feel stuck but I don't know how to change it. My anxiety is such that I can't take my own children to school - how am I ever going to get on in a work place? Also, I worry if I do manage to get a job with zero experience, when my bipolar does play up (I still rapid cycle, just not to the extremes I used to) I worry that I won't be able to hold down employment. 

I'm concerned for the example I am showing my children by not working. I have enrolled at university twice in the last 10 years and have done well academically, however the ups and downs of bipolar, coupled with my daughters ill health have made it difficult to see through and I have ended up dropping out both times.

ive been feeling pretty good lately. i had a really bad depressive episode in the beginning of the year with lots of substance abuse and suicidal thoughts and im glad it passed again. im not quite sure when it stopped, honestly, because my days have been kind of blending together and february is a bit of a blur and im not fully sure what i even did that month, but im glad im over that bullshit.


the few people close to me always get a bit wary when my depression ends and i start feeling good since i found out i am bipolar but i genuinely think ive been doing okay.


apparently my impulse control has been getting worse - so ive been told - with the main thing noticeable is that i started shoplifting again. im not trying to start an ethics debate here and i dont really care about other peoples stances on it, but i really dont give a fuck about taking things from big corporations. ive mainly been stealing food anyways.


i dont even think my impulse control is the issue here. for example, im trying to stay clean from all drugs this months and its been going pretty good. i made an exception yesterday because i went to a concert and wanted to drink, but ive been pretty responsible with my drinking there and i dont regret it, it was an incredibly evening. i also really want to party and have a lot of sex lately but im not doing that. i dont have the money to go out much and no credit card so thats off the table anyways. 


the only thing that i guess i agree on being a bit concerning is the fact that ive been hallucinating more lately, but its pretty manageable. all in all ive been feeling good and enjoying live. 


im getting irritated with everyone always worrying about me. sometimes it takes a lot of self control to not yell at them to leave me alone. im obviously not doing that, but the anger is annoying me because i am having run and i dont wanna deal with it, which ironically makes me even more pissed. but its short lasting anger so i can cope with it pretty well.

for a while i have wanted a diagnosis that wasn‚Äôt just depression and anxiety as proof that i‚Äôm not being dramatic, and more like an explanation as to why i am the way i am. but i don‚Äôt really know how to feel about this? 

i thought i had a personality disorder. they said that they can‚Äôt diagnose because i‚Äôm still young and that‚Äôs usually diagnosed in a few years but they‚Äôre pretty sure i have a mood disorder. 

now i‚Äôm stuck looking at the things i‚Äôve done and recognizing it as symptoms of bipolar. 

the main thing that got me like ‚Äúshit..‚Äù was the fact that my therapist had to have seen me in some sort of manic or hypo manic episode. i never thought i was manic, i thought i had unipolar and would make jokes like ‚Äúdamn i wish i had the highs‚Äù guess i should have been careful with what i wished for. 

i‚Äôve had periods usually after my depression (i think?) where the air feels different.  i feel put together and i feel okay, like i have it under controle. whatever depression i had was just a weird lil thing that happened. and during this i realized i chase excitement, i do dumb risky things. 

i think my therapist was trying to not make me feel shitty about it because before she told me she thinks i lean into bipolar more than depression she kept telling me that ‚Äúi feel emotions very intensely and it‚Äôs not my fault. and at those times those feelings are real‚Äù 

but this also made me analyze if i had had delusions. which is terrifying. it makes me feel like i can‚Äôt trust my perception of reality since it‚Äôs constantly changing.

I went off l my meds maybe like 4 weeks ago, I have no idea when, time does not make sense anymore lol. I don't even remember when I came off them, or even why. I went off the little seroquel first and then my doc gave me a big warning about becoming too high and paranoia. I can't remember stopping the rest, I just know I'm not on them. Before any of that I made some kinda weird post on social media, about having a ""cunning plan ü§≠ü§≠üíñüíñ"" It was obvious I felt very mischievous and I wouldn't tell anyone what my plan was. Then I commented that I think there was a gas leak and I just reassess my logic. I can't remember any of that very well, so I think that's when it started. Then like 2 weeks ago maybe, my dad had a big heart attack and I had to run the whole show while he was in hospital and my mom was in England at the time. I think it was too much. Reading back, my posts were signaling bizarre before that, but I after that I was very happy, but then very paranoid people were making a discord about me and ridiculing every single damn post I made and I had to leave social media.

I feel like a tumble dryer of rage, utter spiritual bliss, anxiety, and an ego. It's like they're battling it out but I'm trying to get the spiritual bliss to win but then my thoughts get too fast and detailed about spirituality, constantly like picking these things apart and developing the knowledge and then the anxiety descends because it's too much going on in my head, which I think turns into rage.

I don't trust meds right now, and definitely do not fucking trust doctors. I write my therapist and psychologist letters for hours and hours some nights, to get it all out. But the mood shifts a few days later from perhaps from divine bliss to hyper amazing invincibility, and I'm like, do I include this piece I wrote about my brain now as well, do I really bring in them four fucking letters, pages long, each one about completely different shit and I sit there while they're reading them all using up so much of the one hour. I will still go into my appointment but I dunno what to trust them with, or if at all, I don't know what's relevant or if I'm just shit sick of talking about all these things with professionals, or perhaps if they'll do something like ring my doc or worse. I've been 90% honest with my therapist, but 100% honest with nobody. Can I trust anyone with my truth. I wrote it out for myself but I don't think anyone on Earth should read that but me lol. I'll never set foot in the hospital again in my life, they'll have to catch me first.

When I can get a few hours of sleep I just dream about doctors laughing in my face and nurses injecting me with things I really really don't want in my body. The nightmares are like fever dreams on acid and I wake up thinking the sleep wasn't even worth it.

I can't take the claustrophobia anymore. 

I am at home cuz it's the weekend and I am trying not to drive too much because I can't afford the petrol anymore from going out every day, sometimes driving for hours. It's been 24 hours and I'm already going insane here. I can't message my friends cuz I can't stand messaging anyone right now but face to face is great. I can't talk to any doctors because they'll just think I'm insane or making it up, *neither* of which is true. I tried all the hotlines in my country, and they're too busy. I got nobody lol. My only escapes are driving some place, my Buddhist meetings, and college where my friends and I make fun of each other, which is the only attention I can tolerate right now. But it's Saturday night. I tried to tell a friend a little of my real thoughts but it didn't go well lol. I'm going fucking insane with this place.

I dunno, I just needed to get it out.

I'm fucking terrified of the doctors. I dunno who to turn to. Trying to get through to the hotlines was frustrating, I've tried to post this for an hour or two now and then my laptop died.

I'm not sure if this is more related to being introverted but the time it takes me to recharge and how bad I feel in those few days reminds me very much of a depressive episode.

Will give an estimate time window of your bedtime every night thru text message or notification. You can log your naps, etc. I find it extremely accurate.

-> Invest in a white/brown noise machine. I personally use a Spotify playlist on my Alexa. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúRelaxing White Noise LLC‚Äù. It has a ton of 8-hr tracks to listen to.

-> Invest in good pillows, comfy sheets. I tend to get hot at night, so I invested in bamboo sheets ($20-$80). Not as slippery as satin or silk, but also not cotton. 
Sheets: Doz by Sijo 100% bamboo sheets: Amazon
Pillows: PG Goods Med/Firm Down Alternative Side/Back pillows 2set: $45.00 Nordstrom Rack

Well, I am 33 now and I have been openly dealing with my bipolar symptoms for almost a decade now. I think everybody here knows how it goes. I'll try to summarize mine.

I come from Brazil. I have always been a gay kid. My mom raised me solo (my father lives in a different city and is very very poor). My mom didn't have a very good job, so my grandfather payed for my tuition. I was very feminine, and very afraid, because I suffered bullying and I was very fragile. We werent poor, but far from rich. Middle class in Brazil sucks, basically. Being gay was very tough when I was a teen, so I had two psychotic breaks at the ages of 15 and 16. At first we thought that I had panic, so I had the opportunity to do therapy since that age. But therapy back then didn't work as it does now. I think the proffesionals that tried to help me back then weren't as good as the ones I have now during adulthood. Anyways, I was also very nerd. Because in order to get social approval, I needed to succeed in everything. But could never hold the pressure.

So I studied computer science, graduated, got a masters, and started to get very good jobs in software engineering. But I never quite knew how to deal with PRESSURE. I was always pressured, always pressuring me to be better, to have a better job... One after the other. Then I couldn't sleep - only code. Started smoking (at 25!!! does that make sense? who starts smoking at 25?). I always think I'm not good enough for the job.

I feel alone, because I was never a guy who had much friends, neither online. I only used the computer to code stuff for college or for the company, and then played offline games. Never talked to anyone. I feel sort of envy of people that actually have friends on discord, on twitch, and play online games. Because I was always just a ghost. Being alone is terrible. I have [paruresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paruresis)\- which is related to social phobia - and even now at 33 I feel very uneasy around people.

Then we come to bipolar symptoms. I have a doctor that has been treating me for 3.5 years now. It improved so much. Now I can clearly see how I acted during mania and how I act during depression. It's so clear now, some friends used to say that I was ""intense"" sometimes, and sometimes ""bored, uninterested"". I thought that I was just ""happy"" and ""excited"" to do stuff, but now I see that this states of euphoria leads me to spend tons of money online without thinking, say something to someone without thinking. I have all those signs of thinking ""I'm greater than the rest of the people"". Sometimes I think I'm a lunatic, or a very arrogant prick. Sometimes I overly excited. My doctor says I have  ""mixed symptoms"". 

I have some friends that referred me to a company in US to be working as backend engineer. I faked my way through the selection process - it was tough, but I tried to study a lot of things that I hadn't worked with in order to look like I was a lot more senior than I really was. Then I got in, and the money is ridiculous. 150,000 year. In my currency this multiplies by 5.

I was doing okay in the first months. The job was very challenging, because I am not a very good coder. I know how to code, but most of my jobs were the same - first months I code like ""meh"", - then depression kicks in and I simply stop. Because I cant hold the pressure and the loneliness. So my mom got super excited that she was gonna be ""rich"". I was just very worried, and I couldn't understand why. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to deliver. And i didn't deliver. *(But I could've delivered! I didn't deliver because I chose not to. I chose not to work... but I feel that this choice was affected by my emotional state, by bipolar symptoms, I don't know).*

5 months in, I had a week that I couldn't simply turn on the computer. My manager gave me some days, but the head of people just said that I didn't need to return. And that's how I lost the job that could change my life materially speaking.

Now I'm so fucked. I am spending money like hell, I could've stored some, but I didn't. Nothing in life makes sense, I don't like coding. I hate coding actually. And just the prospect of finding another job... that pays well.. Ill have to pretend again that I am an awesome coder... That I love programming... Just by opening my github and seeing 3 months without commits already gives me gossebumps. How am I gonna explain that in an interview? How am I gonna explain this ""hiatus"" without work? And technology grows so fast, its always so demanding... I know the life of the engineer it's just googling for your solution on stackoverflow (and even reddit!), but for me it was more. It was a pressure I couldn't handle. I felt that they expected so much I couldn't give. Realistically speaking I know I could give, but in my mind I didn't believe that. So being up to date with recent releases of the languages that I work more, being up to date with web-development in general... This kills me from within.

I know I sort of wandered a lot in this post and it may not make any sense. But the thing is that having bipolar issues is very hard for me. I was taking lamotrigin, 200mg, but Mania was too high, sleeping less than 5 hours a day. And now I'm reducing it to 25mg and taking Sodium divalproate, which has helped a lot with mania, but I still don't see any meaning in the future. In what I do. 

I feel like I'm gonna explode, that nobody can know about this. I'm embarassed to tell my mom, my family, my friends. I'm hiding the truth from them, they think I'm okay, they think I'm gonna be rich now... They say ""of course from all of us, you were going to be the one to be rich, because you were very intelligent"". They don't know ho weak I am... I do therapy (4x month) and 1x psychiatrist, which prescribes the medication above and I'm taking it regularly. But I feel so ashamed. People die hard to get a job, I just took it for granted. I had the opportunity to change my life, but money didn't change my life. I feel that if my friends know about that, they'll judge me.

In here we have a saying that ""crazy people eat sh\*t and burn money"". Well, pass me the poop.

At the same time, I must say that I improved a lot! I was very sedentary, but it's been 2 years that I started working out, but even working out feels exaggerated. I started working out 11 times/week, completely addicted to it. I don't wanna touch the computer. I just wanna work out and cook and sleep. Blocked from coding for 4 months now. Everything is exaggerated for me - I need to be the best, I need to work out 11x a week, when I give gifts... I always try to impress. I feel like I am poor hearted. When the weekend comes, I don't have the energy to go out. Stay inside home, thinking that I could be spending my money with a trip... an awesome trip... Living outside... But I just can't leave the sofa. Unless it is to work out. And I feel that I needed someone, a boyfriend or just a close friend to do stuff together. Doing it alone feels miserable. I've been doing everything alone forever.",1678559422.0

He went mad and wrote half a novel,

He talked to the spiritual,

And went nights and days with no food or slumber,

Just mad,

An expat in a foreign land,

Lost a job,

And just ran,

On trains,

In pain,

Encounter, encounter,

I‚Äôve not eaten for awhile,

Elaborate dinners adorn me,

Felt safe,

Felt like stability,

Friendship from those that raised me up,

Flood gates open,

Money on counters,

Getaways on weekends,

Healthy or parasitic?

Strangers call,

They‚Äôre bored on business trips,

Not sure if I‚Äôm a villain,

Not sure how it all happened,

Because I always hated myself,

Not sure how I attracted any of these people in my life,

Met a woman so deeply infatuated with me in Taiyuan,

Held me like I would blow away,

Seemed to not judge me or my past,

Wedding and daughters in Henan,

To relocation in the Midwest,

Life gets cruel,

The one who called me cute and said they loved me now calls me a whore,

Just because things get a little tough,

Just because,

I want to ride on planes and trains,

Go far again,

I miss Shanxi,

Where I met flattery before the ridicule.",1678565489.0

688,Can Mania look like:,3,11okds7,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11okds7/can_mania_look_like/,2,"Hi everyone, My mom had bipolar so that is where the Drs are landing but can't get into a psych for another 2 months. It started over a month ago. I've always been a very emotional person and emotional outbursts weren't really uncommon but I've done alot of work on myself and outbursts at others were very uncommon. Around my period sometimes I would feel like I was ""tripping out"" like on a psychedelic or higher levels of marijuana but I hadn't taken anything. No visuals, or hearing things just body feeling extra heightened and emotions that had me wailing for hours. Sometimes it would only be a few hours a night. A couple times hours during the day back to back to back days. When these happened I could not do anything but cry and yell like I was having a baby (I've had 2 babies without medicine it is similar but not just body- body, mind, emotions).
So a little over a month ago I felt that way again figured I'd just flow through it like I always did but this time it hasn't stopped for over a month. Waves of adrenaline pumping through my body to where I want to run as fast as I can but then I collapse because I haven't slept and am exhausted from adrenaline pumping through my body (though Doc says cortisol is at normal levels). Feeling fearful of like everything. Headaches, nausea, vision anomalies (swimming vision, when I close my eyes bright florescent swimming vision), shaking hands, kind of numb hands, feet and sometimes limbs, crying and wailing in waves with overwhelm of emotion. 
I am on Vraylar and Clonazepam has been helping me sleep. But I tried to stop the Clonazepam (very low doses) and last night didn't sleep a wink and all the symptoms came back and had me tripping.
I know klonopin or clonazepam is an ""as needed"" thing so I don't want to take it regularly. If it is bipolar shouldn't the vrylar nip the mania in the bud? I feel like it has been helping a little bit, but maybe it is the Clonazepam..",1678541780.0

I have a solid, regular sleep schedule, a good job that I love, a home that I'm slowly making my own, and a robust social network. But it's come at a cost. Years and years of tripping uphill against sleet and a headwind. Climbing out of a deep forest well only to fall back in.

I believe my life will be shortened by 10-15 years due to medication-induced side effects, including the obesity. I'm limited in what jobs I can take and where I can live because my ability to hold a full-time job and function in any way is dependent on my access to a level of healthcare that only around 10% of the people I know have access to.

I was manic for like 3 months. I stopped taking my meds because I thought I didn‚Äôt need them. And in those 3 months I did some damage including:
I bought a new car I didn‚Äôt need. My old car was only 4 years old with no problems but I wanted a new car and so I got a new car. My car payment also went up by $200 and my insurance by $100. 
I got pulled over for speeding 3 times since getting the new car. Only got a ticket one of those times though but still not great. 
I also have already scratched and dented the new car because I wasn‚Äôt paying attention and was driving too fast and hit a pole. I should not be allowed to drive while manic. 
I also drove drunk (in my old car) and hit my roommate‚Äôs car while trying to park fucked up. 
I had a lot of sex. With a lot of different people. To the point where I have an appointment to get tested because I‚Äôm not always careful when I‚Äôm manic. 
I spent all my money. Like everything I have is gone. I also applied for a new credit card that is already maxed out. 
I got written up at work twice for yelling at coworkers and arguing with my boss. 
I didn‚Äôt sleep for days at a time and if I did sleep it would only be an hour or two. 
I tore my entire house apart trying to clean and organize everything. I never put it back though so it‚Äôs currently a disaster. 
I got drunk or high pretty much every night. 
I smoked constantly.
Got super paranoid and I thought everyone was trying to kill me. I also thought they put cameras all over my house and I was being watched. I thought I couldn‚Äôt trust anyone. 
I got banned from this subreddit for awhile for being an asshole. 
I was adamant that I was not bipolar and I was doing great off meds. I kept telling everyone that how great I was doing off meds was proof that I wasn‚Äôt bipolar. 

Anyway in case it‚Äôs not obvious I was not doing great. I was an absolute mess and everyone around me knew it even if I wouldn‚Äôt admit it. I finally got back on meds and I‚Äôm doing a bit better. It‚Äôs just going to take some time to dig myself out of this hole I seem to find myself in. 

And even after all that I still question whether or not I‚Äôm actually bipolar. I still don‚Äôt want to take meds and know I‚Äôll probably go off them again at some point. Like how do you guys do it? I have gone off and back on meds so many times. I have been hospitalized so many times because I can‚Äôt stay on my meds. Everyone around me is sick of it. Im sick of it. I just don‚Äôt want to do this anymore. Why does everything have to be so hard? Why do I have to complicate everything?

Even though i try to speak and be apart of the group, it‚Äôs like my brain has nothing to say or add to any conversation that is going on. It‚Äôs making me want to live in complete isolation so that i don‚Äôt have to talk to anyone or deal with anything social. I‚Äôm exhausted of it. I don‚Äôt feel sad or depressed or anything of that nature.. so why do i feel like this? it doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me. even right now i‚Äôm surrounded by family members and people who love me, but all i want to do is go home and not talk to any of them. 

Isolation is what i really want. just to live in an isolated house, read my isolated book, create isolated art, eat isolated food.

My only other experience with mental health providers was therapists and one hospitalization. At the time I went in, I had a lot of ideas about what could have been wrong, initially believing it possible I had BPD (not bipolar). The reason being is that in that period of my life and several years prior, I was having a lot of difficulty with emotional attachment/regulation and drug abuse among other things. This is largely due to growing up around addicts and living with abusive family (severe and repeated trauma from a young age, genetic predisposition to addiction as well as drugs being easily obtainable). 

These problems have long since passed, I have improved significantly in terms of emotional regulation, maturity, attachment issues, got sober, etc. I am a lot more stable than I was then. However, I mentioned the possibility of having BPD in my appointment as well as personal struggles with trauma, drugs, insomnia and whatever else. This ultimately led to me being diagnosed bipolar. At the time I was open to considering the possibility. I was put on antipsychotics, and still, I didn't mind, because I knew that they have the potential to help with other issues I had (insomnia, depression, anxiety, paranoia). I also did do well on Latuda in the past (I was made to take it in the hospital) which I'm sure may have also contributed to me receiving the diagnosis.

I have never experienced mania, or even hypomania, and I've said as much. I have been on plenty of SSRIs and have never reacted negatively. I have no history of mania or hypomania, and I never experienced anything resembling it, including within the couple of years I've gone here. Maybe she thought it because of the insomnia and drug issues? I'm not sure how true it is (and I know people who actually are bipolar are more likely to abuse drugs) but I've heard sometimes providers throw around this diagnosis too loosely for anyone struggling with substance abuse. I've also heard that sometimes medicaid providers aggressively code in order to compensate for low reimbursement rates, but again, just theorizing. 

I've brought this concern up to her several times to no avail. She will dismiss it, or even try to convince me it's still within the realm of possibility. To an extent I bought it for a while, and this caused a lot of self doubt. The reason this is an issue for me (other than just the fact that it's an incorrect diagnosis in my records) is because I am seeking alternative treatment methods for TRD and don't want this to hinder my ability or eligibility for certain things. I've emailed the office, and apparently she still stands by the diagnosis. I'm supposed to go in next week to a different provider for a second opinion. This whole thing is just frustrating and a bit ridiculous.",1678506012.0

&#x200B;

I know that none of you know me all well enough to give me a straight answer, and I know that every person with bipolar disorder is different, but I thought maybe some opinions from other folks with lived experience may be helpful.

&#x200B;

Here's the brief of why I'm asking:

&#x200B;

I am currently employed and have been working at the same employer for the past 6 years. I've changed positions a few times over that time period, and my current one and the one before it have really chipped away at my feelings of self and trust. I've been doing admin work in almost all of these positions, but with remote work and my general people-pleasing qualities, I have not been good at establishing boundaries with my workload and continue to get work done, just at the expense of my mental health and personal time. Before the pandemic, I was lucky enough to have a supervisor who was so friendly with me that she would always ask if I had time to take on new projects and regularly checked in and complimented my work. That strengthened my work ethic a lot, but in my last two roles I have had no such mutual communication or respect from my work, in my current job I am rarely thanked for turning around things on a tight deadline when someone needs emergency admin help. While a thank you isn't required, I am so frequently told that someone needs something ASAP that I find myself being constantly on edge.   


In the past, before I worked admin, I worked mostly food service in some fast casual and one fast food place. I was not medicated at the time and was heavily using substances (""just"" marijuana and alcohol habitually, but still) and engaging in risky behaviors that in hindsight I can't believe I survived. I was severely depressed, but constantly surrounded by other people. I'm fond of some parts of that part of my life, but overall the chaos of the work environment, no guaranteed steady schedule (at all places I was often scheduled for ""clopens"" because I was a ""good closer"" and a ""good opener""), low pay, and toxic work attitudes (similar to admin), I cannot imagine going back to that entirely.   


I am about to enter an intensive outpatient program for the second time. The first time was about six years ago. Last time I did not do full-time IOP because I was working two part-time jobs. This time I am planning on doing full-time IOP because I have accrued a substantial amount of vacation leave, plus have FMLA protection, in my current job.   


However, I am very concerned about if I can handle returning to my job. It is a big part of this current depressive episode and contributed to the very recent attempt I had that has now landed me here. There was a lot at play, but my job has been a constant source of stress for the past four years, even with remote and hybrid work. I would like to start looking into different options, but I constantly only consider admin since I've been doing it for so long and it's comfortable work for me. My partner is looking at new jobs outside of the industry they've been working in for the past six years, and it is helping to inspire me to do the same, but I am anxious about not having benefits, being able to afford to live, and also a work environment that continues to trigger me.

&#x200B;

My main question:

Has anyone here found a type of work that works for them without contributing to their depressive or (hypo)manic episodes directly? Is your work financially sustainable for you, and how did you find it? I'm really just looking for ideas. It doesn't even have to be your own lived experience, but if you know someone else who also has bipolar disorder and has thrived in a specific type of work, that would be good to know.

The way I behaved wasn't very clear to him, and he could only make a temporary diagnosis of mixed personality disorders, PTSD and an eventual bipolar disorder. Months and years passed, and at some point I realised that i was indeed having a recurrent cycle between ""sad"" periods and ""happy"" periods. I realised it by noticing that there clearly were periods where I felt so confident and full of energy, my vision became more colorful and saturated and my speech more fluent. And at other times, periods of down where I couldn't leave my bed only to ruminate and complain about my past and the whole world. And as my father was already diagnosed with BP too, I came to a point where I became quite certain that I'm bipolar. Only 2 weeks ago was I finally diagnosed with BP2, and only yesterday have I started taking Lamictal. 

I heard a lot of good things about Lamictal, and as EMDR which I started a month ago works amazingly well I'm very also hopeful about my new medication. The pill smells like strawberries so that's definitely a plus too ü•¥",1678485166.0

I know he was aware of the offer for an interview (as he was in the email also) and did not mention anything about it until I excitedly asked if he saw that I have an interview. I thought he would be super supportive. It is my first application I have submitted that is relevant/I am qualified for due to my nearly finished bachelors degree (which he was very influential in making me finish.

My head was hurting because of how much I needed to explode and I had to text my boss I was having a personal crisis and leave about 2 hours in.

760,I feel the Darkness setting in...,3,11nvnmf,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11nvnmf/i_feel_the_darkness_setting_in/,1,"I've been sleeping more the past few nights yet waking up progressively more exhausted, even though the sleep has been deeper and longer with each passing night. 
I had a thought two days ago upon noticing I was getting really *tired* while completing tasks ""Ahhhh shit, I'm about to crash.."" 

Since starting back on medication in January, I've been quite hypomanic with some mixed states peppered in coordinating with titrating meds. While some days have been quite hellish, overall I am doing so much better with my mood states, I've been more aware of them and able to regulate myself better, ensure my needs are met via using Finch, and I have been more myself when it comes to mothering which has been incredible. I've gotten most of the depression mess cleaned up from my episode last fall through the end of December. Though I have been tired, I have gotten good bits of chores done around the house and had lots of hands-on time with my daughter. 

When I woke up yesterday I felt a heaviness over my whole body and mind, so I went through the efforts of maintaining the morning routine I got going while hypomanic, and I decided to spend the day dedicated to doing my nails and eating good food. I took breaks to make goodie baskets for my little one to have in her tent set up inside, read a few books to her and played a round of Bluey Trouble (highly recommend). I enjoyed it all but that enjoyment was muted as fuck, notably so even compared to the day before. Food had tasted positively brilliant no matter what it was while I was manic. Now everything is bland, it literally happened over night. I'm pretty confident it isnt otherwise medically related. 
While I had fun with my daughter and managed to navigate a hairy parenting situation calmly with patience and love- I felt really drained emotionally after that and had to fight off an underlying irritability at everything the rest of the day from the loud traffic passing by to her wanting to interrupt me working on my nails, simply to give me a hug. I felt horrible immediately. 

I hate that I am feeling this way. It's like an enormous grizzly bear is slowly working its way into my chest; wiggling around a bit to get the comfiest spot possible to settle down and hibernate. 
However, I am proud of the fact that I am *aware* that the depression is setting in; that is a huge win for me.

I had a hunch and asked her about it to which she lied to my face. She fashioned such a big lie with breadcrumbs to try and make it seem like it was something else.

When I saw the ""promissory note"" she had tried to hide in the back of her phone, which they had forced her to sign in order to acknowledge her debt from 13 years ago which had made so she could provide for our family. I screamed and I fumed and told her all she is is a liar and that I have two parents for liars. I felt betrayed because I asked her 4 times, why this, why that to which she just lied more and more. She even said ""why all the questions"".

My mom... who is completely co-dependent on me just collapsed in anxiety. And told me she lied because she was scared. 

I said bull shit, she's just trying to lie her way out of this by being the biggest victim. It then came out they had went to her job a week before, they had approached her colleagues, and made her sign who knows what. That's when  I told her I'm done, I'm leaving, I threw my clothes in a bag and drove off.  

When I left I realised my whole life and my cat is still in my room so an hour later I returned to find her shakingin anxt supposedly about whether or not I'm safe. 

After she fell asleep I wrote LIAR in red in capitals all over her wall for her to see when she woke up. 

I was fuming!! When she woke up right before work I screamed at her that she should go to her ex (my father) then she can go and lie with him in a little lying club. I said they should rething since they're a perfect match because they're both equally stupid little liars. 

I then told her she can expect me to leave within the next dew days and that's extremely scary to her since she doesn't have anyone else to depend on. She doesn't even know how to pay a bill on her own. 

Thing is she suffers from severe anxiety and depression and because she has been treated for it for years with benzodiazepines she is unable literally properly function and be present besides for the things she needs to do at work.

So when they approached her at work she immediately assumed the worst got scared and agreed to everything they said. They could've gave her amount and she would've said yes just so they could leave. 

Lying is a major trigger for me because of so frequently being lied to about MASSIVE things by both my parents - like e.g. having 7 other siblings from my dad. 

What frustrated me is her lying about something this big that could affect her entire future, including mine... especially when she could've called me and I could've explained my mother's situation where they maybe could have helped in another way. Now they can't. 

So after she went to work, I felt bad having left things like that knowing mom isn't too healthy... For a minute I realised how scared someone like her who doesn't have any knowledge around any financial subjects must have been.... so I sent her a text saying I'm sorry, I forgive her for lying about this but everything else is true.

Then I noticed she came home because she was unable to work.... but she never came home, she went straight to our neighbour - where she got the letters to substantiate her lie. 

After not that I had time to think about everything. About her blood pressure condition and her cardiac condition. I realised how much I love her and that I exploded because I was scared. My circle was threatened. I was triggered by her lies because it affected me.

When I left last night... I realised I had nowhere to go, no one to turn to. And if she dies, that's the grim reality I face.

I realised I was scared because I didn't have a job to pay for this added debt. I have my own mental issues which I have not even been able to get a hold on in order to be able to have a functional life. 

I want to cry because I am constantly torn between multiple thought patterns in my head. If I didn't leave last night I would've turned over the entire house and wiped everything from the tables - like a child in an adult's body throwing a tantrum with all this strength. 

I realised I was the problem. I yelled at her because I was scared for my own sake. I am the one who is supposed to take care of her. She's 60. I'm supposed to be able to pay her debt and tell the collector to go fuck herself. I've been looking for jobs all day. 

What she did will affect her past 80 and she is retiring with nothing because our lives had been so different.

What I struggle with is my reactions. Especially with my mom since I feel like I can say whatever I want. I freaked out because I knew we didn't have $16 000!! We don't even have a house where we can get that from. 

When I am in that mad mental state, I know every one of her triggers and spew it out of my mouth remorselessly without control and it breaks my heart that I will do that to my mom. I just need it to stop doing it to my mom who is literally the only one who has truly been there for me throughout her life and mine. 

And I need help. I need help and just advice on how to deal with this reactiveness and 5 different moods in 2 hours. 


Btw all day I flash between feelings of anger, empathy, loathe, remorse, regret, disdain, disappointment. Feeling like I don't care at all,  but then I'm stressed to the point where I can't breathe. Up and down and I truly can not take it!!

During her initial consultation, the patient reported that she has been experiencing episodes of depression, anhedonia, psychomotor retardation, occasional bouts of excessive guilt, feeling extreme hopelessness, and suicidal ideations. Conversely, her family also noted the patient having moments wherein she would have an elated or irritable mood associated with increased self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, flight of ideas, increased goal-directed activities, and impulsive behavior. The persistence and progression of these symptoms prompted her mother to schedule a consultation with the undersigned.

Given the clinical history elicited and her mental status examination at the time of examination, the patient has a working diagnosis of Bipolar II Disorder, most recent episode hypomanic. The patient was recommended to be maintained on Risperidone 2 mg/tablet, 1 1‚ÅÑ2 tablets once a day at bedtime.

803,Inception Psychosis,1,11nqnws,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11nqnws/inception_psychosis/,0,"I am starting to think I‚Äôm in a coma. ‚ÄúStarting‚Äù isn‚Äôt really the best word for it. This is a years long idea that I fall in and out of, but I‚Äôm definitely on a hard ‚Äúin‚Äù state. When I was in my late-teens/early-20‚Äôs I developed Hallucination Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD) from some bad choices I made in my late teens/early 20s. This means that I have very mild hallucinations that never go away. Nothing like hearing voices or seeing people who aren‚Äôt there, but more like walls and floors breathing, twinkling lights flat single color surfaces being covered in TV static or tastes and smells that aren‚Äôt there.  I ended up screwing up my perception of reality for a long time playing with things like lucid dreaming and sleep deprivation because of an obsession with the movie Inception. This caused some ‚ÄúI‚Äôm actually dreaming‚Äù delusions at the time including how for a few weeks I believed that my 2 best friends were actually hallucinations and that I was talking to parts of my subconscious. 

This context is important. 

For years, social media targeting advertising has given me a spinning top that supposedly spins forever based of the design used by Leonardo DiCaprio‚Äôs character in Inception. And, although I never click it, it shows up randomly from time to time and every time it makes me just a little worried that maybe the life I‚Äôm living isn‚Äôt real. It usually isn‚Äôt more than a passing thought that sticks with me for an hour or so before I just forget about it.

In the fall of 2021 I finally came to terms with being a trans woman and started HRT which has changed my body chemistry and has caused my meds to work differently and I‚Äôm still trying to even it out. I stopped self-medicating and am sticking to just my prescribed medication and that really seems to help.

Self medication caused me to stop remembering my dreams which was one of the only benifits. I knew my Seroquel dreams were vivid and crazy, and that my brain built huge labyrinths because I would remember them from time to time, but I wasn‚Äôt aware how crazy my they were until I started actually remembering them the last few nights. Last night I dreamed about a town I lived when I was kid, where I won a local writing award that was showcased in some civic center office building thing. I spent the dream trying to find the award while dodging security guards because I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be there. Staircases moved while I was on them, perspectives shifted, and to me the dream seemed real. I woke up this morning and check Facebook only to see the spinning top ad and I can‚Äôt get it out of my head; that maybe one of those experiences from my past actually put me into a coma and that the last nearly decade of my life has been a coma dream. 

I know it sounds delusional. I‚Äôm not out of touch. I know that this is real life‚Ä¶ but some small part of my brain tells me that maybe it isn‚Äôt‚Ä¶. I need to talk to my doctor, but that‚Äôs going to take a few days at the very least and I‚Äôve been freaking out all day‚Ä¶

Little background. I was professionally diagnosed with bipolar type 1 not too long ago, due to having to be hospitalized for a major manic episode, which was my first as well. It lasted nearly three months and totally screwed my life up In high school. Currently, I am restless and feel super energized , I cannot sleep what so ever. I don‚Äôt think I am currently , but a little less than an hour ago I was hypo manic for about 4-5 hours. Was feeling super euphoric, increase in texting friends and even texting people i have not texted in a long time. I am quite educated with bipolar as when I have hypo manic episodes, I tend to be obsessed with bipolar mania. So if anyone knows how hypo mania can turn into mani, please let me know I am concerned for my well being and will let my doctor know. Thanks!",1678433439.0

Awesome right? No! Because I have such bad social anxiety that I actually had to get drunk before going. Did I want to do this? No!

I let my psychiatrist know 2 weeks ago - hey, school is coming up. We talked about klonopin, she prescribed a small test dose, just 4 pills - she told me to take them over the next few days and see if the dose would be good for me at school, not too drowsy or out of it - but able to go out in public. She assured me I'd have a solution by the 7th, the day school started.

The 7th comes, I call in for my appointment. She's not in. I get sent to another psychiatrist and see him. He speaks to me for half an hour, says he'll call in the prescription refill, and everything is good, I'll be able to pick it up before school.

I spend the next 5 hours calling back between the pharmacy and psychiatrist. No prescription. I get transferred to a therapist there, psychiatrist has left for the day, our receptionist can still send in the prescription though, don't worry, you're going to be all set.

I have to leave in 2 hours at this point, cutting it close, but they assure me it's going to be fine.

No prescription. I have to leave. It was freezing out so I dressed extra warm and went to hop on the bus, but decided to grab a quick bottle of booze to calm my nerves if needed, and take a big shot of it before getting on the bus. The bus is 2 blocks away, I can see it pulling up when I start feeling EXTREMELY hot. Like, I'm sweating bullets, my stomach is in knots, I can't breathe. I decide to partially undress and shove my sweater into my backpack quickly. Manage to get it done right before the bus pulls up. I have to pay with change since I haven't taken public transport in awhile and don't have a metrocard, and because I used to get horrendously teased over being poor for using change at the store as a kid (???) - this sent my anxiety back up. Anyway, I'm on the bus now. Still sweaty, and honestly just not feeling too great. I've been sick all week, finally getting over it, so I'm having to blow my nose every 5 seconds which draws attention to me. The bus ride is torture and there's traffic and construction which slows the bus down, a 20 minute ride to the train ends up taking about 45. But I endured.

Finally get off the bus, after stepping on the guy behind me's foot, and go up to the train. Walk up two flights to get to it - I've barely moved off the couch for the last 6 months. I'm in horrible shape. I can't breathe by the time I reach the top. Go to put cash in the machine to buy a metrocard but the machine is broken. Wait behind someone, I feel a little too closely, and finally get to spend double what I expected to! Awesome!

I swipe in and climb another flight of stairs to the actual platform. Too sweaty, snotty, and anxiety to get on the first train. Class is closing in, I haven't eaten all day because of nerves, I was planning on grabbing something quickly before class. I finally get on the third train that comes, because time was running out.

I get off the train, don't know which way the building is so I start following people with backpacks, figuring they all must be heading towards the college at least. Nope. Pulled out my phone and start walking back the other way. Class is in 10 minutes now. I get to the building, but wait! It's the wrong building! Finally find the right building. Class is in 5 minutes. I'm a fucking wreck. I'm sweaty, and gross looking, and my anxiety is far too high for this. 

I duck into the first bathroom I see, sit down on the stall and try my damndest to take the quietest shot I could. Nearly puke. Go leave and find the room, theres like 10 people just standing outside of it, no one knows where the professor is apparently. There's no service in the building and I don't know the wifi password, so I can't check my email or anything, so I play the one game that I have on my phone, I don't really know how to play it but it was just to distract my mind. 

Anyway, the professor had something to do and emailed everyone about an hour ago apparently, long after i had already left to come here. I learned this from the other students, but didn't want to leave with them because what if one of them starts talking to me? So I stay for another 10 minutes before heading out. Walk back to the train. The empanada place I had mapped out beforehand is closed. I'm fed up and just want to go home. I go home.

Next day, call doctor, oh sorry we weren't able to send it in, we'll get it done today, definitely. Okay, I only have online classes today, I can handle this. 9pm comes and there's no prescription sent still.

Next day, call again, yeah sorry we just don't know why they aren't getting it, we'll call it in now. Call us back in an hour. Okay. Online class again today, so it's okay. They don't answer in an hour, 9pm comes again and no prescription.

Which leads us to today. I call again, kinda pissed. Get told ""Sean"" is going to call me as soon as he's done with another patient. I wait all day, calling back every 3 hours, keep getting told the same thing. 

My psychiatrist is still not back. My therapist appointment is tomorrow with MY therapist, and she can usually get stuff done, so I'm going to talk to her about it all. But if monday comes and I don't have that prescription? What am I going to do? Drink again?

More and more, I find that there are things I want to change or improve. These things are important for both myself and my partner.

But I find that I struggle to manage those changes one step at a time.

When I'm hypomanic, I have an influx of ideas, and the excitement to execute them is empowering and motivating. However, when depressed, it's difficult not to discard the ideas, to treat them as impossible to achieve. Finding a balance between being motivated but realistic in my goals is more difficult than I ever anticipated. I remind myself frequently that it'll be one step at a time, but there is an amount of impatience with that being the case.

I guess where I want to go with this is saying that it isn't always easy to make changes, but the positivity they will bring keeps me moving forward. I want the best for myself and my partner, and I think with a positive outlook and support from my peers, this goal, these dreams, will be achievable. Posting this is  a positive way to affirm how I feel, and a reminder to myself that this is what I want, even if it's a difficult path to get there.

My new one is contact lenses. I have an appointment next month to go in for the exam. I'm going to get the clear kind (I think) AND the colored kind. Maybe turquoise. Maybe gray.

&#x200B;

I thought about getting a color for each of my moods. Purple or amber when manic. 

Green/hazel/clear for normal.

Blue or gray for depressed.

&#x200B;

But Idk maybe that's stupid.

&#x200B;

It's like 3 weeks til my appointment and I've been watching lots of videos about eye care, and contacts. I've watched videos of people trying on different colored lenses. I've researched the brands offered by my eye place and put a few in my cart to calculate the price it might be. I went out and spent the last of my spending money on contact lens cases, and solution, and eye drops.

&#x200B;

I won't say it's the ONLY thing I can thing about as of now. But I do get a little rush when I research it or talk about it. As I was writing this, I got distracted and found a coupon for 1 month free on colored lenses. üòÖ

844,Advice on Managing Bipolar in High-stress College Program? (Engineering School),3,11n3wmx,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11n3wmx/advice_on_managing_bipolar_in_highstress_college/,4,"Hi, I wanted to reach out and ask for some advice.

During this past fall semester of college, I was unexpectedly hospitalized and held at psychiatric facilities for around 10 days. Prior to my hospitalization, I was unaware that I was Bipolar. I was unmedicated and was instead ingesting lots of cannabis in an attempt to manage my symptoms (big mistake).

Following my stay in the pysch. wards (early November), I withdrew from engineering school and haven't returned.

While part of me really wants to return to school in the fall and finish my degree, the other part of me has strong reservations about this. I have around four semesters left until I graduate, and I'm so conflicted.

I have two main fears. First, I don't know if it's possible to manage my symptoms in such a high-stress environment. Unfortunately, sleep deprivation and a massive workload are the name of the game at the school I attend. I'm scared all the stress will bring back the debilitating symptoms I was suffering with (insomnia, paranoia, hyperactivity, depressive breakdowns, etc.).

My other fear is that I do seem to have some level of cognitive impairment associated with Bipolar, such as slowed cognition and clumsiness/forgetfulness. Due to these impairments, I have to work harder than my peers, and some of these issues seem to be a bit worse now that I'm medicated. (I'm hoping that as time goes on I'll be able to find the right type and amount of meds that give me minimal side effects.) I'm worried that even if I finish my degree, I won't be able to find employment because of these mental issues.

Unfortunately, I've tried to find a major/career path that's more compatible with my diagnosis, but my passion is still engineering and nothing else interests me nearly as much.

So I'm reaching out to you guys. Have any of you had a similar experience or found yourselves in a position like this? How did you proceed and find a balance between your passion/career and your mental health?

Thanks for taking the time to read this and any insights you have to offer.",1678396211.0

I am on 750mg Lithium and 10mg Abilify, although I'm hoping to get off the Abilify and try Lamictal to see if it helps with the sedated affect. 

I was diagnosed with Bipolar 1 less than 6 months ago. Before medications I experienced a prolonged manic episode for about three months, with one big depressive episode at the end. My mania during this time made it debilitating to function as I progressed into psychosis. I was alone for much of it, so didn't have anyone to really pull me out. 

Since stabilizing, I have noticed that I am not myself. I lack the charm or wit that used to come easily, or the drive to take on creative projects. Hell, holding a conversation now can feel like torture. I can barely laugh like I used to, and not even come close to making someone else laugh with my misplaced goofy antics. I think some of these qualities of me started to slip away before my major episode, with the affects of anxiety and depression.

I feel void of personality and can hardly feel emotions. I sometimes have the odd thing on the radio make my eyes well up, but other than that I haven't cried since being in mania. I have started talking to a person of romantic interest, and I am scared I won't be able feel, express, or give the full range of emotions to them that I would like to. I don't even have any interests right now. I wonder if some of these are affects of being relatively disengaged from the world, I have been pretty recluse throughout my recovery. Just out of the swing of things, and everything feels taboo and overwhelmingly new.

I struggle daily with intrusive thoughts, and have been feeling on the low end of the spectrum. I miss the energy spikes I would get when unmedicated, but being realistic I experienced more depression than anything.

All this is to say has anyone else experienced this flatness before? Is there cognitive recovery? Will I laugh again, candidly? Will I have enriching interests? How to break the cycle of feeling apathetic and boring?

I'm now unemployed again and have some money saved up thankfully so I don't have to worry too much about bills for a couple months since I only pay for my phone and food (bless my parents for putting up with me). I need to get back to seeing a psychiatrist/NP but they're booked out until May. I can make it that long but damn do I hate this illness.",1678402699.0
871,Any advice on what to do during a mixed episode?,7,11mpydq,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11mpydq/any_advice_on_what_to_do_during_a_mixed_episode/,14,"I probably have bipolar disorder and am going to be starting mood stabilisers soon. I'm experiencing what I think might be a mixed episode, and I'm not sure what to do about it. I'm still waiting on some test results to do with epilepsy before I can start medication.

I've been depressed since late November / early December.

Now I keep feeling like I'm coming back up again, but not quite. I'm really irritable and just kind of all over the place. I keep getting the urge to do big things (go out and change my life, make loads of friends, do stuff), but nothing feels good. I'm exhausted but I can't relax.

I'm really anxious: I'm having creeping feelings like everyone hates me and is out to get me. I've been avoiding going out because I'm frightened of people for reasons I can't explain. I'm feeling guilty for everything all the time, but also really confident at the same time.

I feel like my mental health team is up to something. I want to start medication so this will stop, and yet I'm frightened of the pills. I don't trust it. I feel like there's a conspiracy going on, but I know I'm not being logical. I feel like I can cure my illness with good sleep hygiene, light therapy, stress avoidance, and a blend of herbs/supplements. At the same time, I feel like everything is hopeless and that I want to die. I keep having intrusive thoughts about suicide.

My sleep has been all over the place. I've been waking up much earlier than usual, then lying in bed because I have no will to get up. I can't sleep at night, then I cat-nap during the day. I'm tired all the time. It's picked up a little in the past two days, and I've been able to get a full nine hours (thank goodness because I was exhausted), but it's still pretty erratic.

I'm also experiencing aspects of the hypersexuality I get during my ups.

I keep trying to do things, then breaking down halfway through. Today, I've half cleaned my room, half started a load of laundry, half got ready for the gym, half prepared dinner, and now I'm sitting on the kitchen floor trying not to cry. I've written myself a to-do list and failed to do anything on it. I need to exercise and shower. I can't sit still, but I don't have the energy to do anything either.

I'm explaining what's going on in the hope that maybe people here have some advice on things I could do in the here and now to ease the feelings, not because I want a diagnosis or anything. Also, I'm not anti-medication, I'm just having weird feelings rn.

I've been taking baths, trying to exercise, journalling, and meditating to help relieve symptoms in the short term. I've set up a morning / evening routine, have been taking supplements (vitamin D and cod liver oil), and am doing light therapy. I'm trying to see people (friends, family, therapists) regularly too. I've also been engaging with my crisis plan and calling the numbers, etc, and doing all that stuff you're told to do when the suicidal thoughts are getting bad.

Is there anything else I could try to do to relieve the distress while I'm waiting for meds?",1678361790.0

Why do we need this goddamn hypersexuality on top of everything. On top of depression, mania, social anxiety, non-existent impulse control, insomnia, self-hatred.
It takes ALL of my energy not to cheat, which, reading it out loud, makes me sound like an insensitive, entitled asshole. It should come naturally, this one special person that means WORLD to me should be enough. Why do I have to develop crushes on my guy friends? It shatters me to pieces every time I have to end a friendship because of some sick attraction that I just can't control. I catch myself fantasizing about them, I let the flirting get too far and I fucking hate myself for every message I shouldn't have sent.
