3,is this considered a fetish? TW,94,11jfofv,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11jfofv/is_this_considered_a_fetish_tw/,32,"

i’ve been seeing this boy for about five months now, i’m pretty sure that he doesn’t know about my eating disorder, i also don’t do things out of the ordinary for him to suspect anything about it, but for a while i started to question his actions and i need someone’s opinion about it

i’m going to start with the most normal (?) ones:

- he keep touching/feeling my ribs, and tbh i never questioned it because he told me that counting them or feeling them makes him calm 
- there have been times when he tried to put his hand/s around my thigh, calves or waist to see if he can touch his fingers 
- whenever i get a message from him asking if i have eaten yet and i would reply with “not yet” he would tell me to wait for him so we can eat out (and that would be at like 4-5pm) 
- when we do eat out he would tell me to get something light so i don’t get bloated 
- he picks me up a lot and tbh i thought it was cute at first but once he told me to quit binging or else he ll have to work out harder (?) 

i might be overreacting but i would like a second thought!",1678054556.0

My friend whose always been on the slimmer side and has joked about having an ED before, has been taking an uncomfortable interest in my eating. 

Whenever she is eating sugary foods she will always offer for me to eat and if i refuse because i am trying to prioritise my health and also I really dont need a reason why I dont want to eat something. However she will always repeatedly ask ‘why’/‘are you sure’.

One time when she was eating ice cream and I was talking to friends she kept spooning ice-cream into my mouth whilst I was speaking and I told her to stop yet she wouldnt until it was finished. She said ‘I want you to eat when I am eating’

Recently what confirmed she was almost (sabotaging?) me was when I got a coffee and she said you should get some syrup in it and I was reluctant but she said just do it- and the barista poured A LOT of syrup, which is fine but her reaction of laughing really hard and saying ‘thats so good all your gym gains are gone’ is what really irked me. Not sure how to approach this as its clear she is dealing with her own problems but i am not comfortable with this type of projection and its triggering me too.

edit: Ive been hesitant to label her behaviour as toxic as for context she’s 17 and i’ve recently turned 19- I wrote it off as just immaturity and even because im not even the slimmest friend she has- but i think because im polite/ go along she’s made me a target.",1678009776.0

34,Almost passed out just now,4,11jipe9,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11jipe9/almost_passed_out_just_now/,0,"Hi everyone. I have been following this sub for about a year now, but haven’t ever posted here before. I’ve been battling an ED for all of my 20’s and now here I am in my early 30’s doing the same BS. Almost a year ago my old therapist left & a new one was assigned to me. When she introduced herself to me she mentioned that she used to work in an ED recovery program & that it’s her specialty. She came into my life at just the right time. A few years ago I wasn’t even aware I had an eating disorder. I was just “crash dieting.” Some years after that l had an inkling that I maybe this wasn’t health, but quickly dismissed those thoughts. At the time she became my therapist even though I still couldn’t admit to myself I had an ED, I had reached the point where I at least half way wanted to want to stop whatever this was. It’s crazy how things can sometimes line up. Anyway, she’s been a great therapist and ever since I decided to open up to her she has been a big help. It’s been a year’s time since then & I haven’t restricted since nor have I binged until…..



Recently things have been going to shit in my life so ofc my ED came back. I weighted myself a few weeks ago & liked the number, like I really liked the number. I thought why not go further and be as skinny as I used to be when I was in my teens / early twenties. Well, I did lose a few more lbs, but I am currently typing this laying in bed. Let me explain. Today after having a lazy Sunday laying in bed all morning with my wife her and I went to the kitchen to cook dinner. As I was standing there in the kitchen I was getting dizzy and my iwatch showed my heart rate was rapid. I tried so hard to keep it together as I have never opened up to my wife about my ED and didn’t plan to make tonight the night. She noticed I looked blah at the dinner table & said maybe I should go lay down. She came over to the bed after she finished eating & asked if I was ok. I blamed it mostly on not getting enough sleep, but I did admitted that I probably should have eaten breakfast. She said that from now on she’s going to make sure I eat breakfast. My ED went into a slight panic at those words, but honestly guys as I lay here in bed I wanna say it ain’t worth it people. This ofc isn’t the first time I felt like I was going to pass out, but it was the first time I felt my heart pounding outta my chest while simultaneously feeling dizzy and physically weak. I was legit scared and embarrassed. Embarrassed not so much because my wife saw this, but because I had been making so much progress with my therapist, but still chose to restrict. I should have known better. I do know better, but my ED took complete control of wheel this week. I guess I’m just writing this as a cautionary tale for you all.

41,Telling people that it's impossible to recover without gaining lots of weight,59,11irr3u,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11irr3u/telling_people_that_its_impossible_to_recover/,12,"I woke up to a Twitter post from a certain fat positive/HAES ED therapist with a lot of followers that has me concerned and sad. She claims that health professionals who treat EDs as well as obesity are part of the problem, and the proof is that she is the fattest she's ever been and the most recovered/healthy she's ever been, and posted a photo - sure enough, she has gotten very big, even just compared to her profile photo. 

While I'm glad this person feels so far along in her recovery, I can't help but feel like this position is so dangerous for its intended audience, especially for those of us (e.g. me) who are genetically predisposed to being obese/overweight when we aren't engaging in ED behaviors. 

If maintaining a normal BMI is impossible without being in the throes of an ED, and fully recovering is impossible without packing on as much weight as my genes/environment will have me do without intentional intervention on my part, how is that supposed to make recovery appealing? Why tell people that the middle ground does not exist, that it's impossible to have a healthy relationship while also maintaining a normal weight?

Maybe it's my relapse talking, but I was personally super triggered by the post simply because I am so afraid of ending up at my highest weight, no matter how much ""food freedom"" I can have. The possibility of recovering to become healthy is the only thing that makes me *want* to recover, so I wish people would stop saying that it's impossible... that shit is not helping anyone.

Including horrible feelings and struggles about ""femininity"" and body parts that in my eyes portrayed something that I didn't want them to portray. It's literally an illness.

there are a plethora of criticisms that could be directed toward online ed spaces that should be made and discussed, but these sorts of posts/comments/threads almost never revolve around them. it's like these people see eds as a moral failing instead of a mental and use their warped, uneducated views as an excuse to be shitty to people they don't understand. it hits me very much as rebranded ableism with an added superiority complex.",1677994924.0

I did a post yesterday but I think it was too long so here's a shorter version. I have ARFID so I am no stranger to disordered eating. I am trans so I am also no stranger to body issues and dysphoria/dysmorphia.

I started transitioning four months ago, at that point I started a significantly restrictive diet. Ive lost 65 pounds in that time, gone from obese into currently overweight. I've felt amazing doing this, I've loved losing weight and I've really enjoyed restricting my eating. I started at 1200 calories, down to 1000 and just started 800, I'm 6'3. I know that's unhealthy but to be perfectly honest I haven't really cared. I've viewed it as a challenge and sort of a game, how consistent and dedicated can I be? How far can I go? I've never had a large appetite so it's been rather easy, and since going on Adderall and Wellbutrin that's only compounded that fact.

In my mind I plan on getting to a pretty low weight, still plan to lose 40 pounds, and I feel like I'm completely in control of this. I feel like once I reach my goal I will be able to just go back to a maintenance diet. Due to how weight redistribution works on HRT I actually plan to gain 15-20 pounds from my lowest weight up to my long term target. I'm starting to realize this may be dangerous, but I don't want to stop. I like what I'm doing and I like the results I'm getting from it. I feel like my weight loss is actually keeping my dysphoria under control currently, if I started losing slower Im scare it might make my dysphoria worse.

Yeah so, can anyone relate to where I am right now? Am I at risk of developing another Eating Disorder? I feel like I'm not, I feel like I'm in complete control of this. But I decided I wanted to seek out some opinions of this, what would you recommend? I know I should probably be losing weight at a healthier pace, but I just don't want to to be honest. I absolutely don't want another Eating Disorder, the first is hard enough, but I don't know what else to do.",1678078322.0

I went to my synagogue yesterday and a woman who hasn’t seen me in 3 months sees me and immediately starts making comments on my weight loss. The first time it was flattering but then it became all that she could talk about. Every time there was a slight break in the prayers she would say “you look so much slimmer! It’s made you look so much younger too! Your face is a completely different shape!” Everyone in the women’s section was feeling awkward about it. 

Afterwards my SO drops the bomb on me that his brother and his wife are visiting our city for 2 months and are arriving tomorrow. His brother’s wife is a fitness and lifestyle influencer. She was featured in one of those Chloe Ting results videos. On top of that his mum, who hates me, is coming at the end of April. She’s called me awful things in the past and I want to make sure she has zero ammunition. 

So now I feel like I have to put my recovery on hold because in my mind I’m still huge and that means I look older than I am. I have to compete with an influencer (MIL adores her btw) and also not let MIL completely destroy my self esteem. So basically I gotta lose >!15lbs!< in 5 weeks to feel safe.

ETA: To emphasise how much my MIL dislikes me, nobody is my SO’s family wished my happy birthday. Nobody. I wish them all a happy birthday but I’m perceived as such an antagonist they didn’t bother.",1678039563.0

 When we were young I was scared to eat too much or too quickly because I was worried my mom would think I was being a pig, and she would tell me about how she used to only weigh XXX pounds. She was always on some diet, from women's world magazine, and would encourage us to diet. She would poke us in the stomach and tell us to suck it in. As an adult it's easy how she had issues with food and body image that she projected onto us.

My grandmother is the same way. She was always slender as long as I've known her, but was in something like weight watchers until she was 90. There were days she would refuse to sit down because she wanted to be down a pound before her meeting. I can see where my mom's issues with food came from.

I imagine when guys have their growth spurts it must be so hard to deal with numbers going up because they're getting taller. or when puberty is causing them to grow in general.

And im not just talking about puberty. I feel so much sympathy for pregnant people with EDs. it must be so hard to see your body change involuntarily and if you try to change it (the unhealthy way ™ ) then you might hurt your baby. I'd want to have kids but I cant get past the idea that, genetically, the pregnant women in my family gain quite a bit of baby weight :(

Or even when you get on new meds and you know your body is going to change because of side effects. Many birth control meds and some seizure meds cause your body to change and sometimes theyre meds that are NEEDED and you cant do anything about it. I hear HRT has side effects that are tough to deal with too.

I just am both physically and mentally tired. The solution is objectively simple: to eat food. Yet for some reason my brain is messed up, so I can’t. I don’t want to eat more, I don’t want to gain weight.

It's not good and I know that, but it's kind of forcing me to increase my intake and I can't help feeling like that's a positive thing, even though I know I'm probably on the path to a full blown exercise addiction.

I know this isn't sustainable, I noticed a difference when I went to train on Wednesday night and again yesterday morning, the pole is way more painful than it used to be because there's less fat than there usually is.

I've relapsed recently and started secretly weighing out my food and counting calories because it brings me the feeling of comfort my life is lacking rn. The moment I log them, however, I seem to lose the ability to enjoy my meal properly??? Like, instead of appreciating the taste & texture, all I'm focused on are stupid numbers??? It's like eating cardboard??? And then I'm left completely unsatisfied and sooo stressed, as if I haven't just eaten.
Today I ate THE SAME EXACT PORTION of whatever safe food I be eating for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every single day... The only difference is, I decided not to log the calories this time as it's really exhausting... I've finally felt relieved for the first time this week, and I've actually enjoyed my meal?? And now I feel completely satisfied?? Don't get me wrong, I'm still waiting for the next meal to come bc I'm a food obsessed malnourished bitch, but at least I don't feel this urge to eat again one hour later...

hiding the spoilers because I don't want to hurt anyone. For a bit of context I'm 17 female, I have been struggling with this shit for about a year and it started because I put on a third of my bodyweight due to a medication. 

After starving for a while I got to >!48kg!<. It's not that little I know, but for my height it's slightly underweight, something like bmi >!17.4!<. I got really sick, I constantly had headaches, couldn't focus in school, lost my period etc.
I talked to my therapist and she convinced me somehow to stop counting calories and just eat, I thought I wouldn't gain much weight. Well now, after a month of extreme hunger, which has now faded almost completely, I'm at >!52kg!<, bmi >!18.9!<.
I haven't gone a day without crying about it in the last three weeks. Right now I have puffy eyes from last night, and I'm already crying again.

So I think I'm relapsing worse than before. I gave recovery a shot partly because I was scared my therapist was going to break confidentiality ad tell someone if I didn't, so I can't tell her I'm relapsing. I hope she forgets about it all so I can starve myself in peace.

Each BMI bracket you reach is like a medal of honor and you feel more 'accomplished' the lower you go. But that feeling of 'oh, I'll recover when I get to x weight' is bullshit.

Because I got to my ugw, I got to this number I've been chasing for literal years, and now I *can't* get help because IP deems me as too low. That's what they said over the phone. I've been trying to get admitted for two? months now, and after constant back and forth jerking me around, they told me that they just can't help me. And unfortunately because I'm on government insurance because yknow, the ol' Ed won't let me hold a job, that was my only option for treatment. No one else wants to work with me either because I'm too sick. 

So I get to this ungodly low weight and WANT help for the first time but can't get it because what I thought would make me a perfect little anorexic has actually bit me in the ass.

So, don't be like me. Don't chase that number. Get help the second you have that spark.

You can be a normal weight and restricting a lot, or a low weight and be eating a lot but still losing weight due to other reasons. I have been my mentally sickest at my highest weights, and ate the least at them too.

It's great that the sentiment of weight not being an indicator of severity is going around, but it's not actually put into practice. The guidelines for anorexia themselves are based on BMI (mild, moderate, severe). At Patient First last month I was at the very tail end, literally one pound, underweight. According to BMI charts I didn't have anorexia at all. This caused me to quickly drop weight and now I'm back in the loop of losing and gaining.

One time I visited a new PCP and I told her about how well my recovery was going. She seemed pleased until she weighed me, then her entire demeanor changed and she acted like I was seeking meds for weight  loss & I felt like a criminal. Recently I went off ADHD meds for a while and my impulsive eating due to depression & ADHD was terrible. I gained \~5-10 pounds, but doctors don't care about that at all because, hey, her BMI is good! Like, sir...actually that weight gain was UNHEALTHY for me because it was due to uncontrolled mental illness & I was not engaging in healthy behaviors.

I truly believe my weight is not relevant & no one needs to know, not even myself. I can tell when I'm losing weight based on other factors so I have not once needed to know my exact pounds. They don't either. I am so sick of this guideline & I wish medical research kept up with the fucking times & listened to us/the organizations that promote this concept.

Lastly, next time I go to my ENT I am absolutely not being weighed. You don't need to know my weight to see how my ears are doing...ridiculous.

""yes but I don't eat out much""

""Yeah I see that.....Your a very fit one. Living Your best self?""

I am not trying to honour an aesthetic. I am maintaining a commitment to a long held act of atonement. 

It was an arc. 

My adolescence created a vulgar obesity. 

The freedom of my adult years created the precise nature of anorexia. 

The arrival at my midpoint of my life became the chaotic application of bulimia cured only by a complete embrace of drunkoroxia. 

""Are You OK.""

""yeah yeah of course just trying to guess Your age, I couldn't tell by Your face.""

39 is a very long time to sustain the ability to slowly alternate a lateral parallel to a rise and fall from an orbit. 

15 years, I can count it. 

15 long years I have been faithful but not always loyal to my eating disorder. 

""its my birthday, I am 39 years old today."" 

I celebrate my birthdays so as to complete the vindictive illusion nothing is wrong. Hence no one takes the opportunity to interfere with the successful progress of hungers process. 

""Would You like a desert....we have a menu or something special on Your birthday""

I politely rise and focus my eyes. Raise my eyebrows with a sense of defeat. Finding some honesty I replied.......

""my desert is usually a cup of Tea. Black no sugar, no milk."" 

Truthfully no Kcals no shame. 

""that’s not really a desert....oh my are You OK Your eyes seem so......sad."" 

She nervously laughed and I extended a simple explanation.

""Green eyes have a certain dispassionate abstract neutrality. Neither blue or green."" 

I lifted both corners of my mouth with the reassuring nature of Judas. 

Watching her cheeks rise and posture relax, I know I am safe again. 

I collect the fork, the knife and finally the napkin, rubbing the grease from my hands. Which fills me with an evocative thought “did I lose control or did I facilitate the action of hunger.” 

I leave the table. Releasing a sense of fear which allows Me to become aware of the action of placing two notes upon the table. 

I sit in the snug and look out at the bar. 

Reflecting on the many faces and instances of human contact I lost in the fire. 

My motor functions slow. 

My sense of recall fails. I need to restrict and grow my hunger. 

I decline a taxi, choosing to walk the long way home that brings Me far from my destination. 

Book marking the sense of efficiency by which this THING, my eating disorder functions to a read only memory of shame, regret and finally loss. 

Celebrating the operating system that created the code which will erode the necessary hardware.",1677973985.0

I was thrown out of the hospital and she spent the next 8 months watching my weight go up and down and up again as I continued to struggle with the recovery relapse cycle.

Now I'm finally recovered, she had been binge eating throughout those 8 months and decided now that I wasn't restricting anymore she could lose the weight she gained and more without being too insensitive.
But it's INCREDIBLY triggering, my recovery is in the ""just learning to walk"" stage.

And she is so anorexicly persuaded, she is very overweight but her dream weight is extremely underweight and she eats WAYYYY too little calories.

She looks at thinspo and when I beg her to lose weight healthily she says she can't because she needs to lose it as quickly as possible.

She has a breakdown crying session when she gains 100gram, says ""nothing tastes as good as skinny feels"", keeps getting really down about not being a ""good"" anorexic and always lists the traits she has that make her a ""bad"" anorexic. I want to shake her and scream at her that I had all the same traits but obviously I try to comfort her instead.

She is fixated on the idea that when she is skinny she will be happy and we all know where that ended us up.

I can't handle on the diet foods in the house, how she weighs out everything she eats, how she is on her calorie tracking app 24/7 and how I feel her eyes on me every time I make myself something.

The replies here have been really eye opening to me. I made this post originally to vent about the triggering comments my SO had made, but as many of you have pointed out those comments are the tip of the iceberg. I been keeping a list of all the times he has hurt me (emotionally) due to his binge drinking since the baby has been born. If you’re keeping a list like that, you already know your relationship is not one you should be in, but I guess I’ve been in denial. 


I am scared of all the uncertainty I will have to encounter when I finally face the truth. It’s not as simple as leave him when I don’t have a job or any stable family members. We also moved states for his job and I have no friends here. I have my own car and access to cash but man leaving with just that and a baby seems so drastic. 


I will talk to my therapist at my appointment next week. I haven’t told her the extent of what’s happening. She is a social worker so I think she will be able to help me. Thank you to each and every one of you who have commented. This group is for ED support but many of you went above and beyond for me and I truly appreciate that.

ORIGINAL POST:

Background: I gained a lot of weight while pregnant. I gave birth 11 months ago. I am still working on getting from an overweight back to a normal BMI. I thought I had repaired my relationship with food and was giving myself time to do it the healthy way. But lately idk man.


First, he took an unflattering picture of me eating a cupcake while pregnant. Said: “I’m going to save this and send it to you to encourage you to walk more”


In response to me saying I don’t have any time to work out anymore while taking care of our newborn: “just wake up at 4am and work out before he wakes up. If you really wanted it, that’s what you’d do”


In response to me feeling happy about the results of my personal training sessions and positive about my body for the first time in a while after having our baby: “how much did you spend on that again? Oh, you could have bought us a nice home gym with that money if you were willing to just work out on your own” 


And finally, while watching me eating trail mix, which was the first thing I’d had the time to eat all day: “you know you don’t have to eat the entire bag, really looks like you’re making a good effort to though”

I’m currently heavier than I’ve ever been and I cannot stop eating.

Went to my doctor and she wants me to call some places and organise a psychologist & dietician but I just can’t bring myself to pick up the phone and do it.
I feel like it’s because I know how to lose weight, I know all about nutrition, it’s just I won’t stick to it and I find it impossible.

Any time you use your abs, you are engaging your pelvic floor whether you realize it or not. And no, unfortunately this doesn't mean that you'll have a super strong resilient pelvic floor as a result. Having too tense of a pelvic floor can do as much damage as having a weak one. Take a deep breath, relax your abs, let that belly out, and release the tension in your pelvic floor. Do this daily. Do it as regularly as Kegels. It will benefit you, I promise.

The weight they want me to be at is much higher than I’m comfortable with. I’m not saying I want to be at my lowest weight because I know that wasn’t healthy, but why do I have to intentionally gain weight beyond that? Like if I’m not gaining enough, they’ll increase my meal plan, which seems silly to me. Im at a healthy weight right now, and im comfortable with my current weight. It’s a weight I feel I could recover long term at. However, the higher weight makes me feel like I’ll just relapse. 
I understand part of recovery is breaking the need to control your weight and accept what your body needs, but I’ve already relinquished control by accepting that I can’t be at my lowest weight and gaining weight to be healthier. It just doesn’t make sense to me to push me into a more vulnerable state when it’s not necessary. Also, before anyone asks, it’s not related to medical issues as at my current weight, all prior issues have 
resolved. 
I have recovered before on my own and didn’t force myself to get up to a certain weight. I just started eating enough and giving my body what it needed, and I do gain when I recover on my own, but not to the point that they want me to. And that’s a big part of why I feel I’m more successful in recovery on my own because I don’t tend to relapse. I don’t know, maybe I’m missing something?",1677881115.0

I  can't even confront her about it. My parents are old asians and they will definitely blame me for skipping meals. They will never try to understand my Ed and will probably just tell me to eat💀 like that will fix anything. I'm even more disappointed today. What the hell can I even do now?

what really bothers me is when my sister does it. i think it's for two reasons really, the first being that her comments are typically more... overt i guess? she also comments way more frequently than my parents. the second is that i just don't expect this kind of stuff from her. she always says we're so close, but then she turns around and does something like this, and makes me wonder (not to be all angsty lmao) how much she really understands about me. i tried to get her to stop once, and was pretty firm about it, but she got really upset and started crying, at which point i just felt so guilty. she stopped for a little while but restarted pretty soon. obviously she doesn't understand the full reason behind it, but i just still think she should know better than to constantly comment on someone's body. my parents also took her side when they found out why we were arguing, and kind of just gave me a ""she's older and knows better than you"" lecture.

my family is also definitely a ""clean your plate no matter how full you are"" kind of household. they don't really emphasize exercise and fitness, and especially my parents' health could be better. can't really say i'm doing a great job in the health department either though lmao, but i am normal weight, so for them to be calling me too skinny all the time is definitely influenced by their perspective.

Heyo. Long rant/story soz. Started recovery in January. It’s not been linear but I’ve been feeling so good and proud about it. My therapist gave me the option to weigh myself as we go to prove that eating more regularly won’t make me gain weight currently (leaving a restrict/binge cycle).

She said I could either not do it, do it and not look at the result or do it and look. I opted for the latter. I was presently surprised to see the first 3 weeks I maintained despite eating what felt like more. These past 2 weeks I’ve steadily lost too much weight. She was a bit worried, asked if I’d increased my restricting (I really thought I hadn’t) and adjusted my plan. I was completely thrown and so upset that my hard work wasn’t working and sad to see her worried (lol). I was also already having a bad day because my pants had started getting so loose they were falling down that day 😅🥲.

Anyway naturally I went home and binged. And then had a pretty out of control meal the next night too. I was so much happier knowing I was meeting tangible goals: regular meals, more calories, less binging. I think I want to ask to stop weighing but I’m scared she’ll think I’m trying to hide weight loss or something.

Obviously it’s a tool to help her and me know how I’m going but I don’t think it’s worth it at the cost of me spiraling. I was happier being blissfully unaware I was losing. For context I’ve proudly not used scales myself for a few years now after previously using them several times a day and basing so many goals around weight numbers. I pretty much don’t care about numbers anymore, it was the feeling of failing in my recovery and letting her/me down that made me spiral.

I don't even enjoy it because it's compulsive behavior.
The most I think about restricting myself, the biggest is my urge to binge

I've been gaining a lot of weight that no exercise is able to shed off
I do exercise but it's not enough
I need to stop eating

A doctor I saw years ago gave me topiramate and it worked LIKE A CHARM for all my compulsive behavior and excessive appetite, however, it stopped working after years of using it daily.

Even if I tell doctors about my body dysmorphia and how I HATE being fat, how it triggers my depression and suicidal issues, they won't listen to me because I'm not obese.

I've tried ephedrine and it makes me feel awful.

I have another appointment with my doctor on 8th and I don't know if he's going to help me or say ""I won't prescribe you appetite inhibitors/weight loss medicine, because you're not even obese""

So basically they will wait until I'm obese to solve my problem?

I don’t listen to the thoughts, I move past them, but the thoughts I’ve gotten now, post-braces, are definitely making me a little worried.  

When braces were last suggested for me to get, it was when I first started recovery and we said no cause we didn’t want it to affect me food wise and honestly, I’m worried it might be the case now.

I've always known that she struggles with depression. I do as well. However, I can't pretend to actually understand how she feels or what it's like to struggle the way that she does.

&#x200B;

I have been trying to do as much research on anorexia as I can. She's actively trying to recover (sort of), she has been for a long time. I understand that it's incomprehensibly difficult to overcome. I know that I would never have the strength to continue on in her shoes, and I've told her as much. I don't know if that was a poor thing to say.

I know that she's on-and-off about wanting to get help. I know that her family is trying to help. I avoid any conversations that might be triggering, I've never and never will comment on her body, I'm trying to learn to cook so that if I'm ever over maybe I could figure out something that she'd like.

&#x200B;

She has expressed to me that she has BPD. Our friendship is weird, and it's always been hinting at something more, I just never pushed it that direction because I don't think she's in the place for that right now. I also don't want to rush into that and lose her, I'd rather stay friends so I can know her until forever. I worry that she thinks that's why I talk to her, and that maybe that's changed her openness with me. I'm not going to let it go any further, at least for now, because neither of us are stable enough for that to be good for anyone. Not the point or my focus just wanted to note it.

&#x200B;

Recently she explained to me that she wasn't getting better, and that she felt very, very, very depressed. I don't know if she's felt this hopeless the whole time, and she just opened up about it finally, or if she has truly hit a wall. Either way, I know that she's at a point where everything is difficult.

She's said to me before that when she gets ""extra"" depressed, she tends to push everyone away. I'm watching it happen now. To my knowledge, she has barely been communicating with anyone, this includes me. I know that I cannot fix anything. I probably can't even make it that much easier. But I really want to try.

I've expressed to her numerous times that I won't pester her endlessly if she truly doesn't feel like she has the energy to talk to anyone. But, I've also expressed my worry that if she doesn't try to overcome that lack of energy, that she's going to feel worse.

&#x200B;

**Here is one of MY biggest issues:** I am the most insecure person. I'm insecure about every facet of my life. This includes our friendship. I am trying my best to not take everything so personally, but when she goes completely silent for ages, I freak out. I tend to not say anything about it because I don't want to feel worse. However, I've unfortunately expressed it a few times and I worry that doing that has caused her guilt and that now she's going to push me away more.

I know this is something I need to work through personally. Sometimes I end up withdrawing because I feel like I'm just bothering her and making everything worse. Sometimes she'll speak up and I'll feel reassured, but it's always momentary and then I feel like shit again. I know it's not fair to complain, but I'm coming from a place of not wanting to make her feel worse.

&#x200B;

I really wish I knew how to help her. I know I just need to offer up that I'm there when she feels ready to talk. I've tried to get her to call or hangout or go on walks, sometimes she'll say she wants to and then go silent when the time comes. Sometimes she'll even ask for those things and then go silent.

I've told her that we don't have to talk about the serious stuff if it's making her feel worse. I've got a whole list of things to talk about that I know would make her laugh.

I've told her that we can talk about the serious stuff too. I'll listen and I won't even say anything if she doesn't want me to.

I've told her she's not going to hurt my feelings or burden me if she is distant. I've said that I won't let her push me away (unless she actually wants to obviously). But then I get all insecure and prove the exact opposite to her.

I've bought a bunch of gifts for when I see her.

I've talked to my therapist about it.

&#x200B;

I guess this isn't very coherent and I'm doing the bare minimum as a friend here.

The main points are just that I want to help her however she needs or wants me to help.

I'm trying not to be take it personally when she's distant.

&#x200B;

I know that I don't understand her conditions but I'm trying to learn as much as I can.

I know that I can't push her to recover from her ED in any way. I just want to be there along the way so she has someone if she needs anything. I want to know what I can do to help or not make things worse.

I know that she's going to push me and others away. I might not know her exact reasons why. I want to understand how I can gently try to get her to talk without being overbearing and making her feel worse.

&#x200B;

She's already getting help from professionals and doctors. However, I want to know how to get her to accept that help a little more, she seems so indecisive about wanting to get better (which I know is the ED talking) and I just want to help her feel like getting better is the right path.

&#x200B;

I don't want her to feel hopeless. I know that her struggles govern such a large amount of her life. I'm curious if you think I should try to be a sense of normalcy and talk about everything but those problems, or if I should try to find the balance between normalcy and being there for the serious talks.

&#x200B;

I know that I need to take care of myself while helping her. I'm trying to branch out a little more socially because I was definitely a bit dependent. I have hobbies and a therapist. I'm going to be fine.

&#x200B;

I'm sorry if this makes no sense. I'm very tired and I just don't know what to do.

&#x200B;

Edit cause I think maybe it's helpful to know:

When she was in residential, we would call every day. It was brief, but I think I'm going to try to get her to continue that habit now. They don't even have to be as long of calls as they were then. I just think checking in or talking about insignificant stuff might be helpful. Let me know if that's a bad idea.",1677860413.0

its been about 6 months since my relapse and I've just been eating basically non stop. I gained weight yet I'm still fucking starving mentally and sometimes physically too, every second of my day is consumed by a thought of food my body or something related to those two all while I am eating and still gaining weight

ive made my meals more consistent, I've eaten to my cravings I've had larger meals and yet I still feel the need to open and finish every container, I ate a load of bread all thorough my relapse and the obsession has never gone away since the first time I was recovering and it's still very much here

I'm not asking when I can restrict again I'm asking when I can feel fucking okay again, constant conflicting thoughts of I'm eating so much (probably >!4 to 6k calories a day!<) and I need to eat to finally get rid of these thoughts but they never leave

I'm feeling like I'm just eating because I'm bored and want flavour and something to chew and swallow and to attempt to fix other problems by deluding myself that everything stems from my eating disorder. I eat so much and I'm still obsessed with the same stuff

my diet soda addiction barely ever tapered down I still have constant thoughts around food and my body and I just feel miserable. I gained weight in hopes that I can live my life again but I feel just as mentally horrible as before. A part of me likes eating all of the food and some people say it's normal for a male teenager my age but it feels so abnormal. I can't man idfk anymore

and probably the worse but nmost niche is that I still have no social life. I can barely stand being outside with people I'm not extremely comfortabkr with longer than 8 pm because I just want to be at home sleeping or eating. im an actual anti social hermit it's so fucking sad telling people no when they invite me to places not because there will be food but because I feel like I need to be home by 8 to be at peace.

In 2020, I was at the height of my restrictive ED. I had gotten down to >!120lbs at 5’6!<I know it’s not technically UW but looking back on photos, I was SO thin and looked malnourished. I always had people trying to make me eat food, and several people commented on me being “too skinny.” I have never been into exercise so this was a result of pure restriction. I maintained this weight for about a year. 

Over the past two years, I have been rapidly gaining weight to the point where it makes me question if I ever had a “real” eating disorder, because the old me would melt if they saw the weight I’m at now. Feels like I just went straight from restricting to binging. For about a year, I thought “this is okay because I’m recovering! Weight gain isn’t bad!” I am now >!195lbs and I feel so ashamed and disgusted with myself.

I really want to lose weight but it doesn’t feel like there’s a healthy medium for me. I try to restrict to “x calories” a day and then my partner will tell me I need to eat something. And then once I have eaten I just think “well you’ve already gone over your calories for the day so you might as well eat anything you want.” So it’s either restrict all day, or binge all day.

I’m super curious what you guys think about his cheating. He cheated by watching and engaging with porn/creators. We agreed porn was cheating at the beginning of our relationship two years ago. I expressed countless times my concerns that if I wasn’t intimate with him x amount of times a week/month he would revert to porn, he said he didn’t. When I asked if he was using porn, he said he wasn’t. I expressed how insecure porn made me feel, and that I wanted to be perfect and enough for him. He stated multiple times he would never do anything to jeopardize our relationship, but look now lol. 

His main searches were for transporn, super muscular woman/doninatrix types, bdsm, and he was following a recovering anorexic with an onlyfans/more sexual account on Twitter. Her ribs look like mine smfh. I feel like his only way to relate to me was through porn, and I’m just trying to understand the psychology of it and his choices. 

I found out he also excessively used porn in his last relationship and found the usual normal porn, as well as transporn, some bdsm themes, and bestiality 🤮

So, I know he was never into super skinny/anorexic girls now, I’m curious why he was engaging with her in particular? He engaged in social media banter with her and it’s so hurtful. 

He is a big guy, around BMI >!42-44!<whereas I’m closer to >!17.5!<

She morally berates me for being a horrible person while I'm here struggling to fucking eat at all today. So then I yell back at her.

She felt so hopeless and trapped, the medical system would not leave her be, they would come to her house at random and weigh her, and if she was losing weight they would admit her to a hospital. Sometimes once a month. She felt trapped and hopeless, all she wanted is to live on her own terms, but nobody allowed her to. She even moved to another city to escape it, it did nothing. Eventually it all took her from us.

I feel so guilty, i feel like i could have done so much more, i should have been there for her the last few days before she passed, but i wasnt, i didnt utter a word, i didnt know i really didnt, i wish she came to me, but she didnt.

Her last messages to me were about her feeling trapped, she was scared she'll get admitted and tube fed again, and im guessing thats what pushed her to do it.

She was only 18, she deserved so much better.

What should I do? eat like I normally would or try and save the week?

she needs someone to talk to that isnt going to try to fix her. she feels super ashamed every time i shut her down and say i cant talk about it and then i feel awful as a partner. 

i don’t want to leave. we’re in couples counseling and I have my own therapist but she just had to switch so she hasn’t gotten set up with a new individual therapist yet. idk how to keep myself emotionally safe without essentially cutting her off from talking about her shit entirely and idk how to do that without triggering her and making her feel ashamed and alone.

Even though I have restrictive thoughts about food, regardless of how I start my day, I always find myself going to sleep having eaten a normal amount (or sometimes too much) of food. Sometimes I eat a lot at night, sometimes I eat something calorie dense, etc. And I don’t compensate by exercising, purging,  or anything. I don’t even feel that guilty about things anymore. I do think I actively restrict, but maybe not much more than someone on a light diet. And I’m not very successful as I’ve described. I feel uncomfortable in my body but I think my dysphoria is out the roof considering I’m constantly bloated/constipated. 

I have always felt like an imposter - many people do - but now I really feel as if I’ve just recovered. As if I lost a battle to my body’s protective instinct. I just wish that if it has to be this way, I would at least also be able to also lose the constant thoughts about food and the desire to restrict over and over again. And, the worst part is, my depression is much worse than when I was restricting “successfully”. Isn’t that kind of fucked?

And I've been trying all the usual tricks and remedies to flush the excess water out, like staying hydrated, managing my salt consumption, and upping my protein, but nothing seems to be working and I'm starting to get scared. I do still menstruate but my weight fluctuations these last few cycles haven't followed the pattern they used to before I made these lifestyle changes, and I'm not hardcore exercising enough to be putting on this much water weight or increasing my muscle mass.

Then my asshole therapist (who has low-key been ghosting me since I attempted suicide 5 months ago) booked me in for an appointment with only a few days notice (from an automated system message too!) even though as far as she’s aware I’m on the other side of the country rn. Then my sister decided to stay for a few more nights (actually quite nice but it means that I’ll have to share my bedroom and won’t have my own space for even longer than I’d expected). 

So all this accumulated into an emotionally-driven binge. I stopped myself multiple times during the binge (also an accomplishment!!) but still continued to binge. And then I purged (but only a little bit to take the edge off of the nausea, not to get rid of the calories, so also a tiny accomplishment). 

This morning, I didn’t fast or compulsively exercise to counteract the binge. I just acted like it didn’t happen and kept with what I’ve been doing for the rest of the week. And it’s … okay? I’m more snackish than usual (and I’m holding myself back from snacking because that spirals into a binge quickly), but I haven’t had major binge urges. 

So yeah. I’m hopeful that this quasi-recovery attempt will stick this time :)))",1677761740.0

And *unacceptable* if I’m not. I’ve noticed that whenever I am above that weight, I feel as though things are just that — unacceptable — and I have no mental clarity, which results in dissociation. I also have some sort of psychosis sometimes, and I’ve noticed that this is prevalent when I am discontent with my weight. Like, I actually become psychotic, whether that manifests as seeing and hearing things, or just not trusting those around me, not trusting my own actions, not recognizing myself, etc. To be clear, the line between dissociation and psychosis is very blurred for me, and my psychosis tends to be quite mild.

Anyway, I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this — a deep mistrust in your perception of the world/trouble distinguishing reality from your mind when you are discontent with your weight? I assume it’s a combination my eating disorder trying to isolate me and make me feel as though I will suffer tangible effects if I’m not underweight, and my own inability to cope with discomfort.

**it was when i was watching a documentary on the average americans eco footprint. scenes cut to third worlders with children picking rice(i cant perfectly remember) on a farm esentially saying that these people make stuff that hurt them then the food is shipped from over seas in order for americans to eat which in turn gives americans cancer because of pesticide used to preserve the food and gives the people who grow that very food problems in their dna. i think i have some type of undiagnosed orthorexia, but not in the way where i have to eat gmo free things. it goes as far as not eating something that was harming another human being. i cant bare eating things/ get obsessively frantic thinking of ingesting food that slaves or forced laborores made. i know its a real thing and i have known about it since 13 years ago because i saw it on tv. there are people right now being forced to pick food sold in stores i can walk to. i just feel incredibly privileged and the very same person who made the food for me probably died of starvation the next day. i have lost weight, my stomach hurts, i can barely drink tap water.**

&#x200B;

when i do make this type of post on reddit or look for support online its incredibly difficult to get support. nobody else really relates. But when I have made this exact post last time here, someone did say they felt similarly. it was just one person though. one person out of maybe dozens who have told me im very very different from others since having this ""problem"" is not common to the group. if you check my profile history you may see i am active everywhere and have been told im ""obsessive"". I am clearly obsessive, because I'm stressed out about 4 different things...

Hey all!

I get that asking for positive experiences with inpatient treatment is an oxymoron, but here goes...

So - I'm looking into inpatient/residential treatment. I had a - not to be dramatic - but let's call it an incredibly traumatising experience at the Eating Recovery Center in Plano last year. This time around I really want to do more research and choose somewhere that is not going to be quite so awful.

I mean, I get that treatment is a pretty miserable experience. I DO. But I also feel like I was gaslit, maltreated, and bullied by staff. As soon as I came out I fell into the worst relapse of my life and I'm currently a few steps below rock bottom. I know that I need help, but I'm so wary of placing myself in a situation like that again.

I'm 34, so I'm no spring chicken. I understand ED treatment is necessarily a somewhat infantilising experience but I'd like to have some ability to advocate for myself and not be totally shut down, dismissed and invalidated at every turn. ESPECIALLY BY MY FUCKING THERAPIST. She made me feel like I was the worst person in the world and hey... maybe I am! I sure feel that way. But isn't therapy supposed to help with that?!

Sure enough she actually began to lose weight somewhat effortlessly while I struggled counting calories and exercising, just to binge the next day. She would drink Starbucks or Dunkin and maybe have one meal and that’s it and the weight was falling off of her. Not to mention she is blessed with a banging body so her “overweight” looked good on her either way with the weight going to the right places. while I was a blubbery, manly built POS who would constantly get acne and lose hair while attempting to the drop the weight. And I’d be okay with being this weight if I wasn’t purging anymore, but restricting and purging and still gaining has to be my worst nightmare. 

Now I can’t even stand the thought of hanging out with her anymore knowing she was able to lose the weight while I struggled all these months just to end up gaining 5 more pounds.

Perhaps these past 3 years of b/p and loosing a ton and gaining has really put my body on its last straw.

I don't usually post here but I think i need help and support.
I développed anorexia in 2020 and got hospitalized for three months because of my extremely dangerous weight and unliving intentions. 
By far worst three months of my life. Psychological torture. I was brainwashed into thinking I was a horrible attention seeking narcissistic person who hated her parents. I know you can't tell from this post but I have been heavily bullied and I'm very introverted and shy, so this took a huge blow on my self-esteem. Also, my parents are incredibly supportive and love me more than anything in the world. I came in saying my dad was like my best friend. 

I didnt see sunlight in two months. if I cried I got put on antipsychotics. I do not and never had psychosis. if we refused we would get tied up in a bed from our feet hands stomach and neck and then injected with the medication. all of this not for screaming or anything, just crying. they didn't care if we sh, as long as we were quiet.

 laughing was not allowed either. we were a bunch of depressed teens seeing hundreds of hours go by without even clocks, so we would play ""intelectual"" board games to pass the time. as we should, we would sometimes tell a joke or laugh at something. the nurses would get so angry, telling us we should leave if we were just there to take resources from people who needed them more. that we couldn't be I'll if we smiled. that were not in summer Camp and need to take things more seriously.

My psychiatrist was plain evil. I won't go into further detail but she is the only person in this world I truly hate.

I went of on a rant there, sorry, i needed to get some stuff out. The trauma i experienced has led me to develop plenty of BPD symptoms, according to my current psychiatrist.

Anyways, I've mantained severely underweight since, but just at the limit to not go back there again ever. as soon as I turn 18 in a couple of months, the law states i won't ever have to go back there and I'm so excited to finally feel free. 

the issue is this. my weight has recently plometed because of the shift from bulimia to purgative anorexia. my doctors haven't seen my body but say they trust me not to lose weight, so they're not weighing me. my parents are noticing and are extremely worried and angry.

I know i have to make sure I don't lose more weight, because I'm probably very near the weight I was when last hospitalized, but if I gain weight, i get severely depressed, can't study (this is a very important year in terms of grades where I live), and actively attempt. 

so I don't know how to approach this.
if I tell my doctors the truth, I'm going back. If I get depressed, I'm going back. if I keep losing weight, I'm going back.

I'm very stressed out I would appreciate some words of encouragement and kindness very much, thank u if you made it this far.",1677669425.0
488,How do I reach out to my friend,2,11f0u08,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11f0u08/how_do_i_reach_out_to_my_friend/,1,"Sorry for the misleading tagline, this is going to be long. 
I have no idea what to do. I would never ever ever think of commenting of peoples bodies, eating habits or anything because I've been on both sides of the spectrum and know how damaging it is.  I've had a relatively steady period where I consider myself 'healthy'. 
At least healthier than I can I remember.

 Anyway, I have a very close friend who also struggles and she's getting thinner and being around people of that size makes me so incredibly uncomfortable, I can't look at her, I can't think about her without feeling my stomach turn. I've actually cried and vomited multiple times now just from spending time with her and thinking about it makes it so much worse. I know this isn't about me but I love her so much and I don’t know how to bring it up without sounding like I'm guilt tripping her with my own issues to make her gain weight. I honestly don’t think I can be around her again if I don’t bring this up but we've spoken about her people bringing up their concerns usually makes it worse and now I'm so torn. 

I know it's my problem but I don’t think it would hurt for her to get help, but I know she will see it as someone who doesn't understand anymore because I'm slowly getting better. We were by each other sides for years through this and now I feel like saying anything would seem like talking down.

It feels so stupid, and pointless, and no matter how hard I study, on every assignment or test I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing even if I get a good mark. I was restricting and lost 8lbs over the last two months. My mum caught on to what I was doing this time, so I basically was forced to confess to her two weeks ago. I had last week off school. I was eating somewhat normally again for a week and a half and actually felt good for the most part. I gained half the weight back. I was looking forward to restarting school and trying to keep a positive mindset. Now that school has started again I feel so lost, confused, and helpless.

I cant even binge anymore cause I cant do my day or two restricting afterwards to make up for all those calories. I can't wait till this is over. Im so sick and tired of it. I want to lose weight, so much, I want to look sick, so the outside of me looks like how I am on the inside, sick. Nobody cares about me or my problems.

I’m very new to my workplace (this is my seventh week or something like that). Have struggled with ED myself since my teens, am currently three and a half years into recovery. 

My ED was very bad. I was extremely underweight and did a lot of possibly permanent damage to my body that I can feel today. I know I’d be dead if I had not recovered. I wish someone would have SAID something when I was struggling; no one did. Which leads me to…

Our receptionist is a sweet, beautiful, kind young woman who can’t be more than 22, probably younger. I sit probably 15 feet from the one-toilet women’s room. She has gone in there every day, sometimes a few times, to vomit. She’s quite obviously gagging, hacking and putting the toilet seat up and down for a good 15 minutes at a time. I knew immediately what was happening here, but yesterday it really crushed me for some reason. I went in maybe 15 minutes after she vacated to pee and saw her smeared lipstick on paper towels in the garbage. 

I ended up low key asking a coworker “is someone throwing up in there?” Coworker confirmed and said they all know she had bulimia.  I don’t want to seem like a gossip because I’m not—I didn’t say her name, I just asked if someone was throwing up because I hear a lot of gagging and the coworker filled in the rest. 

It’s A. Extremely triggering for me personally to be RIGHT there and B. Crushing to know that this girl is bulimic and vomiting at work. I’m not close with her, it’s been a short time that I’ve worked here anyway, but as an older (not actually “older”, but older to her) person in recovery, it breaks my heart. 

I know I can’t just walk up to her and ask and offer help. Even if I could I’d probably break down sobbing. I would also feel weird and wrong to bring this to someone’s attention, even though I believe most people can hear what’s going on. I don’t want to do anything to fuck with a person’s already fragile mental state especially when I do understand. I’d imagine it would be extremely hard and awkward for a supervisor to approach this.

Idk, it really triggers the fuck out of me while putting me in a head spin. I don’t know if there’s anything I could do. Calling her out (having a supervisor do so) sounds even worse for her and not at all helpful. It’s difficult to listen to and I feel for her.",1677593306.0

I’m still unsure if I’m just on a disordered diet or have an actual eating disorder. I’m not asking for a diagnosis.

Every time I visit one of the many low calorie, weight loss etc. subreddits, it feels like there’s an elephant in the room. All I can think when people praise the orthorexic recipes or talk about how OMAD or >!1200!< cals a day is the “best decision they’ve ever made” and how they “feel great”, is that it feels like I’m getting scammed. I know that for many people that might be a normal number, but I have no idea how. They act like it’s normal (maybe it is, if you’re not disordered?). At >!1200!< cals a day I feel physically fatigued all the time, I’m always hungry, and I’m not even losing as fast as I was.

My diet would be considered “high restriction” in some ED spaces, which makes me think I’m not trying hard enough, even though the people who tout it as a “lifestyle” act like it’s easy. But restricting makes me miserable.

The biggest reason that I look to ED spaces is that it’s known that this is a problem. There’s no justification or glorifying, it’s well established that this is an illness and that these behaviors are a symptoms, which I find comforting in a way. Does this mean that my behaviors are unhealthy, or am I looking for an excuse? All the super-health CICO-pushing people normalize behaviors that, in the context of this subreddit, are part of an illness, so if I don’t have that illness, I feel like I’m faking it. Do I wish I was sicker, or less sick?

It’s hard to figure out what the “right” way of thinking is when the lines between diet and disorder are so blurred.",1677619775.0

i've never been underweight tho. i oscillate between a like >!5-10!< pound range on the low side of normal weight. and the most normal thing i guess is that i can go weeks at a time without engaging in any restriction or purging. like if i go on a trip, i can just stop for the time. the thoughts never stop, and i'm always bodychecking and all of that, but i'm not actively engaging in any ed behaviors. also, if i feel like anyone irl is catching on ever, i immediately do whatever to make sure they don't suspect anything. occasionally a switch will flip, but even then i only high restrict and again go out of my way to make sure no one irl is suspicious, even if that means eating over my cal limit or something. i was high restricting for a few weeks recently, but just started eating normal cals and purging like twice a day last week.

i’ve always been a very active person and now with a usually restrictive ed i have an exercise addiction it seems. i guess technically i purge through a means of exercise. i also purge through vomiting (started less than a month ago) and laxatives, but i have lately been getting off those and just adding more fiber to my diet which seems to be helping thank the heavens. for reference of where i’m at, i am underweight with a bmi of around >!16.4!< or so, but my weight fluctuates obviously, but not a whole lot. i know those things along with restriction can have an effect on heart rate. 

when i first got my fitbit in 2021, my resting heart rate was in the 70s. i’ve been losing weight since then, but it was more steady. i’d say my weight loss really ramped up from restriction around november and i lost >!10-15 lbs!< quickly and hit a lw of >!94.5 lbs at 5’4”!< less than a month ago and now am usually between >!95-97 lbs!<. i’m trying to maintain because i have people who are on to me and i’m honestly scared to go lower right now. i go through bouts of doing intense cardio almost daily and then i’ll go a week or two where i don’t, but then i’ll go back to doing it because i feel guilty. i always get over >!10k steps!< and i went through a period where i got a lot more than that daily, but i’ve calmed myself down from doing that because i was hurting myself worse by doing so. 

now my resting heart rate is around 46 bpm and hits lows of 38. the last few days i’ve felt a little off. no chest pains or anything, but i feel very foggy and sometimes slightly dizzy. my calves have been hurting so i’ve been trying to eat more and drink electrolyte drinks cause something tells me it’s my electrolytes which is scary. i’m trying hard to not vomit when i eat, but sometimes i feel guilty and do it anyways. i’ve been upping how much i eat but the rate is going lower. 

i am in the medical field and know an active person tends to have a lower resting rate, but i also know i’m sick and it’s never been this low. should i wait and see if eating more helps? or should i be worried at all? part of me honestly doesn’t care but another part does because of the people i love",1677620312.0

Daily headaches, wanting to sleep all the time, brain fog, electrolytes out of whack (tingling in my lips and face especially), heart pains and palpitations, etc. I am starting to lose focus and I *need* to just finish school without collapsing or running out of steam. Of course, every time I consider real recovery my ED gets way worse— it seems quiet until it’s threatened, then I realize how bad it really is.

Anyway, long story short, I need somewhere to start. What are your favorite electrolyte drinks, protein shakes, snacks?

I have never openly said I have an eating disorder to my mother but I skip meals frequently, lost a lot of weight and have suddenly gotten health issues so it’s probably known by now. 

Today she came into my room to talk about an issue to do with her boyfriend and me feeling uncomfortable with him coming around. As talking to her often does, it escalated into talking about our relationship. I brought up how we only talk about her life and she doesn’t know me, and that I don’t want a relationship with her because she’s caused so many issues for me, both long and short term. 

I ended up saying something along the lines of “I’ll never be okay” because of what all the trauma has done to me. She called me dramatic and said I was only a young teenager and I have my whole life ahead of me. I got mad and mentioned my whole relationship with food will be ruined. She denied it, saying i’m just thinking in black and white and I was being ridiculous. 

Maybe I’m overreacting, but it made me feel terrible. I know I’m young however that’s what makes it worse. I may never get to enjoy my birthday cake when i turn 18, or even my wedding cake if i get married. I cant talk or think about food without also thinking about the calories. This eating disorder has made my life terrible for the past 9 months and I’ve not even lost more than 50lbs. I feel like I’m never going to be okay again, and although I’m aware how dramatic and childish I sound, it’s truly how I feel. I don’t know what to do with myself. Sometimes I feel like losing weight is my only purpose and I’m not even good at it, if anything I’ve gained a few pounds.

I have have probably had a variety of eating disorders at this point over the years and i have swayed in and out of slightly normal eating at times

Recently i have been eating quite normally, im not constantly obsessing over food and calories but i still do a bit and still hate my body but i dont think that will change. I have been going to the gym because i want to build muscle in certain areas so that i can then lose fat and keep some muscle and hopefuly hate my body less. Gym membership expires a few days ago and i plan on restarting it i just have no money at the minute but that is the plan

I still feel awful and plan on eating a lot less the days after a binge, i still avoid looking at my body in the mirror a lot and i still do have ed thoughts but no where near as much as when i was worse. I now eat in front of people i dont know too well and i eat during break for class at the canteen. 

If i was just born with a different body type id be happier and hate myself less. Also with different everything else so maybe i am saying i would be happier as another person. But then i wouldnt be me so i guess that doesnt make actual sense. 

Think i feel slightly nostalgic for when i was like 14 and restricting heavily and purging and obsessive even tho i was miserablw because of eating disorder related things and other life things. It just kinda felt good to be doing it i guess maybe the control even though i always thought it was never because of control but i think it was partly now

I have hated myself since i was like 6 or around that age possibly before but i remember looking in the mirror as a small child at my stomach and crying so hard. Makes me kinda sad for little me but i still think if i just had different fat distribution and proportions none of this would be a problem.

i’m not restricting or losing weight rn either - and i’ve been in a very recovered state before (have had an ed for over 10 years now) but still had this preoccupied brain full of food & exercise thoughts.

my doctor is constantly asking me what meds do I want to try? what do i think will work? 

unfortunately, i’ve got very little knowledge of meds that might be helpful past what my friends use/media references. Obviously i have tried googling, finding any that seem relevant, & then giving that list to my doctor, but… still too long of a list! so i thought i’d ask in ur experience what has been good for you!

i need medication for sleep, anxiety, and depression. 

the only side effect i am absolutely against is weight gain.

I currently take propranolol for anxiety (max dose otherwise i’d just get more) & venlafaxine for depression/sleep.

in the past i have tried:
- sertraline (liked it, only swapped bc sleeping pills weren’t working so we tried venlafaxine as a two bird one stone thing). 
- citalopram (meh, i was less depressed but still depressed)
- mirtazipine (i would wake up w killer migraines & gained weight)
- zopiclone
- zolpidem
- amitriptyline
- promethazine hydrochloride  

so

pls recommend anything u hv tried that i haven’t mentioned! especially if there’s a combo that worked well for you!",1677591182.0

At the end of the 2022 I went through really stressing situation at work and took restriction and over exercise further than ever before, eating >!400-800kcal!< and run for an hour 6 times a week. My weight dropped about >!10%!< in couple of months, even though had quite slim NW figure in the beginning. My body started to look too skinny even to my own eye, and I started to avoid mirrors because I didnt want to see my bones sticking from chest, stomach and everywhere.

Went to see doctor because of the cardiac problems and got actually scared of the symptons - low potassium, fainting randomly, takychardia and other stuff. I was told my heart might be already damaged, which is something I take very seriously because of my family history.

I Started to eat more, and during three weeks it went quite good, although under mainteance - and after that time I saw myself from the mirror after doing yoga. My body had much healthier look, my abs were almost showing, I had nice figure again (still considered too skinny, but still much better than before). Even though this was positive thing, I relapsed immediatly day after that - started to restrict, walk forcefully 2-3 hours a day even though denied all exercise, avoiding meals and lying about eating to everyone.

Seems like the skeletal look I didn't even find pretty, was more important to me than I thought, because losing it and adapting healthy slim look makes me relapse immediatly.

I feel so invalid all the fucking time and I hate it so so much I lose weight and some reason my body feels bigger than it was to start with?? Whenever I get compliments I manage to gaslight myself into believing that they’re just saying it out of pity because of how disgusting I look. Not to mention my stress from school because I’m a perfectionist and I have such an extreme fear of failure, so not only am I constantly thinking about ways to burn calories and eat less but I’m also trying to avoid disappointment which is inevitable anyway because I’ll never be good enough for myself.

And on top of all this my friends think im perfectly fine because I refuse to talk about my problems and show emotions to people because I hate the idea of being vulnerable and getting pitied. My friends think im always happy and I have no stress when really all im doing is worrying about my measurements and how much a despise myself. 

And like I said I’ve been getting worse this month and taking it to the extreme and Im fearful but also strangely excited because I know the worse my mental health gets the lower the number in the scale gets. For example; I got surgery on Saturday and used it as an excuse to avoid all foods and drinks that contained calories and I was on the verge of fainting for days that even people I don’t talk to started to stop me and check I was okay because I was as pale as a ghost and could barely walk up the stairs. It got so bad my headteacher even called me for a meeting and told me I should go home but because I’m scared of failing myself at school I  refused 🫠 ended up being made to go to the doctors and they told me my blood sugar was WAY too low and said I have to eat but after I got home I still refused.

Idk I guess it’s just stupid shit like that which I’ve been doing that displays my shitty mental state rn. I feel as thought I’m falling into a rabbit hole of self hatred and danger but I can’t stop doing any of it. 

I mean I’m 15 years old for fucks sake I should be enjoying myself and doing fun things while being care free but I can’t because of this dumb mental illness :/

1. They’re major binge triggers for me 
2. While it will stop me feeling nauseous sick it will end up making me feel lethargic sick
3. if I do eat enough bread/sugar to stop myself from feeling sick I’ll be too full for dinner 


Extra info: this isn’t caused from hunger, whether I haven’t eaten at all yet that day or ate an hour ago I still get it, also eating any other foods doesn’t help - it either has to be super carby or super sugary, and a lot of it.

CW:  weird power dynamic?? i guess

hear me out because I don't know if I'm losing it completely.

so I've been in recovery-ish (or like purposeful weight maintenance rather than loss) since December, going to therapy for other reasons and it's like a long term psychoanalysis situation.

anyway my eating habits come up on occasion but it's rly not why I'm there or the majority of what we talk about. he's probably mid-50's, I'm 27f. 

anyway every time I mention food he gets me to describe in greatly specific detail what I ate, how many times I chewed it, what I was wearing, how it made me feel, and he always always asks if I made myself sick after (purging was never a behaviour I had and I've told him this so I don't know why he still does).

he's also made comments in passing - i.e 'youre a very attractive young woman' (in the context of self esteem so might be normal?) and that he 'can see why men would want to protect' me (in the context of an abusive partner, kinda weird). he'll make offhand comments about my 'air of innocence' a lot. he also asks if I need a hug sometimes after a rough session which never happened in my previous ones?

idk it's rly weird to me?? I've had therapy before but this is a bizarre vibe - he actually is rly good with my other issues so I'm not rly super happy about stopping going. 

my question is - is this normal?? I'm not attracted to him at all so I don't think this is transference, but am I reading way too much into this anyway, and perhaps me being uncomfortable with it is part of the process?",1677449964.0

Once I went to college I slowly stopped purging because I was afraid my new friends would notice. I also went on pills for my mental health. I’ve gained so much weight in the past three years and now… I hate myself. I so desperately want to go back. But I just can’t. Every time I restrict it doesn’t work. I even considered smoking heavily again just to be able to quit again and lose my appetite. I hate myself now. I’ve tried exercising, and eating better. But I never stick to it.

when i relapsed this fall, i stopped going as often, especially as my health and ability to be a person has declined, and more of my time has been devoted to compulsive movement, or rest, or food obsessing, etc. been working on harm reduction but it's been super hard to be consistent. moreso i've been going back and forth between eating more than i'm comfortable with for a few days and then lapsing back into restriction, plus an overall increase in compulsive movement. and to top it off, the grief has been really, really fucking bad this week. 

2 of his regulars and 2 of his coworkers, all of whom i consider friends, came into my work (which is at a pub) this weekend without warning to surprise me and just say hi. neither pair even knew the other was coming, it was just a coincidence that they both came in on the same day, albeit different times. all of them said they missed me, and showed concern about my weight loss, and i ended up telling them i've been struggling with a really bad relapse (only one of them was previously aware). they were all super supportive and kind and just.... reminded me why i'm trying. it was a very, very necessary coincidence. i realized how much i miss feeling like enough of a person to see the people i love, and being able to interact with them with energy, and not having to swim through brain fog in order to do so. and even if i'm struggling, an effort is better than nothing.

his energy's everywhere in this universe now and sometimes weird little coincidences like this happen and it just.... feels like him. i needed this.

Currently I use energy drinks  for energy, focus and appetite “suppression”. The appetite suppression is not really ed related. Certain meds upset my stomach but I often get nausea and then false hunger I have to wait out. If I eat during the weird period of it or in the transition I will be very sick. The energy drink allows me to skip the weird raw stomach hour or two after my meds so I don’t feel it and they also give me energy and focus. It’s not healthy or safe for me to have them w my heart and I shouldn’t be but I do not know what else to do so I am going against advice currently. I want to change this.

I’m hoping maybe there are safer alternatives out there that aren’t so unhealthy and dangerous esp for the heart.

692,publicly airing disordered tendencies,3,11d5amb,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11d5amb/publicly_airing_disordered_tendencies/,2,"a little rant i guess, since i've been in shambles. (tw for describing stuff?)

this girl in my microbiology class is so so so so thin. probably comparable to ec levels of concern, since not only is her face absolutely hollowed out, but whenever she comes to school in leggings they are literally baggy on her. she seems ""fine"", as in with a working mind, at least enough for an upper div college science class, and she buys vending machine snacks at break (chips, oreos, nuts) and eats them outside. 

i already have so much.... skepticism to her general vibe, but since day 1 i've been mildly triggered seeing her in class every week. it doesn't help that i've gone from restricting to binges + not caring, because of stress, and seeing her has made me spiral and feel invalid and flawed, unattractive. i refuse to wear tight clothing to that class when i have it, because she has the air of a judgmental person about her.

the other day she was talking to her class partner (who is older and in the upper obese side of things) about idek what, but i almost froze when i heard her talk about how skinny she is and how she passed out at this thing. the way she said it felt like a show off, like ""hehe omg im so tiny and frail :3 ahhhh!!! its hilarious!"", and i'm usually good at hiding how i feel but that day i just went home early. edit: i forgot to say that her class partner has often been like ""how do u do it??!!"" and stuff like that which is the only reason i described her size lol, i think the girl lowkey likes the fact that she's the small one bc every convo i hear between them regarding weight drives me nuts)

what was really weird about it is how my partner kept asking if i was okay and i said i heard something weird that made me feel off, and she kinda just said ""was it That?"" and i was like ??? how'd you know,,, and then she told me that she has a history with ed stuff. now its like, cool someone gets it, but also weird because i feel like i overrated i guess.

but god damn, i feel like an overarching mess of a failure. i have 0 friends, since over break i got so depressed i stopped replying to people, and when i did reply i either didn't have time (im basically teaching a class at this point) or they didn't get back to me again. last year was the first time i felt real genuine connections from people, starting in january when i was inpatient (ironic). after being split on, fading away as usual, or being forgotten, getting busy, it's all returning to how it was. the last person i talk to, my s/o, is someone i can't really say all this stuff to (embarrassing), and i have one online friend i write little letters to, but i havent had time to think about thoughtful words to write. im not going to rant to someone out of the blue either. 

that, combined with generally feeling like a failure, not being able to get my meds bc shortage, pms, getting doordash like x5 a week because im too lazy to drive but too stressed to restrict, which might change since i have a hole in my mouth now ! my stupid deathly fear of anesthesia and surgery and dentists have been resulting in all 4 wisdom teeth showing up, and one is literally growing into my cheek and making a hole. i can barely chew which has translated to getting boba(s) and calling it a meal. the stress, although somehow condensed in magnitude in text, is unsolvable by the distracting myself + nicotine + energy drink combo, and i've just gone back to doing classic ocd hair pulling, which is making me more stressed because balding. (my hair is already messed up from other reasons too !)

whats worse is how my mom pushes me to user her card for food, and keeps bringing home snacks and candy from work, even sneaking some halo top into the freezer for me without saying anything??? she's been on an extended cleanse diet which only lasts 20 days, yet shes doing it for ~2 months and counting, getting extremely thin in the process. totally not a shocker that eds are genetic, but it hurts when i feel like shes using me to feel better about it by buying stuff i have no self control over. 

tired. tired of failing at everything i try. especially the routine i planned to follow this semester which i did for the longest i've ever followed a routine... (~3 weeks.) when i could get my meds. now im just a braindead trainwreck and i want to (redacted), but i would rather my corpse be skinny lol cool",1677481121.0

That's not to say I don't allow ""fun"" foods or ""fear"" foods other days (because I do). That's just to say I allow myself to have a period of time where *all* ED rules are thrown out the window. 

~~Not diet culture rules per say, I think diet culture is BS, but I won't lie when I say I'd rather eat a baked potato than a fried one, for example. I'm not going to eat something just because it's ""bad"" or avoid something just because it's ""good""~~

Last night, I had my ""cheat my ED"" meal

My ARFID >!revolves around digestion.!< I'm very afraid of >!fibrous foods or foods with no fiber. I'm afraid of certain combinations of foods and putting ""too much"" (volume wise)!< at once.

My EDNOS revolves around >!caloric restriction!<. I will >!binge and restrict!< or >!purge via exersize!< to maintain my weight. 

Last night I said fuck it to both.

I ate dinner early at a time my ARFID *hates*. I made myself an Indian Lentil dish and poured it over two servings of home cooked potato wedges. I even ate whilst making it, which felt weird. 

When I was done, I asked my family member if I could try some of the ice cream they bought. I would *never do this* because God forbid I ask to try someone else's food. It was dark raspberry and chocolate truffle flavored and very delicious! I made sure to leave at least another good helping left for them to eat.

Then I waited a few hours since I wasn't hungry anymore. I went grocery shopping as per request of my dad and bought myself a pint of halo top. I normally wouldn't do this because the >!18g + fiber intake!< on top of what I have already had, but I was curious to try it and compare to regular ice cream.

When I got home, I ate it with chocolate chips mixed in. It was pretty good, but nowhere near as good as real ice cream! I'd rather eat a smaller *real* ice cream cone than a pint of halo top! 

But I was glad I did this because afterwards I ended up using the bathroom which proved my ARFID wrong, and found that I was less hungry the next morning with less sweet cravings which proved my EDNOS wrong. 

I'm not gonna restrict today. Just try to eat intuitively.",1677431126.0

The only reason any of this ever started was because I began to skip breakfast for convenience and thought intermittent fasting would be good for me. 
But I was 15F (now 16) and I didn't know this but fasting can actually do more harm than good for teen girls. I was also active and so I started to binge eat, my hunger cues were all messed up and I didn't know when to stop. Eventually I gained some weight but I wasn't overweight, I just felt really bad about my body. 
So I started counting calories because I wanted to lose weight. At first it was hard because my parents make my lunch and I was scared that I wasn't accounting for everything, so I started to try and overestimate. Then I would try to eat a very low calorie dinner and I even started to eat breakfast but made sure it was low enough. It got extreme when I bought a food scale off Amazon and I started to lose weight but still wasn't happy with my body. 
Throughout all this I lost my period and it had been gone even before I lost weight but the doctors were saying that I needed to eat more in hopes of getting it back. My estrogen levels are very low too and even though the doctor told me my BMI was a little too low. But when I searched it up on a calculator it told me I was just on the lower part of a normal weight range. I'm trying to gain weight now because my parents want to see if it will make me better and we're scared about my bone density. It's been hard to not count anymore and I still hate my body sometimes. But my worst fear is that it was all a coincidence and there's  something else causing my health problems, and all the weight gain will be for nothing. If that happens I will probably just go back to trying to eat very small portions but at the same time I don't want to go back to trying to restrict and count and always think about food. I wish I could just have a healthier relationship with food but I also watched way too many wieiad videos and compare myself with thinner people on a daily basis. This was more of just a vent but my main point is I hope gaining weight brings back my period because that's basically the only reason I'm even trying right now.",1677456207.0

Ever since I can remember the thing that stopped me from eating was not necessarily weight loss/gain, but the fact that I would over analyze every bite, looking for flaws on the food, which I guess lead me to ultimately find them - more than most people.

It didn't matter if it was a fancy restaurant or eating at a friend's house I would very frequently find hairs on my food - short, long, grey, black, thin, thick you name it. And after that I could never keep eating, I wanted to throw up. I had to stop eating immediately.

Finding food I like is hard enough as it is, let alone it be ""safe"" (healthy/low calorie), I only have like 5 restaurants I like in my city, and even then I have to switch them up constantly because I get sick of the food.

Basically writing this because I just ordered one of my infamous açaí bowls and found a hair on it, ate it to break a fast and now I'm as starved as I am disgusted.

I never have an in between. i’m either starving or I’m binging, and i’m not sure how to find a middle ground. about this time last year i was in a long anorexia spell that sent me to the hospital 3 times, and I ended up getting kicked off my college volleyball team because of it (yeah really stupid bc i was still playing very well), the bad anorexia spell lasted about 9 months until may of 2022 when I found out I was pregnant, very shocked bc i was 19, but so happy and excited! I was 6 weeks along, and my anorexia just poof disappeared the day I found out! I think I knew subconsciously i needed to feed the baby. I gained weight, but then i sadly miscarried at the beginning of my 2nd trimester in July.

I drink plenty of water, keep a food journal, and try to eat a healthy snack at night to reduce the cravings, but this doesn’t work. What ends up happening is I just eat the healthy snack *in addition to* whatever I was craving.

My doctor has okayed me to take it long term and I always take no more than the dose I’ve been prescribed. 

So I started freaking myself out a few days ago wondering if I’m not losing weight because of taking these pills. I eat in a slight deficit weekly, try to stick between >!1000-1200!< calories daily, and I also spend the majority of my days on my feet/walking around, my Fitbit estimates I burn >!200-300!< active kcals most days. Basically I’m confused as to why I never seem to lose weight and if I do it takes a long time to lose even a tiny amount.

Online I can’t really find anything about promethazine causing weight gain besides the possibility that it might increase appetite (personally I haven’t found this and if I’m tracking my calories and actively restricting it’s not like I’m eating more unconsciously). It’s annoying because with the medication I can only sleep max 5 hours a night which really impacts my mental health and day to day life, but equally I don’t seem to be losing any weight which is also impacting my mood and mental state.

I’ve had pretty generalized disorders eating through most of my life. Orthorexia developed into BED, developed into, binge restrict. 

I have a lot of mental health issues, and only got diagnosed about two years ago. I stopped drinking alcohol (something I was doing problematically) a year ago. 

I started becoming adverse to food? Not fearful, or anxious, but something felt off. I’d try to eat and the texture/taste would not be like I remembered the food being. Like it was fake, almost like I experience derealization while trying to eat. So then I would forget to, and my therapist always just tells me it’s my adhd and I just need to “prioritize food” 

But I never want to. Even when I find myself feeling hungry and think about what I want to eat, make/obtain that thing, take a few bites before this weird feeling comes over me and the food tastes “grey” (idk how else to describe it) and my hunger disappears. And I’m suffering for it, it’s not a good feeling or good for my body.

Hello fellow friends, I need a word or two of advice. For context, I have been training taekwondo for the past 4 years. It has been one hell of a journey tbh. Started without any complications and then within the 2nd year of training I started struggling with eds and shit. Thought it would pass, well it didnt. In taekwondo there are weight cathegories and my coach is super crazy ab it. She pressures not just me but everyone to try and reach the lower cathegory and it is just to much for me and makes me relapse so fucking much. Ive gotten better over summer while we didnt train, but the second we continued : relapse, a big one. Bc of this, Ive tried to explain to my coach ab a year ago as to what is happening to me and that its the reason why I want to find something not so weight related. She apologised and said that she wont pressure me so much anymore and that she didnt know it affected me so much. Thanked her and continued training. And she really did change, she didnt pressure anyone to go into lower. But after a month, everything went back to the usual and it was even worse. Now I really cant take this anymore. With this, theres also so much of discrimination, ignorance and toxity in that club. Please, anyone, I need a very good excuse to leave. And no its not that simple to just stop paying and say Im leaving, its much more. You basically devote your life to a sport when you do it for so long. Its like entering a toxic relationship and not knowing how to get out of it so you think if you wait that it gets better, but it doesnt. I was thinking about blaming my college that its difficult and stuff so I dont have any more time, but idk I feel that thats just so lame of an excuse. Please help me, I am just so stuck.

This disorder is destroying my life. I'm at a healthy weight. In fact, even at my worst I've never been underweight. But my suffering is still valid. I know this. I don't feel it, but I know it's factual. My health is suffering, my relationship is falling apart and I'm losing touch with everything in my life that brings me value. I have been in this shithole for 6 years. In this time I have recovered, regained my period, improved my energy/hair/skin/nails/mood, and then lost it all over again. I have been all across the BMI scale, I have lived through it all and know that my weight has never equated to my happiness. I know being in a larger body again and weight restoration itself is not what will bring me value and happiness. But I know that body is a byproduct from freeing myself from the shackles of my ED and no longer letting food control me.

I am sick of my immediate response to feeling unhappy being starvation. I am so over this. I am an adult now, I have too much at stake. I want to have energy again to invest into strengthening my relationship with the love of my life and uplifting him. I once had a beautiful soul. Now it has been rotten by vanity and malnourishment. I am so self obsessed. All I care about is my body and appearance, despite the fact that my ED robs me of energy to actually invest into either of these realms in any way other than getting thinner. I don't even look any better, which is the sad part. I've lost my glow, my smile no longer looks... happy. My hair is falling out, my nails are brittle and my skin is dull and grey. My recovered body may not fit societal beauty norms regarding thinness, but I was gorgeous. I am small now, but I am no longer beautiful or memorable. I am dull and ordinary.

I don't even know what the point of this rant is. I guess it's my last hurrah, I suppose. I need to recover for myself and for the ones I love. I am not in immediate danger or medically unstable, but I do not wish to continue engaging in this disorder until I reach that point. I know I am already doing irreversible damage, I do not want to completely destroy my body and render it unsalvageable. I struggle to keep myself accountable, though. I eat adequately for one day and then by the end of the day I am panicking and overwhelmed. I can't take it, so I go back to restricting the next day. Rinse and repeat.

If you benefited from FBT, I am happy for you. I am simply sharing my own feelings on this matter in hopes that fewer people will go through this pain.

I am not okay. I cry every day. When it comes to my mental health, my parents treat the eating disorder like Satan incarnate and constantly question my judgments about food, weight, and even self-esteem and depression as products of the ""eating disorder talking"". My mother, who used to listen to me a bit, now sides with my father and glorifies him as some kind of fearless parent fighting for his child's health when he has hurt me in so many ways, emotionally. My eating disorder initially developed as a reaction to his fat-shaming and emotional neglect, and now, my treatment decisions are in his hands.

""Nothing is more dangerous than the eating disorder,"" they say. I scream and cry that my parents are hurting me, and they acknowledge the trauma but justify it as a product of treatment. Even partial hospitalization was not this bad. They say they love me with a smile when I am begging them to stop. Stop judging me when I eat. The program I am under has transformed my parents into some fake amalgamation of therapist, dietician, and nurse. I am so tired... so tired of waking up to the possibility of having access to transportation taken away if I do not eat X slices of pizza or cake, even if I am genuinely full or not wanting to eat that (but again, they say it is ""my ED talking""). I am tired of my parents being convinced that forcing me to be overweight for the sake of ""overshoot"" and somehow magically losing that weight next February is the sole way my brain will recover and I will be okay. I hate the obsession with that number and that even if I were at a normal weight and doing fine, that would be unacceptable.

I am so sad but I still smile. My parents say they are saving their daughter, and I ask them if they are trying to save me or the image of me in their mind. I read my own diary, and it is jarring how mentally unstable I am. I am constantly being fixed, analyzed, and gaslit. Doctors betrayed me. My parents hurt me, but of course it is all for the sake of ""defeating the eating disorder"". Everything is the eating disorder's fault, apparently.

I am crying. Every single day I am fighting growing urges to >!commit suicide or self-harm!<, and my parents trigger me so badly. I am on the edge of hysteria, like a string that will snap at any moment. One moment I am sobbing and hitting myself, the other I am laughing through ugly tears. I am scared for my own safety, and I am so lonely because I have to deal with the pain on my own. This mental instability is not as simple as mere ""depression"" anymore. My brain broke somehow, and I feel like my entire being is falling apart. Every smile is fake. I am obsessed with death. I no longer look forward to academics, and I can hardly remember who I was before all this.

I do not know why I am still holding on. Maybe it is because I do not want my brother to be too sad if I go. At least he listens sometimes. A few of my high school teachers know about my medical and family situation, and they are really worried. Somehow, they can tell from my emails or my voice that something is wrong, but my own family cannot see it. They think I am reaching the light at the end of the tunnel, but I am only reaching an event horizon.

My mind is filled with background noise. My parents' shadows haunt me like ghosts when I close my eyes. Their presence in the day makes me want to do bad things to myself. The emptiness and despair consume me with a malice far more severe than some eating disorder, while that is still present too.

Every day, I force myself not to die. When can I discover what it means to live?

I was also watching supersize vs superskinny through the whole ridiculous food planning lol. My mom won’t help me fight for my freedom either and she’s also forcing me to stay enrolled in college. My brother’s away for a while. My friends are all busy with their own lives and I’ve been leaving their texts unread for days. I don’t know why I’m getting emotional about this, I deserve this.

Hello my name is Taylor and I suffer from anorexia b/p subtype. So my start to recovery didn't really go as expected. I was in residential for around 2 weeks in August/September. Due to something that happened they wanted me to go to more intensive care(they signed me up for an inpatient care center) and had me leave. I was originally going to go to this inpatient place (Walden) for what they said was a month or two before most likely going back to residential. Due to some miscommunication on my part and never hearing back from them I didn't end up going. Now I'm February I've relapsed and honestly I'd say I'm worse than I was in August. Especially due to what happened last week while purging (I almost had a heart attack). I told this to my college health center which led to me telling this to my GP. My councilor and my gp helped me to contact monte Nido and we got most of the lab work done on Friday (I f**king hate ekgs but for some reason I have to get them a bunch). I have my pre entry physical coming up on Thursday at my doctor's office and I should be back in within a week or two. Now I'm double guessing myself for doing this but I'm trying to go in more open minded this time. All that's left for right now is telling my family I'm going back(I'm living with them while I'm in my two year because its like 7 minutes away) and to pack(which will take like an hour at most and I will bring a few stuffed animals this time).

Whhen does it get better?  
Its been almmost a decade. Its only gotten worse.

&#x200B;

**Stage one, Age 9**. Anxiety. I becameanxious to the point i struggled to speak. sttruggled to even talk to myparents for fear of rejection. struggled to play with my siblings because i was scared theyd be mad at me. Never went away. Im still anxious. to the point that i hadto drop out of school because it made me so anxious i would throw upand pass out constantly.

**Stage two, Age 11.** Depression. I was depressedconstantly due to transgender dysphoria. Depressed about growing into a womans body with a mans brain. Depressedthat i would need to spend thousands of dollars jjust to be normal like everyone else. to be 'acceptable'. Im still depressed. I still want to die most nights because at least then i wont be depressed anymore. Thhat brings us to,,

**Stage three, Age 13.** Tremors. I dont quiite know how these developed or why i have them. Doctors are sstumped. Its getting worse every year, in the llast few months its gotten much worse much faster. I cant write with a ppen anymore. My bones in my hands hurt. The doctor i went to has no ideea whats wrong with me and wwont give me any referrals. 

**Stage four, Age 14.** Suicide attempts. Ive had six at this point. All within a year or two. i was put in a hospital. it didnthelp. they just put me on such strong drugs thhat i became a robot. i was alive, sure, but i wasnt living. I quit using those drugs AMA lastt year. I feel alive again. I still want to die. Ive chosen my nnew method.

**Stage five, Age 16.** Insomnia. I cant remember the last time ive had a full nights sleep. unless you count for the ddays that drift away while im half unconscious, because ive bbeen without sleep for four days straight.. 

**Stage six, Age 17.** AN-BP. I began may 30th of 2022. i was at my highest weight eever and decided to finally give in to my disordered thoughts (that ive hhad all my life) and just,, stop eating. And when i did eat? It wouldnt stay down very long. Ive lost almost half my original starting weigght and i want- No, i *need* to lose more. I cant stop. i uused to say 'oh ill just stop whhen im no longer obese!' that turned to 'ill get tto a normal weight! then i can be healthy.' Now its 'Just underweight. Maybe then ill gget help.' And even though im not underweight yet, i know for a fact it wont be enough. I want to die to this. This is my new method.  


So. I ask all the people whove told me over the yyears. When exactly does it get better? im tired.. My bones hhurt and my mind is dying. Why exactly is euthanasia not an ooption for humans? i just want to go to sleep.. I just want to be gone. I dont believe im ever going tto get better. No meds have worked without hhorrific side effects. Nothing makes me happy. I just want to disappear. I dont want to actively die, but i dont want to live.   


It feels like my life is just a fucked up pplay. Like im someones OC that they torment as a coping mechanism for their own ffucked up trauma. Thats kinda messed up right? to think that you arent real? Nothings real?   


When does it get better? I just want to be better.

Should I even continue to entertain this dude?

anyhow, because of how focused he is on all of that i have known since the beginning of the year his height and weight, >!5'10 135lbs. !<i think he's 3-5 lbs heavier now from building muscle, but like he's bmi >!19.5-20 !<and has basically no body fat, all muscle, definitely knows he looks good. at the start of the year i >!(5'5) !<was >!160!<lbs and now i'm down to the >!high 130s!< so we finally actually weight the same amount (give or take a couple lbs) and honestly it has been such a big goal for me to weigh less than him bc like he's so much taller than me and it made/makes me feel so gross to know that technically i'm the ""bigger guy"" even when i am so much shorter and should be the small one. his bmi is obviously still way lower though and he looks way better. it's hard not to compare because like we live together and go to the sauna together and therefore there's a lot of ""shirts off"" time. like i definitely feel *better* about how i look now than before but i'm nowhere near *done.* 

i ordered a new pair of pants the other day bc all my pants are from before this relapse when i was almost >!30!< lbs heavier and i'm sick of poking holes in my belt (legit not even a fun progress marker bc it is so annoying) and buying pants is terrifying especially online bc i have wide hips/big thighs and am scared they wont fit even if they fit my waist, and i don't even know my waist size rn. in a moment of weird weakness after i had already ordered i was like ""hey wait i can try on my roommate's pants bc he's not here"" and they're a size >!30w 32l!< and i ordered >!30w 30l!<. (they're a little big on him but it's like the smallest waist he could find with that leg length i guess. earlier this year he was jokingly like ""do u know how hard it is to find >!29w 32l!< pants and i was like ""why the fuck would i know that"" bc i was like a >!32 or 33!< waist at the time and it made me want to cry.) anyhow, i tried them on expecting to realize that i had fucked up with the ordering and it turns out that they were slightly too big! (and the legs weren't long either so i guess i could buy longer pants) which is so exciting on one hand because like i am so self concious about my legs but also i feel like in that moment i realized i probably don't know what i look like anymore if i can wear the same pants as him and yet think we don't even have similarly comparable bodies.   


i ran track/xc in middle school and high school and Sucked partially because for a lot of it i was starving and/or incredibly overweight which is a terrible combo for sports but anyhow bc my roommate is a runner, i have been running a lot again and actually enjoying it and im definitely better than i was in hs but it's really just another area to compare myself to him. he's way faster than me (like i don't even have goals to be as fast as him tbh) even tho he only started running like a year ago, *and* he just LOOKS like runner. he's tall, he's thin, he's fast. there's been times he is running with his shirt off and i'm 30 feet behind him with my shirt very much fully on and looking twice as tired and slow and feeling like everyone else is also just comparing us and thinking ""The Runner and his fat little friend who is trying so hard to keep up"". There's so much competition in my mind that he probably doesn't even consider is there bc why would he? and it feels kinda wrong to be comparing bc he is also very much struggling (even if he sees it as healthy and not struggling, he has admitted he has an unhealthy relationship with food once tho) with food. and like he is so much more open about it like telling me to tell him not to get ice cream if he says he wants it at the dining halls (i told him i will in fact Not be stopping him bc wtf) while i am trying my best to not have him be suspicious/worried and eating just enough to not make him suspect anything at the meals we get together and just skipping/having cereal cups at the meals where i don't have to eat with him and lying if he asks, we have pretty different issues and it's not like i'm enabling him in any way bc i see some of what he does as very fucked up, but like just his existence encourages me to do disordered things. we're friends outside of all of this obviously and i really like him as a person but all of this feels so weird and hard idk.

I'm interested in getting help on my own terms. Everything I read about eating disorders makes me uncomfortable because I simply don't relate to any of it, not even others with BED. My binges are less emotional and more driven by my sensory differences. I don't have distorted thinking many aspects of food or weight.

The concept of ""recovery"" just doesn't resonate with me. My ED is far from my biggest problem, more of an annoyance, and there's no black-and-white boundary between occasionally overeating and binge eating.

I have considerable barriers to seeking healthcare:

* I have a neurological disease that severely limits my activities. I cannot always leave the house or be awake during the day.
* I have cognitive impairment that severely limits my executive functioning
* I simply don't trust healthcare anymore. I suffered enormous iatrogenic harm because doctors refused to diagnose my disease for 4 years, attributing the symptoms to my mental health.
* My physical doctors not knowing about ED treatment would be ideal. I lie about my mental health to some doctors. They simply can't grasp that cognitive impairment and post-exertional malaise have ruined my life, leading to me feeling sad at times, not the other way around.

I've actually been in semi-recovery for a while; I still definitely have disordered thoughts/habits, but I'm very careful about eating enough to maintain my weight and trying to get all of my nutrients in and w/e. 

I don't feel guilty after eating, even if I have a lot of highly caloric food/junk food/etc. But I've always had stomach problems, that have definitely been aggravated by years of terrible eating habits, so eating more than a small portion, or pretty much anything overly greasy/fatty/rich, or certain types of alcohol just leaves me feeling super gross/nauseous physically, and I unfortunately at some point realized that just making myself throw up makes me feel so much better physically than having to spend hours in severe discomfort, doing breathing exercises and sipping water and w/e. And that instant relief is so gratifying that it's hard to just *not* throw up every time I have stomach discomfort right after eating.

I think the weird thing abt it for me is that it's like... genuinely not related to calories? If I eat way over my maintenance calories in a day, but with no nausea/discomfort, I have absolutely no urges to induce vomiting. But if I have one drink too many, or eat too fast or w/e, it's so hard to not give in to the urge to just get it over with and not feel shitty for 5 hours straight, even though I know feeling shitty for 5 hours straight will be much better for me in the long term than fucking up my teeth/esophagus/etc.

I'm sure that some of this is brought about by my food issues, because even if in my conscious thoughts I'm not upset about calories or w/e, I've probably conditioned myself to think being full = bad and gross. But at the same time, it is genuinely spurred on entirely by actual physical discomfort, so even though I've improved all of my other disordered eating habits, it feels like I can't kick this no matter what I do.

865,My description of anorexia.,18,11bfgio,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11bfgio/my_description_of_anorexia/,1,"An eating disorder....it's not about the weight or food and it's not all about wanting to be skinny ....too many do not understand this. There’s so much more to it and everyone is different….
This is my description of it…

Sure, it’s part of this, and may even be how it began, but it’s so much more. You truly get addicted to the feeling of hunger and emptiness, the feeling that you’ve actually accomplished something for once when you feel smaller, or see that number drop down again. Become so small, but also are able to do something that most people can’t?! 

I feel like I take up too much space in this world like I am too much....like I deserve to suffer and starve and shrink myself down to how Small I feel and have been made to feel by others. 

It's being too much and not enough all at once...surrounded by people but still feeling so terribly alone because you are unable to relate. Don’t have anything to contribute to conversation because your life experiences have been far different, and you also don’t want to appear negative. Unsure if you can trust anyone because you've been so terribly hurt before...

it's being invaded by a constant being telling you you're not good enough, you'll never be enough, you're a failure, you don't deserve to be loved, you're a terrible person, you've made too many mistakes, you're fat, ugly, stupid....like nothing you ever do or say is right....black and white thinking that says if you didn't do it perfectly you've failed completely...

.....know this could kill you and are terrified of that, have even been told you’re dying, have very nearly died in the past and been told you’re lucky to even be alive, but feel like you deserve it in some way if it does kill you...feel like you're not worth recovery...of course others are, and you will always actively encourage anyone else struggling to pursue recovery, and that they absolutely deserve to recover, but somehow you don’t, you’re different and will never be worth it. 

It's a way to deal with anxiety, guilt, frustration....make things seem more manageable when life seems so terribly out of control….at least I can control my body focus on numbers, body checking, hunger, and of course, food? (But then it takes control of you quickly, and consumes you).....it's an escape, numbing from a life that can feel like too much, from memories, that at least there's numbers and a body to focus on instead of the things that are too overwhelming to deal with....

It's trying to please everyone sacrificing our own happiness and wellbeing for others because they deserve it more…feeling like you have to apologize just for existing.

it's a constant feeling like I don't fit in anywhere, I don't belong. Like why am I here? I don’t even fit in to my own family. 
To feel like most would be better off without you, would they even notice if you were gone??? What do you add to this world? 
It's wondering why I'm still here after so many close calls...sometimes wishing Id just died but terrified of that thought too....terrified of living and remaining this way, but so terrified of dying and unsure how you can Even ever live without this beast because it’s so present in your life and has been for so many years.

Wanting recovery sooooo badly but not sure that you know how to live a life without this demon anymore...especially since it's been 20 years since it all began. Sure you’ve had good times, periods of recovery, but none have ever lasted more than 5 years, and it always comes out of the shadows when things are bad again. 

It's been my way to survive and cope in many undesirable situations...distract from things that happened that are too terrible to think about, and you absolutely don’t generally share because others would never understand….or worse, say it’s all your fault. Say you’re exaggerating, lying, too negative, or to just get over it already like it’s that easy, if it were do you think I’d seriously still be struggling with this?! 
Small feels safe….familiar, small as I feel in this crazy world. 
It's about so much more than wanting to be skinny, more than food...more than just eat and be cured...and it's hell.",1677311560.0

My parents used to own a restaurant and packed me food for lunch everyday in primary school. I liked the food (usually really good sandwiches that would honestly get pretty soggy by lunchtime) but one day, some kid made fun of me for eating a “goopy sandwich”.

I got into trouble for it multiple times and so my parents stopped packing me sandwiches. But I still kept throwing away my school lunch for the next 4 or 5 years. 

The result now is that as an adult, I always get very defensive over food waste now and I can’t stand throwing away “perfectly good food” but also I just realized that I really liked those sandwiches 🥺 They were good and I would like to recreate one to heal my inner child ❤️ Still sad that I threw away so much food, but I also equate that food with how my family showed me care now.

It didn't start off as intentional recovery, more compulsive eating from anxiety, mental hunger and binge/restrict cycle. Right now my relationship with food is better than it's been for ages. My weight has remained fairly stable for about 6 months. Still, I have no sex drive at all. It's the slightest bit better than when I was severely anorexic, and that's it. I'm sick of it because I don't want to gain any more weight and I feel like giving up on being healthy and just having a body I like.

I am 5'8.5 and >!131 lbs.!< This weight is incredibly triggering for me to be at even though my bmi is not that high, since I feel like most people would consider someone of this weight to be average/not skinny without seeing them. I have no concept of what is a 'light' weight and I feel very heavy in general. My 200 lb father can't even pick me up for more than a few seconds without it being very hard for him, and this has been an enormous trigger for me. I have been hyperfocusing for ages now on the fact that most men can't pick me up easily compared to lighter women, and since I have discovered a lot of my ED comes from really fucked up gender and sex dynamics, this makes me hate myself. I'm so jealous of light, small women that can easily be carried and thrown around. This is literally on my mind so often and it makes me sad because I know that's weird and messed up.

Someone please give me their opinion on why I still have no sex drive since weight gain? I've had my period for nearly 6 months now too. I'm pretty sure I'm not asexual since my sex drive was quite high before my ed (15 ish years old). Do I just need to wait a while and keep maintaining this 'healthy' weight?

I hope this post was not triggering to anyone, and to be clear I do not perceive others weights to be as heavy as mine, even if the number is bigger.

I was diagnosed with OSFED back in 2020. I think the psychiatrist at the mental health clinic basically gave me that because I only had one session with her before I got placed with a therapist. I basically struggled with elements of BED and Orthorexia. I struggled with my relationship with food over 10 years. Some months food stressed me out less, sometimes it stressed me out a lot. I felt like I lacked control over food. 

Yet, I never felt like it was as bad as others. I wasn't eating thousands of calories at night or counting calories or anything, but I often ate past the point of fullness where I felt so much guilt and shame. I still don't know if I had just ""disordered eating"" or a ""real eating disorder"". Sometimes I want to tell people my story. People always comment about how I eat so healthy and stuff and how I control myself around food so well. I generally eat healthy now not because of control but BECAUSE I struggled an eating disorder and spent so much time HEALING. That now I just think of food as food, and nothing more. So I just eat what makes me feel good without ever restricting anything in particular. But I don't feel like I had a ""real eating disorder"" enough to say that I had an eating disorder. OSFED doesn't feel real; and even my diagnosis of OSFED doesn't seem real. Does anyone else feel this way?",1677298000.0

So, question:

What are some of the questions you have/had in early recovery? What did you need to ask/know when starting recovery? What do you wish you had asked someone, but maybe we’re too shy at the time? What questions tend to keep you stuck in your recovery if you don’t have an answer? What questions led you to answers/realizations you otherwise wouldn’t have come to?

For example, I was contemplating eating more tonight and asked for some reassurance from my parents. I’ve been in a higher res deficit than i’m used to all week but a deficit nonetheless.  My stomach has also been a wreck today so I’m not even sure how many nutrients I’m absorbing and i was starvingggg even after hitting my calorie/protein goals.

Ofc, my dad pipes up to say I should stop eating bc I’d been eating all day. Thing is, I was eating low calorie safe foods all day, they just don’t look it. Not to mention, I’m running xx miles a week, doing pilates, and a 5 day weight training program so I need to eat!!

Idk, I just lost it and broke down exactly how few calories were in the Choc PB oats I was eating vs his “keto” wafer drenched in actual peanut butter. In hindsight, I hate that I spoke to him that way, esp bc I try so hard not to comment on anyone else’s food intake (even when they never extend the same courtesy to me). Why can’t people j keep their commentary to themselves, esp when they know absolutely NOTHING about nutrition to begin with??

I’m really upset now by 1. how much I’ve been eating lately and 2. how much everyone around me thinks i’ve been eating. I’ve fought so hard to become more athletic and fit than my granola family just to prove them wrong but I feel like I’ll always be the fat kid at the table to them, even when I know I’m technically eating less and am on the verge of being UW. 

I really don’t want this to set me back but I already have plans to restrict tomorrow and run some serious distance to make up for the week. So now my parents think I’m a calorie obsessed freak, I’m disappointed in myself, and my disorder is disappointed in me too. I can’t make anyone happy.

Actresses like Ana Taylor-Joy and Hannah Murray never bothered me and reading through edtwt never caused any triggers to me.

That said, Jennette McCurdy's bluntness and honesty has seriously messed with me since I read her book last month as I go through my worst relapse to date. Double checking my copy, I'm surprised it doesn't have a content warning on it, or if it does, at least not a more obvious one. I think about my early dates of my ed, especially the first time I purged and how similar her feelings on it were to my own.

>I feel victorious.

>So what if I fucked up and ate? So what if I failed? So fucking what? All I have to do is shove my fingers down my throat and watch my mistake be undone.

I can vividly remember looking in the mirror and being so proud of myself afterwards on multiple occasions which she writes about *in detail.* Then further on her account of bulimia turning into something she loses control of hits too close to home for me and my current situation.

>*I can stop here. I'm full, I don't have to keep going. I can interrupt the cycle...* Overwhelm floods my whole body... I'm still filled with pent-up anxieties. I need to rid myself of these fucking feelings.   
>  
>*Fuck what am I doing I need to stop I need to stop.* 

I think because she gives the actual feelings and ugly parts of eating disorders from the account of someone who was seriously affected by it, rather than the Hollywood accounts that romanticize it, the book hits home. Another line that I think about constantly is her discussing the appeal of being anorexic rather than bulimic, something that I and others have written about on here and other forums. Her lines remind me of being in middle school and religiously following the ""Ana is my friend"" ideology.

She has multiple pages detailing how panic attacks led to binges and the way she discusses her failing health comes across like she broke a nail rather than lost a molar.

I’m 17 and my bmi is >!20!< and I started treatment less a month ago and it has been so stressful and they have only been focusing on medical monitoring visits to make sure my blood sugar is fine and giving me all these blood forms to take. 

They’re barely helping and it’s so frustrating and each visit is just torture. They weigh me and take my blood pressure and check my blood sugar. If my blood sugar is too low they force me to drink an ensure and if I don’t take it they threaten to send me to the emergency room. 

I don’t even know why I’m doing this anymore because each visit I just get worse and worse and they’re completely ignoring my mental health and focusing on the physical side when I’m literally fine. 

They said I’ll be seeing a dietician soon but honestly I don’t know how that’s gonna help. I need actual therapy sessions. Not whatever the hell this is. 

Two months ago I was in a really awful BP cycle and I’m currently almost two months BP free and a month binge free and I’m currently restrictive and my main worry is bingeing again and they’re not taking that seriously at all and just focusing on the restriction part. 

I’m thinking of just stopping and not going anymore. So unhelpful. Each visit I hope that something changes and they actually do something to help me but no. I’m way worse now than I was a month ago. I hate this. 

Basically after todays visit I just feel broken and hopeless. Will it ever get better? If you were/are in treatment in the UK how have they helped you? Have they helped you at all?",1677276516.0

i know I'm not pregnant now, but now I can't get the daily body-checking mindset to go away.

Today I sent her the restaurant menu for lunch today ( just a little deli to grab a quick bite) and she goes “I don’t really wanna focus too much on eating at lunch today I have to get a shirt for my dinner tonight, so I’m ok if we don’t grab food”

I have been dating my girlfriend for a few months now. she initially persuaded me to try recovery, and because I was in the honeymoon phase and wanted so badly to be with her, I signed up for therapy and all that jazz. I didn't really recover. my heart wasn't ever completely in it, and I ended up having a really bad run-in with bulimia that was exacerbated by our relationship. 

I experience a lot of stress in our relationship. this isn't my girlfriend's fault, but she thinks of me super highly, and it makes me feel extremely pressured to act the way she expects me to act. she also refers to me as a ""puzzle"" or a ""mystery"" a lot, and points out behaviors that seem to contradict with her view of me (""it's so surprising that you listen to that kind of music"" ""it's so unlike you to get so heated over this"") and it makes me feel like she's constantly analyzing me or evaluating me. I've told her a bit about how it feels like she has really high expectations for me, and how that makes me sometimes feel uncomfortable/makes it hard to open up, but I've never gone in-depth as to why that is. she's not saying any of this with malicious intent — that's just how she views me, and she doesn't understand the depths to which it affects me, because I've never talked about it with her. 

the past few weeks, I've withdrawn a lot from her. this was initially because I was busy (we're both college students), but I soon came to realize how much easier life is without having to constantly spend time with or talk to her. I miss her a little bit, but for the most part I've felt so light. I found other reasons to recover. I had a huge shift with recovery — I'm actually serious about it this time, and genuinely want to get better. I don't know if this could have happened if I was constantly stressed about our relationship.

I know I've hurt her by doing this. she's always needed more affection/attention from me than I have needed from her. we briefly discussed this recently, and I apologized for pulling away when I knew she was hurting. my intention wasn't to hurt her, but I knew I was doing it, and would try to brush those thoughts away because they were uncomfortable to deal with. I was in the wrong. I withdrew, even knowing it would hurt her, and didn't tell her why. 

so I've made an effort to talk to her more again lately, because I don't want to hurt her. (we're long distance-ish, so we don't meet up often) but I'm just stressed out when I think about her again. I feel so uncomfortable and constantly on-edge when I'm speaking with her, and spending time with her makes me feel so exhausted afterwards from trying to keep up this image of myself. I know it's a horrible way to feel about your partner, but it's just how I feel. 

I'm planning to talk to her about my feelings this weekend. we have a whole time scheduled for it. I'm so anxious I can't stand it. I'm losing sleep over our relationship again. I could try and make it work, but I don't know if I want to. it just feels like me putting in so much work for something I don't want to do, that just makes me miserable, which feels a lot like my eating disorder, if I'm honest. it also stresses me out and makes me want to engage in behaviors again to cope. and my affection for her has died down so much within these past few weeks that I don't even know if I feel romantic feelings for her anymore. it's kind of triggering me really bad, and just stressing me out to the nth degree. I'm losing sleep, it's easier to fixate on food than deal with these feelings, etc. 

that being said, I don't want to hurt her. I've already done so much to hurt her, and it'd only hurt her more to just break up. I may not like her romantically as much, but she's still a friend, and I still care about her. I feel like leaving her now would give her lasting trust issues regarding relationships, and as someone who already has trust issues, I don't want to see her go through that. but feeling like this is also stressful for me. I don't know how much I should prioritize my feelings, how much I should compromise, how much I'm even willing to compromise, how much this will affect my recovery or her mental health. this is also, as you can probably tell, pretty much exclusively an issue with me, and not her. (classic ""it's not you, it's me"" lol) it's not her fault I feel consistently pressured around her, or that I have issues with meeting people's expectations of me, or that I struggle with thinking about how she may not like me if I no longer fit her expectations. what do you guys think? even if you don't have a definitive answer as to what I should do, getting an outsider's perspective from people who don't know me irl would be super helpful, I think. thanks for reading if you've read the whole thing...",1677256125.0

986,very confused and kinda sad,1,11areq2,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11areq2/very_confused_and_kinda_sad/,2,"This is basically just a rant about how confused I am n stuff. Apologies in advance, as this text is a fucking mess due to my abhorrent writing skills and low energy levels atm. So yeah it's not going to be very coherent lol

Almost at the end of a one-week vacation in Spain right now and I am really afraid that I've gained weight due to how much I've eaten these last few days. There hasn't been a single day where I haven't overate, which has caused me a lot of guilt after every meal. It feels like my vacation is being ruined by this shitty disorder.

Unsure how I will be able to lose any weight I have gained when I finally get back home, as I can't get through school without eating properly. I don't even know what I'm doing, or how I am gonna fix this. I'm fully aware of how much this is fucking everything up, since I am constantly tired and worried about what I eat. The issue is that I am afraid of recovery and trying to eat more to get better because my weight is technically healthy (I have AA). How am I meant to start eating more without gaining weight? I can't gain more than this. I feel stuck. 

Sorry that this was a mess. I'm not thinking clearly rn and I am unable to formulate myself properly.",1677245339.0

I tried to make zucchini fries to go with my meal for today and mind you I’ve never made them before but I’ve made something similar with carrots and it just turned out so bad and mushy and I over salted it and I just wish I could cook food for myself without being afraid",1677205554.0

989,The first relapse I’ve had in years.,8,11afqyd,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11afqyd/the_first_relapse_ive_had_in_years/,0,"This sorta was/ sorta wasn’t an accident. I didn’t sleep at all last night, when I decided I needed to get dressed for work I was so focused on making sure I felt and looked awake that I didn’t think about making anything for breakfast. 

My mind went to “remember in high school, you drank an energy drink in the morning and wouldn’t eat until dinner, and it would just be some pasta? You got hit on all the time.”- so I decided that was definitely a good idea for today. 

The last time I ate until recently was 8pm last night. I was so distracted that I didn’t even realize or remember my goal until I was dry heaving. My stomach feels so sick. I ate 2 oranges and sipped on a boost. But holy crap, I forgot how awful my body felt all the time while in my active ED.

>!I’ve successfully gained 60 pounds,!< it’s been years and I have learned to love my body.

Also, while lying in bed thinking about my life choices, I realize people hitting on me had nothing to do with my body— it was because I was a minor.",1677204703.0

Today I was scrolling through some videos and found another one of Zoeunlimited's bs takes, where she claims if you restrict too hard ""a glass of water"" will make you gain wieght. I lost it. No, how would that make me GAIN?

Also I saw Sierra Ann talk about her weight loss god knows how long ago and claim now she can't lose anymore because she destroyed her metabolism back then. As much as I like her videos and vibe, support her and all, no way she would stay the same weight if she started counting calories and stayed in healthy deficit.

Lately I saw  My Thoughts Will Probably Offend You say the same thing, basically if these people started counting everything they eat like she does, they would be able to lose even with their ""slow metabolism"". Some of these influencers need to cut the bs.

That was a long rant but you probably know all of these people, we are all in the same boat here haha.",1677147060.0
