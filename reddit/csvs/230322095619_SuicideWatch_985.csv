This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail. 

Thanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.",1567525791.0
1,Please remember that NO ACTIVISM of any kind is ever allowed here. No matter what day it is.,718,pl9suy,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pl9suy/please_remember_that_no_activism_of_any_kind_is/,43,"Activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues (and suicide is, inescapably, a social issue) is absolutely against the rules here at all times. 

Please understand that we're all for smart, strategic mental-health and suicide-prevention activism. It's essential to fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and to fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding. Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL. 

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population. We used to allow it but the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming.  We do regret the need for this rule, but the need is inescapable. 

Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our community's wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

**tl;dr** Any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's about any cause or issue (rather than a request for personal support) is not allowed here.  Please report everything of the nature that you see.",1631232110.0

I'm 24 now and I have just never been able to overcome the childhood trauma and adverse experiences I've had to face. I have PTSD, anxiety, and depression that I know of, and being alive is so incredibly difficult. I truly wish I was never born, I would choose to not be alive if given the choice and it's so frustrating to me now that I have to end my own life in order to make everything stop. I've been through different types of therapy after becoming an adult, and although there have been marginal improvements, all I can see staring me in the face is the decades and decades left of healing I have to do. I'm still so angry at my parents especially for forcing me to endure their abuse, and every adult in my life as a child just turned their back on helping me. It makes me feel so incredibly worthless, and I struggle so much with self neglect now. I don't really care about myself at all and I'm just so tired. I haven't spoken to my sister in 4 years now and it hurts, she has decided to take the path of my mother and has become a toxic young woman. 

I am in university now as a freshman and I've been royally fucking it up. I've missed so much class this semester and last because I just fall into a depression pit for weeks at a time. I don't want to accept help anymore to get out of it. I feel like a waste of resources at this point since I can't seem to get it together and I'm tired of taking. I've been to the hospital and I've been admitted to the psych ward once, and so far it has not helped. Every time I go, I just get sent home the same night after I am not an immediate danger to myself, which I know is how is has to be, but I have nothing really worth coming home to anyways. Getting admitted is worse in a lot of ways anyways, it's such a depressing place to be.

I live in a dorm by myself and I've tried to make friends, but I can never bring myself to actually open up anymore and become close to others in real life. I've had someone tell me before that talking about my life is one of the worst things they've ever heard, and I am so much more reserved about it now. I used to trauma dump on anyone that would listen, but that's so inconsiderate and I don't know how to find a happy medium. I can't talk about my life to relate to people since there's just so much bad so I feel so disconnected from my peers. I have nothing to really offer in conversations, and most people around me are fresh out of high school so they don't have anything like the life experiences I have. The people I've been closest to have all been online, and they're so far away from me. I am so lonely.

I know how I am going to kill myself, I've never had an attempt before but I've thought about this a lot. I do want to die tonight, I just don't want to be alive anymore. Things are too difficult and I have been fucking up my schooling so much, and I can't flunk out and go home either because I hate living there more than anything. I just don't see any real way forward, I am so exhausted. All I do is fail and I don't want to ask for help anymore because I fuck things up over and over again. It feels like such a waste. I've missed so much school and have fallen off of my sorority again, I feel like a failure and I just wake up every day to neglect myself again.

I can't reach out to any of my extended family, they enabled my abuse by doing nothing and no one wants to acknowledge that or take any ownership of the harm they've caused. The thing that set me off the last time into depression was my cousin telling me she knew things were bad for me growing up, skirting around the real issue again. She's 16 years older than me, and she chose to do absolutely nothing to help me. Not even checking in to make sure I'm okay. I never thought I'd even live past 18, I feel like I've been in a haze my entire life and I can't deal with it anymore. My view of the future is poor now as well, the housing market sucks shit in my country and the career I came to uni to pursue needs a doctorate. That's so much time and I can't even handle myself now.

I just can't continue on anymore. I don't care about myself and no one really cares about me either. My extended family has tried to somewhat reach out now, but its too little too late in my opinion. I am fucked for life now and I don't want to spend the time fixing myself back up again. There's not really a point and I'm just wasting time. If I can't get myself put together, I don't see why I should wake up tomorrow. 

I don't believe in any god, but if there is one I just hope I can die without any hiccups. I don't want to wake up tomorrow.",1679446373.0

50,I am suicidal,2,11xyak1,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11xyak1/i_am_suicidal/,3,"People do not think I am serious when I post about this, not that they would care. I understand that. Why would anyone care about a stranger? At the very least, if anyone read this, I'd like them to think this is real. This is serious. The person writing this is not trying to get attention, is not trying to troll, get upvotes or anything else that is immediately assumed. The person writing this is exhausted. 

I spent the majority of my childhood not understanding why I was so miserable. I could not form friendships and I was offered relationships but was not comfortable in them. I had no voice. I was the quiet kid in the back of the room, and I was tormented by my own life. My strictly religious family let me down in so many ways, and that one place you are supposed to feel comfortable and safe, I did not. 

No one cared to understand people like me when I was a child. I spent so many years saying what is wrong with me? It wasn't until I was an adult did I fully understand what I was going through and truthfully, it has been devastating to accept. I am transgender, the most hated group of people out there. The kind of hatred we get makes me live in fear. I am unable to get employed for more than minimum wage despite going to college. Even my short hair has been an issue for so many people. The amount of hatred we get just for existing is exhausting. 

Perhaps when I first came out with it, it was more scary and disappointing than the commplete exhaustion that I feel now. I am ready to throw the towel in. I cannot stand the hatred anymore. Yet I cannot stand presenting as female anymore either. Maybe if this was the only thing I was going through or I had a supportive family, things would be different. Due to my severe depression, I am left with no hope. I believe there is a hard worker inside from me. I demonstrated it in my early 20s, but the more hatred I've faced for trying to be me, the more depressed I've become. Most days I do not want to get out of bed or even eat. When I do eat, I eat ramen noodles, as I have literally no money to live on. I am in a lot of debt and my only option is to go live with my family who will go back to pretending these feelings don't exist, despite me coming out ages ago. 

I am completely and utterly alone in life. I fell in love with a 51 year old man online, as he was the only person to ever attempt to accept me. But I am over being online, I'm over being alone in a room sleeping all day. The quality of my life is so low at this point. 

To top it off, I'm dealing with an extreme bitterness and distrust towards women. I am not completely sure why. I can recall being forced by girls growing up but I have this feeling the root of it has to do with my mother. And I cannot remember being sexually abused by her. Yet I will dream about it and when I hear about mothers sexually abusing their sons, I will have a panic attack and cry. It's a complete trauma response, and I am unable to afford any help for it. This has made me miserable. I do not know what happened or what is causing the trauma, but I have put up with it for so long that I cannot bare it anymore.

Perhaps the whole point of this post is to say, hey I'm not seeing myself going on much longer. My family put an intense fear of hell in me, and therefore as a child, when I was being forced by females, I could not say anything for fear of being told I'd go to hell and disowned by my family. Regardless of it having nothing to do with me, or having any control over the sitution. Religion let me down, my family let me down. And once again let me down in telling me my feelings, my identity is evil and not valid. 

I am an alcoholic and everyday I battle it as well as a crippling eating disorder. I sought out the only help I could afford from a psychologist and was medicated but the only therapy I can afford consists of coming in to continue getting prescribed medication I am addicted to. 

Every single day, I think about suicide. I no longer feel sadness for my family. I can't say I believe in religion. The only thing that has stopped me is this fear of hurting one of my dogs (who lives with my family). But I'm not sure she would be so affected by something she can't know happened. 

I feel it would be so much easier to end it. And yes, I'm serious. I just can't do this much longer. Go ahead, hate on me. I’m used to it.",1679440095.0

I guess I had this fantasy that if I killed myself, everyone who abandoned me or treated me wrong would feel guilty and remember me for the rest of their lives.

I do wanna say I don't have the worst life imaginable, maybe by some people's standards I have a good life but I feel real fucking suffering. I am in pain.

Wake up, play games, talk to internet ""friends"", watch anime, jerkoff. I get ridiculed by my parents for being jobless, I react and say something stupid. Get yelled at for eating food, get yelled at for being too loud, get yelled at for not having a job, get yelled at. Yeah i know i'm in my 20s and worthless and not capable of taking care of myself. I can't hold down a fucking job, I RUIN EVERY RELATIONSHIP I HAVE FRIENDSHIP OR OTHERWISE. I wish it was easy to kill yourself and not know when it would happen, yes i wouldn't wish that on anyone else but still that's how i feel. I got diagnosed with ADHD. I can't stop talking about my personal issues to anyone and fucking overshare. I victimize myself and then beat myself up for not taking responsibility. I drop hobbies and become discouraged when I become bad. I have bullied people, maybe even been abusive.

It's the same everyday, i am trapped. EVERYDAY I suffer. I deserve this I know, I am willing to get help but even that doesn't come it has be fucking expesnive and hard to get free versions. I HAVE FUCKING TRIED. I have anxiety to going to jobs, to saying the wrong thing. I tried going for a dream and saw people i know close to me succeed while I failed and gave up. This shit fucking pain

EVERYDAY EVERYDAY EVERYDAY EVERYDAY EVERYDAY EVERYDAY EVERYDAY EVERYDAY EVERYDAY EVERYDAY EVERYDAY EVERYDAY EVERYDAY EVERYDAY EVERYDAY. I feel like i am going fucking insane, no I am sane but in fucking pain. WHY DO I HAVE TO BAD MEMORIES AND PAIN ON REPEAT???? WHY DO I HAVE TO REACT BAD TO SMALL THINGS?? WHY DO I OVERSHARE WITH PEOPLE??? I am mentally and physically stuck in this house, I don't know how much longer I can last. This shit is driving me up a wall.

Anyone reading this or not is fine, I just need something written down, even if no one reads this it feels good to have that be a chance it will be read.

 Its been too much going on that the only exit i see is just ending it, sometimes i think of just making a shitty attempt to get the help i need but ik that will probably not help, i would just need a few days and i would remind myself how much of a bother i am to people, how pathetic and irresponsible i am, how much i depend on other people and how a simple mistake makes me wanna just do it, makes me waste all the good days ive had.
 In my family sometimes suicide is seen as a joke, my mom has told me to kill myself in a joking matter, my sister has joked about me killing myself and all of that doesn't help what im going through, it just truly makes me wanna end it all more, my family, specially my mom and dad make their son's and daughters trauma a whole fat joke and im honestly tired of it, my brother has told me how he was contemplating his own life once, this family is just a big joke but i dont think ill be able to live in this house until im able to leave.

To give more context: I’ve helped financially my only sister for over 10 years, paid a private university recently and the other day she told me that I’m stupid for not realising how little she cares about me. Also, last year my ex boyfriend abused me financially, cheated and lied about multiple things. I felt used, I left everything in London to move to Amsterdam with him because of his job and I was isolated, and mistreated. I’m a very strong woman that made herself - becoming very wealthy during the pandemic. I’m also highly empathetic,and sometimes I feel like I would like to be in my previous position.

&#x200B;

I never thought it would end up like this but here I am. For background, 19(M) living in the UK. I was a happy kid up until year 9 (school), but looking back now I think I was just oblivious to what this world really is. All my friendships got fucked up in year 8 so I was starting off completely alone. Absolutely no friends, and it was hard. Thankfully, I managed to land myself in a good group with three other people, and we were all really close. The future was looking good now that I had new friends, and getting a 4.0 GPA the first semester really helped keep me optimistic. 

Spring semester then rolls around and I didn't know it then, but it was the start of the end. I got sick the second week of classes in the new semester and was out for an entire week. I got really behind on my maths and other classes and it had a big effect. My marks were absolute shit. We're talking 20%s. This shot my motivation down. Not long after, I got sick for the second time and it was pretty bad again this time. I was out for another week. My friends that I had made in the previous semester had classes together, but I wasn't in them. I started slowly getting phased out of the group, and it was so clear. My grades were shit, I was losing my only friends and I had no motivation to keep going. This sounds really dramatic, but where I come from (pretty wealthy area), you only matter if you have good grades and that belief is heavily ingrained in me. 

Nothing ever really got better. In fact, it only got worse. First semester of year 13 (last year of school) was easily the worst time of my life. I'm not gonna explain, but it was bad. I gave myself an ultimatum. I either get into the university that I wanted to go to, or kill myself. I ended up getting into the school I wanted, and that was the one thing that drove me to keep going. I got accepted in December, so I really used this motivation to make the upcoming year better. I was tired of feeling like shit, so I was going to make a change and actually fucking do something to better myself. I quit all video games, I deleted all social media, stopped watching youtube, all that shit. Erased the time wasters we call social media from my life. I started eating really healthy and lifting weights. I got a new job. I made some new friends. I got good grades that semester. I picked up new hobbies. I did everything that they tell you to do in terms of ""self help"" bullshit. I was so excited for university. The feeling of hope that it gave me, the feeling that things would really take off the ground and get better, was almost like an other-worldly high. For the first time in a long time, it actually felt like things would improve. I wish I could feel that kind of anticipation again. 

&#x200B;

University was my last hope. I was really banking on it. The funny thing is, it was actually over before it even started. My flatmate that I got paired up with had a girlfriend that was also going to the same university as us. I didn't see a problem with it then. We also got put in a hall of residence that was secluded from main campus and mainly for upperclassmen (we were freshman tho). Again, I didn't see a problem with this. Second day of being there, I knew it was over for me. All the other freshman in actual freshman residence halls were doing all these activities designed for freshman and meeting new people. What was I doing? I was just sitting in my fucking flat, alone. My flatmate was already gone, out with his girlfriend. I understand that they're gonna spend time together, but it was every waking second of every fucking day. I feel like I got scammed because we met up before school started and he made it sound like he was interested in doing shit together, when he really wasn't. There is only one first week of school. There is no redoing it. Everyone has their groups now, their friends and I'm just the outsider again. I don't know how I hung on. I just distracted myself with my school work and slaved away at it. I ended up getting a 4.0 last semester somehow.

&#x200B;

Now we're here. Spring semester of freshman year of university. It's not like I'm doing bad in my classes. Shit, I have straight A's. So you're wondering, what's the problem? I have 0 friends. I have no community. I have no group. I have no purpose for being here. I'm a computer science major and every time I tell someone that, they will say something like ""you're going to make a lot of money"". And guess what? I don't care about the money. I want a reason to exist. It doesn't matter if I do well in university and get a good job if I'm miserable like this. I'm just a fucking robot man. What's the point of slaving away now to get a job, then slave away 9-5 for the rest of my life? It will never get better. I've been trying. I really have. I'm seeing good results in the gym. I'm getting better grades. But it doesn't mean anything to me when I'm so empty like this. There's nothing left to look forward too, and I feel like I've already made up my mind. I'm gonna take myself out. I don't want too, but here's the alternative:

I have counseling options at my school etc etc.

If I tell them how I'm really feeling, they'll just send me away. I will not live with that stamp on my forehead. I refuse too. Meds won't do shit, the whole ""chemical imbalance"" thing is a lie. You're told that so you think its something that can be cured. I'll tell you why I'm fucking depressed. I HAVE NO ONE. Medicine doesn't fix that. All this shit that I'm typing out now doesn't even make sense, I know whoever is reading this (if anyone) is probably like ""what the fuck?"". So how do you think I would explain this to a counselor? If you are me, what do you do? I am not ""found out"" yet, so this first move is pretty important.

Lost my job, lost my only mode of transportation, I was trapped in a toxic household, and I had no friends, hardly any family. I had a plan. I was going to find my cat a great home, go to my favorite spot along the river, and hang myself on the bridge.

My life’s never been stable, when I was 5, my mom threw me in a tub of boiling hot water. When I was a teen, my main group of friends treated me like a joke and a doormat. As a young adult, I just question what’s the point in suffering so much if it all ends the same. I couldn’t argue with the fact that I lived my life stuck inside of a box, so I decided to not go through with it and see what a life where I’m more assertive and being myself despite what others think would be like.

I’ve become a different person since then, I’ve improved a lot, but I still just struggle to find enjoyment in my life. I’m just at my limit, something has to change, I wish the people around me actually showed they care as much as they say they do.

When things get difficult (i.e. a fight with my fiancée, or work stuff goes awry, or I can’t access my creativity when I need it for work… etc.) my mind goes straight to “it would just be easier to kill myself than to actually deal with this”. 

It sounds silly to put into words, but I practically fantasize about the idea of ending it and how it would be for the people I’m struggling with to be at my funeral, thinking of what they did to make me feel like this was my only option.

It seemed harmless at first, but it’s started getting to the point where it is my first go-to in my head. And I’ve been thinking more and more about HOW I would do it, rather than it staying as just a fantasy that would temporarily make me feel better.

It’s clear I have a hard time coping with things in a healthy way, but I’m not sure how to do better.

this post, like every other cry for help i have let out, will go unanswered. i won’t be surprised. i’m not special or different and neither is the pain i’m experiencing. i’m tired of being unnoticed and i’m really tired of being under supported. i only live because my mom would probably die without me. i’m tired of living this way, i’m tired of living.",1679418192.0

I am 40 years old and single.

When I was 20 years ago I had a series of extremely traumatic events happen to me and I was in a deeply vulnerable space.. The one person I had to rely on, my girlfriend at the time had been lying to me for months and was cheating on me.

Finding out was the most awful night of my life. It was revealed in a really cruel way. All her friends laughing at me behind my back on her birthday because they all knew. I looked like an idiot. Showing up with presents and gifts and having to take them all with me when the night ended. It was a disaster.

Anyway, years of rejection issues, anxiety, depression, failed relationships with other women that had invisible red flags - again, everything came out all at once that had been going on without my knowledge.

4 years ago I met someone that became my best friend. She's gay so I knew nothing was going to happen, it was great just to have a proper friend. We have both been single and dating and laughing about the terrible dates we've been on. 

She recently met someone and I couldn't be happier for her. But I'm pretty sure her new partner is anti men.

I woke up this morning to a huge long text from.my best friend listing all the things she doesn't like about me, things I have said or done that have weirdly been taken out of context - and that our relationship is weird and can't continue.

This is totally unexpected and out the blue. My genuine best friend who I love dearly has just decided that I'm awful and we can never see eachother again.

I can only assume that her partner has had words with her.

Some of the things I'm accused of saying make nonsense whatsoever.

Anyway. I am sad because I really valued this relationship. A genuine friend that I could rely on and have fun and honest chats with - suddenly gone.

I feel like I'm never going to meet anyone at my age for a relationship and the one person I was investing time in because it meant a lot to me has just disappeared as well.

I really didn't expect this and it's too much for me to handle right now.

I didn't expect this from my best friend. It's just another rejection and it's killing me. I have nobody else that close to me - what with financial issues, being in the middle of an INCREDIBLE non stop pain from surgery on my teeth (adult tooth never came through, so it's being pulled out with elastic attached to braces and a metal bar. I can't open my mouth and talk without pain, eat, sleep or smile.

I'm just done.
I'm done with this life really 
The little things I hold on to for comfort have slowly been eroded.

I'm afraid of my future and love life. I feel like I fail everyone and everything. I failed highschool and college. I know I am still young, but the motivation was drained from me. I can't be in crowded places due to my SA trauma, I can't touch anything due to my OCD. I am afraid of going outside because of my paranoia. I feel so trapped and I know I am the one who is holding me back.  


 I have almost everything I could ask for; home, substantial amount of money, friends who I think care for me. I have love and a cat. I don't have the right to end my life, but I am so paralyzed  by depression that I can't go a day without crying my heart out. I know I don't have the strength to carry on, so I am trying to make my friends happy by spending time with them, but it's hard when they are starting to notice I'm not the same as I use to be.   


I disappoint almost everyone I loved and cared for and I hate my self for that. I know I wont be able to find love that will last long, but I wish everyday for it. It feels like I am cursed with never ending heart break. I just want this pain and suffering to end and the only way it seems is death. I just want to be happy.",1679415559.0

First of all, I wish I hadn't started college so soon after high school. I wanted to take a year to myself and give me time to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. Unfortunately, my scholarships wouldn't allow that, and unless I went right after high school, I would not be able to receive that type of financial aid later. 

What made this a lot worse was that I was going through some bad moments in my life during that time. I needed to push a lot of my personal problems out of the way in order to focus on my school work, but it wasn't possible. No matter how hard I tried, I could never have enough free time to my self. Any amount of time I did have I couldn't ever concentrate hard enough to work on anything like I wanted to. I ended up making a high D in one of my classes while making A's and Bs in others last semester.

I promised myself I would do better this semester, but I'm fucking blowing it. Right now, I'm struggling in my English class because of this stupid shit that I choose to write and research about, but I can't find shit despite all of the resources I have at my disposal. I went to the tutoring center for help, but they're not helping me find any sources to use (all they tell me is to use websites I already know about). 

Every time I try to work on my essays, I get so overwhelmed because all I can keep thinking about is how I'm fucking everything up and that killing myself will make it stop. It's why I keep getting behind on my assignments because I get so upset just thinking about it. I don't know how to work on this fucking essay without having suicidal thoughts.

I could really use some help right now, cause I'm so lost.

I've been drinking and smoking so much for the past few weeks, its really starting to hurt me really bad. But, I think I just lost something special. So basically, I was in a relationship with this girl for around 4 months. We hit it off real good, right from the start. We used to hang around uni together, and it felt so perfect. I had to break it off with her, since I wasnt really looking for anything serious, and she insisted on only that. Ever since the beginning, and even during our relationship, she only prioritized friendship over us. It was always friends, friends, friends for her. We said we'd balance both, but somehow she didn't do anything much about us. She also had a lot of guy friends, that made me feel so bad about, but I never got the nerve to tell her about how that made me feel. Seeing her dancing with all those guys post breakup, sparked a different kinda anger in me. I know I ended this, but I was really hoping that we would atleast stay friends. I told her how much she meant to me, and even begged her to stay. 
I just ended up blocking her. Her birthday, is in a months time. Should I even bother wishing her?

Should I just let this die slowly? 
Should I move on?

I am 16 and I am constantly told ""oh I wish I could be 16 again life was so much easier then"" which is so scary to think about, I can barely survive right now let alone trying to survive if it's so much more harder when I'm older. I have been having to deal with my problems either by expressing them via notes app or joking about it to my friends as a coping mechanism. for years I have had multiple attempts all of which haven't worked or I have been to scared to go through with, cried myself too sleep to the point my pillow will be soaking wet from tears, I feel so hopeless I barely go to school and the school is trying to support me but I mentally cannot get out of bed or do simple things. I am so close to being kicked out of school with my attendance and have ruined any chance of having a successful career in the future. I applied for a job the other week but found out I didn't get it which is okay there will always be other jobs but it hurt to know the fact the one source of hope that I latched onto didn't work. My brain feels so foggy and the world around me is distorted to the point nothing feels real or I am living in a bubble away from interaction. I hang out with my friends and for a bit I am happy but then my social battery runs out and everything goes quiet again, I zone out so much that I can't be serious in conversations which then lead to arguments. I just feel so useless and I don't know how much longer I can cope with knowing how much of a burden I am to other people, and to myself.

Been suicidal for over a year but actively working on getting better these past 8 or so months. I ended up getting SSRIs pushed on me for 2 months which after a dose increase, resulted in a first attempt at my life. Decided to switch those out pretty quickly to a common SNRI (venlafaxine) which caused complete sexual dysfunction, more dysphoria, more emotional blunting and an increase in suicidal ideation. After 10 days I weened off those with doctor recommended weening instructions and had a nurse (my amazing partner) watching over me most of the time. Terrible withdrawals, night on the bathroom floor, couldn’t keep down a sip of water. Any hard drug withdrawal video you’ve seen that’s either IRL or Hollywood, it doesn’t do justice to how bad it actually feels. -1/10 experience. Would rather get beat up in elementary school again than go through that. 

Anyways flash-forward to yesterday. Finally got to see the psychiatrist for the first time and after 30 min got told “I think you’re Autistic (yeah, same!) and handed Desvenlafaxine to try for a month. Desvenlafaxine is used to treat Major Depressive Disorder and, correct me if I’m wrong here #pharmafam, *DESVENLAFAXINE IS THE END METABOLITE OF VENLAFAXINE, A DRUG IVE ALREADY REACTED POORLY TO* can someone here please shed some light on what to do here?

I do this sometimes for doing laundry, or brushing my teeth, or taking a walk: I make a “pact” with someone, and we all have to do it no matter what. It’s just the rules of the spell. I’ve isolated myself from everyone I know this past month, so I’ve come here this time. Let’s make a pact to live tommorrow— leave a comment or something, report back if you’d like.

 No Palouse Falls for me or for you . 

I was really in some kind of a mood too.  A really fun, no regrets kind of mood.  A f*ck you, here’s your damn tit shot kind of mood Dragonfly.  I’m so angry.  Just furious.  I should never rely/trust my husband to take the time to take care of me.  Not with even a car battery.  Its not just his fault of course, I’m an adult, I can figure out how to get it out and take it to buy a new one.  

But here’s the point.  Its my orgasm.  My responsibility.  Its not right to put that responsibility on a man, you know?  They don’t know what they’re doing, and neither do we.  So just, figure out what works and get it.  I literally seek pleasure, as my religion.  (Satanist) Why the f* am I still a sitting duck in such a gorgeous lake?  I’m so slow in the head man.  

It’s fun to publish my fall from grace in real time.  What else am I supposed to do?  Go ask one of the, what twenty car and truck owners in my vicinity (I’m “stranded” at a gas station and resturant lol) for a jump?  

Naw.  I need to just sit here and chill out.  I told my husband last night, I don’t think I should drive home tomorrow, because you know, head trauma, and he didn’t care.  All he cared about was getting the new dishwasher.  

Guess what dude?  I’m not like you.  I’m not okay.  You use our son as a weapon against me to force me to be okay.  I know you dont mean it, you don’t even know you’re doing it, but fuck.  I would leave you if I could.  I would just go and try to die somewhere, fail and come back.  You and him are gonna be fine.  You’re wealthy.  You have everything you want.  You’ll be heartbroken,maybe even become like me, like us.  Depends on if I killed myself, or cheated on you and forced your hand.  One would be far more damaging to you.  

You bought me.  You bought me with that cruise, with that sentiment of, hmm, if he thinks we’re okay, then I should just let it go.  Yeah, well, I’d take all that money on quality marriage counseling over two weeks in Hawaii to celebrate ten years.

So it all started, at 17 I finally achieved my goal weight of 80 lbs ( I was anorexic and bulimia for 4 years). I wasn't too insecure at all, I didn't compare myself to other girls. I had self harm scars that healed but no stretch marks or loose skin, a flat belly, tiny waist, etc. Well then I git pregnant, that all changed. My body is dramatically different than before I had my son, it didn't help that I was cheated on back to back while I was pregnant and my live in bf would jerk off to porn with it on full blast as he moaned and all. He'd post pictures of sexy models on Facebook and my heart would just drop into my belly everytime...I look nothing like those girls. I'm very unattractive actually...that's why I'm fighting to stay alive everyday. My current bf is friends eith strippers and sex workers so he see salot of that, he's used his ex to make me jealous, even using that she has a business against me ( I didn't even finish HS and I had to do SW at 17 to survive while homeless)... don't attack my bf it's not his fault he prefers them over me... 

To paint u a mental picture I have black stringy damaged black hair in messy curls, dark brown eyes, an inch wide gap between my teeth, a muffin shaped body with no boobs or ass. Like a fridge, and stretch marks. I was bullied for my looks heavily from 6-12 grade, the bullies would make Instagram hate pages using unflattering pictures of me to diminish my appearance and personality despite always being a sweetheart...I never went to prom, nor was I ever asked out to prom, guys usually ignored me in real life/ highschool...I was always the butt of the joke, and now it still feels like I am.

These intensely conflicting feelings have been making me feel really suicidal lately. I've been feeling so depressed, it hurts. I don't talk to either of my parents. And talking to the rest of my family about this doesn't feel like much of an option as they are so emotionally unintelligent/unempathetic that talking to them about things like this usually makes me feel a lot worse. Parts of the suicidal ideation is to punish my family for traumatising me so much and being so unhelpful. The only school councillor at my university left recently too and it will take months for them to find a replacement for her. I keep hoping that a friend or someone will reach out and check up on me and every time I go outside, I keep hoping that I'll run into someone who shows that they care.

she had plasma and platelets infused. she needed her husband to accompany her to the bathroom. she was always vomitting because her body rejected food. i felt embarrassed when she asked why was i there, how do i tell someone who's trying to get healthier and suffered so much that i did all of this to myself. i lied and said i had some stomach ache.

but i think she knew, she's been dealing with it all her life. my blood was drawn every few hours day and night for a few days, she knew.

Hello, I'm 19. My fear centers around what I did 2 years ago. Growing up, I had unregulated internet access starting from age 7. At around age 8-9, I first discovered porn. I started masturbating around 9, I didn't actually know how to do it properly, but I knew to hide it from my parents. I would watch porn on low volume and get off that way.

From ages 11-15, I was a complete porn addict, I looked at it almost every day, sometimes several times a day, I even looked at drawn porn without even being horny. All this to say, my views on NSFW and porn have been completely fucked.

At age 11, I made friends with a 12 year old who I'll refer to as A. A and I didn't become best friends until a year later when I was 12-13 and they were 13-14. I can't remember exact ages.

Anyway, me and A would make sex jokes, a *lot,* mainly I made sex jokes. I'd talk about sex, we'd share fanfiction and porn, nothing was off limits. Our favorite thing to do was make fun of fetish art, so I was aware of way more fetishes than I should've been at age 11-13. In general, I knew about every sex act there was at age 13-14, which was my fault. Looking back, I'm so ashamed that I knew extreme shit when I was only a child.

Having all that porn available to me at a young age definitely fucked up my mind, but I can't blame anyone but myself, because no one forced it on me, I found it myself.

With the context out of the way, here's the actual problem.

When I was 16, I entered this new friend group which was mostly teens, with the occasional adults. It was a roleplaying group, text RP. We'd make characters and write our dramatic stories, collaborative storytelling pretty much. I mostly hung around these other 15-16 year olds. Then I started to make friends with this person who I didn't know the age of. We'll call this person B. When I turned 17, B had their birthday too, turns out we were almost exactly 2 years apart and B was 15.

We quickly became friends. I didn't really think about the age difference between us because when I was younger, I always had friends who were much older. I was best friends with a 16 year old at 10-11, was friends with a 17 year old at 10-11, was friends with a 13 and 15 year old at 12, made friends with 20 year olds at 16. My parents always tried to force my sister and I to be friends with each other and she's 7 years older than me, I also think she may have some maturity issues, but whatever. All this not to say that I knew B and I had an age gap, rather I didn't think me and B had a significant age gap at all. I thought inappropriate behavior was only things like the 24 year old who tried to showed me NSFW unprompted at 16 (that incident scared the shit out of me), I didn't know that a 2 year age gap could be bad.

The two year gap between me and B barely registered. A and I had a 1.5 year age gap ourselves so when I was 15, A was 17 too, that certainly didn't stop us from talking about porn and all that. Besides that, B had a long-time friend who was 3 years older than them. I just didn't see our age gap as wrong at all, I thought it was normal.

The problem? This particular friend group made sex jokes and talked about sex a lot. It wasn't the adults though, it was the teens with each other. We would make cum, dick, penis, boob, and MILF jokes all the time. We'd ironically say shit like ""I'm creaming my pants."" I don't know why I say 'we,' despite my past, I actually didn't make a lot of sex jokes, B even remarked they thought I was a prude at first. But I did start to make them too eventually. Before you ask, I'm 100% sure we were all virgins. I was and I still am.

But it gets worse, when I was 17 and B was still 15, we'd talk about our characters having sex because they were in a relationship and we'd even write it out (only us and a couple other friends close in age saw it). It was in the third person and these characters were adults, *not* self inserts, very different from us, but it's still wrong. I can't believe I did that, I'm really ashamed. B did that with B's other friend too (who was 16), I thought it was fine because we were all teens. Looking back, I think B was too young and I shouldn't have done that, I didn't register that at the time. Now I know that 15 is really young even if I was addicted to porn way before then. Apparently B had roleplayed things like that before with their peers at 12, I don't know what's up with that though.

Outside of this, we talked about SFW topics quite frequently and talked pretty much everyday, we were best friends and I saw B as a peer. Our relationship wasn't purely sexual, it was mostly us asking each other for advice, helping each other out, and talking like teens do. Later on, we actually ended up dating when B was around 15.5 and I was 17.5, B was my first partner, I was B's third serious one. Most of our relationship was when we were 15-17 and 16-18. I never thought B was hot or wanted to have sex with them, I thought B was cute (and B thought I was cute) and I wanted to hold their hand and celebrate Valentine's together, sex didn't even come into it. I never talked about us having sex, we never did anything sexual except those damn talks about our characters.

We eventually broke up and now a year after the relationship, I feel like a creep and I regret this time of my life a lot. I was pretty immature then too, I definitely shouldn't have been in a relationship. I keep hearing people say 15 and 17 is pedophilic and that it's grooming. I asked my therapist and she said my relationship wasn't, that grooming had to be intentional and that it was deliberate manipulation for your own self interest, which I didn't do. I just don't know. Also, since I know some people may bring it up, I'm not concerned about legality since it was legal for us because of close-in-age exemptions, that law's for physical sexual activity anyway, which we didn't have. It's the social aspect, like if I'm a groomer or if people will see me like one.

I have taken steps to improve myself, I now know that what I did is wrong. I don't interact with anyone younger than 18, most of the people I talk to are 19 like me or in their 20s. These days, I'm always ashamed of feeling sexual attraction because I feel like my capacity for it led me to do this fucked up shit, I want to become celibate and just end every urge for good. I feel disgusting.

I've been researching a ton of shit too, like how harmful age gap relationships are for teens, but every source I find says ""sexual contact with a person above 2 years in age might contribute to risky behavior for teens"" or something like that, and I can't tell if they mean above 2 years or 2 years and more. Or they research age gaps in teens and come to the conclusion it's risky for relationships between teens with a three year gaps or more, which doesn't apply to my situation. I wish I could ask every psychologist/therapist in the world what they think about my relationship.

If I'm really a groomer who hurt B, I should kill myself, I don't want to have hurt B in that way. I'm ashamed my fucked up childhood led me to do something like that. I know people who got called out for equal to the shit I did. If I ever get a callout done on me, I probably deserve it. I feel so disgusting, I want to die.

I'm the only person I know who's suicidal because they're a terrible person, I just don't know what to do because every advice for those depressed and suicidal is realizing their worth or some shit. My issue is that I'm genuinely an awful fucked up person and no amount of redemption or helping others is gonna fix that. People in my life always tell me I'm so sweet and positive. I feel like I'm lying to them, they don't know this disgusting part of my life, I should die so no one has to deal with me. I should die so I don't disappoint anyone and ruin their perception of me.

I'm moving to a high-rise apartment in a few months which means I can actually kill myself soon. It's getting harder and harder not to, it'll only take a few seconds. The only thing stopping me is that I feel like I owe a lot of money to my parents for raising me, so I should pay them back before ending my life, else I'll just be a waste of money.",1679389709.0

I’ve felt pressure lately to be more social, meet new people, maybe try to make a friend, but every attempt has gone poorly.

I've been in therapy ever since and although I'm much better, I'm still confused whether or not I was faking it or not. I'm wondering if I'm in denial of being a manipulative and toxic person or if I'm being gaslighted.

252,Catharsis,1,11xd4wb,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11xd4wb/catharsis/,2,"I don’t think my brain works correctly. Lately I find myself experiencing more and more of my life from the passenger seat, as if I’m on autopilot and I am completely unable to control what I say and do. I might have some dissociative disorder or it may be a symptom of my depression, I’m not sure. Either way, I keep watching my life unfold like a slow motion train wreck as I continue to act in an impressively self destructive manner.

I grew up in a fundamentalist Christian household that viewed the lifestyles of LGBTQ people as nothing more than an abhorrent and sinful choice; our church would preach that all liberalism was wrong and anti-Christian. In this environment I made the lamentable decisions to develop gender dysphoria and to harbor feelings for other boys, though I was assigned male at birth. I believe that’s why I hate almost everything about myself. My voice, my face, my body, my name, my life, I loathe me and I constantly wish I would die. While I’ve always had these passive suicidal ideations, lately I find myself doing strange things to try and increase my chances of a fatality—like counting how long I can keep my eyes closed while flying down the freeway at a hundred miles an hour. The most pathetic part to me is that I came out to my siblings over a decade ago, and they all accepted me, but I’ve never had the courage to tell the world, or even my parents. I’m sure everyone who matters would accept me, but I am a coward—I’m too scared to talk to a therapist lest I be locked in a psychiatric ward like some of my other family members.

Anyways, I’m a PhD Candidate and I just went to a conference and gave a mediocre talk on some esoteric subject matter and it hit me that… this is it. My only contribution to posterity will be a couple of papers, conference talks, and a thesis, all given under the name of a person I despise. So, I had a nervous breakdown and, after a few days of crying, I went and had the very surreal experience of buying a Glock 17. A part of me wanted to just tell the people that I was crazy, but I just watched as autopilot took over. Now I’m waiting on my background to clear as I scream into the void. I thought the resolve would make me feel better, but I still spend my days crying; I feel like I've lost my mind. Thank you for allowing me this cathartic rant…",1679395101.0

It’s a specific type of agony which I have grown acquainted with, but when I’m sad, I still have reprieve in knowing that I’m not alone, and that others can support me, that life still gods on and that the world is alright, even if I’m not.

I wish I could say the same thing about fear.

I have paranoid personality disorder (PPD), a Cluster A personality illness which makes me particularly susceptible to paranoid and anxious thoughts and delusions. Even if completely irrational, completely unrealistic, and bereft of any sense of reasoning or understanding, I still can’t make the thoughts go away. They cling onto me like glue, and never let go until they’ve abated for some time, awaiting the next time they can return.

It chews away at every aspect of my life. My friends, my girlfriend, people I meet online, random strangers I’ve never met, people who walk by me in the straight. I find difficulty fully trusting them, in fact I’d say I probably don’t fully trust anyone. When the paranoia reaches a crescendo, it can cause physical effects on me too. My heart weighs down and begins beating faster, my skin grows warmer, my movement becomes erratic, and my throat becomes dryer.

And then there’s the particularly bad episodes. Ones where it causes me to have a panic attack due to an existential fear of Solipsism, or the idea that my partner is cheating on me despite evidence proving otherwise, or that all my friends are working together to deceive and manipulate me for sadistic benefit.

Any time someone asks me how my day has been or if I’m doing okay, I become suspicious and question them on why they’re asking. These compulsive desires also manifest in other ways, such as me asking my friends to explain why they suddenly paused halfway through the convo. Most likely they simply went to grab water or their mother called, but my brain refuses to dismiss the possibility that they went away to discuss what I had just said to them with the other people they’re working with.

I find it hard to take compliments sometimes because to me that that feels as though it reinforces my paranoia. If I wanted to manipulate and conspire against someone for years, I’d also attempt to be as unconditionally nice to them as I can.

To me, this fear, this paranoia, this existential horror and lack of trust in even the fundamentality of the universe, to me, that’s a type of Hell that my depression wishes it could be half as torturous as. 

It’s like a fire that burns away any sense of clarity or safety in your life. It makes even the simplest friendships ambiguous, makes you question the very nature of your existence until you’re left panicking on the floor, and never once allows you to live with the peace of mind that everything is exactly how it seems. 

For me, it’s always like this.",1679391912.0

It wasn't mutual, I've wanted to get back together from the moment he said it. I was super needy for about 5 days until he sternly told me to stop.

I tried everything to get back together but it didn't work. Extensive and genuine apologies, not blaming him, understanding his perspective, promising and showing action that I am going to be better in the near future. Nothing worked.

Since then I've done what he wants. We don't discuss the relationship, something I actually initiated, and I don't act needy or say anything about getting back together. 

We still text all day everyday, with joy, even just when talking about mundane stuff. We will see eachother each weekend within our friend group and spend time together. 

I am still moving towards getting back together, no matter what he says. He still cares about me and wants to be friends, but says he doesn't love me and doesn't want to date me.

I'm getting through the days with that faint hope. I'm working on myself with therapy, medication and a new, much better job. Hopefully he will come back to me, but I seriously doubt it at this point.

In a few months he will probably have forgotten all about me and be happy on his own, while I still cry every night for hours and think about killing myself. 

My routine everyday is this: wake up from a dream about him, feel depressed/cry a little, go to work, think hopeful and confident thoughts, get off work, neglect my self care, cry for 3 or 4 hours and then eventually sleep for 5 hours. 

If we don't get back together, I've decided to kill myself. Most nights I don't even want to wait anymore. I think part of me is convinced he's never coming back and I should save myself the trouble. 

Life is just horrible everyday and I'm so exhausted. I don't feel happy or any good emotion at all unless I'm talking to him. I'm filled with constant anxiety and depression.

278,I feel like a blight to everyone in my life and that my future is doomed because I am a former sexual abuser.,2,11x6uyy,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11x6uyy/i_feel_like_a_blight_to_everyone_in_my_life_and/,0," In a relationship I had as a teenager, I was sexually abusive to my partner. Most of this comprised of me repeatedly asking them to make out, persisting when they said, ""No,"" until they would eventually relent. When we discussed this behavior after breaking up, they said they did not characterize what I did as sexual abuse. But I understand that can change--they might eventually change their mind and want to tell other people I sexually abused them. If so, I would be more than willing to affirm the truth and deal with the consequences of my actions.

There is one particular incident that we have never discussed. I learned recently that I have a type of parasomnia called ""sexsomnia"". I believe I had an episode of this the first time we shared a bed when we were on a vacation together without parents. I don't remember much because it began when I was asleep and I only came to for a few moments before falling asleep again, but what I do remember is aggressive dry humping on my part. I fear that I might have done something much worse, but I don't know at all. Not to say that what I remember doing wasn't bad--it was very bad.

I wish I could reach out to my ex-partner about this. I want to apologize and offer to do whatever they want to help make it right--pay for therapy that they might have needed, tell mutual friends what happened, affirm their story if they want to tell it. However, I don't want to bring up any trauma they don't want to deal with right now. Furthermore, they might still not consider what I did to be sexual abuse and therefore find it strange that I reached out about it. So I feel stuck where I can't do anything about this except for contribute to sexual abuse prevention charities like RAINN.

I feel like I am implicitly lying to my friends and family. I have distanced myself from my and my ex-partner's mutual friends. My ex had already stopped hanging out with that group for other reasons, but I want to give them the space to return to that group if they wish. I also don't want my old friends to spend time and energy and affection on me, not knowing that I am a sexual abuser.

I feel like I'm lying to my family, too. I don't want anyone to unwittingly spend time and affection on a sexual abuser. I believe that one of my siblings in particular would be disgusted to learn what I had done and regret their affection for me. And I totally understand that. I desperately wish I could just tell my family what I did so they can make informed decisions about their relationships with me, but then they will probably reach out to my ex to ask them about it when my ex is not ready or comfortable to talk about it. I am considering options for alienating myself from my family, as well.

I am in a committed relationship, and my partner knows this aspect of my past. They have accepted me, but I don't think they understand the possible ramifications this could have for our future. I feel like I have a responsibility to not have children, because one day out of the blue it might become public that their parent is a former sexual abuser. That would be hell for a child to go through. And when this information becomes public, my partner could face serious scrutiny for willingly having a relationship with a former sexual abuser. I don't want them to go through that. I have been thinking lately that I should end our relationship for their sake.

I am in a career training program, and I feel like I'm implicitly lying to my colleagues and mentors. What if all the energy they invest in me is in vain because it eventually becomes public I am a sexual abuser, and my career is halted? My colleagues are becoming my friends--but I don't want them to unwittingly befriend a sexual abuser. They will be properly disgusted with me when they find out. I'm considering leaving this program so they never have to deal with that.

Even if I leave my family and friends and this program, I have to have a job and some semblances of professional relationships to live. My continued existence will always involve other people unwittingly interacting with a disgusting sexual abuser. I have considered suicide, but I am opposed to that outcome for multiple reasons. First I seriously fear the physical pain that comes with death. Second, it would just cause more pain and problems for other people. I don't want to cause pain to other people. Even if my family knew what I had done and hated me, I believe my suicide would still cause them grief and confusion and pain--not relief. And, if it was not yet public I sexually abused my ex, I would have to think of a plan for affirming their story posthumously. I could write a letter to them that they could share when they're ready, but what if people disbelieve them or accuse them of lying or forging the letter? Or people do believe them, but then blame them for my suicide?

Sometimes I wish I would just die of natural causes or be hit by a car or something. If a magical genie offered to make it so that I had never existed, I would agree without hesitation. I know that, in some ways (maybe many ways), I bring goodness and joy into other people's lives. But my past actions are always lurking there as a time bomb. Nothing I can do can change what I did or who I am. I feel like having committed sexual abuse has indelibly marked me.

I feel like, as a perpetrator, I do not deserve any help. But I understand that to mitigate the pain I cause people in the future, I need to get therapy. I started therapy recently and my therapist says this is all OCD. Maybe I have OCD and that's making me blow this out of proportion, but it doesn't change what I did and I don't know any other way to think about this. Any time I see commentary about sexual abuse, no grace is extended to perpetrators--and I agree with that. I don't believe any grace should be extended to me.

I just don't want to cause pain to other people. But because of a particular way I hurt someone in the past, I will bring pain-waiting-to-unfold to anyone I love. I don't wish this manner of existence on anyone. Maybe this itself is my ""karmic"" punishment for what I did. I deserve the way I feel. I feel like a pathetic nothing complaining about this to strangers. I don't know why I want to be heard when I don't deserve to be. But thank you for reading. I appreciate any and all thoughts you might have to share.",1679373333.0

I have a cat named pepsi, he is a black Norwegian forest cat. I have two older siblings, a dad, a mom and multiple cousins/other relatives.

My favorite colors are White, Green, Pink and Purple. no specific order.

Some of my favorite songs are Genesis, What You Waiting For?, Claus, Good Looking, Plantasia, Why Do I Cry, A Cruel Angels Thesis, Ana Le Habiby, QKThr, Blue Monday, Enjoy The Silence, 4ÆM, Who Is She?, Rock Me Amadeus, Alberto Balsalm, Sega Sunset, Aint No Fun, Dreamcore//, Rayquaza Ex, Swimming Pool, Deceptacon, Blue Monday, The Descent, Dead God Graveyard, Goodnight Dad I Love You, Everybody Wants To Rule The World, 180db_[130], Oblivion, and Mice On Venus.

 I have a close friend whos name i will call A.A. we have known each other for about 5 years now, we became friends in a weird way, but i love him. He has always been there for me, supporting me through times when i questioned my identity, and the few times I've questioned my sexuality.

 I have diagnosed ADHD, Autism, Anxiety and Depression.

Im a Trans, Gay, Aroace and Hypersexual man. I have already  managed to do temporary damage to my genitals and i am probably going to end up unable to have children (which i didnt want in the first place).

 I have been too the hospital before for a suicide attempt of poisoning myself around 2 years ago.

 My special intrest is space. Its been my special intrest since i can remember existing.

Recently i started some new ADHD pills and Antidepressants, which have made me incredibly tired. Way too tired. I dont know how to handle it since i already was too tired to go to school, go outside, take care of myself and lots of other things. 

Yesterday i decided i couldn't take it anymore, and i have begun to neglect important parts of my routine. Such as eating (which is partially due to the pills ruining my appetite completely), talking to my family, friends and really anyone, but the only thing my mom seema to care about: taking my pills. which include ADHD pills, Antidepressants, Period stoppers, Melatonin and some normal vitamins.

My mom also has decided to put me on a diet because im ""too big"" and i need to eat healthier. Normally the food the makes is the opposite of healthy. The pills have also made it very hard for me to eat alot of things i consider heavy. Such as Bread, Meat, Rice, Fish, Chicken, Anything that includes cream, Cheese, Chocolate, Potatoes, and Pasta/ most things including flour. I have resulted to mostly eating things such as chips and vegetables. Only.

My mom and my sister went to the store yesterday. When they came home i asked why they didnt tell me they went, because i wanted chips. My mom then responded ""yeah i thought about you, but i wasnt gonna buy you chips. You're too big."" Infront of my entire family. I immediately went up to my room and locked myself in my closet. I think this situation might have been what caused me to crack. 

I simply cannot take it anymore. Ive already texted what i need to say to A.A. i on the other hand refuse to leave any texts or anything to my entire family except for my dad, who i will not be messaging until im fully sure that i wont fail with my attempt this time.

Im not here for any help, i just needed somewhere to go.

It is currently 10:22 PM where i am in sweden. I dont think im making it too far into tomorrow morning.

My dipshit father who loves to control us, has gone on another tantrum rage again. Me and my brother came out as wanting to commit, and this dipshit just threatened my brother and ignored me. WTF? This bitch is literally the reason we're both trying to kill ourselves and he just threatens and ignores us? Anyway he took away our phones (for me I use my phone to call my friends so they can help me when my mental health is getting worse, I don't know about my brother), and before he took some other shit away saying he owned this house and could do anything his bitch ass wanted. That's one of the only big mistakes my mom has made. Quitting her job so this fuckwad has total control of everything. Now he just abuses us mentally and when we break he just threatens to take more shit away if we do anything ever again. We always have to play along like we're his fucking playthings. I would love for my parents to get a divorce so we an get away from this psychological piece of shit, but I'm really scared that he might get custody. My mom hasn't worked in 20 years, and my dad has a prestigious job. And it's not even like he can't just get a new girl to fall for his games. Once he even said that so many girls hotter than my mom could just line up for him, but he's not that kind of guy. FUCK. YOU. The only reason he's letting us stick around is because he doesn't want to look bad in the eyes of his own fucked up family, and I sometimes still play his fucking game in hopes of him not kicking me out of the fucking house. Now, I'm tired. I don't care if he does that or not. Either way, I'll probably be found dead, splattered on the side of a high story building, and if you're reading this by any chance, FUCK YOU I HOPE YOU DIE A TERRIBLE FUCKING DEATH

I'm so sorry for all the cursing. My mom and brother want me to look on the bright side and not anger the piece of shit thats tainting our entire family. We don't really have much other than 40k he promised to give us. If I got my hands on the money owed to me and my brother, I'm taking the first flight out of New Jersey to somewhere new with the rest of my family and I'm getting a job. Hopefully they get a divorce and can see what he's doing to me and my brother. Then, we'll have a lot more than 40k and the mother fucking bitch thats tearing my soul in half will finally leave.

I'm 25 years old and my life is going nowhere. I only just realised this year, after flopping my A levels (threw up during the exams and couldn't finish), flopping my A level resits (threw up again and couldn't finish), failing the first yr of one degree, being unable to complete the dissertation of another degree after botching the third yr, having my work contract renewal revoked after making stupid mistakes, and spending £2000 on automatic (meant to be the easy option!) driving lessons but being nowhere close to test standard that I probably have ADHD.

Now I'm unemployed (but not seeking benefits), have deferred my dissertation until further notice, still living at the mercy of my parents, am unmarried at spinster age (I'm an Asian woman) and am waiting on the GP to get back to me after filling out a symptom form, but I've been waiting five weeks now when it was only meant to take two. Every week I call the receptionist, get told that I'll be contacted soon, and wait like a mug by my phone for a call that never comes.

I can't get a graduate job until I finish my degree, can't finish the degree until I can focus on something for more than 15 minutes at a time (so I need ADHD meds). I can't get a regular job until I learn how to drive (small town with few jobs to go around, so I need to drive to surrounding areas), but I can't pass a driving test until I can focus on driving for more than 15 minutes at a time (so I need ADHD meds). I'll never have children because I don't want to pass my ADHD and possible autism on to an innocent child, but I'm too retarded to raise an adopted child anyway and no man from my culture will accept an adopted child when he can have a biological one; I can't marry outside my culture because then I'll be disowned by my only support system. No one would marry me anyway except to get a UK visa (and my parents are only too willing to sell me off).

What's the point? I hear some people have to wait seven years for a diagnosis on the NHS. I hear the NHS doesn't always recognise private diagnoses, so bye-bye to reduced prescriptions on the NHS and hello to buying them at full price with no job. I'm so fucking tired. The longer I'm out of work, the bigger my CV gap gets, and I can't provide references for my last job anyway because I'm too socially retarded to ask for a supervisor's contact number. What the fuck is the point.

My parents think I'm overreacting every time I have a breakdown due to emotional dysregulation (common in ADHD and autism), but they won't shut the fuck up and leave me alone until I tell them what's wrong, leading to the said breakdown. My mother smiles when I have a breakdown because she finds it so ridiculous, and my father has nothing useful to say. No one gets what the fuck ADHD is and they don't care.",1679336270.0
291,Im Scared,2,11x4whg,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11x4whg/im_scared/,1,"I cant get the intrusive thoughts out of my head. I wake up every morning and the first thing that comes to mind are thoughts of self harm and suicide. There are days where the majority of my thoughts are spent thinking about hurting myself. Anytime spent outside of my room my mind quickly scans for all the possible ways to end my life: jumping off a cliff, crashing my car, drowning. The only thing I can do is to try to drown out my thoughts with music. Its only a matter of time before I actually go through with it, within a few weeks is my best estimate.

I began carrying around a bottle of sleeping aid pills last week, enough to kill me or at least mess me up bad. Along with a folding knife and a razor blade, incase I feel like making myself bleed instead.

This is starting to affect my life now and I am deeply tired. I no longer feel like working, and very demotivated in my college studies. I was late to class last week because I spent 30 minutes laying in bed with a knife in one had and pills in the other. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. I already had trouble focusing and this isn’t helping. My homework is piling up and my grades are plummeting. I spent 20 minutes trying to remember what my name is 2 days ago.

Ive spent the last 4 months depressed and at this point anything that brings me joy feels like its only a distraction. I always end up in the same spot, lonely and depressed. I find myself crying multiple times a week, sometimes even multiple times in a day.

At least I can say that Ive been self harm free for 60 days at this point and no longer feel an urge to do so. But even that is starting to feel difficult.

Im in the process of getting help, but it feels too little too late. My psychiatric assessment isn’t until April 6th but at least Ive been seeing a therapist. Yet the therapist called out sick 2 weeks ago and that is where my slowly improving mental health took a nose dive. Followed by my friend’s suicide attempt.

All this just adds to my feelings of loneliness and isolation. I don’t feel like any of my friends are really my friends and I admit to most of it being down to me. And of the few that are: One lives half way across the world and I would hate to burden her with my suicidal tendencies after she recently dealt with her own. The other one and I are not on the best of terms and may as well be total strangers (Absolutely heartbroken from this and is essentially my fault). The only thing that has helped me is spending time with my brother. Even then those moments are sparse.

I feel like I am slowly fading away and I just want to get it over with. Besides my brother and my friends, there is not much tethering me to this world. Its quite ironic that I aspire to be a geologist yet all I wish is to be removed from the Earth.

because of an accumulation of different reasons

1. I'm social inept
 I've always had this inherent flaw. I'm excruciatingly shy and very awkward. I
don't really know how to weave my way through a conversation. It also doesn't help that I have asburgers. I think my shyness has been perceived as dullness.

2. My mental health history
I have severe depression and anxiety. Last semester I was
placed in a psychiatric hospital and I opened up about it with some of my coworkers. I think that information has spread to my other coworkers causing people to think I'm mentally
challenged.

3. I'm not quick witted
I'm not particularly clever, or fast. I've always been behind in this sense

4. I'm immature for my age.
I'm 22 but I act 15. I'm very goofy at times, and I joke about childish
things.

5. I act different then most people.
This is more due to my diagnoses but I certainly do act a little strange sometimes.

I'm very apprehensive about all this but it extends beyond just this. I'm worried about my life. I'm going to switch majors and I'm not sure I'm smart
enough. I'm 22 and never had a real girlfriend and I'm worried if I ever will get one because everyone thinks I'm stupid. And ultimately I'm worried I'm going to end my life before I find out if it will ever
work out.",1679348446.0

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Hello to anyone reading this,

&#x200B;

Please do not feel bad for me or question how you could have done things differently because, quite frankly, the web that I am entangled in is one of my own creation and is the culmination of 2 decades of screwups and failures on my part. Also, if it makes you feel better, please know that I am better off now and that I haven't even been living for a while, just surviving. I don't consider wallowing in bed, crying, forcing myself to eat and repeating that cycle to be living nor is that the life I wanted to live.

&#x200B;

I don't want to beat around the bush so I'll address the burning question: Why did I do it?

There are a plethora of reasons but I'll just cover the few that had the most influence over my mental calculus to do what I did.

1.) Academics: Unfortunately, due to some mental health issues, I have fallen very far behind on lectures and assignments in two of my classes and I don't know if there's time to catch up. This semester is probably one of the most pivotal semesters of my academic career since I must declare my major at the end so while it's easy to say that not doing well in some classes ""isn't the end of the world"" it sure feels like it especially since this isn't the only thing that factored into my decision to do what I did. That said, I take full responsibility for falling behind and accept that I am a failure and have nothing but myself to blame.

2.) I don't think I belong on this planet: I feel like, wherever I go, I have to put on a mask and I can never really be myself and like no one would notice if I disappeared suddenly. Also, in general, I feel like the society we live in isn't for me. Even if I somehow survive until graduation and graduate, I don't know how I'm getting a good job with my disability but I also don't want to be more of a financial burden to my parents. If, after I die, I'm reincarnated into a better society, that would be great but, even if I simply ceased to exist and never reincarnated, that would be preferable to this current existence. Additionally, I'm a massive burden to anything and anyone that associates with me: An environmental burden to the planet, an emotional burden to my friends and anyone I'm close to, and a financial burden to my family. If I died, a few people might be temporarily hurt but, in the long run, they'll all realize that they're much happier and better off without me.

3.) I just feel really exhausted and drained and don't know if I can ever find long term happiness.

I can't seem to tell anyone about anything and uhm it's getting really fucking hard. Its been roughly 6 years since i started thinking about killing myself and at first i had many reasons not to. I used to be a muslim, a faithful one but in time i lost the faith as nothing got better. Only thing i have left now is my parents. I just can't do it while they are still alive. My mom has a lot of mental problems, which effected my life more than i ever thought and im only realising them now. And uhm my dad has a heart condition so im scared if i do end it he might have a heart attack. So what i did instead of ending it was hurting myself. I have quite a few marks on my legs. Honestly I thought i was getting better after one of my relationships ended in 2021 november. At first it was pretty shit. I failed most of my courses in school and fucked up bunch of other stuff. Around the summer of 2022 I started getting better, started working out and stuff. Then I met someone in September. It felt like fucking heaven. I was feeling fucking loved and cared for and i thought that i can finally fucking trust someone and open up and let them in. But I was fucking wrong apparently lol. Our relationship ended at the end of this January. She broke me into a shit tons of pieces and then left me because i was too broken to fix and she didnt wanna be with me if i killed myself so yeah she left. Its been 1.5 months and i thought i was handling it alrigbt but im not. Every singlr fucking shit is going downhill. Im facing a lawsuit with my hpuse owner and i might lose the house and if i do i cant afford to move into another one because it's expensive af. Im failing at school and i cant seem to get myself to do fuck all about it. Im losing friends and the ones im not losing im slowly distancing from them because i cant talk to them cuz im afraid of telling them how much i am actually tired. And i cant seem to find someone to fucking love. I have lived all my life for my family. Ever since i can remember clearly i have been trying to make them feel better, take care of them when they fall down and i am so fucking tired. I cant fucking take it anymore. I feel like a huge failure. I fucked up my relationship. She wasnt perfect but she was perfect for me and i fucked it up. I fucked up school. I fucked up my relationship with my family friends. I fucked up everything and i cant fucking live with myself. I cant fucking sleep and when sleep i get nightmares about killing myself all the time. And she was the last and only thing that was giving me strength and hope and i fucking lost her. Everything feels so pointless and hard and i dont wanna keep going. Im scared of taking professional help cuz if i get prescribed with some heavy shit it would get in the way of me finding a job and idek why the fuck am i worried about it because i know if i fucking dont i will end up kms which means thst i wont even have a future to worry about finding a damn fucking job. I am tired of bottling everything up so that i look strong and people dont feel like im a burden to them. I fucking hate it. I fucking hate waking up every single day. I pray to fucking go to sleep and not wake up every night but it doesn't happen. Sometimes it gets so fucked up that i wish my parents were dead so i could kill myself as well. My head is all over the fucking place and idk why am i even writing this post. I just fucking miss her so much and i wish i could have a second chance. But she fucking hates me for idk why. I tried loving her as best as i could. I just wanted love her and idk how i fucked up. Idk why am i such a big failure idk why i was born why im still here. Im just a burden to everyone around me and i wish they would all just fuck off so i can finish it and find some peace. I am really tired.",1679364217.0

I been through a lot this pass couple of years unfortunately. Before in the pass when I was feeling suicidal I was feeling somewhat confident in doing the task. I even planned it out and everything. 

Now I don’t. Because I talked to someone about it. I didn’t necessarily say it but they were able to pick up on it. They said something to me that stuck on me. Which was “ once you gone you won’t come back and you’ll never get to experienced the things you want to do”. 

I absolutely hate her for that. Because it’s true. I had no regrets and I was ready. Now because she said that I realized all the things that I haven’t did yet ( I’m young ). I haven’t really lived. So that is one reason as to why I haven’t done it. I eventually found hope again to live. 

Now another reason is even though I felt suicidal I didn’t felt it first hand. Meaning I prefer to get into a accidentally death. As in getting ran over, falling off something than me doing the job myself. Only one time I had confidence of doing the job.

Out of kindness, I replied with some words of comfort, after a while we started messaging, and have kept in touch since. Like everyone, he's had good days and bad days, but lately things have taken a darker turn and I’m realizing I’m probably in over my head. For a while our conversations never involved suicide, and I know I’m not really equipped to help people struggling with those thoughts, but now it’s come up a few times and I’m starting to feel like I could be in danger of inadvertently saying the wrong thing or somehow making the situation worse. My first inclination was to steer him in the direction of talking to parents or another trusted adult, calling a hotline, getting therapy, etc., but for several reasons nothing like that is not an option right now.

At this point, I’m completely committed to helping this kid get the help he needs and I won’t abandon him just because this situation has become more complicated than I originally anticipated. I started myself down this road, and I won’t give up until I know he’s safe or at least in the right hands. I don’t want to get into any details here, but I could really use some advice from anyone who understands how to talk to a very depressed / suicidal kid who is desperately searching for a reason to keep living.

I know i need help but i feel so stuck, Suicide seems like a rational solution at this point.",2,11x1vd1,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11x1vd1/16_any_form_of_my_self_esteem_self_love_and_self/,2,"Im currently in Highschool, i’ve gradually grown more and more anxious throughout the years and it has affected my life for the worse. This semester i began doing school completely online from a laptop due to my social anxiety, i’ve felt unmotivated and depressed. Schoolwork is not being completed on my behalf, and my grades are on the decline. It’s hard to care about school at all when i feel as though i won’t be alive to see the returns or any benefits from my years of work. 

I’ve developed unhealthy coping mechanisms to get me through day by day, I’ve found that cheap jokes help me skip around any meaningful or serious conversation, and that making out my entire personality to be nothing but a joke maker and “funny guy” gets me much further in relationships with people than just being myself. I know i also use jokes to lighten trauma and try to pretend like things don’t bother me. I always laugh at the things that hurt. 

I’ve developed numerous addictions during the past few years, I self harm regularly and can’t seem to stop, i just do it out of habit now, and it’s a hard habit to break. I recently stopped drinking but it’s been hard to resist going back to the bottles, i’ve been doing better with this though. Last off, i’ve never admitted this to anybody but i’m addicted to pornography, and out of the three this is the one i’m easily the most ashamed of. I feel absolutely pathetic for even typing that out, It hurts to know that the little kid i used to be is undoubtedly dead when i say something like that. I’m so fucking disappointed in myself. I feel disgusting for doing so, and i think this addiction alone is reason enough for me to off myself. 

I have a handful of friends who i talk to occasionally, all of which are online. Other than those occasional interactions i’m lonely. Id give my left fucking nut for a friend at this point. I miss socializing, but i think i’m too disconnected at this point. I’m probably pretty awkward by now, but it’s been so long since i’ve tried to make a friend i wouldn’t even know. It all just seems pointless. 

I’m miserable, and suicide just seems like the blatantly obvious answer. I know there are other solutions to all this but they all require so much effort, i’m far too unmotivated to even try. Some pills or a pump to my skull just seem like the quickest and easiest way to rid myself of these awful feelings. I don’t hate my life, i just hate myself.",1679359731.0

I've lived without even the most basic emotional intimacy for practically all of my life. She was the first person who nearly made me feel accepted. 

Yet the more I think about it, and maybe I've been thinking about it too much, I can't escape the notion that I was always a little disposable to her. Now maybe she didn't even realise that herself, but I cannot get past the sense that she was always just trying to distract herself from an already broken heart, instinctively knowing on some level that this thing with me wasn't necessarily going anywhere. And then once she had healed, she dropped me like it was nothing because she was never in as deep as I was.

 No-one else has ever made me cry. No-one else has made me taste what being human feels like as she did. It hurts so much. To live in total silence, then briefly hear the faint song, imagining that it's coming closer and closer, only for it to be totally snuffed out without warning.

It hurts worse when i see them going on dates and stuff. I want to date again but my living circumstances prohibit me from that. Call it a Rapunzel situation. 

It just really hurts, and i dont talk to anyone when i feel like this because its stupid. I just pretend to talk to people in my head and that only helps me cope to an extent. I self harmed some months ago and ive been thinking about doing it again recently more and more. 

Its just i feel i have no one and on top of the undiagnosed mental problems i have going on it hurts to not be taken seriously and then when i do open up because i get told i should it never ends well. I wish i could disappear. Im doing all this stuff to try an be a normal functioning adult but its gotten me no where. I dont know what to do and im scared and confused majority of the time and asking for help nowadays doesn't get you anywhere. I even went to the hospital and they sent me back hone with nothing and told me i needed therapy but i dont have access to that. 

I really have no one and if i do i dont know who it is. My mind just hurts. All i know is to do school and be on good terms with everyone and be as less of a burden on people as possible.

I said yes, and they explained they were from the university, and they wanted to speak to me about a post I made last night (that can be found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11w11il/i\_lost\_my\_uncle\_last\_night\_4\_months\_after\_i\_lost/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11w11il/i_lost_my_uncle_last_night_4_months_after_i_lost/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) ) They explained that they were concerned for my well-being, to which I explained I was doing okay today (which I was due to keeping my self busy by tidying up), but I just recently lost my uncle. By only mentioning this (and I'm assuming due to the fact I admitted last night that I was a risk to myself during a conversation with an admin on the website which I also believed would know me anonymously) the caller immediately suggested therapy provided by the uni. I've been trying to get 1-1 therapy through them for a while, but I was referred to wellness programs before my uncle died, so I think they realise now that I'm a risk to myself. I couldn't properly explain this when I was being referred to wellness, and I was also embarrassed to admit that I was experiencing SH tendencies and suicidal thoughts, so I kept quiet. 

Tonight, something else came up in which I may need to leave university for a while and work to support 4 people, a mortgage, weekly food shopping, bills, and a car, as well as maintain a social life and stay sane all while I do it.

Meds haven't worked for me and I've been on them for literal years. Therapy is too expensive. I can barely function, let alone work. 
The rinse repeat life pattern just isnt working. Get up, medicate, work, go home, force feed myself something, medicate again, sleep, repeat. 

And so if the medical trial doesn't help, and I can't work, and he breaks up with me, then what's the point? The person I love won't stick around because I can't function as a human being and the things that are supposed to help me function and feel more normal don't work and are too expensive.

For the past few months (year, by now) I have felt everything around me crumbling down. I have no friends, my grades have been dropping for the past year, the future seems absolutely horrible in every way I can concieve it, I look and feel like shit all the time, all my dreams and goals seem unachievable, etc. I've been talking to a university councelor for the past 2 months and I've noticed no change and gained no insight into anything whatsoever. I waited 6 months to get a prescription for ADHD medication and my psychiatrist seems like such a piece of shit for refusing to look into any sort of alternatives that would be covered by insurance. So now I can't afford my previous prescripted medications (I was also diagnosed with anxiety since I was a teenager).

Every realistic solution requires time and/or money that I cannot afford at the moment, because university is sucking up every last penny I can save (I love being an international student). So now I'm conflicted because I routinely end up looking up ways to kick the bucket, but I also understand that my situation is not hopeless in the eye of other people. I am a whole continent away from my parents, but we have calls and they are loving and respectful. I also found and fell in love with an incredible girl, who I've been with for the past 5 months. All 3 know I have mental illnesses, but I've never spoken to them about my ideations or if I'm having a crisis. 

So, I feel my entire life falling apart and everyday the future seems more and more hopeless. Every time I get grades back I'm just reminded that I'm an idiot and then all my effort is worthless in the end. I absolutely refuse the idea of talking to my parents or girlfriend about this, since I know they won't have a solution and it would simply make me a burden. However, I also cannot simply commit suicide, since that would definitely put them in a painful spot. So now I'm stuck in this position where I have little to no care about myself and everyday is crushingly painful, but I'm conditioned to live because of people who I know care about me. I hate this. I often think of time ticking down until I finally disappoint them and be enough of a let down so they naturally get pushed away without them feeling guilty about it.

34F. I've been trying to live healthy, eat right, get proper sleep and some exercise. Nothing works. The doctor who long ago said I'll never be happy might have been right. I'm biochemically screwed, especially now after more than a decade of antidepressants and antipsychotics. I might never be healthy ever in my life. 

I had to quit my relatively easy part time work from home job after a whole month of extreme anxiety. It was like a very long panic attack where at times I thought I was going to die for real because my chest hurt so much. Sometimes my head or my stomach hurt and I thought I was getting sick. 

Most of the anxiety and pain went away as soon as I quit working. But I'm still depressed, with no reason to live. Nothing interests me anymore, and I can't muster the energy even to watch my favorite anime or drama. I can hardly read, so I scan posts on here or on other sites. That's all I could do lately. 

I hate myself. I can't do anything right, and I ruin anything I touch. The ones I care about the most are those that I end up hurting the most. It's a curse, and I want to go away if it means the curse will go away too and everyone else will be better off. I wish I had the guts to off myself, if I don't have the nerve to do something with my life, I might as well end it. My friends are already feeling the strain and I can't keep on lying to myself just to hang on. 

All I have right now is a little pocket money, a tiny amount in a digital account, around a hundred books left unread (hardcopy), 3-4 months worth of medicine and supplements, 3 sleepless nights worth of snacks, 3 guitars waiting for setup and restringing, a piano in need of tuning, a keyboard that needs to be transferred upstairs, a few sets of clothing, some crystals and incense, a semi-abandoned bedroom / personal library, and my useless credentials... Been trying to find something or someone to live for but nothing moves me enough, or I end up with projects half done.

It's coming up on a year since the suicide attempt that nearly resulted me being sectioned (hospitalised). I think I'm still traumatised by the brutality of the so-called ""help"" I received afterwards. Essentially, I received threats instead of care, because the NHS is fucked and they can't provide for me.

I can't say I feel a lot better a year on. Things might be different, sure. I have a bit more of a support network - at uni I'm near to my friends, and not that far away from my family, and I have a councillor. But I feel so isolated and lonely and my baseline suicidal thoughts are becoming more intense.

One of my close friends was pretty seriously suicidal a few weeks ago, and whilst I'm glad he opened up to me about it, it's sent me off on my own downward trajectory. I feel like I'm spiralling, that I'm not able to catch up with any of the work that I need to do, because everything takes so much mental effort. 

I felt unwell over the weekend, which meant that I wanted to rest and recuperate. Instead, I feel like shit because I haven't done any of the work that I need to do. I've basically just procrastinated 4 days away being ill, and I've only got until Friday to finish off this assignment that I've only done about 40% of. It shouldn't be that difficult. but I can't focus on anything. 

Everything feels meaningless, and even though I \*\*care\*\*, it feels like it doesn't matter. My motivation is just completely shot. I'm definitely getting more depressed by the day, and I'm kinda a bit scared that it'll all bubble to the surface quickly and I'll try to kill myself again. 

I've never been the planning type. Well, that's not strictly true. I have mentally ruled out any violent or brutal methods, especially those involving others (walking in front of a lorry, train etc), because I don't want whoever finds me (or kills me) to be unnecessarily traumatised. That leaves me with very few methods, but still enough that I've attempted several times before.

I'm not really sure what I hope to achieve by writing this message, I guess I just needed to read it back - the words on the screen maybe mean more than just thoughts? I don't know. All I do know is I'm getting more depressed, and nothing normal seems to be stopping it.",1679351796.0

So… hi. You all can just call me Boom for now.

I’m 18M, Oklahoman, autistic, and have absolutely zero reason to be suicidal. Which ironically, has become the very reason I’m suicidal in the first place.

To keep it quick, I was adopted into a **very** privileged life. Like, it’s insane just how lucky I’ve actually been for most of my life. Of course, with how bleak the rest of the world can look at times, it creates this real divide between myself and others, and I always end up kicking myself over how “People are out here barely able to afford basic life, and here you are, splurging $8k on a trip to Spain with the rest of your school band. Fuck you.”

One day, it got bad. **Real** bad. That negative voice in my head managed to use logic against me, and it goes something like this:

1. Given how privileged you are, how much good would be done for the world if you were to kill yourself right now and use your will to donate your entire net worth to charity?
2. Are you absolutely confident that, by choosing to stay alive, you can somehow do more good than that standard?
3. Given your lack of confidence in #2, why haven’t you killed yourself already? You’re nothing but a selfish bastard; that’s why. Go fuck yourself.

I haven’t done anything drastic yet, but I’m scared that unless I can find a counter, one day, I may just actually do it, and I really don’t want to. I’ve had too many other good experiences with my life to just be willing to throw it away, but if wanting to live makes me a bad person… well, what can I do?

I am a 24 yo trans woman who was sexually and physically assaulted.

I am a 24 yo trans woman, I lost my apartment in the summer of 2021 due to an abusive ex boyfriend. I moved in with my very abusive grandparents, I was threatened with physically violence if I took too long in the shower, people would beat on the door of the shower, scream at my face waking me up at 7 in the morning after having working all night as a sever and having work the next day. I was constantly misgendered and harassed by my family

. I have a 39 yo cousin who is a very big strong guy and he targeted me in particular. He did not live with my grandparents, he stayed a few miles down the road with his family but would visit to hang out with my grandpa and occasionally for horseback riding. One night in early 2022 he came over while I was getting ready for a date with a guy I liked, I was wearing a dress and a jacket and a full face of makeup. I walked outside to go to my car and he was sitting on the porch with my grandfather and my grandfather's friend, he said 'the legs of his pants fell off' with a big taunting look on his face and my grandfather and he both proceeded to laugh at me, I turned and quickly walked away to my car and left.

Fast forward to June 2022, I get a text from my ex boyfriend who wanted to come visit and I said yes, we hadn't seen each other in a while so I put on a skirt and makeup for his visit. He pulled up in his truck and I led him inside. We visited for a while and he was ready to leave so I walked him out to his truck, my cousin was sitting on the porch with my grandfather again, however this time seeing my boyfriend with me he was silent. I led my boyfriend to his truck and he pulled away, as he was driving down the driveway my cousin began yelling me: ""Hey boy, go put on some pants"" I ignored him and froze in fear and anger. He began to repeat himself atleast 10 times the same exact sentence over and over. I reached my boiling point and I finally turned around and walked over to where they were sitting and I stood right in front of my grandfather about 5 feet away from my cousin, I told him I had never disrespected him once in my life and it was bs for him to disrespect me like that. He laughed at my face and again gave me the same taunting face trying to provoke a reaction out of me and that's exactly what he did, I told him he was a piece of shit and he threatened to hurt me, I called him a piece of shit again and he got up and got right in my face until we were almost kissing he was that close, and I screamed in his face to get away from me. He reached out for my throat and his fingers tried to grab my throat but I pulled away before he could secure a grip, he reached again and I smacked his sun glasses off, I tried to turn and run but he grabbed my hair and knocked me to the ground and stood over me. Holding my head up by my hair, he grabbed my balls and said ""see you're a man"" and then proceeded to punch me on the side of my head full strength 10 or so times. When he was done he dragged me to my feet by my hair and threw me down the concrete steps leading to their house. I bruised my legs and heels in the process. My grandmother came outside and hit both of us with a stick and fired a gun into the air. I called the cops and they sent an officer who knows my dad and my family personally, my grandfather told the police that I had gotten up in his face first and thrown the first punch, he did not tell the truth that he got out of his chair and walked over to me and started reaching for my throat. He told the cop that we had been fist fighting and I pinched him with my fist several times even though I never once threw a punch and he did not have a mark on him and I was covered in bruises. The cop labeled it mutual combat and filed on us both. The DA labeled it a screaming match and dropped the case.

This has completely wrecked my life mentally and I sustained multiple permanent injuries including post concussive syndrome and a neck injury. I can not see properly anymore. I am so angry and hurt over being assaulted and then lied about. He hurt me and got away with it Scott free. I don't know what to do with myself and I think about ending it every moment of every day since this happened. I am so angry and hurt and I don't know what to do. ive posted this story on other subreddits and no one gives a shit idk what to do pls help.",1679363576.0

My father passed when I was 7, and I was later groomed and molested by a family friend from 7-9. From 10-14 I've self harmed, burned, scratched, cut, bruised, ripped out hair, and torn skin multiple times a week every month. I was later raped and sexually assaulted multiple times during a 5 month relationship when I was 12-13. He was 16-17. I'm not liked by people at school, nor people in town. I look weird, out of place. I'm 6'0, mixed Jamaican/polish, short curly pixie cut, fat to skinny girls skinny to fat girls, hip dips, broad shoulders, short eyelashes, the get-go. I plan on taking my ex-boyfriends pistol and shooting myself in the head with it 3/28/23. Whenever I think about suicide or commiting or self harming. There's no sense of anxiety, no worrysom of others, no issues, nothing. Just contentment, this is what's going to happen, I will be at peace in a higher plain and I will achieve Nirvana. I don't know if I'm supposed to be sad, or if I'm supposed to scream and cry and sob about killing myself, I don't know if there's something wrong with me for feeling this way but I don't really care. I will forever love everyone who stuck by me these years. If you recover my phone after my death, please don't go through my gallery 🙏🏼",1679363448.0

Like a little emergency backup. Whe I met her, I forgot how it is if you don't want to anymore. I felt nothing but happiness. It was just perfect, more than I ever dared to dream of. My rational part fights with the rest of my mind. If it wasn't for the people whos lifess I'd ruin I'd already just step in front of a bus. I just want the pain to stop. I want my life back. My love.

I’ve been thinking about this for quite some time. I would theoretically be successful with lots of money and at the same time I would slowly be dying until I suddenly collapse and pass away. To the average person this sounds horrible, but for me not achieving my goals at this point. It could be a great alternative! I know I sound crazy, but man I’m in this subreddit so I hope someone can understand why I’m thinking this way. I worked my butt off to get into a prestigious school, but only because that would give me access to the top banks. 

I’ve basically failed with that plan so it looks like this could be my new life goal! Now that I’m writing this, this sounds great! I’ll take the job at the lower tier bank and then work my ass off for the rest of my life trying to climb the corporate ladder before my body can’t take it anymore!

See this thinking is also probably why no one wanted to hire me. So many bad things happened to me in the last two years that this could finally be the quiet way out of all this worldly injustice and unfairness. 

Why live in a world where I could be born middle or lower class and fight my way to the top, when some kid is born into luxury and dies in luxury.

There’s no way someone can relate to what I’m saying here, but at this point sharing my thoughts with the world seems like the best way out of this mess.


Wow this actually made me smile, maybe I am psychotic!


To clarify I’ve gotten into the school just not the bank so my life is a complete lie. I also fell into this thinking after I was falsely accused of SA.",1679360989.0
379,Even though my life seems wonderful on the surface my soul is in shambles,1,11x1prp,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11x1prp/even_though_my_life_seems_wonderful_on_the/,1,"I’m a 4.0 student with a 34 on my ACT and 5s on all my AP tests so I’m doing okay in school. Im a classical pianist and I’m in choir and just made it to a state competition for both vocal and piano performance. Im a lead in my school musical. I have a wonderful close group of friends. I volunteer a lot and have a wonderful family. So on paper it looks fine. But for the past few months my life has felt horrendous. I have found occasional solace in music, performance, and friends, but I am so lost and confused and want to give up on life.

I’m a physically in mentally out Mormon teenager. I used to be a very strong believing member but about a year ago I lost my faith but I’ve been putting on a mask of still being Mormon because I don’t feel okay sharing what I believe now. I’ve been able to tell a few friends in a similar situation, but my closest friends are all members and it’s hard because I feel like a fraud around them. And I leave, what will that make of me? I feel like I will lose my friends. I have many core memories of my early childhood related to the gospel and my family and I feel like I’m going to lose that idyllic life I had been living until I had doubts. I don’t know how to live without it but I can’t be honest about it right now. 

Additionally, I have feelings towards men. I have been since freshman year. And I fucking hate it. I felt strong attraction to girls all of middle school and then shortly after COVID hit hard switch to men. Im so fucking pissed because I don’t want to live like that and I get so upset whenever I occasionally have feelings towards my best friends because it makes me feel just absolutely disgusting and like some psycho. However, I met another gay guy my age who I fell head over heels for. On paper we were a perfect match because we had so much in common. But after kissing him, even though it was fun, something wasn’t right. The vibe was very off. Then there was that time when his mom came home super early and caught us kissing which has seriously traumatized me. I simply do not want to be in a relationship with a man ever it doesn’t feel right with me. But then I get these occasional feelings of attraction I my friends and it makes me so fucking angry like this is such a stupid and useless thought to have why can’t my attraction to women fucking come back. Maybe in just never supposed to be in a happy relationship or have kids just like my Mormon religion wants I think I’d be better of dead let the straight normal believing people be happy and successful. I’m a defect that needs to be thrown out I just want to overdose on something and fall asleep and never wake up. I would rather be dead than be a gay exmormon. I don’t care what good thing happen in my life my core identity is just shit and everything feels like a waste. Maybe I’ll feel better in an hour but holy shut I wanna die right now this all feels so meaningless",1679359352.0
380,Waiting for Death,1,11x1pr5,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11x1pr5/waiting_for_death/,1,"I can say confidently by doing what I could with the little that I have, something about my suicidality changed. But quite frankly its not enough. Maybe this is still the mental illness journey.

I really don't want to kill myself and I live with this fear that one day I will because I don't trust myself sometimes.

On some days I enjoy the sun, the cool breeze, and a full stomach. I try to count my blessings and on this eternal dark cycle I managed to paint parts of it white but it's not enough.

Is it bad that I wish I could love life?

Is it bad that despite the improvement I made over the long long years that it's not enough?

One of the things that helped me from being suicidal is just reminding myself that I am going to die anyway and that time is coming, do not rush it! But its not enough.

I live with a lot of internal pressure for perfectionsim. 

Yes it is not real and yes it is an imaginary construct but it's a default to try hard and it has led to this fatigue. I am fatigued.

In my work, I try to mediocre and just do enough and even that is too much.😞

So in a way it all feels inescapable, but I do not have the strength to off myself. 

So what do I do when life gets hard? Remind myself that I am going to die one day and pray its an accident soon to come.

Anyway, eventually all of us will, I just wish I could heal this. I have been trying so hard, for so long and its like, what the fuq did I do in my past life to deserve being suicidal from 9 years old to 25.

I can't find dates, I can't complete assignments... what is my purpsoe but a thing people constantly lean on. Who do I lean on?

How many holes does my fist need to make in my door before things change?

I guess in the end its all my fault.... My responsibility and it sucks that help is so expensive.

I am tired of having to premeditate every single detail to every single thing I say when I have to talk to someone. Not even just that, it's also equally as cumbersome to have to do this while I am talking to someone, I don't know how to define this. I just read a lot into every single thing message someone conveys verbal or non verbal. I hate feeling the wait of my presumptions every time I have a conversation.

Things weren't necessary always like this. I feel like my brain is so traumatized that it finds it hard to recognize when these simple idiosyncracies do not necessarily mean that I have upset a person or someone does not mean well towards me. At the same time, I feel that within society people have this tendency to not be honest and do everything to avoid stating how they actually feel, which then puts you in this sorta limbo of assumptions. Some people are so dishonest that even when you confront them directly about an issue they still will refuse to be transparent about it. Interacting on a whole is just so frustrating because of this, it makes me feel like completely isolating myself from the rest of the world.

I'm so tired of it all, I really am, I don't know who I should trust or what I should think about people. I feel completely disconnected to humanity at my core. Then everything just stay bottled up inside, which just leads me to this profound despair that I can't escape. It drains every ounce of my soul and renders me unable to do simple task.

396,My R,1,11x00yu,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11x00yu/my_r/,6,"Here i'm (15M) gonna tell everyone my reason for s*icide and life story, read this, if you want to, but you don't need to it's gonna be long.

I was born in an unhappy family. They argued alot. They weren't a happy couple.

They hated eachother alot. They sometimes got physical to the point that the police had to come. It  makes me sad to think about all these things. To think about the arguments to think about, how glass shards were on the floor and my mother raged quit and threw my IPad (basically my only escape) on the floor. 

I hated that time. I was a weird kid in Kindergarten hated by almost everyone. I played videogames and only talked about them. It made me annoying and I once, even got chairs thrown at me from the kids there.

After Kindergarten I was put in a school for mentally unstable children. I was a picky eater overslept and was slapped by the staff there for not eating and had to stay there after school daily.

I also still had problems with my parents divorce I wanted both of them to be happy. I wanted to love with both of them. They always told me, that the other one is bad and insulted the other it hurt. They used me against eachother. I after awhile decided to abandon my father and live with my mother because I believed her more. They wanted me to decide with, which one to live.

I was put in a a mental hospital, because my mental state wasn't good, that was before the divorce decision to live with my mother.

I cried daily and missed my parents. I hated being there. I saw people being isolated and other stuff.
I was 7 years old. I also, because I was afraid of showering had to shower n*ked Infront of the staff, because I would get a panic attack else. They basically had the door open, while I showered and some female staff saw me n*ked and sometimes, like in one incident a male staff looked awhile at my private part to long and it wasn't comfortable. I also had detention after school daily, because of oversleeping. I don't remember alot, I don't know how much.

After that I was put in a boarding school for ""hard to parent children and teenagers."" I was put in a residential home with teenagers. They bullied me, because of my spoiledness and ""weirdness.""

I almost remember nothing from this time period except a few incidents. I was thrown around on a turning thing in the park. 

I flew alot and almost wanted to scream in pain. I probably hit my head s few times and after awhile fell in the floor in shock. It hurt alot, but I was so shocked I couldn't say anything. Again my details are blurry. I also had a vivid memory where I livked someone's foot. I felt like being back there. I don't remember, if the memory is correct. Atleast that's what happened in my memories.

I lived there for 2'5 years and after that I could go home daily from there for 3 years and after that switched to a public school.

My mother married a new person who is now my stepfather in this time and my father got a new girlfriend. 

In public school I stressed myself alot in school. After school I studied 4 hours. It was alot. After awhile I lost the energy to study. I also had weekly or daily arguments with my parents for every week in my life probably, which didn't help.

They called me spoiled and other stuff. Even sometimes slapped me. They screamed at me even.

Yeah after the school stress period of my life my home life escalated. I started self-h*rming and became lazy.

I had many arguments with my parents at the time, because they knew about my self-h*rm.

In one holiday, which I because of my self-h*rm at first didn't wanna go with them there we had many arguments. 

Because I didn't wanna go outside because of my self-h*rm and laziness. 

They screamed at me called me lazy, spoiled and other things.

They said ""they should c*t themselves not me."" They said ""they should s*oot themselves not me""and other things. My mother slapped me and asked me ""to you want to go to your father.""

In these holidays my first s*icidal thoughts in my life developed. I thought about OD'ing on medications or juming down the apartment.

I started getting more lazy. After awhile my parents because of a psych ward stay found out about my s*icidal thoughts and other things.

We had many arguments. One time I didn't shower for 11 days and my mother told my stepfather to force me in the shower. My stepfather threw me downstairs. We fought for 3 hours and I got screamed at for these whole 3 hours and threatened to get physically forced outside and get publically humiliated with them screaming at me how lazy their son is. I wanted to b*rn myself in a self-h*rm way Infront if them but my stepfather saw my attempt and said ""I can do it for you, because then you don't look as crazy.""
He also said he doesn't care, if the police came and that he will if it takes longer punch me unconscious. In a fight with him where I tried to escape by pushing him away he said ""do you want me to k*ll you?"" He said that in a threadining way. He also said he can k*ll me.

They also said stuff like they will throw me out of the house and other things.

It was the second time I got threadened with being thrown out and having to be homeless.

The first time my mother tried to push me outside of the house, but I resisted. It was after an argument, where I refused to give her my phone after I stayed awake for to long.

Yeah we also had many arguments in the last few weeks, but that's normal.

Again that's my life story and all my reasons why i'm gonna kms.

I have a bridge that's high enough and i'm gonna jump if I get the opportunity.

Everything is my fault i'm a spoiled, ignorant, lazy, dumb and bad child!!!

Don't tell me otherwise.

See ya in the afterlife i'm so happy!!!!!!!",1679355276.0

What I don't have: A sense of connection to anyone. Someone I can talk to. A sense of connection to this life i've chosen to make. A desire to see if things can get better (this is probably related to my low frustration tolerance).

Nobody has time for me. They'll say ""tell us what's bothering you"" and when you do they suddenly don't want to know, it is too hard, I'm too much. I've discovered it's the equivalent of being asked ""how was your day?"", nobody really wants to know and are actually annoyed when you tell them! 

I think about dying all the time. Everyday. Morning and night. As I wake up and as I'm trying to sleep. All the different ways I could do it. I don't feel anxious. I don't feel depressed. I just don't feel anything. I just feel a great big emptiness. 

My dad killed himself and I think about that too and how my mom still tells everyone it was just a tragic accident. I wonder if she'll do the same for me when I finally decide to jump.",1679311670.0

They're all precious memories. Because the only reason I felt alive was because of my relationships with others. Because I was able to be me. I don't want to forget everything, lose everything. None of us will ever escape the curse. Thank you. I love you.

This is a dialogue, altered a little by me, of the end of my favorite anime, Mawaru Penguindrum. It is a messy show and go off-rails all the time but it defines almost perfectly the way I feel about life. Everytime I feel sad I remember this dialogue, as it isn't as I want to die all the time, but I do feel small punishments everyday, little crystal fragments hurting me -figuretly, I do not hurt myself. Life is a punishment, I know it for sure. Yet, I have to go through this punishment.

400,Yeah I'm done.,1,11wzjtu,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11wzjtu/yeah_im_done/,0,"I got an email from an advisor that seemed like it was making assumptions, I sent it to my mom, and she constructed an email that explain my situation and also presented itself as standing up from myself. Even though it was really her doing the talking for me, the most I did was edit the message some.

I'm panicking and upset because this email has put me on edge, I expressed concern to my mom about the worry about the attitude problem and needing to meet. My other advisor walked up to me while I was talking on the phone and she said we need to have a meeting because the email was inappropriate. So I'm in hot water. I could have spent all these four years of hard work to lose it all, lose a scholarship, spend another year, get kicked out of the program, whatever. Possibly because of an email.

And so now I feel like that's at stake, I'm trying to do every fucking thing I can but apparently no matter what at least one part of it is wrong. I shouldn't have even told my parents. I should have just kept it to myself and moved on. Not even worrying about a thing other than uh-oh, I can't miss any more days unless I'm actually sick or something.

I have never seriously tried to kill myself, I have written notes and self harmed but the harm has been literally skin deep.

I [M 26] feel like I am in this miasma constantly of this low level depression, consistently failing to achieve anything close to what I want to achieve. My ADHD has been extremely bad recently, its holding me back at work and now I am not sure I even want that job and then I look around at creative jobs and realise that I am nowhere close to the skills required to build anything interesting creatively, certainly not to make a living, so I just feel trapped. I am going to ricochet between jobs I grow bored of and underachieve at for the rest of my life, squandering my potential and never meeting my goals. I don't know how I am going to summon the energy for the rest of my life.

I am not quite sure why I am posting, I guess I just want to know I am not alone, and express this malaise I am feeling somewhere people might get it. I feel completely incapable and unable to carve my own path.
I also want to know if I am ""really"" suicidal, I have had experience with medical professionals where they've essentially said I'm not too bad, I wonder if this is all just self pity on my own part.

I know I can’t die, not yet. There’s someone I have to live for. But that feeling of just wishing for the pain to cease and the noise to fade out is really  quite unsettling. How free I would be if I slept tonight and didn’t wake up in the morning.

437,I’m Worthless But Have 1 Reason Left,1,11wv2ve,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11wv2ve/im_worthless_but_have_1_reason_left/,0,"Sometimes it’s overwhelming pain and sometimes it’s complete emptiness and I’m numb. Either way, between the sadness and the apathy there nothing left inside of me that’s good.  

I just want to know what it feels like to wake up happy one day. I want to know what it feels like to REALLY, TRULY know that someone loves you and cares about you.  I want to know what it feels like to have a best friend that makes it known I’m their best friend, instead of an embarrassing secret that no one knows about.  But the reality is that there’s nothing about me left that’s worth loving. 

Its painful to watch everyone you love and care about so very deeply give others more care and attention before returning the love back to you. Its excruciating to feel like every every attempt to build connections and memories is forced and a bother.  And it breaks me apart when you can feel yourself getting hurt by the very person with whom you’ve explained all of your pain. 

I only have a couple good things in my life right now, one much more than anything. For today, that’s the only reason I have to wake up every every morning. Unfortunately I also have BPD (borderline personality disorder),
so those great things in my life that are the reason I wake up every day are also the very source of all my pain and suffering. 

The most important of those is someone that is depending on me right now, and that I know needs me to be around and loves me very much, as I do them. So I’ve made a promise to myself. Like a cancer patient that refuses treatment in order to enjoy whatever remaining years of life they have before the cancer consumes them completely, I have decided that I must protect this person from my BPD at all costs and be the happy, positive force they need in their life. I will suppress these terrible emotional waves of self destruction and despair and put on my smiling, laughing clown mask and work as hard as possible to fill that persons life with as much love and joy as possible until they are able to reach out on their own and be successful. 

It’s like the most famous line from the recent film The Whale: “I need to know that I’ve done one thing right with my life.”  

If I can make sure all of that is done, even if it means I’m suffering tremendously on the inside and crying myself to sleep every night, I will happily endure the quiet suffering and make sure it never negatively affects them. 

In the end, just like with cancer, my sickness will probably kill me, like it does more than 10% of us. That’s why I’ve already altered my living will and made this person my sole heir of all my possessions and estate. But even tho I might need to take that step just to finally stop my brain from endlessly terrorizing me, I won’t be unhappy, and I’ll at least feel fulfilled that I did everything I could to give them every opportunity I can and hope that they can use it to make a better life than I could.

Im tired of hearing from people ""It gets better"" I feel that it truly does'nt. I grew up with an abusive mother, the abuse was physical at first but after covid hit, it went emotional. At 13, during lockdown i was crying myself to sleep every night. My father and my sister dont seem to care about my mental health and ive started to hate all my family. When Offline School started again in 2021, the pressure created on me to get good grades was so much that i started to self harm by cutting. Later I tried to kms by slitting my wrist. It was my grandmother that unfortunately saw me and i was saved. I really wished she did'nt.  My mother loves gaslighting me to this day and my father and sister still support her. My sister is the most cunning and the most manipulative person i know of, She loves to join my mother in the emotional abuse. It does'nt help with the fact that after lockdown, due to the abuse ive lost all emotion and have lost all my friends. I hate my family and have had thoughts of getting a kitchen knife and murdering them all, I have no friends and i spend all day, everyday in my room, i dont even go see my family until they call me for dinner. In simple words I hate interacting with people now. I feel daily that when i start college i should either kms for real or fake my death and disappear entirely to start a new life and get a new identity.  


Edit: I dont go to therapy because the country where im from, mental health is seen as a joke and things like depression are considered fake, so the nearest therapist is over 30km away. Also, people who talk to me at school say that im basically a sociopath.",1679344633.0

I have been drowning myself in self criticism, allowing it to bring me down further. 

I get these periods of joy where I take advantage and function at my highest, while I can. 

I am in search of love and companionship, yet lack this with myself.

I have no right to love another woman and continue to hate and harm myself.

No woman should have to go through this level of stress to keep their partner alive. 

I deal with problems as they come yet they pile on as though I said I would take them all- I did. 

While I am inching closer to taking my own life, I cant stand the fact that my father would do the same.

I worry about his well being, having raised a suicidal son.

It wasn’t his fault.

It wasn’t my fault.

Nor was it anyone else’s fault.

The universe does not care how you feel

Because if it did, how far would you really go?

If I sat and considered every possibility of how I would feel, I wouldn’t get anywhere. 

As thoughts cloud my mind and feelings of dipping are solidified, I fear for my own well being.

Will I actually make it or will I become another statistic.

My family and Friends do not deserve to see me buried over something I can get help for.

I have made three attempts on my life, none of which were half-hearted. 

I made it a mission to remove myself as i felt the world around me would function properly without me.

I still do not value myself until someone shows me love or a woman gives me her attention.

In this I feel bliss.

Looking into the eyes of another beautiful soul as we share our thoughts and opinions.

To me this is what keeps me going, yet fear and loathing from my past prevents me from letting anyone in.

I would love to be in a room next to everyone  in the world that I have “touched” emotionally.

Not for the sexual aspect but to sit in a room, and speak my mind to people who I have connected with before - this time on a spiritual level. 

Opening up doors for them to connect with each other.

I am told that I am the glue that keeps groups together.

Im here for my family and friends

Those who I go to work with see me in this manner too.

If they knew how I treat and feel about myself, it would bring them all to tears.

I am a hopeless romantic who has been dealt the hand of suffering.

I do not believe I am here to enjoy life but to keep people together. 

I enjoy seeing groups that I helped form, but do not take credit for- it was human nature that really did the job.

The same human  nature that allows famine, enablement and suicide to happen.

This same burden that the world carries would be transferred to my kin if I were to take my life.

The thought of seeing My little sisters crying at my grave and my little brother growing up without one, brings me to a new low point.

Here I have a perspective not many are willing to see.

The truth.

What would happen if I killed myself?

The world around me would crumble and fall to dust. 

All that we have worked for, gone.

For what?

Nothing.",1679330818.0

I noticed suicidal thoughts and signs of remasculinization like my pen*s pulsating every morning, increase in boob hair, increase in brow ridge size. But I thought it was impossible due to my low T levels so I ignored it.

200mg spiro solved my masculinization and mood symptoms but I only started taking it days ago so it was already too late.

And it's all my fault because I ignored signs of masculinization that i had been having for 4 months thinking it was impossible for it to happen due to my levels. 

It makes me want to kill myself because I vowed that I will never masculinize further when i started hrt. And then like an idiot i let it happen again without doing anything to stop it. 

I was so exited to have a chance to be a beautiful young woman after a year or 2 on hrt but now I'll have to remain in the closet and lose the best years of my life due to my fucking jaw and chin.

I’ve been trying to not hog conversations and let the other person talk. Sometimes I end up relating with personal anecdotes but there’s always mixed signals about that being acceptable or not. But I try not to make everything about me.

It fucking sucks to see my peers have experiences that I lost out on due to poor life choices. And having them later isn’t an option because life always seems to find one curveball after the other to throw my way.

It’s easy enough for people to say “just mute those people so you won’t get notifications” but that doesn’t stop them from having events I’m not invited to, and it doesn’t put me on their level.

Since I'm burnt out and have been getting on average three hours of sleep every night for some time now (I genuinely feel like a zombie) I did not have the physical strength to cut properly. I was just laying on the bathroom floor for some time and all I managed to achive was some scratches with barely any blood. I have tried going through with this plan before but those times were more like rehearsals where I knew I wasn't actually going to do it.

Sometimes people around me tell me that I am emotionless or heartless. 

Things got worse when I moved to other city for collage. Three of my friends moved here too and I live with one of them. I steel have contact with them but I feel like as time passes I loose most of them. 

In collage I spent most of my time just sitting somewhere allone. I have not talked to a single soul and this will continue for a long time I am sure. This got me very depressed. Everyday when I wake up I think about killing myself and I fall asleep thinking about same thing. This had big effect on my studies. Now I don't have motivation to do anything.

I'm still in that same school with the same classmates I had the worst experiences with. 

I am miserable and depressed right now. I do not want to do anything anymore. I lost track of my hobbies and lost sight of my ambitions, ambitions that I made up to lie to myself. 

I'm having a really really awful time with everything. And on this very day, I found out the classmates I was so nice with, all actually very much disliked me. I found out through them accidentally adding me to their gc and then immediately removing me afterwards.

I feel like I'm failing school and failing at life. I know I'm still young and has not went through much. But that's not something I'm looking forward to. If it'll get better, it may most likely get worse too. I may never know? It doesn't matter, I've had enough.

Usually I just browse. I'm from and still in Arizona. Lived here my whole life. (Yes the heat is absolutely awful!) Since I don't have anything to lose at this point I figured I'd post something, somewhere, showing what's going through my head. 
Doing it semi anonymously (yes I know I have my face as my pfp but it's not like someone's gunna hunt me down and stop me from doing anything) seems just right. 
Life has always been rough. Grew up in a drug house with addict parents whom never took us to school, bathed, clothed, and fed us much of anything. My mother was kind of the instigator and my dad was a pusher over who never stopped to see what was going on.
And since we had strangers over constantly, staying for days on end, you probably wouldn't be surprised to know that I was taken advantage of throughout the years. However, i still was always close with my father despite everything.
Once I hit an age where I could see what was going on, I left and lived with a friend (I was 16) for about a year. 
Probably the most stable year of my life. 
Dad gets clean and we move in my grandma. But he didn't get clean in time. He ended up having liver failure and died when I was 21.
One of the most difficult things I'd gone through. He was my bestfriend and support system. 
I should mention I moved in with an abusive prick at the age of 19 until 22. .
He killed one of my dogs and my pet birds ( including all the hitting and verbal abuse) 
But I was young, I had nowhere to go and no one to look to. I finally left and went straight back into another very unhealthy relationship, ended up pregnant but miscarried. (I have severe endometriosis, along with a whole mess of other health issues. I was going to pelvic floor therapy, regular PT, had a gynecologist I saw once every two weeks and my primary once a month. But I'm getting ahead of myself.
The guy I was with when I had miscarried, well things eventually ended and I end up in Mississippi where my mother was at the time. (Still an addict at this point).
But I had to travel back to Arizona semi frequently to see my doctors. 
I decided to just stay in Arizona and help take care of my JW grandma who was getting very old at this point. 
I loved my grandma but oh my lord was she awful to me.
It's like I could never escape the verbal abuse in my life.
I won't go into all the petty things that happened because this is already too long and I've skipped a few things. Some years go by and she needs to sell the house. So she goes up north and a friend of mine tells me he has an extra room I can move into. That my rent would be super low (this was great cause I had recently lost work due to an influx of health problems. 
( During this time I had been diagnosed with C PTSD, MD, and PMDD)
But things ended up being weird, too weird. He knew about the things I'd gone through (we were friends before this.) He knew my stance on relationships, my sexuality, my ptsd. But for MONTHS he would knock on my door just to tell me things like my legs make him hard, or to ask me if we could please cuddle cause he's lonely 
Or he'd want to talk about his precum. He'd also bring people over and film himself having sex with women on the couch because his room was always FILTHY. 
And it might be my fault because I didn't scream at him to stop. But I didn't want to get kicked out.
I don't have any family or friends at this point. (Hard to make and keep friends when you're often stuck in bed)
( I should also preface I'd been working throughout these years and only had to stop a little under a year ago because I began getting more sick).
Well, he must have been over being turned down so many times because he's no longer allowing me to live there after next month. ( He owns the place, I'm not on any lease.) I think he wanted a live in maid he could have sex with on command. 


SO even before all of this I've been having severe mental problems but felt I was working through them with therapy and medication. Until I found out my pup and I have nowhere to go. It's like I've had a complete relapse but worse than ever.
I don't see any way out of this. No family, no friends, no vehicle. I don't have the strength anymore. Not psychically or mentally. I've felt like I wanted to be done many times before but this time it's a lot more clear.
I'm not fighting with myself, going back and forth.
I already know who would take in my dog Abu when I'm gone. 
I think I just wanted to let someone, anyone know a piece of what my life was. Even if it's this abbreviated. 
All of my family members are no longer alive. I have no backup. 
I know this was VERY long. But I take comfort knowing I was able to say something.
Thank you so much to whomever decided to give this a read.
I hope you all take care. ❤️",1679287969.0

And every good moment I’ve had with people in my life. And it just makes me feel so sad that it isn’t like that anymore. Most of them I don’t even talk to anymore. I’ve never felt so alone in my life. I have had a guy, he messaged me saying how he would be there for me when I was going through tough times. We talked for a while, and I felt like I finally had someone. I shared so much with him. I genuinely had such a fun time talking with him. Just turned out he was 40+ years old and just wanted someone easy and young who could fill out a fantasy his wife couldn’t . I still talked to him because I am that desperate and sad. 

And I called the hotline, because I know myself. And felt even more like a piece of shit after. There was this one guy, I’ve talked to him around four times. And each time I neared him it was like a relief. He truly knew how to make you feel better, and each time I called and got him I felt safe afterwards. But today, she cut me short and said if I don’t need emergency services now then call back when I need them. I was talking to her about my plan for today, and yk how it goes. The whole plan thing. 

Maybe their just busy. I don’t know. I think it’s funny, how people say to ask for help. I’ve gone to therapy, I’ve tried anti depressants, I’ve tried reaching out to my sister and family. Heck even according to my therapist rn I’m on a good path. But nothing. I’ve just learned that no one in this life will ever care for you. I was so depressed about it for so long. I still am I guess. And even as I write this in this stupid little Reddit, I know that no one will look at this and genuinely care. I’ve had people who cared about me, but they left. My friends left, my Cresha left. And everyone else doesn’t care. I just think it’s so funny how we talk big about mental health, but when you actually are ruining your life because of it. Suddenly your just another piece of shit with a victim complex.

I should try harder, I think about it everyday. I should be doing more. I’m only 18 right? I have so much more to live for. I should be trying to heal from my trauma, yet it haunts me everyday that I live that I can’t even escape it when I sleep. It should be better. Yet nothing. I hate my life, I hate everything about it. And I just can’t imagine it getting better. It’s been supposed to be getting better for the past two years. One more day turned into one more week, one more month, one more year. And I’m tired. I’ve lived my life, I saw the ocean. I’ve had genuine friendships, met my family, maybe not been with someone intimately or my first kiss. Never had a boy think I was pretty enough. But that’s fine. And I’m fine with it. It’s just so funny to me that everything I had that used to stop me from doing it is gone now.

It was something like, ""I believe everyone has the right to choose whether or not to stay alive. I also believe that you are sick and might change your mind as you get better. I want to help you get to a mental state where you can make a clear, informed decision.""

The thing is, I feel mentally well right now. I'm not anxious, I'm thinking calmly and rationally. I don't feel much of anything at all. I just think I'm a bad person and the people around me would have better lives without me in them. I complain too much, I'm sensitive and weak. I don't like myself; I don't like living. I feel redundant. Sure, some people would be sad, but they'd get over it. And as ashamed as I am to admit it, I wouldn't be around to feel guilty for hurting them. 

I made a half-assed attempt three weeks ago (overdosed on prescription meds). I mostly just wanted to end up in the ER to prove (mostly to myself) that I *am* actually sick enough to warrant the level of care I'm getting. It ended up just making me feel sick for a few days.

My parents don’t typically understand mental health, they don’t think that I’m serious when I feel this way. They just think that because I’m in a hardship, I am seeking attention and this is how I seek it. I know deep down. I’m not trying to manipulate anybody, but when my dad says that to me, I can’t help but go into another spiral of maybe I am. It’s always been hard for me to stand sturdy with how I feel and I don’t know anymore .I don’t know if I was .wrong I don’t know if I was right for sharing how I felt.

Until it wasn't. She wasn't talking to me, wasn't responding to texts, wasn't responding to calls, and I was scared. I finally caught up with her on our way to class (we're both in college), and she is hardly talking to me. I ask her if everything is fine and she says yes. Well, I see out of the corner of my eye a text from a guy. I don't think anything of it, until she tells me she's meeting up with a friend, but won't tell me the name of the friend and that she doesn't remember her name. Well, I later find out from a friend working at the dining hall that she is with a guy. That guy in the text message. I go to confront her and she immediately leaves. I later find out she reported me for stalking her and threatening violence against her friend. I didn't do that at all.

I already struggle from bipolar. Luckily a formal title ix charge wasn't filed, but there was a mutual no contact agreement made. I ended up leaving the college because I have a class with her and I live in the same dorm with her. 

I loved her. I did everything for her. I bought her a promise ring. I skipped classes to be with her. I spent thousands of dollars on her. She would go days sometimes without texting me. She would get extremely defensive if I brought up something she was doing, yet I was always wrong. She never communicated with me. If I was doing something wrong, I found out through someone else. When I would ask her if I'm doing something, she would say no and that I'm fine. This is the second time she just flipped on me and broke up with me without any warning. I just feel so hurt.

I had a life planned out. I had just started at this new college and it was becoming home. And I lost everything. I have to completely start over. I can't do it. I don't want to do it. I don't have the strength. I give up. She wants me gone, I left. I'll leave for good. She probably wants me dead. I just want to die and be done with the pain already....",1679308745.0

I'm 22 and I just made this account. Today my day was terrible, and I have no one to vent to.

I'm an only child, my parents had me early and both abandoned me because they found other partners, I always lived with my paternal grandmother. Before, I thought that not having parents present had not hurt me, today I realize that it hurt and still hurts me.
I was always very quiet at school, which since preschool resulted in bullying, physical and psychological. I didn't tell my family, because I never had the courage or intimacy for that.

At 12/13 I went to Facebook groups in order to look for a friend. I found a guy 10 years older, from another state. For two years we talked, and he was my only friend, even though he did things that today I see as abusive and having, according to my family and some people who have passed through my life, the profile of a sociopath. Honestly, sometimes I agree that he was crazy and sociopathic, the way and the things he said and did, but anyway, I also sometimes think he was the only person in this world who ever understood me. In 2015, my family found out about us and took away all my internet access, preventing us from talking to each other. In 2018, I managed to find him again through a friend (his), but he disappeared days later. I think I was no longer the way he wanted me to be. I'm sure, actually.

I never felt like I fit in, ever since I was a kid I always felt like I was totally different from everyone else. That feeling stays with me to this day. When I go out, I feel extremely out of place and different from other people.

In the past I have been self-harming and I have also suffered from anorexia. Today, I'm dealing with binge eating and trying to lose weight, which is currently the reason that makes me think about suicide the most.
I remember hitting my head against the wall in an (dumb) attempt to kill myself. Today I think a lot about paying someone to do this to me, but I don't have the money. Because on top of all that, I'm still a recent college graduate who is failing to find a job. Another frustration for the huge list.

And now she's gone because things got too hard, or maybe she fell out of love but didn't have the heart to tell me.

Even when we were still together, suicidal thoughts sneak in every once in a while. I was once on a family vacation in New Zealand, and on one gorgeous, quiet, snowy night, the worst case of existential dread I've ever had hit me, kept me up till sunrise, and ruined the rest of the trip for me.

I've never felt a sense of belonging, never felt like anything I did could make me happy. I live a good cushy life, and was what you might call a ""gifted"" child. I did music, art, sports, and I am now in law school.  I keep saying to everybody else that ""my dream is to accomplish x and y"", but most of the time it feels like I'm announcing it to the world so I can convince myself that it is what I really want.

I don't care for a successful career, great friends, exciting hobbies. I feel like I have most of these things now, but none of it feels... right? I've never felt anything genuine, except maybe during my first, now defunct, relationship, and now I'm questioning if the love I felt for my ex was truly giving me a sense of fulfilment, or was it just emotional busywork so I can keep on functioning?

Every night, I go outside and lie on the ground to watch the stars. Sirius shines the brightest, and on good days I can see Betelgeuse, Orion's Belt, and Procyon. And I think about what insignificant specks we all are, how temporal everything is, how STUPID heartbreak, parental expectations, and societal norms are. Sure, I can go to the gym and get my revenge bod. Sure, I can aim for a full GPA and go to grad school. Sure, I can get that prestigious job and that dream apartment and make my parents damn proud.

But when will I feel happy? When will anything I do feel like it's for me, for my own joy?

Or do I have some unrealistic, extravagant conception of happiness, and I'm asking for too much? Am I doomed to the hedonic treadmill forever?

Will there only be solace when I lose consciousness?",1679305253.0

551,Don't know anything anymore.,1,11wd9f7,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11wd9f7/dont_know_anything_anymore/,1,"I feel empty now, I go through manic episodes of suicidal attempts and urges but continue to live. I tried to find god but I felt as if he left me and is no longer trying to help me improve my life.   
I've been surrounded by people that constantly tell me what I have to do, they've forced me to go through college and to provide for them, even though I have nothing.  


I'm 18, I have no job skills, I'm talentless, The only aspect of my life that's good are my grades, I'm a presidential list student and a national honor society member. The only good thing in my life is my scholarship and my car but unfortunately my car isn't in any condition to be driving, I can't afford to fix it since I have to provide for my dads failing business. For the first time he hit me. I don't really have anyone besides my dad and he's not even my dad, hes my step dad. I have ptsd everytime he yells at me I think of an argument from when I was 16 when he told me how I can never call him dad because I'll never earn that title, he apologized to me the same day he said that but only after asking me if I could loan him some money.   


I don't have any friends really. The only friends I have are people who've I've known my entire life but they have drifted away from me as I've let them closer into my life and have told them my problems. My entire family isn't related to me, I'm the only one who shares a different last name and I'm always told that fact as well.   


My only attempt at therapy I was told by my own therapist, ""if you continue life the way you're living, you'll be 30 years old living with your mother"", I was 13 when he told me that, and this was all because of video games, I would play video games to escape reality but pulled back into reality. I can't even write this really I hate all this shit because I'm so hollow right now I'm just going off memory I guess.  


If I commit suicide they'll take advantage and use me as an example, I'll be missed yeah but the problem is I won't be remembered, they'll be sad and move on, that's what happened with others in my family. I wanted to kill myself by disappearing and crashing my car into the river but they'll end up finding me. I've looked for way too many ways to kill myself and everytime I think of it I realize how illogical it is.  


I don't like attention but I told someone how I felt and he told me to grow up, my best friend. I told someone I was going to kill myself but couldn't and he comforted me but just let me be. I told this other friend about how my dad punched me and they ignored it and continued on. I realized that all throughout my life I've been used and abused by people. It's funny because this is my last attempt at seeking any kind of shitty ass condolences or reasons why I shouldn't kill myself. lmao. its petty though. I want attention because I want a fucking reason not to die but I don't want attention because I'm no better then the average fucking young adult experiencing the same shitty ass life but they got over it with plenty of shit done.   
I have enough shit to overdose right now but I can't, I'm so empty inside after crying for 5 hours that I can't bring myself to commit suicide.  
I was suppose to be dead a month ago and I'm still here. I mix fucking random ass shit in a bottle of pre-workout to disguise it that way if I collapse they don't suspect it was an overdose. I've tried to kill myself 3 times this month. I'm overeating so even if I live I'll be fat. I'm fat. Lmao.  i tried to find love but i cant anymore, the last girlfriend i had cheated on me and told me it was my fault, i cant trust anyone, i want to try to find love but my own sexuality gets affected when i think about it. its weird.   


my dad called me while i was writing this to tell me sorry, but thats only because I have to give him a ride tomorrow while he fixes his truck. imma make some shit look like an accident at this point i dont want help just link me with some articles or advice.",1679302049.0

I got the job right out of college due to a huge stroke of luck with the help of my (now former) best friend who still works there. Shortly after in January my dad passed away from esophageal cancer, that’s when I began drinking heavy and started smoking cigs again after having quit 3 years ago. When cigs got too expensive I began smoking the cigars that come in 99¢ packs at the gas station. They’re rough on inhale.

Now I’ve been unemployed for almost 4 months, there’s almost no Jr Software Engineer jobs on the market because of mass tech layoffs, and now I don’t have enough work experience to get any other jobs in my field. Had 11 SE interviews since January, almost every one ends with the hiring person saying “we’re looking for people with **more experience**”. Furthermore I’ve been laughed out of interviews for smaller jobs like data entry and even a barista, because I have a 4 year degree in tech with 3 internships relevant to my degree. Nobody wants to touch someone who’s gonna dip at the next best opportunity.

Get this, internships apparently don’t count as job experience anymore. Go figure. After doing almost 2 years of paid SE internships before graduation, it ultimately meant *nothing*

I’ve got monthly student loan payments summing to $1500 a month. I only have $3500 left, so I have 2 months before shit really hits the fan. My mom refuses to tell me how much the life insurance policy she took out on me will cover — go figure, even *less* peace of mind. My stepfather is a white collar corporate narcissist who’s wholly convinced I was fired for being lazy, when in reality I was already working myself 10 hours a day into an awful anxious depression. Both of them send me job listings weekly — none that I even qualify for, but they use that as a means to further demean me.

I’ve been living with my girlfriend for free who’s been somewhat supportive of everything except for my lower sex drive (can you wonder why?). I’ve recently found out that she takes opportunities when I pass out after drinking to molest me, to “help” her sexual frustration. She does this knowing that I was raped multiple times as a kid by the neighbor boy my mom had babysit me after school. I’m no longer attracted to her at all now because of this but I have nowhere else to live, rent in Philly is insane and the weather has been too cold/windy/rainy to sleep on the streets. There’s no shelters for guys like me, so if I want a roof over my head that’s not a jail cell I have to put up with being sexually assaulted, i guess

I just want out. I won’t be able to endure this much longer. I have an interview this week for a Jr Engineering position at a big health insurance company that doesn’t require experience beyond a bachelors degree. It’s obviously gonna be super competitive and smarter people in better situations than me will surely apply and most likely get it. If I don’t get the job, I’ll most likely end things by the end of April.

I turn 25 on July 1st and I don’t think I want to live to see that day. If I do, I’ll most certainly be broker, drunker, fatter, and sadder than I already have gotten. As it stands, I have not much left to look forward to other than more pain and more misery.",1679272416.0

I was prescribed Xanax because I was in an abusive relationship with their father, struggle super badly with a panic disorder.., I left him last June. But I became severely dependent on them, and that was the reason behind all of my black out nights. 
I blacked out one night when the kids were at their dads. My father picked me up from the bar and apparently I hit him. He called the police. I got arrested for battery (I’ve never been violent in my life… how can I forgive myself? I don’t think that’s forgivable.) I’m on probation.

I know how I’m going to kill myself. (My brain tells me)

I am going to strangle myself/hang myself. Not from a tree, but from an height where I can tie it and sit as I go. 

I enjoy the feeling and I know there will be pain as the blood pools and no more can enter. I know my lungs and chest will burn as I can’t breathe. I know my head will feel as if it will burst.

But followed after that will be a glorious sensation of pleasure and then darkness. 

And I’ll be gone. And done. 

No pills like before. No overdose on antidepressants. No overdose on Benadryl. No overdose of alcohol and sleeping pills. 

No more failed attempts. This time, whenever this time may be, I will not fail. I will be successful. And I won’t be here anymore. 

These are the things my intrusive thoughts tell me. I see my therapist on Tuesday. I’ve started a new medication and I’m aware that su1c1dal thoughts can be a side effect. 

I’ve reached out to my doctor and therapist. I assume I’ll hear back tomorrow.

And the days I have off I spend doing nothing because I’m either dreading going to work again the next day or I’m just too sleep deprived from not being able to sleep before work the day before.

I can’t bring myself to do anything I like or find purpose in life, and even if I did have the energy to do that, I’d have nowhere to focus my efforts because I don’t like anything anymore.

here is my life:

- emotionally abused by my mom, my dad enabled her

- developed PTSD from how she treated me, undiagnosed for 10 years of my life

- first relationship i was abused in and stayed in bc i didnt know that was unhealthy

- second relationship ended because of my toxic behaviors - it lasted 2 years and we had talks about marriage

- after that breakup i took self improvement seriously and went to therapy twice a week for months and stayed on top of my medication 

- today i am finally the good person i always aimed to be. my friends and family notice the difference 


I was in a relationship for 3 months with the best person i have ever met, it was the best i have been treated and he is the most genuine person i have ever met. he broke up with me bc there is a lot going on in his life. and that combined with our relationship being long distance was not working. he doesnt think he can do long distance again.

i understand, i really do. what he is going through is intense. i am not mad or upset.

but i keep thinking about how he said i was the one, he wanted to be with me forever, he wanted to make things work. and yet .. things still end up like this.

i offered to visit, he wants a relationship where he and the other person can see each other every day ,i cant do that.

so now here i am, heartbroken, hurting, lost. why me?

ive constantly gone through some of the worst pain i ever felt, only to recover and then get back into another mess. i really thought this was it, you guys. i think im stupid, i shouldve known better that he wouldnt change his mind. i really am stupid. he still wants to be friends and i do too, but i...i dont know that i can


honestly? im tired. i don't see a point in living for life to just be like this. everyone always tells me im gonna come out stronger. then i just keep going through the worst stuff. this one isnt even happening because of a fault on my end, life is cruel.


it was easier to recover from wanting to die when i thought i was a bad person. now that i know that im not, and life is just unforgiving sometimes - what is the point? i am begging someone to tell me. what is the point?

I’ve always been terrified of dying.

I have great hope for the future.

I’m young and have good physical health.

I have great opportunities and great people who could/would/do support me.

I want to have kids and feel like I could be an amazing father.

But I so desperately want to kill myself. I hate the things I do, I hate the way I treat myself, and I hate the fact that I won’t kill myself.

It feels really weird, because I’ve been depressed (I guess) for about 5 years, and I’ve gone through different phases on my thoughts with suicide, but this one feels different. I’m sad (in a third person kind of way) that I want to kill myself, but I’m also not happy that I know I won’t. Im pissed that the pussy can’t do it, because I’ve already come to terms with death sort of. It’s like a spite thing, like when you know your friend would really like something but they won’t try it. But the thing keeping me from actually killing myself is the stupid support system I have. And not for the reason I assume it’s supposed to. I just can’t hurt those people like that, because I know how each one would react and there is no way I can put them through that. I won’t go into details with all of them since this post is already so long, but I know for a fact my dad would kill himself, either directly (likely) or by stopping taking care of himself (would happen if he survives initial grief). And that would on itself create a domino effect. That man has been and always will be my hero and who I want to be like at his age. I couldn’t do it to him.

This is the type of thinking that (partially) makes me want to kill myself to begin with, I never can seem to put myself first. 

Idk what I want to accomplish with this post, but anything is appreciated. Idk if this even sounds relatable to anyone in any way, but I’m honestly most curious if I’m just blowing things out of proportion. Idk, let me know ig.

So is the tenth year since I graduated high school.
It's almost funny.
I had a small glimmer of hope that I could be someone back then. 
Not now.
It's probably the new psych meds but even before them I've been thinking about suicide. My doctors ask if I have a plan. No. I'm too scared of pain. So instead I just will myself to die.
The past couple of nights I've dreamed where I've predicted my death. In the 'story' of the dream the causes have been similar. Spinal collapse. Cancer. Etc. In each one the predictions relate somehow.
What do I have to live for? Books I'll never read or finish? The novels I'll never write or publish? My dreams are so buried, so deep, that they'll never see the sky let alone reach for the stars.
I'll never beat a video game I love and enjoy.
I'm too distracted or bored or erratic.

I just sit and stare at screens that ruin and strain my eyes. Doing nothing important. I'm not sure what joy is anymore. I don't take care of myself much. I take my meds morning and night. Eat at least one meal. What does it matter? I'm disabled, unemployed, and worthless.

 One thing after another happens. One positive is one too many, so a negative thing occurs. The car went out. And somehow medical coverage I've had since ~birth has ended. I'm still disabled. My limb isn't growing back. Now the rent will probably go up again or we'll be kicked out for 'reasons.'

If I'm gone I no longer have to be a disappointment or a burden. My fiance can take our cat and start over. He's strong.

My life has been crappy and unfair, even for life. I'm a teardrop in the sea.

Change the world? Make a difference?
I can barely help myself.

I was not trying to attempt, I was trying to succeed and make sure I die so I slit my wrist in the horrible way you could imagine ...

Fast forward I was in coma for 2 days and luckly for me the blood bank in the hospital was not empty that day otherwise I wouldn't have made it ...  doctors told my gf that I have less than 10% chance of surviving , I guess a miracle happend .

there's nothing stopping me because everybody left a long time ago. when you reach the bottom, everybody leaves you. i became a monster, incapable of making people like me or even sympathize with me. i'm lucky because nobody will cry or even be upset for my death. i cut contact with the only person who could have a remote feeling, my grandma, and she does not miss me nor asks for me, so that makes everything so easy.

608,"Everyone I meet becomes a weirdo and it feel like it's my fault. I'm literally ruining the world, just by existing.",2,11w2m2s,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11w2m2s/everyone_i_meet_becomes_a_weirdo_and_it_feel_like/,0,"I could meet the nicest person ever. They could be literal Saint with a heart of gold and I'd still somehow cause them to rust.

I destroy everything I touch. Relationships, friendships, good opportunities. Everything. Even things which aren't mine to break. It's honestly like I'm this big black hole, sucking the goodness out of everything. I make everything  and everyone bad. I ruin everything. 

It hurts. It hurts a lot. All my friends turn mean. I mean my first friend became a sexist, racist asshole Andrew tate follower. The second friend I made now hates me and tries to sabotage me a lot. They're dumping me as a friend when we go to college. 

I just made a new friend abd he was literally the nicest person I'd ever met. But I messed it up like I always did. He got all pissy after I said I wouldn't wanna sleep in his bed with him. I really liked him. And now it feels like I've managed to turn him against me too like I do with everyone. My heart hurts. I tried to talk to my mom about it but she said that's just life, and it's how all teenage boys think. It still hurts. 

Everyone and everything that I like gets ruined. I get like this tiny glimpse of happiness and its just snatched away from me before I can make it stay. I can't even make this horrible cycle end because no matter how hard I try to kill myself it never works. 

Slitting my wrists was futile. My overdose was pathetic. I can't even escape this hell. I'm doomed to ruin everything. I hate upsetting people. It hurts. It hurts a lot. I hate ruining people. I just bring out the worst in them. And then I'm left to deal with the consequences, the monster I set free. I just want it to stop. 

I want to scream into the void to stop with the false moments of fleeting happiness that are gone before I can put my guard down enough to enjoy them. And it makes my stomach hurt. I ruin everything. I'm literally on my knees, begging. Make it stop. Make it stop. Make it stop. I'll  pray to Gods I don't believe in, meditate to try and find answers to my sorrows. 

But I'm doomed. I always fuck everything up. I want friends. I want to feel loved, and cared for. I want to be happy and make people smile, but I just ruin them. I make everything bad. I'm like a rot, which spreads from person to person, corrupting their morals and twisting their world view. 

I'm a bad person, and I make other people bad too. I wish I could make it stop. I just wanna run away from here. Run away and ditch everything, fake my death and hide forever. I want to stop hurting people and making them turn bad. I just want to be good. I've heard there's good people out there, but I've never met a single one. 

And it hurts so much. I know as soon as I hear those little words it's over. ""I love you,"" Or ""I really like you"" ""let's be friends!"" 

It's like a switch. I wish nobody would ever utter those words to me again. It's sorta like a kill switch. Everyone who has ever said any of those things has turned on me. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I'm trying to be good and nice and keep everyone happy. But I can't. I'd cut everyone off if I could. Get in a car and drive away the moment those words were uttered.

Those words have caused unimaginable pain and tragedy. I refuse to say them anymore. When I do, I know that means it's only a matter of time until everything is destroyed. And then I'm alone again. It really hurts. I just wanna die so I can make it stop. Why does it alway happen? 

And I tell my mom and she tells me it's life because the words got to her too. I tell my friends and they say they're leaving me. I run around screaming and begging for the universe to stop taunting me. What did I do to deserve this? Please, oh please just make it stop. 

The only way I'm safe is when I'm alone, locked in my room. Scared and alone on the dark. But safe. I won't ruin anyone else. And I wanna cry for days and just melt into a puddle of ooze. Everyone turns on me in the end, even if they promise not to. I always instinctively know, if someone's nice to me then I'm going to ruin them like I ruin everything. The only people who are nice to me are the people who end up hurting me the most. 

And I don't wanna live in a world where I make people bad. It hurts so bad this time. Everytime someone manages to sneak through the barbed wire fences and cages made of steal, they deal a fatal blow to my heart. Its like they can sense that I'm a Monster. When  I open up to people they leave quicker. I'm so fucking  dumb. I'm fine with being alone it it means I get to be safe. I'm fine with being scared and crying myself to sleep If it means my heart is safe. 

I'm shaking and crying trying to fight the urges. It's selfish. Trying to stay alive when all I do is ruin things. I just want to be locked away in a tall tower, but as much as I yearn to be saved, it would be better if I didn't get rescued at all. I don't deserved to be rescued.  Everything I touch turns to dust. And now I've lost yet another friend. It always happens. Adults I talk to start acting inappropriately or hurt me. Teenagers turn on me. Little kids get hurt because of me, or bully me. 

I'm just floating endlessly begging for it to be over. Literally on my knees at this point. I just want it to stop. And I don't care about the it gets better bullshit or you'll find someone who will care about you one day, I don't. The only time it gets better is when life is preparing to give me the biggest kick in the ass ever, straight back down to the ground. I reach a new rock bottom every day and I just wish I would stop waking up so it would stop. 

I wish people would just be mean to me first before turning after a while. I wish I could just get it all over and done with. I just wish it would stop.",1679271354.0

I lashed out at her. It’s not fair. I’ve tried so hard to change and there are people out there with husbands calling themselves lesbians. It’s not fucking fair. I feel like every day I meet more and more lesbians with husbands. Why do so many lesbians have exceptions and I can’t? I can’t even find male celebrities attractive. Why am I the only lesbian suffering with pure homosexuality? Am I fucking broken? I used to be confident with my identity but now I feel disgusted with myself for looking at women certain ways and I look at men and try so hard to be attracted to them. I just want to be a lesbian with an exception. People tell me everyone is bi and that me being 100% lesbian is statistically impossible. I wish that were fucking true! They say that like I haven’t tried so god damn hard to change. I dated a guy for 2 years and I should have never explored my identity. I should have stayed with him thinking that it was normal to not really like the person you’re dating. I think about all the stuff I’ve done with women and I feel disgusted. After I lashed out a lesbian told me she used to be like me until she found queer community offline. I lashed out at her too. I’m in fucking Missouri. Everybody here is too scared to be open about that stuff. Whenever I meet queer people they hear I’m a lesbian and their smile fades and they never ask to meet up again. They just kind of ghost me. The rare queer person who tolerates my lesbianism usually does not tolerate the autism. I can never win. And plus with all these new laws I’m not sure if I will have a decent quality of life. I just want to end my life. Being 100% lesbian is pure suffering. 



Nobody likes me. I’m so fucking lonely that I pretend to have meaningful loving conversations with imaginary people at home. I walk around and just talk to myself and imagine I’m with friends that don’t exist. I have a better relationship with the fucking air than I do with any human being. The loneliness is so bad that I look forward to work and dread my days off. Just because I get my social needs met. But the entire shift I beat myself up for not working hard enough or not listening to people or being so  fucking awkward. Once someone asks me about my tarantulas I go into nerd mode and they’re just so grossed out and think I’m some sort of freak. I hate existing. I want to like men. I want to be normal. I want to be loved. All of that is out of reach. I won’t commit suicide tonight because I have to be careful to arrange things and make sure things go smoothly for my family after I die so they don’t get in any legal disputes. I need to figure out who will find me and how to ensure that happens because I live alone. I still have lots of planning to do.



I can’t stop crying. I have an injured meniscus because I always pull and dislocate shit but they won’t fucking listen to me. I have PMDD and im like an emotional bomb. My neighbors fucking dog has caused significant sleep deprivation. I am also a terrible person.

In February I broke up with my 1 year girlfriend (I'm in 8th grade) whom was the first person I loved. It needed to be done though because we ended up never seeing each other and it felt like it was going nowhere, and I knew I was acting inappropriately and felt terrible for liking another person. so I broke up with them, i felt sad at first but then got over it in a few days because I found new people that cared about me. let's call them C & A. I trusted both of them and C was the one I developed feelings for and cared for with all my heart. I knew they liked me back and was just waiting for myself to recover from my breakup so it wasn't a rebound. about 3 weeks later I hung out at their house and we just felt so comfortable with each other and I've never felt so amazing around a person and like I could be who I was and just hug them and love them and be loved back. I asked C out and they said yes. after that day, everything felt amazing like nothing could go wrong. I thought nothing would go wrong because they said they were just waiting for me to be ready for the relationship and I thought I was. Then \~2 days later we hung out again. everything was still fine, but they mentioned how they felt that they were a bad person and started being rude to everyone since we started dating. I didn't really see it but then they just said that I suffered from the same behavior. that I really needed to work on how I treat others, and so after that day I did work on it. and I was getting better. (btw, about a week before we started dating cut myself. they were really sad so I promised not to do it again. then when they had a bad day, they also hurt themselves. I was so hurt and sad because I care about them so much and said I wouldn't ever hurt myself again as to not put them through that.) but just two days later I cut my legs up so fucking bad. I was pissed that day because I was literally crying and wanted to receive help from my friends. at least a ""I'm sorry you're sad"" a ""I hope you feel better"" or at least a hug because I was fucking down because I kept thinking about how C called me a bad person. A didn't really give a shit but did ask if i was alright, I said no but I was sort of laughing through the tears because I was coping. I just wanted someone to care but they acted like I was invisible and I hated how I couldn't ask for help. here's how I fucked everything up in 4 days; I cut myself when I got home. I was tired of being so depressed and so tired of hating myself for sort of looking for attention by crying I guess. when I told C they just seemed really disconnected like they didn't care. I said I was sorry for breaking the rules I set and making them feel bad but they just said ""I don't know anymore."" I had no idea wtf that meant at the time but the next day at school they couldn't even look at me. at all. I made a few jokes about self harm because when I'm sad I joke about what's bugging me. It was sort of awkward to do at the time but I literally just wanted help. I was seeking attention because I didn't want to feel terrible anymore. then in 1st hour C just left, without any explanation and I thought it was because they were mad at me. they had every right to be. I went to the councilor's office because I was literally crying in class and wanted somewhere to do that but I spilled too much information. and the councilor knew i cut myself and told my mom. I got sent home and after that and Talked to them about it. they said they wouldn't ignore me again like that and would help me get better. they said that they just couldn't look at me because they knew they would get mad or just cry and I said if they need to get it out they could. the next day I only saw them twice because C was going somewhere with their family in the middle of the school day. I kept Joking about my self harm again with A and didn't think anything of it just that I thought I would stop sometime soon because I thought I was getting better and was finally able to heal. I even apologized for being such a bad person at times to most of my friends and promised to be better soon although it was brief at least I was finally expressing myself, I thought. then at the end of the day my other friend, T said that A told them that they wanted mine and C's relationship to fall and burn and that it was because I was a bad person and was negatively affecting them. I didn't think much of it but the next day on Friday when C found out about how A felt I think It really got to them. they probably realized how much of an ass I was then. and when they came back from talking to A they were crying. I didn't know what to do because sort of knew I was a problem in their life at that point. I was confused and angry that A felt that way but It was going to be fine I thought. C promised not to leave me. C promised that they would help me through the shit I was going through in my head. But then the next morning, They texted saying that they needed to break up with me because ""i was turning them into someone they weren't"" and because ""I was hurting them and everyone around them"" and bc I needed to work on myself before getting into another relationship. I understood where they were coming from but I thought I was getting better, and that my health was improving. then they said I needed to apologize to everyone be a better person.  that they weren't going to leave yet though like J did (J is my ex of 1 year) and weren't going to say we couldn't keep being friends after it. but once I sent my apologies everyone responded saying that my behavior was ok but A said it wasn't forgivable at all. that I made them and everyone else uncomfortable and that i wasn't a bad person for just being rude and saying uncalled for things at times, no but because of everything literally everything i do. it's hard for me to say everything but I just realized that day how Terrible of a person I really was. whenever I'm with someone I treat them better than everyone else. I'm disgustingly clingy. I joke about my struggles with self harm and most of all I apparently blame everyone else for my problems and how disgusting I am. All the things A said I cant look back on it. But I've been thinking about it all day. I really don't deserve anything. even C said that they realized they didn't even lose anything by breaking up with me. that the part of them that loved me was in the wrong. When I asked how they felt about me, they just responded ""you don't deserve to know"" and ""fuck you"" it hurt so much to know they felt that way. and I felt like Dying that day like I had no reason to live at all anymore and I just wanted a reason to live and they said ""I can't think of a reason, sorry"" I'm so fucking done. almost everyone I cared about hates me and said they don't want me ever to talk to them again. A said I didn't deserve at all to be forgiven and that I actually make them sick to their stomach sometimes. I don't know how to come back from this. those friends that I had meant everything to me. C & A were who I thought I was closest to. now I'm pretty sure I only have 2 real friends. I feel like absolute shit because of this. I don't know what to do or how to become a better person now. C was all I had and now I have less than nothing in them and apparently I'm just that insanely unlovable. I hate myself even more now and I don't know what to do. I just want to die because the person I loved just fucking hates me. I'm not worth the trouble, I guess. And it's not even just C and A. I've been struggling more than ever with my self image. I hate everything about the way I look, sound, and I wish I wasn't trans so I didn't feel this way. I also just hate the person I've become. I constantly make fun of and pick on my friends and act like I'm better and when I'm not doing that I'm making everyone 'uncomfortable' for seeking help. Every time I get close to someone I just hurt them and make them either disturbed by me or terrible about themselves, or both. the only friends i still have are only here because they don't know me that well. if they really knew how disgusting and manipulative I was towards the people i loved Im sure they wouldn't feel that way. i feel so worthless and I can't tell if my desire to die is getting better or worse as I think about this incedint.",1679278640.0

After more or less 4 years, I finally switched from my previous therapist (psychoanalysis) towards a Dialectic Behavioral Therapist.

I'm currently 32, recently lost my job (March 2023) and my employer scammed me so I won't get a severance package.

Sadly, my mental situation is really complex. After working with the previous therapist, I managed to finally acknowledge the real significance what happened to me during my childhood has.

I lived with my parents until I was 4. After that, my mom discovered my dad had another family, so he left and never took care of me. He only visited me once a week and every time he invented a different story about why he can't be with me, with my mom, or how my mother was lying, how he couldn't afford paying my school and so on.

My mother had to work a lot, because she didn't have a degree. In Peru, it´s really difficult to get a decent salary if you have no education. When I was 10, she flew to Asia, leaving me with my older sister and my aunt and uncle. My sister decided to leave for the USA, when I was 11, and just 4 weeks before I had started being abused by my school owner.

He played the role of a protective male who would care for me and support me. As a child, I believed and trusted him, which he took advantage of, after realizing how neglected I was growing.

During the following 5 years, I was intimately abused, via intercourse and psychologically speaking.

I was forced to wear women clothes, to repeat phrases such as ""I like taking it whole"", ""I was born to receive seed from men"" and so on. During multiple years.

Every single act was recorded, and several times 1 or 2 extra men joined for the ""fun"" they had with me. Everything happened inside the same school, which was connected to the school owner flat he had for himself.

Since my dad didn´t want to pay anything, my mother was struggling to get enough money in Asia, so my school payments were due. The owner offered me an arrangement of a $1 discount per each time his (or his friends') seeds were unloaded inside me and this got recorded.

I managed to pay my own school through this, all the way from last year of junior school up to the lst year of high school.

I got humiliated, degraded, filmed and left merciless, sometimes they would put their feet on my head, while I was on the couch and they were doing their thing as hard as possible.

When I was 15, I discovered I had HPV, intestinal wounds, and herpes. This didn't stop the school owner, though, who kept doing his thing, until one day I just simply couldn't take it.

That day I stopped believing in a god. After asking for mercy or help in my head and from my mouth, after asking some adults for help and realizing nobody came, I had to become strong enough to stop this from happening, and be smart enough to get an upper hand. Whenever I had previously tried to resist or use any amount of strength, I got pressed down to the couch, or they did their thing even more merciless.

I finally stopped it after recording audio and uploading it to the internet as a threat. Since I had the names of the other involved men, I requested they left me skip the last school year. I had been the valedictorian student even going through all that, because feeling so powerless and alone only made me realize I had to become my own parent, since I couldn't count with anybody else.

I started working by 15 and left my home by 19, after saving some money. The money became a monster to me since it's the main resource me and my family lacked all the time, and the one that was used as a weapon against me to abuse me.

When I was 17, I entered an state college here in Peru (free but difficult to get accepted) and finally finished my career.

What happened over the following years, is that I kept reliving or looking to live those situations again. Every time I saved some money and was out of the ""emergency state"". I also kept looking for relationships that degraded me, controlled me, physically hit me and so on.

On the other hand, my mother came back from Japan and she was also super violent to me, screaming, hitting me and so on. I had to move a couple times to avoid she found me, because she told me I robbed her of her life and that I was a bastard for not giving her my salary each month or letting she take control of my life.

Last year she even went to publicly accuse me, without any evidence, that I neglected her and hit her, but then I shown all the receipts from money transfer I've been sending to her since I was in college to help her have a decent life. She even owns a house, which I don't, but the keeps asking for more and saying that she having a house doesn't make a difference and it's my own fault for not making more money.

My trauma started appearing after I got the news the school owner passed away by 2015, which really set my mind wild, because the person I hated the most was finally dead, so I was ""safe"". Sadly, this has all impacted my life, my personal relationships and even my jobs.

I have difficulty trusting people, setting boundaries, loving and caring for myself. Sometimes I dream of the trauma or invasive thoughts come and I start panicking or crying since I feel like being there, stuck inside those awful moments.

The peruvian goverment doesn't care about mental health. I've talked to some of the free hotlines they provide and the ""professionals"" have really treated me bad. They recommended things such as going to church or just accepting the fact my life is awful and contemplate ending it soon (I have audio recordings of this). This is the quality of mental health services you get for free here, so I've been forced t go for private mental care, which is really expensive.

Sadly, my first approach, after meeting with around 12 therapist, was to go for a psychoanalyst, which helped me, yes, but it was really expensive since she strongly recommended having 4 sessions per week. Considering each session costed $50 (USD), you can image how much debt I have right now and can't pay.

The bank doesn't care about my mental health. All the jobs I've had had taken advantage of me in a way such as giving me a fixed time contract instead of a indefinite-term, as explicitly written during the job offer emails, and so on.

I've been recommended by lawyers to fight, but Peru is so small that a lawsuit could close me doors, and honestly I don't have the mental energy to deal with this, several days I can barely survive.

By the way, I've diagnosed with complex PTSD, depression, generalized anxiety and ADHD. I have to take medication for all of this. I've even resorted to blowing men for some extra cash to pay for my medication, since my jobs started delaying their payments due to lack of liquidity.

I'm really desperate exposing my private life here, but it's because it's getting really difficult. I wish I could only live a normal life, I feel life is so hard and so unfair to me, after having lived in heel and nightmares for multiple years, now I keep struggling enough so my own head tells me everyday I should probably just give up and stop eating, drinking water and such, in order to have my heart and brain to finally shut down.

But I don't want to. Over the time, I've realized I want to cope with this. I want to become strong and develop the skills to surpass this.

I also cry thinking multiple persons could be living this in their day by day. I look forward to the day I could live with this, I know the pain will never go away, but I want to be able to endure it, and become strong enough to prevent children and teenagers from suffering like I did, and help adults to overcome the wounds from the trauma they could have suffered, just like me.",1679274376.0

I start off by explaining my mistake was because I forgot to put my phone in my pocket but my dad ignored me and I pushed him to get him to respond and then he told Mom what I did and made me seem like the instigator and that it is overall only my fault. My mom believed him and made me apologize to him and tried to scare me by telling me that I could get in big trouble. I have pushed him three more times since that incident for different reasons each time and I was forced to apologize by mom each time for acting out of desperation to get him to talk to me due to him ignoring me when I did actually start off by talking to him in October of 2019. I still get taken care of by my parents but that doesn't mean that they aren't toxic and if I move out I would be alone. I can't leave a place that is toxic because I am provided with everything that I need except consistent regular communication outside of asking me what I want to eat or telling me I have food that I have food downstairs that they have just bought for me. I feel like I mishandled being ignored because of my parents toxic manipulation even though I'm only seeking consistent regular communication outside of just being told or asked about food. I also feel guilty for not having the TV on channels my dad normally watch. I have to live where I'm unwanted and can't leave because of my health trouble and lack of money to move because I get fed and taken care of. I can't reach out to others because they would victim blame me and not understand how my depression truly started. My dad has also threatened to kill me and told me there was the door. I have too many disagreements differences with dad overall. My dad also talks about sports and other news and occurrences and stuff that stress me out.,1679273646.0

I'm truly one of the worst people out there, I fuck up everything I touch. Almost like the Midas touch but instead of turning things into gold, I turn them into garbage.  


My suicidal thoughts are banging heavier than usual in my head today, it's one of those times when you realize that you're on a worse spot than you thought you were yk? Today my stupid brain was rewinding all the friendships I had, and how badly they ended, always my fault, as usual... I'm tired, fucking tired off everything. Nobody cares about men's feeling, specially people in my age and in the society surrounding me. Everytime I try talking to someone new, they run away like I'm a monster... I can't take this rejection anymore because I'm a fucking crybaby snowflake that hasn't had a fucking normal childhood, leading me to be the failure I am.  


Today I dreamnt about a (ex)friend of mine, and she showed me pictures of how well she was in her new life; ""without you in my life"", she said. It was like a preview of my day. Later, I heard some news about another friend that left me because of how stupid I was. She's studying abroad in a very rich country, 16 years old... a true prodigy. It seems like people's lives turn into better when they leave me, while I eat dust in the sickening race that is life. It was only downhill since I was born, and I've had enough... enough of that shit, I want to die.  


There are many reasons, some of them don't fit in a Reddit post, some of them aren't developed enough in my mind to be turned into words. I have anger in my heart and I'll violently unleash it on three people: my parents, and then myself. I'm planning to kill both of them, since they never gave me chance to normally develop as a child. Then, I will kill myself because I don't deserve to be alive anymore, I fuck everything up. Any thoughts in my head leads to suicide. It's like a death funnel.  


Nobody will listen to the things in my head, they don't want my negativity around. Maybe some will laugh at my suicide: say it was childish, unexplainable or selfish. But why should I care? Nobody is truly there for anyone, we're all alone.  


I don't believe in life after death but, if I ever come to see how things will follow through after my death, it would probably be painful. To see that no one cares.  


Yes, I want some attention. Who the fuck made this look like something bad? Why can't I pursuit some dignity? Why can't I just be heard?  


It's ridiculous how I act like somebody cares, like someone is listening me. All of this is in my head. Nobody is listening and no one ever will. If i write a letter, will I be understood? I don't think my head fits in a simple letter, neither does it in an entire book. Whatever, it's just a bunch of junk and I wouldn't even be able to put it into words.  


I'd like someone to grind my bones to dust, spread them in a nice garden, take the rest of my body and bury without a coffin so that I can be a part of the beautiful nature. Maybe then I can be something I like: atoms in nature. Just atoms, part of plants, soil, animals, etc

I have been thinking about taking my life and that. It was a thought that disappeared for a couple of months, like mid august last year. They came back but I believe that stronger. Since 2021 my life has been like in uncertainity. In my house things with my mom have been weird and she has her own stuff going on. I do care for my family but sometimes i like to think about myself and ending this stuff. 

My idea of talking over here is to see if I could talk to someone. People! I don't have the possibility of paying a psychologist. I have been attended by a psychiatrist and I believe the pills they prescripted are not functioning thus my next appointment is on august 2023. IDK if you know but psycologist and psychatrist are different stuff so I don't really have help from them. Many people got spiritual help but I feel so so bad that I don't wanna move from bed. If I move, it's because my mom or grandma needs me for anything; besides that, I don't want to do anything.

My mom has her own situation with suicide plus anorexia and she has been going through some stuff from work. If I talk to her I know that I will do anything but help her. I don't want to say anything to my best friend. I study at the University but I have done nothing the past 8 weeks I believe, many would think within my social circle that I am exaggerating or just being a total vagabond. 

I don't want to bother my mom with my stuff, I shall be affecting her much more than what she is currently going through. My dad is not even part of this equation, I have his contact and I talked to him maybe an hour ago and he does not care at all. What scares me the most is that in my house there is some medication without usage that if I lose my conscious mind, would drink and lead to a sleepy death with an overdose. 

My best friend lives far away from me and I saw her more than a month ago. I love her so much because maybe she is the only one I could talk about. But she can barely do anything for me. Much of our friendship, since we graduated in 2021 has become virtual. Besides that I got no friends to talk, I am crying right now. My grandma has cirrhosis which is a sickness that has no cure and I know that she'll die maybe sooner and I don't want that.

I can't go to church because I feel so lazy that I can barely do anything. I saw about manifestation and started practicing it but I got sort of disappointed idk. I must be by now tidying up and cleaning my room because when I pass away I want everything to be clean but I am lazy to do so. I had so much plans but i feel very bad, broke, and without hope.

19th March 
nothing.

On the 18th I had the worst experience ever. I had taken the 26 tablets before my parents came home. It took around an hour before the extreme nausea started to kick in. I was fighting for my life to stay conscious as we went out for lunch, trying my best not to throw up and faint. Had to leave immediately after eating to get home alone and luckily didn't fall asleep on the transport. 

Now it's the next day as my nausea is somewhat gone, a slight headache but no side effect present. The day before I was contemplating whether to call the ambulance, without letting my guardians know. I cannot tell them as I would rather not stress them, especially with the fact that my mother is pregnant. I've been researching a for a couple of days but still I don't know what to do. Nothing seems wrong despite the amount of pills taken over the past 4 days. Is it too late to ask for help? Am I in danger? When will it work?

Edit: First time on Reddit, so not sure why I can't see the comment on this post when I got a notification for it.


Edit 2: 
Currently in school, so I will try reaching out to the school counsellor if I can. As said before, all the dizziness and pain has subsided. I can't shake off the panic and stress though of uncertainty, not knowing what's going to happen to me. Thank you for the support so far!

Edit 3: (Update)
It's the day after reaching out to the counsellor. I explained my situation and she was helpful and professional. Unfortunately for me, by the end of the session I had to bite the bullet and call my mother to come to the school which resulted in her finding out what happened. We were told to go to the hospital to get a checkup, but ended up booking an appointment instead. 

Once we got home, as expected, all hell broke loose and I really can't explain the amount of stress it caused me and still does. 

Despite being absolutely drained, I went to school today with a fever and headache from the stress (pretty sure it's not from the OD) and just finished now. I'll be going to my GP and getting a slip to go some sort of mental institution. It was all vague but managed to freak me out nonetheless, after knowing how the mental institutions in  the country I currently live in aren't the best.

Was it all worth it? Was it worth it to finally reach out for help? I don't know, but I'll keep updating this post for as long as I can:)",1679258314.0

I'm 25 years old and have been living away from home for almost a year. I'm from Ireland but am living in London after following a big career opportunity, and so far it's going ok. A lot of downs, but a few ups so I guess it's all been balancing out.

I guess I don't really have a segue to saying this, but I don't feel like I can live for much longer. I've no health complications/issues, I'm relatively healthy physically, but mentally I'm not ok. I feel sad and lonely a lot of the time. My family and girlfriend are back home and I miss them so much. I've noticed I've been drinking a lot over the last few months (not always getting shitfaced, but having something to get the lightest buzz) and whenever I visit home I smoke weed most nights. These substances make me feel a lot better than I do without.

I've ticked off a number of things on my bucket list such as see my favourite band live, meet said favourite band, work in my desired career field, find a partner I feel happy with, move out of my parents house, etc. I know my bucket list isn't super exciting or long, but I can't think of anything else to add on to it.

I spend most weekends at my flat, browsing the internet aimlessly and trying to find something to do with my couple of days off. Admittedly, a few weeks ago I'd gone out with a friend of mine for a few drinks and when I was waiting for my train to arrive, all I could think about was ending my life. It just came out of nowhere, I wasn't even feeling sad or helpless, it came into my head and took over - clearly I didn't act upon it. Since then I've realised that I don't see myself living much longer. I don't have a plan for ending my life, but I can't see myself living to 30 (that's only five years away). I struggle to plan for things that are less than a year away becasuse I put so little thought into the future, I just try and plan things day-by-day or week-by-week.

I haven't expressed any of this with anyone in my life because I don't see them often or else they live back home, and I don't want to scare anyone. I don't really know what to do with myself.",1679269719.0

She had multiple people telling her to leave me. I didn't know anything was wrong.

I worked my ass off. I got better. WE got better. Then my mental health jumped off a cliff in February. Valentine's week, even.

3 weeks ago she told me she was thing about leaving me but was willing to give me one more chance. The love was gone from her. She still had hope it would return.

I would never hurt this woman. She is the best thing that has ever happened to me.

I started working harder. On myself, for me, on us...

Last night, something happened and in one fell swoop, I destroyed everything. In my fucking sleep.

I had zero control over what happened. She had not spoken a single word to me and has been having our roommate ask our kids to get ready to go somewhere, etc. 

I ruined everything without knowing I was doing anything. I woke up during the incident, and immediately tried to rectify. I've been in tears all day. I'm fucking devastated.

I threw away my only chance... I'm my fucking sleep.

This last week, everything was getting better. We were getting back to how we used to be. She was starting to trust me again. Starting to feel love again.

I can't. I just can't anymore. Losing her is the most devastating thing I've ever dealt with. I can't do it. I'm not strong enough.

I've survived trying to kill myself 4 times in the past, one of which ended up institutionalized.

I'm not scared of dying. I'm scared of trying to live with what I've done. With knowing what I threw away.

I have a plan. I have a note. I've done all I can to fix things. It took a single, unconscious moment, to destroy everything. I'm going where nobody will find me. To them I'll just disappear.

I just can't keep going. I'm 33 and It feels like I've been doing nothing but barely keeping my head above water for the last 25 years.

My heart is finally broken. I am finally hollow. I feel nothing but shame, regret, agony, dispair.

I can't be there for my kids. I'm not strong enough. Not even for them.

I've thought about suicide so many times and even attempted it a few times but my family found out and force me to throw up every time. (I only tried overdosing on meds, I just want a peaceful death. I always think I don't want anyone to find a dead body covered in blood or poop)

I got a dog two years ago and he is the light of my life. tbh whenever i think about ending my life i think about him and I can't do it. but I feel sorry for him. I am always crying and sad and I think it's affecting him too. I always think he would be better off with someone else who is mentally and financially stable.

a few months ago I decided I should go to school again. after a very stressful process I managed to enroll in a university abroad (I wanted to be away from my family. we are all going through a lot and my parents stress me out a lot) but now I am here, nothing is working out for me. I applied to over 200 student jobs and part time jobs and got none. I have no friends at all. even therapists never helped. last month the therapist I used to go to basically told me that i'll never achieve anything because of my mental state. a relative told me I am too old now and I basically don't have any chances getting good job in the future.

I just feel like it is time to give up now. I don't think tomorrow will be better. I can confidently say I tried my best and so maybe this should be the end. This might sound crazy but I feel like the universe has given me signs that I had my shot at life, I failed and now it's time to give up.

My wife's suicidal ideations first came to my knowledge after our daughter was born when she had post natal depression. She said she wanted to end her life, we got her to the drs who gave her sertraline which helped take the edge off. She wasn't offered any counselling and she thought she got better so came off cold turkey. After she did this I asked her to go to the doctor for advice which she reluctantly did but they didn't say much further apart from to monitor it.

She was clearly still depressed and pushed me away. When our daughter was about 1 she started an affair with a friend that went on for 9 months, then I found out. She says she wants to try and fix it relationship but she is almost entirely consumed by self pity, depression and strong suicidal ideation again. We have tried counselling which hasn't helped much if at all (mainly because she doesn't practise the advice of the counselor). She is going to the drs on Monday to ask for medication again. She is also pregnant.

When I pretend to be happy and act like the affair didn't ruin our marriage she is happy, when I am down/angry/want to talk about it she gets depressed and shuts down.

Would separation be a safe option so that she can get herself sorted out without me being around? I won't stay in a relationship with her without us addressing the affair, which she has to a certain degree but she can't/won't do it completely due to her MH. Do you think it's safe to do this in tandem or try and wait until she is in a better place with her depression?

Her depression is moderate/high, she has desire to no longer be alive but doesn't think she will act on it now due to our daughter and unborn. She has told me she would only go through with it when the baby is born and weaned and she had told me how she would do it. She said she feels our children would be happier and better off without her. I have told her she is a good mother and listed 100 things about her the are good. I also got her to say back to me ""I am a good mother"" as well as some other things. She had felt a lot better the past couple of days after we did that.",1679233136.0

TRIGGER WARNING - Suicide

Guess I just want to be heard right now, I feel completely defeated, betrayed, sick and alone. As a kid I watched someone commit suicide. It was a rail pass incident outside of my school. Ever since then I’ve been struggling with suicidal tendencies related to railway tracks. I don’t want to go too much into it, but that’s the gist of it.

Throughout my life (I depend on my dad for support due to autism) my family haven’t really talked about it much with me. It’s like it never even happened.

Today I got into an argument about one of our dogs. I was worried about our husky (Loki) overheating with his harness. I got upset that nobody was listening to me. It’s pretty standard. My opinion doesn’t mean much.
It got to a point where I had a meltdown. I wanted to go for a walk. When I get like that, grounding myself helps.

My sister took this as an opportunity to say something that completely baffled me
She said “are you going to take Loki to the railway?”
It took about 5 seconds for it to really hit me. I honestly thought she told me to go onto the nearby railway tracks - I asked her where she got that from, then my dad told me that I told him I would do that a while back.

Problem is, I didn’t and I would never. I’m fine with the prospect of doing something like that to myself, but I would never do that to my best friend. I asked him when I said that and he couldn’t answer me. My sister was looking smug and didn’t say anything. My other sister told her to not say anything.

I walked out without my phone. I went for a good 2 hour walk. It took me close to a local railway track and I struggled very hard not to do anything.

Got home and now I just feel tired. My sister tried to talk to me but she just tried to compare what I was saying (I said I thought it was cruel to take a husky out in summer type of heat with a winter coat on) to her using my suicidal tendencies against me.

She knew the moment she used the word ‘railway’ it was going to hit me hard. I’m still trying to figure out why my dad would lie about something like that and then pass it onto my sister who then used it against me like that. 

They’re trying to make me feel like the bad guy and tried to tell me that my reaction wasn’t necessary. I just don’t understand how someone could say those things. 

I’m done. I’m tired. I’ve never felt this amount of heartbreak and betrayal before. I don’t even know how to write it all out because my mind feels so muddled.",1679250618.0

She was such a beautiful, kind, funny, charismatic, smart, faithful, genuine, kind, goofy and a loving individual, partner, friend, and soulmate. She struggled with depression and was taking medication for it, and was also drinking because she was depressed (I’m assuming) a lot  and it caused her to blackout. We had so many rough nights but so many beautiful moments. I honestly loved her more than I can explain and miss her dearly. In the past year I’ve met someone who I’ve started dating. The beginning was beautiful and after a long time of feeling like I’d never love anyone like that again, I was proven wrong. She also struggles with depression and also drinks a lot. There’s been nights where she’s done self harm. And it triggers me back to my last relationships. I’m not a saint either. I’m in recovery for a heroine addiction.

My IQ is continuously decreasing and my forehead is pitifully low, signalling a lack of intelligence. Meanwhile, my personality is still the same misanthropic, autistic, schizoid-like, paranoid, unlikable, neurotic mess that has been present from childhood onward, my physical strength is mediocre and utterly incapable of meeting the demands of the world. I am like Charlie Gordon, slowly losing his intelligence as he can only watch as people begin to pity him, and as he grows dependent on others. I know the reactions of others, they pity me, they see me as a child, though I do not blame them for feeling that way. My IQ is already marginally below average, and in the future it'll only get worse and drop further. I am cursed by my genes, environment, childhood; a perfect concoction of despair, hopelessness, and frustrstion at the world for being so perfectly unfair. For all intents and purposes, suicide is truly the only rational and ethical choice...

...were it not for my family. I can't die either, my family will miss me dearly, and the long-term benefits will potentially be ruined if the short-term drawbacks are this large. I can't die, I am too cowardly, I am too weak, and reliant on instinct (survival instinct to be precise). I can't find sweet relief, I can only leech off of my family, I can't do anything, and I am stuck in a fork between ruining the lives of my family like an earthquake and ruining the lives of my family like a cancer upon them. I can't do anything, I can be anyone, I can only stand by and slowly disintegrate, waiting for the day that I die by natural or unnatural causes, to hope that my death doesn't impact my family the same way, that they receive some sort of closure. And note that it is *only* my family, I am sure my death at school will range from indifference to annoyance to some mildly glad or relieved.

Everytime I try to get help, I am the victim to constant cliches, the same answers that are meaninglessness, or an absence of an answer altogether. How do I live with a low IQ? The answers are just talking about how everyone else is stupid, signs that someone *else* has a lower IQ, liberal/conservative IQ this, Dunning-Kruger that, never considering whether or not they are the ones who are at the left side of the bell curve. Perhaps they are justified in their feeling that they are superior, just as I am justified in the feeling that I am inferior, yet people still never give advice to those on the unluckier side of things. I am inherently worthless and am a burden on my family, what do I do? ""It gets better!"" ""Your time will come! ""Imagine Sisyphus happy!"" ""You are just being dramatic"", no one ever believing my case to be a rational one, merely treating it as something to be dismissed and minimized. The worst of it is this one statement: ""You *are* smart!"", heard time and time again either by biased sources or by obvious  and blatant liars, believing I am too stupid to actually give into their lies, or they seem to deny the fact that IQ changes and in some people gets worse with age, and that the Wilson Effect makes it more genetic. They see me as a static individual, not as a rotting corpse that can't be properly laid to rest.

I've given up on life, intelligence was the only thing I had, my only redeeming quality, and I have lost it. People may think that intelligence isn't everything, and for 99.99% of the population that is true, I am the .01% that could only rely on intelligence. I was seen as a bright kid, and looking back I was. I don't have social skills, a good personality or work ethic, I have none of the strengths of my family and all of their qeaknesses. I have nothing besides intelligence to fall bac on. Now I have become below average, and my dwindling intellect has progressed to the point of failing basic arithmetic. Suicide was my only saving grace, the option I could turn too when all was lost, and now no longer is it that saving grace, I am truly stuck, in a situation where anything I do results in a lot of damage to my family and to those I care about.",1679257240.0

If One does not speak against the irresponsibility of selected authority figures that are more concerned with a hastily procured conclusion rather than an honest conclusion against the threat of losing acceptance from socially desirable adherents, One will regrettably succumb. If a governing party initiates a trial involving science when they only know of religion, does science then become obsolete unless regarded by the socially desirable? If One perceives an iniquity to have been done or seeks to relinquish oneself of responsibility to appear trustworthy, does One’s previously acquired trust void the need for competently gathered supportive evidence to manifest a selectively favorable conclusion?

I am thinking of ending it all, genuinely, this time. 

Over the past few months my relationship with my (now ex-) girlfriend has been rocky and falling apart a bit. I’ve always been a recluse and don’t have many friends to rely on. I’ve been ghosted and abandoned by almost everyone I’ve ever cared about at some point or another. The only two people I’ve consistently had to rely on at this point were my girlfriend of nearly a year and my best friend of 6 years. She, 18 when I met her, and he, now 21 and about 6 months younger than me, have been the cornerstones of my mental health for as long as I can remember. That being said, I’ve deeply contemplated suicide time and time again. One day, coming so close as to having everything written out and everything. The only two people who I could talk to about my feelings at this time, were them. They talked me through it and told me they’d be there for me whenever I needed it. Sometime later I find myself cheating on my girlfriend (I’m well aware that this makes me a piece of shit). I had several girls I was talking to online, but when it came time to meet one of them, nothing happened and i came clean to my girlfriend. She broke up with me and said some truly awful things to me which I will not repeat here. This was tuesday night. 3 days later, my best friend starts acting odd. Come this morning, I get a text from him saying he can’t handle me anymore and I’m blocked on everything. Other mutual friends are treating me weird and he has reached out to my parents, to which they now are on suicide watch duty. I am destroyed. I have effectively lost everything and everyone and feel that I have nothing left to look forward to. I have cried, sobbed, and held a gun to my head over and over again just arguing with myself why i should(n’t) do it. The pain is unmatched and I have nowhere left to go. I need to find the courage to just pull the trigger but I’m struggling. I can’t keep pushing people away and being told that i’m too much. I need the nightmare to end.",1679252363.0

at 15 i was SA by the guy i was dating at the time and the police were informed 4 months later after he had messaged a mutual friend confessing to it all. 
then i was SA and r@ped in 2020 (i think, dates start blurring) after a small party at my next door neighbours, he was drunk and high and i was sober. my mother was also drunk and in the house. it happened outside. in my back yard. 
then in 2022 i met a guy through a friend and we dated for 3 months. he was a dealer and an avid user of a lot of drugs. 
he drugged me with K and then went on to r@pe me three times and i found out from his cousin who was in the room below us after he had left. i also got pregnant from one of them. 
he offered to help me call the police and offered his support and helped me move out of the room to get air and to go to the bathroom where i found cuts on my legs and arm. the police were never called. 
i had a miscarriage a couple days after the first month. he had no clue. 
i left him that day and never saw him again but i had to message him for some reasons. also never spoke to the cousin again. 
fast forward to the august of the same year, new boyfriend had no issues prior till we both started drinking and smoking. and he r@pse me. i tell my friend and he comes round to stop anything from happening again. 
the boyfriend at the time said it was consensual, but i had no recollection of it for about three weeks… till another positive pregnancy test happened… i told the guy and my friend and we all celebrated to an extent but then in the same week of finding out 3 weeks after the incident i had another miscarriage. and the friend comforted me while my boyfriend was playing a game in his room. 
his phone was in the living room and he got a call from his “friend” and it was the girl he was cheating on me with. 
he didn’t know i had t taken the call and me and the friend planned to go to the club to distract me. we told him and he was down to join he just needed to find his passport for ID. he couldn’t find it and i went anyway.  he broke up with me and i was drunk and high and blurted out i lost the baby and he hung up thinking it was a joke. 

i am 19, have been SA three times, r@ped 6 times and lost two babies. 

my mother is very highly abusive, not 
physically in months, but verbally and mentally. she calls me her maid, and refers to me as Cinderella when she “makes jokes” about what i’ve been doing in the house. 
i have C-PTSD, severe depression and moderate to severe anxiety. i have had suicidal thoughts since i was 13. and i have tried taking pills, multiple times, just to try to end my life but i’ve always woken up and thrown up. i’ve never told people about it because if it failed it wasn’t meant to be. 
but i’m a diabetic. so i have access to insulin. which mixed with some pills will easily kill me. 
my mother has been my main cause to my depression and my attempts. 
i’m at a point where i feel i have nothing to live for. i work really bad hours at a really bad job with a really really bad boss who never seems to care bout mental health or actual health. and i really don’t have anything to live for at the end of the day.

Sometimes it doesn't.,2,11vkbn4,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11vkbn4/35_yr_old_gay_transman_sometimes_it_gets_better/,3,"I'm feeling pressured by both hostile mainstream society and the ridiculous transphobia of the gay community out there to recloset myself and accept I'm just as unwanted as a gay transman as I was when I lived as a straight gnc tomboy. I'm 35 this year, been fighting since age 18 in California to get mastectomies, can't get them because I have to do bariatric surgery first. Fighting to get disability, too.

Yet these stupid fucking breasts and the fatphobia and transphobia have ruined my goddamned life. I'm tired of being the exception for cis gays, I'm tired of cis bi guys trying to guilt me into keeping my breasts, I'm tired of being shat on for being ace spectrum and wanting to be a dad, I'm tired of never EVER being enough.

 How dare I be autistic and have multiple mental and physical health issues, how dare I be a gay transman who is too poor to afford surgery and who had to stop hrt 8 months in because of a near fatal side effect, how dare I be unable to afford to live on my own or go to college.

For a worldwide community that declares how accepting they are, I sure as fuck don't feel safe. Its the same sense of agony I had when I was a teen and didn't feel welcome in church anymore. I will always fight for the worldwide lgbtq+ community,  but for godsakes, DO BETTER. Enough with the racism, ableism, fatphobia, classcism, transphobia, and putting down others who aren't in narrow little cisnormative boxes.

All I ever wanted was to be loved, to be a dad, to be myself. And in the end I am never enough. With all my health issues I'm likely to die before 50, and I'm screaming with few to hear me.

 I wasted almost 20 years of my life fighting to be me, to be Adrian, broken down by chronic pain, my heart shattered by betrayals, the loss of my only child before I even knew he existed in a miscarriage, suffered SA, starvation, and in the end, I'm not wanted anywhere, just like I was when I came out at 16. 

I've gone through with suicide attempts 5 times and none of them worked, all I get is told I'm too old to be helped, and that since I'm not an addict, a veteran, or between the ages of 18-26, there are no long term psychiatric places for me. I'm fighting so hard to hold on every day, I'm trying to hold on. But I don't want to be hurt anymore.

I couldn't even hold my son - I had no symptoms of pregnancy at all, and then he was gone. He would have been 5 this year. I would have been the weirdest goth dad ever, but would have given anything to have him safe.",1679229490.0

I am on an extremely high dose of Prozac and have been for a long time. Things are getting worse. 
I moved interstate to take a job that pays very well and to escape a large amount of family drama that I would normally be dragged into and feel obliged to to take on the responsibility of fixing/looking after others. 
I now no longer have a psychiatrist. My new one put me on lithium which I reacted too in a very scary fashion and another drug that I also reacted badly too. I stopped seeing him because I didn’t agree with his diagnosis/treatments and the exorbitant costs. 
The job I took, which I thought would be exciting and rewarding turned out to be located in a toxic organisation, with a manager who is incompetent and misogynistic. 
It was not the job I was sold and relocated for. 
Everything started to spiral, especially my health. Fatigue, brain fog, inability to speak fluidly, injury flareups, overly emotional - quick to anger/tears. Along with long covid and weekly (min) migraines. I took extended sick leave and then tried to return, but it made me worse. 
I have now resigned, am stuck in a strange city with very few supports (other than my partner who has also recently lost his contract role). 
We have no income, had to give up our pets when we moved, have seen our family once in the last 12 months. 
I don’t see the point anymore. I can’t talk to my partner openly about how I feel because he has history in his family with suicide attempts and it upsets him. 
I can’t tell friends or family - they are too far away to help, even if the could or wanted to. In all likelihood they would just think I’m an idiot for chucking in a 6 figure permanent position.

I am worried I will never get a job, especially because I'm autistic and I struggle so much with anxiety 

2) I was one of the helpers for my university clubs but I had to quit because my anxiety got so bad and the other helpers left me to do a lot by myself. I feel like I've lost a big sense of purpose. The clubs were bad for my anxiety but mostly good for my depression

3) I have a few friends but they're all casual and I feel very left out and alone. I have no friends that I can just make plans to hang out with, I can only tag along in group settings

4) I feel as if no one understands my conditions, especially my anxiety

Like u might still have “friends” or family but at the end of the day you still feel alone. I think that’s y most people commit suicide. I usually don’t discuss my problems with anyone because of 2 reasons : 1. I don’t wanna burden people with my problems and 2. Even if I did, they wouldn’t give a damn anyways. With that being said, it kinda makes society in general more dissolved and passive. My point is, that people r selfish. Like if u have a bad day and express how bad it was no one cares, but if u ask questions people will reply. Every one wants to be heard but not everyone wants to listen. And because no one asks questions or persists about me, I adopt this nilhistic feeling of loneliness which sometimes evolves into suicidal thoughts.

I have destroyed everything and my mind is pretty much made up with the plan of suicide. Its not that I wanted to die. But the things that has happened are insane. I did things while in some crazy mania god-complex episode that lasted several years. Now I can not continue. It is not possible, there isn't even a direction to take. I am not a bad person from heart but have been as delusional und crazy as you can be. I have lived a fake life, believing the lie myself
So now I have one opportunity to kill myself. And because I do not want to end up in the closed mental hospital there is only one option that I see as pretty much safe. I planned on drowning in a lake, not that deep but deep enough to drown and lots of green stuff around so not too obvious. I would do it in the middle of the night. Taking some sedetatives that hopefully will make it at least a little bit easier to go through. I know I will go through minutes of horror but after these have passed I've heard it will get calm. Idk if i will be courageous enough tho, as it is horrific. But I think the chance of it failing once I commited to it is pretty low becaue i'll wear a heavy rucksack which will make me drown. I will do it at night so the chance of someone noticing  is very low.

I wanted a painless death so I took 105 tablets of ibuprofen. I didn’t want to die. I just felt like I needed to do something big to get people to care. I woke up with a horrible stomach ache. I kept bumping into walls. I told my parents how bad my stomach hurt. I didn’t want to go to school. The first thing my mom said to me was, “Are you pregnant?” Not in a joking way. She was mean and judgmental. I don’t know why her mind jumped to that. I was still a virgin and never even had a boyfriend before. 
After barfing I was able to stay home. After 6 hours of stomach pain I texted my friends and told them what I did. One of them called the police. A bunch of (hot) men showed up at my house. There was an ambulance and police cars. They put me on a stretcher and my parents were confused. 
I was sitting in a hospital bed waiting for my parents. It was during Covid so I could only see one at a time. My dad came first. That’s the only time I’ve seen him cry. After a few days in the hospital I was transferred to a mental hospital where I lived for a week. Then I spent two months in partial. 
When I came back home I found out my parents had cleaned and redecorated my room. Thinking back to this is making me cry. Why don’t they care about me like that now? My room is covered in mouse shit. It’s in my clothes and bed. They’ve chewed through my clothes. At one point I was growing mold for months. My room is a mess, just like me. It’s like the embodiment of my depression. Why don’t they care anymore? 
I’ll do something drastic like self harm or OD and they’ll treat me better for a while. But once they deem me better it goes back to how it was. They won’t even let me go back on my anxiety medication. My dad keeps saying I’ll grow out of it and that all teenagers are emotional. My parents don’t really believe in mental illness. 
I stopped trying to reach out for help from them. I don’t tell them or my therapist when I cut because it amounts to nothing. Things will get better for a little bit but my parents can change their mind any time. 
I’m wondering what would happen if I took all the medicine I could find. They locked most of it in safe when I first overdosed, but they don’t do that with any new medicine they’ve bought. I know we have a bunch of cold and flu medicine downstairs along with some advil. 
Again, I don’t want to die. I just want things to change. I’m so tired. My life has just been one shitty thing after another. The last time I felt okay was before I turned 9. I’m so tired. I just want to sleep.",1679240887.0

I'm sure everyone is confused and is having a hard time right now because they don't understand, I wish I could explain why I took my own life. I really do. But I don't think anything I say will satisfy you or bring you any peace of mind, so again I'm 

I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment and failure. I'm sorry you have wasted so much of your time raising and caring for me, I'm sorry that I'm such a coward that I couldn't push through this mental pain any longer. I'm sorry I have terrible communication skills.

I have been feeling like this for many MANY years I think I have hid it well enough for a while but as some have probably noticed the mask has started to peel away. I haven't truly been happy in a long time and most days I just fake it in an attempt to not be too much of a burden.

The world is not designed for someone like me, I feel like I dont belong anywhere. No matter who I talk to, work with or wherever I am or whatever I do. I feel like don't belong, I have always felt like an outsider. Whenever I talk to people it hurts so bad it feels like I'm going to throw up, it's hard to explain and I have pushed through this feeling for as long as I can remember so I seem somewhat ""normal"".

I have tried working out, Antidepressants, ""faking it until you make it"". Every job Ive had has ended poorly, every friendship ive made has been lost (most have ended thanks to one person that i have been forced to keep forgive because ""blood is thicker than water"") I have told others about these suicidal thoughts I have had and nothing has helped me. I am a useless memebr of society that will never make anything of himself. This I feel like is my last option left as nothing or nobody can help me. And even if I were to get better I wouldn't survive in this world long anyway, with everything going on in the world I don't have much hope for humanities survival.

To my siblings, I'm truly sorry for leaving you guys I know it's not right. I want you guys to know that I have always loved you and will always love you no matter what. Do me one favor though, be a better person than I am. Make your thoughts and emotions known, don't bottle your feelings. If something bothers you express yourself don't be a doormat for others to walk all over. (Joe you can have pc if you wish, you know my passwords for stuff. Lexi I don't really own anything you might like but you can have my phone I know you are in need of a new one)

I know I am loved and I know I might be missed, I am grateful to you all for the life that I have been given. It is more than anyone could ever ask for. I hate nobody and forgive anyone who thinks that I dislike them. May you all have a fruitful and happy life after I'm gone, I know this is a selfish thing to do and if you hate me please do so, but never hate yourself.

Please take care of my cat when I'm gone, she has saved my a handful of times from going through with this. Also take care of yourselves and try to forget about me, Im not much of a memorable person anyway so I'm sure it won't take long.

There are a lot more things and people I'd like to address, but I don't have the energy to say anything more. 

Oh and always remember, hate me not yourselves. Peace out.",1679164526.0

I have no happy memories of my childhood besides bad ones, I recently found my iPod nano and the only recording/saved thing on it was a video of my dad screaming at me and chasing me to hit me because I didn’t have swimmers on. I can’t remember any of this but have it all recorded. My family does nothing to stop it. Everyone else sees us as a happy family but we’re not. My dad is a psychopath. He can smile while hitting you and torturing you. I try my best to avoid it. I drive hours to do things for him, drop him off somewhere, drop something off for his work and I get no thanks or anything. All I get is a “find your way home use google maps or something”. I am not anything strong, I can’t defend myself I’m 5,8” ish and weight 60kg and have no muscle what so ever. A month ago was the first time I called the cops on him. After 18 years of abuse I did it. That night I did he had cooked dinner, but I had already eaten and could not eat anymore (I cannot eat a lot otherwise I will vomit it up, I have problems with vomiting due to a alcohol incident, anxiety, stress, depression, if I feel any of these my body defence just goes straight to vomiting so I try to avoid it). I told him I wasn’t hungry and continued doing what I was doing until he came barging in my room grabbed me by the neck and started shoving me out of my room and pushed me down the stairs to where I was falling over but he was keeping me up by my throat. He then forcefully sat me down and grabbed my arm so hard it bruised and was forcing me to give him my phone. (He did not pay for the phone nor for anything I own) so I said no. And he went on a rage grabbing my neck again and pulling so hard I was falling off my chair so I held down on the off buttons and the volume on my phone and swiped the energy call slide and called the cops and they picked up to hearing me screaming “get the fuck off me” over and over again. He then grabbed my phone and hung up and chucked it. The police kept calling to which my mum grabbed it and lied and said everything was fine it was just a verbal dispute. After that I was in my room and I was extremely depressed, I am always extremely depressed and I have been suicidal since the age of 12 when I was getting bullied. In my room I would smash my head against a desk corner and attempt to slit my wrist with a old rqzer but the best I could do was make a mark. The cops then ended up coming over the next morning at 8 am to my little brother opening the door (13m) and he hs experienced it all infront of him that night. I then talked to the cops and had to lie to them for my own safety against my family, as they will all hate me if I didn’t. I have no where to go if I get kicked out I don’t have money I don’t have anything to leave with. Today was the last straw before making this post, this morning I woke up with extreme  food poisoning and vomiting for an hour straight and it was also my cousins birthday lunch and I couldn’t go because I was having uncontrollable vomiting every could of minutes if I didn’t have anything to vomit i would just gag over and over so I texted my mum (my parents and little brother were away so it was just me and my older brother going to the cousins birthday) saying I had food poisoning and couldn’t go my dad then called and said I was lying and to get up off my lazy arse and go to the lunch. I had enough at this point I have vomited for 3 hours by then going from bed to the toilet so I just said “fuck off” and hung up. Fast forward to 10pm that night. He comes home tells me he has called the cops and he’s going to speak tmmrw to then to kick me out of the house. That’s night I slit my wrist properly, blood flowing out constantly and just a stream of it dropping into the floor and it just felt less painful then not doing it. Am I wrong about my family being abusive? I showed my mum my wrists and all she said was “did you get enjoyment out of that” is that what a normal parent would say? I have nothing anymore,, my dad stole my car, my computer my consoles non of which he paid for. I’m so confused on what to do I can’t think straight I don’t want to live anymore.

Now let's get the obvious out of the way, because I've noticed from past post from others that everyone here just goes to the same tired statement of ""I bet you're not even ugly, you just think you are"", or something down the lines of such. Firstly, I'm deformed which is technically worst than being ugly. As I've discussed with this forum over a week ago, I was born with bilateral cleft lip. When I think back to everything I've experienced in my life mostly bad or unfortunate of course, it always goes back to my appearance. Whether it's social anxiety, not having friends, not having and never having had a partner etc etc. You can be as nice as the world will allow and people honestly could care less. You're ugly and they don't care to be around you. It's they have their minds made up the second they lay eyes on you, that you're this and you're that. Having a job is the absolute worse though. Going through with the interview process and orientation which you have to do with multiple normal people/employees. You wave to people and you can tell they don't really want to wave back or they just don't and you haven't even done or said anything to them. I'll forever be unhappy in this world because of the unfair hand I feel I was dealt in this life. Man, I could go on and on about how being UgLy has just destroyed my life, my self esteem, my future. I will never get the chance to have the experiences that just come natural with being alive and existing. Going through life wondering are people looking at me or listening to me when I talk. My nose was affected also, bad skin, but strong as shit for whatever reason. Literally, neck up I'm one of the most hideous things there is. God, kill me now.",1679191033.0

Im 14 and I lived with my dad and my sister my mom was in prison for 3 years after stealing and doing drugs, so it was just the three of us my dad quickly turned into an alcoholic while smoking weed and the only time he wasnt violent was when he was high. He body shamed me and grabbed my ass and thighs. Pulled at my stomach and made gross comments about me and my relationship with my boyfriend. He also body shamed my sister. We lived in Alabama after we got kicked pit of two different place one where I was being verbally and physically abused by my aunt (moms side) she pinned me against walls and also made comments on my body, I was 11-12ish, she threw stuff at me, like a rock, shoes, glasses, a cup for some reason? After my dad ""found out"" we left I put that in quotes because he knew the whole time. We went to my great grandma and my great grandpa, she was verbally abusive to my sister and she slut shamed me at 12 in front of my dad and cousins and great aunt. No on said anything my dad agreed with her around us living here my dads drinking got reallyyyy bad and he pinned me against walls and threw things at me layed on me while I was sleeping and when I would wake up I would have a panic attack and he would get mad at me for it. I would ask him to stop drinking and he would get aggressive once he threw me to the ground and I hit my head on a bed frame and another te he bent my fingers back to the point were I couldn't use that hand for a week.we moved back to my home state after a year and my mom got out. During this whole time I was online for school so I had no escape from him. When we got back to my home state we moved in with his mom, I'm a queer kid and she's a hard core homophobe so you can imagine the things her and her husband said to me. Her husband would grab my ass and make comments about me like my dad did. My dad drinking continued to that house where it got even worse, he pinned me against walls and yelled in my face spit on me, threw things. Two weeks before my attempt my dad tried to kill himself twice I stopped him both times. I lasted three year , taking care of my sister protecting her and myself from everyone I had no one I was alone in that hell. Then I moved there went to in person school and I made friends for the first time I had a break. I met my boyfriend the first person I really care about other than my sister. I got clean for him he's the reason I'm alive rn. My dad kept blaming me for his suicide attempts and I don't know what it was about that but I snapped we got into a fist fight and I tried to over dose I fell asleep and I was so happy and relaxed it was the most relaxed I had ever been other than with my boyfriend, the thought that I would die was so comfortable. I kept waking up and throwing up at around 4 am I knew I wasn't going to die and I woke up my dad to try and fix the mess that I made and I was so hopes I told him in hopes he would feel bad about it and apologize for everything but instead I got yelled at and had things throw at me, I got sent to the metal hospital where all  my friends thought I died I got SAed and then got out and was SAed again by someone else.im currently across the country from my friends and my boyfriend im going back in a week and im probably going to live with my dad and finish school off at my old school.

In August of 2022, I was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer with 9 months to live, and a year or more with prevantative treatment. I began my treatment which was a mix of oral chemotherapy and immunotherapy. The cancer was responding to it to their surprise, however immunotherapy is very powerful these days. I informed some of my close friends. I was meant to do a surgery around Xmas but was unable to due to getting covid. On new years day my partner broke up with me. Granted i was being a bitch, i was projecting my issues onto him. I have a bad relationship w my family and i felt guilty that this could possibly be my last holiday witjout them. We broke up. I went to the hospital as i was puking blood - had to have an emergent abortion and a laparoscopy. Turns out i was 3 months pregnant and the treatment was no longer responding. So they told me it looks like 6 months without treatment and treatment would be prevantative. I tell my friends as i am in panic. I lost my love of my life. I an told im dying. 2 weeks later my grandparents die. I get a huge inheritance. I stress as i have to make a will… as suggested hy my doctors. Obviously everyones emotions were all over the place but i kept my medical life private as i felt like i was already a burden. I ask my friends if they have any student debt they would need help w or what they would want to keep. Im 22. Idk what goes in a will. My dad shunned me because of my abortion. My family is filthy rich so i didnt want to leave them any money. Fast forward to april my cancer is shrinking thanks to radiation therapy and immunotherapy. At this point i only tell ppl who ask. I had a endoscopic resectio. as well. my partner and i move in together in July (we got back together due to terminal cancer). i told him that my cancer is responding to treatment so it isnt terminal but i do not want hopes up. Around august it became 6 months since grandparents died , was my dads birthday, i was having horrible paranoia (i lived in palestine as a child and now experiencing resurfacing of trauma). We j got a beautiful puppy. I am feeling suicidal again (I considered assisted suicide in february but decided not to. some friends knew). I dont tell anyone. I have a doctods appointment and i find out my cancer is NED which means no evidence of disease … So remission. However with stage 4 cancer remission means it is simply not present in scans but most likely will be there forever. Tbh i was disappointed, i dont know why. I was ready to die, i had a beautiful life and bf and dog and home and friends but i was not happy. My family hated my partner as they felt he was not good enough for me (refusdd to meet him the whole 5 years). I wasnt ready to tell anyone about my doctors appointment as i began planning my suicide. I decided i wanted to commit and that id rather my loved ones think it was the cancer and not my own choice. I didnt want them to feel guilty. My bf and bff kept aski g me what happened, i panicked and blurted out that it was spreading again. Ofcourse we are all sad. I regret it. bfs friend visits for a week and we r on opposite schedules so i have no time to talk to him… he works pm i work am. My suicide ideation becomes stronger and stronger with my dads birthday coming work being difficult and guilt eating me alive. He confronts me one day nd accuses me of lying about cancer because hes been counting my meds and sees i havent been taking them. I lie and tell him theyre at work preportioned. I panicked. he begins to question me about my inheritance… which made me uncomfortable. The next day he asks me to send a photo of my meds. Ofcourse i didnt have any as my round of treatment was completed and i was too focused on my suicide plan. I photoshop the worst photo. I deny it for a sec. We txt. im still at work. I call him but its too late hes moved out showed his friends and left. i call him and tell him the truth he calls me a liar. Next day he asks me to call my bank. i refuse. I txt and call my mom thanking her for payi g for treatment she says ur welcome and im glad ur on the mend in front of him. He still tells everyone i lied about having terminal cancer (even tho i gave him updates in the spring treatment is progressing)…. A week later we meet and i explain. He tells me that be doesnt believe a word i say but its a beautiful story. The next day i drunk a lot and swalloed two bottles of advil and tylenol. i forgot i had a meeting w my labdlord (which he now says i planned so she could have saved me, bs). And i had our dog. I call 911 to tell them what i did as i felt faint and dizzy. I cancel w my landlord. I call my ex to ask him to watch the dog. He comes and i was passed out and ultimately paramedics come. Granted i live in montreal… assholes there tell him it seems like im faking it but will take me anyway. He tells everyone i fakdd my suicide to get his attention and i have serious untreated BPD (i blamed my lying and fear of abondonment on that, now discovered it was a CPTD misdiagnossi). Everyone drops me. Friend visits me in hospital i was passed out. I have never been in this hospital they had no emergency contact friend leaves his # in a stickynote. Picks me up the next day. I learn my stomach was pumped but i shouldve been responsive and it seemed like i passed out from a panic attack. Friend says another friend called the er nd they said i do not have cancer…. So friend tells everyone im a liar. Then i go to the mental institute and friend there claims i confessed to my therapist saying i never had cancer i said that everyone thinks i lied and i didnt lie. In mtl we speak french and english. So i get out of the institute and nobodys talking to me. lost all my friends. im puking everyday on my mattress. ex rehomes our dog without waking me up to say bye… 6 months later everyone says im a liar manipulator. they go and fact check shit about mt grandparents and my health with my brother whos been trying to get me and my ex to break up for years. everyone believes him even tho they never met him… bc he is an abusive piece of shit. dad got sense into him and tried to reach out to friends. brother tells him it isnt him… and that im pretending to b him. brother takes my computer and calls everyone im imessaging on no caller id and makes an account on instagram using my email to stalk my friends. everyone says im harassing them while ive just been trying to heal.

After that moment, she stepped out to arrange the foods, then called me to eat since she brought me my fav food.

I started working out to lose weight when I wad 17 (I'm 19 now) after my boyfriend broke up with me and got with a girl whose probably 4'10 and no more than 80lbs. I lost a lot of weight and gained muscle, but I still struggled a lot with my body and size image overall. The past three men I have been with made it abundantly clear they like smaller girls with overall size (shortest was 5'9 and tallest was 6'5) The guy who was 5'9 I dated for about a month and he talked nonstop about how much he loved smaller girls and how cute different girls were bc of it and made me feel like I wasn't enough because I wasn't like that. I get out of that relationship and have a one time thing with the 6'5 guy who also makes it clear he likes small girls, he even tried getting with my friend according to her a while back (he doesn't know we are friends) and she is very petite, about my height but 90lbs. We hooked up once and he never wanted anything to do with me again and that wrecked my self esteem. I know he probably used me but he said he wanted to be with me before and after seeing my body fully it makes me feel like he didn't since he didn't want to be with me after. My current boyfriend is 6'0 and we were friends with benefits before our relationship progressed, he made it clear in the past he likes small girls, girls under 5'5 but also said the ideal weight was 100-115lbs for women and when I showed him pictures of me when I was heavier he told me no guy with standards would've dated me and that I was unattractive and he would've never dated me. He apologized about it and told me he loves me the most now since I'm healthy. I had anorexia and relapsed towards the beginning of our relationship and got to 120lbs but I recovered and gained the weight back. He tells me I'm perfect and he loves me now more than anything, that he doesn't want me losing weight because he wants me to be healthy. He told me he was being mean and didn't have any concept of women's weight and as for the body shaming of how I used to look he said he was just trying to hurt me then and he said he would love me no matter what now. I try to accept that but it's hard when I know his true feelings about women's size because even if he loves me he still has a preference and it isn't me. I'm in love with him and I can't loose him but it's eating away at me. And every single guy is like this now, it feels like I only find men who want these girls who are not me. I want to die more than anything because I can never look like those girls. I just want to shrink, I really hate myself I feel like a monster or something. I can't even look at more petite girls without this envious dreadful feeling because of how every guy I ever fall for now ends up liking that and settling for me even though I'm far from it. I hate myself. The nightmare I had, my boyfriend kept talking about other women and how he liked their small features and not only admitted to liking smaller women but younger looking ones too, which is another fear I have related to this, and I woke up crying non stop. I'm now up super early and I'm debating what to do because I'm unsure I can take this life anymore because I will never ever be small and petite and it makes me want to die.",1679219323.0

I had some really huge plans for the rest of my life and I’ve always had big dreams and ambitions I thought I’d stick around to try and see out, but I don’t know if I can do it.

Dying would mean I don’t get to make music anymore, or experience love anymore, and I’ll fuck up the lives of my family and friends and I can’t bear thinking about them being in pain like that.

it’s too early to say for certain yet but it’s very likely that I might have Post Finasteride Syndrome, I’m not sure I want to carry on living if I can’t ever have sex again in my life, that might sound shallow though. But it’s my other side effects that are killing me even more right now, I can’t sleep for a second even after being prescribed strong sleeping medications, and I just feel completely hopeless. No professional, none of my friends or family, or anyone knows what the hell to do to help. 

I’m trying to stick around for my loved ones and my cat, because I love my cat and I don’t want to pass away and her have to live unhappily with anyone else. But I’m struggling. It’s weird, I’ve spent my whole life petrified of dying and now I feel pretty calm about the idea of it. I think that’s actually a side effect of pfs, as I can’t imagine I’d normally want to take my life.

But yeah I’m not gonna do it rn, I’m gonna wait to see if I’ve got a decent chance of fully recovering first.",1679217816.0

I just need to put this out into the ether I guess. I really am having troubles going on. Its too long of a story to go over for what feels like the ten thousandth time this week, but to sum it up, I'm the father of a 14 year old kid who's own depression, anxiety, and mental disorders (borderline personality disorder) has caused a complete colapse of my relationship with my partner. I've stuck with my partner through thick and thin over the last year, but my child's sociopathic behaviors have proven too much, and she has her five year old to think about. Yes my child has been diagnosed, but getting the kid to accept help is incredibly difficult.  


So now I'm here, alone with my kid, trying to get her help, and she's just gone. And no one's called me to see how i'm doing. I cant afford anything so I need to get a second job. I'll have to work 14-16 hour days just to make ends meet. I'm alone. I feel abandoned by everyone. Meanwhile she's got an extensive family, some significant wealth saved up, so she can afford to go. I've got no money. No time. No support. I'm supposed to care for myself and this sociopathic teenager of mine, and I don't know how? I'm just so overwhelmed.  


I keep looking through all these suicide help lines and I keep thinking about how I can't handle calling them. I don't want their bullshit platitudes. ""Oh, its so tough what you're going through. You're so strong for calling and seeking support."" I don't want any of that. I just want it to be over. And what happens after I get off the phone. No like they can do anything. It just goes back to being the same as soon as I hang up. Like I said, I don't know why i'm posting here. I don't expect anything. I just need to get this out of my head. Everything has collapsed, and no one's reached out to see that I'm doing okay, because i'm not. I'd go to the hospital and check myself in, but then I get the anxiety that I'll lose my job, and then I'll lose my house and how do I take care of my kid then?  I can't afford to stay at the hospital. There's no answers, theres no solutions.

Sure I am. I am harder on myself than others are, my dad is pretty bad though. Sadly have to live with the one person in my life who doesn't care much for me, and can turn off feelings for me on the fly. I work and have college, which I'm nearly done, gonna start masters soon hopefully, but I also am just tired.

I told my dad the other day I think about wanting to die, that it'd be easier, that I'm tired of life alone and how I am pretty sure nobody will ever want me. He acted nice in that moment. Today we fought about some shit bc he is a bigot and I was defending ppl because I know what discrimination feels like. He told me to jump off a bridge. lol imagine. imagine telling someone who felt suicidal, to jump off a bridge. nice one dad.

a 54 year old person behaving like a kid on social media: making fun of people, and making fun of them when they show they don't like being made of. Gaslighting. Narcissism, its just a joke guys, just words, cant take a joke? somehow this is acceptable behavior, i think its pathetic.

Basically, I should have moved out long ago, and that is obviously a key in my journey of healing. However that is hard to do.

anyway I came home after leaving today and i said to please not talk to me, he acts like an asshole and says I ""get too hung up on words"". I really dislike having to act like hateful things don't hurt me. I hate not getting to be myself because he will treat me like I'm soft. Basically, it's hard to deal with a delusional schizophrenic narcissist gaslighting bigot white semi supremacist. Then i even am like ""well, he isn't mentally well, it's not all his fault he is like this"" He actually used to be somewhat okay to be around. But, the more i stopped being like him, the more he began to hate me, and his mental illnesses aren't helping.

Oh, and he acts nice when he wants something, expects me to help him all the time, tells me all his worries. and is genuinely confused why I don't want to help him. lol, he literally is flabbergasted that my suicidal feelings could have anything to do with him. He just acts like all righteous and pure. and twists everything i feel bad about in a way where I'm still the bad guy.

I don't wanna die, but i was really frustrated and feeling stuck and was like man if i had a gun id just do it. i kept looking at these scissors and imagine cutting my throat, before it sounded like a bad idea, but in that moment i was so mad and sad and shocked that i just had to get away. i really hate having to come back to this hell hole though, and nowhere else to go, so on the drive home I'm just numb and/or sobbing wishing i could drive into a river and suffocate.

I really don't want to die. I want this sad life to be over and a great one to begin. at 30, i feel like im I missing all the great moments i could have with friends or a lover, but i don't imagine anyone loving me, whos gonna want to stay long term with a trans person who cant even have kids? my evolutionary psych class is basically proving to me more and more that I'm not fit as a mate, and every time i go in that class i wana kill myself more and more.

I've been sober from alcohol 15 months, which i was suffering from horribly, i have a job, school, so much to be grateful for, but I'm simply not hopeful for the future, and every day i feel this depression getting worse. I don't think its all my dad, i think its also my inadequacy feelings being trans, and i feel extra pressure to not off myself bc oh those transphobes will be right when they said ill kill myself. i imagine a future where I'll be working at a career, and I'm alone. ill make bank but ill be alone, and that sounds so off-putting to me.

Imagine joking about someone committing suicide, saying they'll go to hell and be unloved, and then wondering why they'd want to die.

honestly, humanity makes me sick. it makes me tired that as a human we have a need to be around others. I hate feeling need for love and being cared about. If i could turn it off and be a robot id be much better off.

I've done all the self harm i think i can do to myself by drinking. I don't want physical pain or suffering. I just want to sleep forever. I like to imagine that death is like dreamless sleep, and it sounds so peaceful. If i never woke up, id never know i died. I imagine that if i was put into sleep, and a thousand years passed, id never know until i woke so i have a frame of reference to see that i was in fact sleeping. i want death to be like that, just like before i was born, something unimaginable, nothingness. True freedom from thinking. true peace. id never want another life after this one. I think one is enough. I'm already tired of this one. I just want to be excited and hopeful again. a part of me is holding myself back , when i smile i say that I'm not allowed to. I tell myself negative things all the time. I'm my own worst enemy, and in the end, I'm just a sad human who wants love and a happy life. I'm a victim that is tired of suffering from negative thoughts. i hate myself, and i cant trust anyone to save me. I have to save myself, but i have to want it hard enough to push thru the feelings of wanting everything to end.

I was writing a post today on a sober community board. I was being all sad and talking about my dad. And i kept being like ""i should delete this, i feel bad making ppl read it"" etc. I deleted it instead of posting. I felt so bad because a part of me wanted to not feel alone in my suffering.

some part of me wanted to say it, so bad. to show the world i exist and I'm here and i want to be noticed. some part of me is trying to reach out, despite how much in those moments i want it all over. even now, i wonder if i should post this, because i wrote so much, because idk if someone will realize I'm that one person they know.

as if me saying I'm suffering and i want it to end is such a fucking bad thing!

even if nobody reads this shit, at least i will have fueled a part of me that got my voice out, and it can at least serve as a showcase to myself that there is more wrong with the world, than there is wrong with me. I want to be so happy so that I can show the world that would say i should die that I'm gonna prove them wrong.

Or at least show myself i can be happy and that the negative side of myself that thinks dying is worth it is wrong. I can't let that part of me win.  even now i have this feeling that being hopeful or positive is something i cant have, like someone is laughing me off and pushing me back into the mud ""no you don't get to be positive, you don't get to feel hope"" and i scoff at myself for letting myself feel a glimmer of hope or excitement about continuing on.

My brain is so deluded by negativity that the notion of feeling happy is so scary that part of me wants to fester in depression because it is easier than fighting and trying to pursue happiness. its easier to scoff at being positive and just say ""no, i wont get to be happy"", and cry some more. Only thing is, this sad feeling isn't sustainable. It will only serve to get me fired, quit school and end up buying a gun. And obviously some part of me wants to live (besides the obvious instinct of survival my body is designed with).

anyway I'm tired of typing now. if you got this far, hopefully some of this got you feeling even a tiny bit of hope or whatever. toward the end i felt a little hopeful, I also felt stupid for being hopeful, but that's just my negative side trying to take over. fuck that side.",1679216699.0

Everyday I wake up I know that night I have to deal with all this again. And I feel guilty about it. Because its basically nothing wrong with me. Yet I cannot function. I feel useless. Each day is a new low. As the days go by it just eats away at how long I can keep this up. Although obviously I want to become better, deep down a part of me doesn’t. Which makes me feel guilty. Is that normal? I don’t know. My life isn’t exactly normal. It feels like I complain about things that everyone else just deals with. Which makes me feel guilty. The thought that one day it might get better has gone now. It feels like a downwards spiral from this point forward. It feels like the day I was born was the top and my life has just been going downhill since. Nothing good ever happens to me. It’s just repetitively bad. Going from bad to worse. Now it’s at the point where because I woke up it’s a bad day. I feel so drained by life that surviving is making me annoyed. Nothing Anyone says or does can change how I feel. I’m stuck like this. 20/1/23

I though a lot about if I should write you this letter, but being that you're the only person I have ever truly loved, I couldn't leave without writing this. I don't know if you still love me, I don't know if you still care, but I'm sorry. I'm sorry for taking this way out. I loved you so much, and I still do, my love for you is unconditional and I want you to know that.

Thank you for sharing 3 years of your life with me. Thank you for being there when I needed you. You added 3 more years to my life. Waking up next you every morning was truly a blessing. Thank you

In a world where I have always felt so misunderstood, even by my own mother, you understood me, you embraced me, you saw me. I appreciate you more than you will ever know, and I cherish every moment we spent together, all the laughter and the silly simple moments we shared. Without you coming into my life I would have never known what being loved felt like. Thank you for giving me the chance to experience love while I was here.

If what I'm about to do hurts you I am truly sorry, but I will be happier this way and I hope you can someday understand why I did this and not be mad at me.

I wish you peace. You are so intelligent and have such a beautiful heart, I just want you to feel peace. Love, live and laugh as much as you can. Again, thank you, thank you, thank youuuuuu.

if there's such a thing as the other side then I'll see you there someday",1679199733.0

I was never a depressed kid, I had friends  and honestly enjoyed my life. It wasn’t until about midway through the start of the pandemic that I started to have suicidal thoughts. Never self harmed or anything like that, but I would think about drinking bleach or opening my window and jumping out. This feeling greatly subsided once the pandemic cooled down and went back to school normally. I’m in university now (same city so no change at home) and it’s okay. 

Anyways sometimes I found myself think of bad memories/experiences of the past. I find myself sometimes mumbling “I want to kill myself” before I actually catch it. I think honestly it is a coping method. But the thing that has legitimately scared me is sometimes I’m just sitting studying and I have this raging impulsive thoughts telling me go swallow a bottle of pills or run in front of a train. I don’t really want to die, but these thoughts feel so power it is scary. I’m scared I might actually do it one day.

I lost close friends because I asked for a break from socialising to recover my mental health 

I have accomplished good things in life but it never feels enough. No matter where I am in the world, what I have,  who I have... I'm still depressed... 

No matter how much therapy, anti depressants, anti anxiety .... I am a wreck

No matter where I am and how much I work hard for things and how many great things I have,  it's not worth it.

I’m a 21M from the US struggling a lot with passive suicidal ideation which I fear might grow worse if I do not speak about it. Which is the reason for me writing this. I feel as if I have no one to speak with about the issues I face, as I have to keep the majority of them a secret from those close to me for various reasons. 

Which has left me to wrestling with concerns as coming off as manipulative or a burden if I were to speak with the one person I trust about the issues I face (they are coincidentally the reason for the majority of the mental fatigue and thoughts I have.) 

I’m trying to distract myself currently but my mind continues to wander back to the problems bothering me. If anyone would like to talk or wants to reach out, please feel free. I could use someone to speak with. Something I believe to be worth sharing is I only speak the ‘elegantly’ when I’m depressed, handling ideations or some other negative emotions, I think it’s my brains way of trying to communicate my own thoughts..

The one and only thing that she thinks will give her purpose is a child. And I don’t think we are in the place emotionally in a relationship nor financially stable to provide proper care and resources for one.

I can’t keep talking about this, I feel like there’s nothing left to say. I’m a 30 year old female who has felt suicidal since age approx 10(maybe younger)pretty chronically. I’ve been waiting around, hoping things would get better—but alas, they never do. I guess I might document this here just so I am not completely alone & maybe someone would see my logic. Not that I need it. Maybe this will be my final place for goodbyes? I’m not sure yet. 

The only things that are in my way are my funeral arrangements so nobody has the final burden of me, once again. I am trying to see if my body could be donated to science.. I will have to figure out how exactly I can do this without leaving it for someone else to do. 
I have picked a playlist for when I follow through. I also have ideas about how exactly to do it with no chance of being discovered too soon or it being unsuccessful. I have plenty of notes I have penned throughout the years for other attempts. 
The peace I get thinking about how it could truly be over in a set amount of time gives me an overwhelming euphoria. 
I’ve seen the drs been in the hospitals, therapist after therapist, medication after medication. There is nothing else for me. 
I don’t have any money. I spend almost every day alone and if it’s not alone, I’m alone inside. 
I don’t even cry about this when I think of it anymore. I am so absolutely numb to the thought and action of my death. I feel nothing. I wish I had the means to follow through today, it’s unfortunate. Soon enough though, soon enough. I can’t wait until it’s done.

Fast forward to today I'd say my depression is at the same intensity if not more so since that night. Life has really beaten me down in these past 4 months. I won't go into detail cuz nobody really cares about that. I can't afford to go to the hospital again. But my suicide ideation has a grip on me. 

Five minutes ago I popped a sleeping pill because I have work in the morning and need sleep. Since then I've been fighting myself, trying not to take the whole bottle and end my life. I'm not alive for me, I'm alive for my parents, who will be devastated if they lost their only child. I think about how they'd react and it breaks me.

I live in the country that invaded Ukraine on 24 of February 2022, and I want to opt out of life. These are the main reasons:

1. There is no way not to sponsor the war and repressions, since I have to make money in order to have something to eat. I contribute to the federal budget with my income tax (13%), I also pay VAT (20%) every time I buy something. 32% of the federal budget goes to the army (17%) and the police (15%).
2. I don’t want to put an effort into my life that will be eventually taken by the state. Sooner or later, I will be mobilized. The options will be: a) go to the war, b) go to prison, c) go to the war in transit through prison.
3. Guilt. The war is my fault as well, and I could’ve done more to stop it. I’ve been trying to redeem myself with charity, but it doesn’t help much. Not sure if that feeling will ever go away.
4. Anti-LGBTQ+ laws and propaganda. Well, I’ve accepted the fact I’m such a second-class person, but it still hurts.
5. It feels like I’m an alien here. I don’t get the concept of “patriotism” and “duty” to the state I didn’t choose. Neither do I understand the mentality and the obsession with WW2. Let the bloodthirsty people live with each other in this godforsaken country, but without me.

Unfortunately, I don’t think it will get better. At least I won’t live long enough to see that happen. So, I decided to spend some time with my parents and friends and then take my life. Thank you for reading. Really needed to speak out.

P.S. Please don’t think that I’m trying to belittle the challenges Ukrainians have to bear. I do understand I’m quite privileged that the war zone is not in my country.",1679136393.0
943,I want to give up I can't take this anymore but I'm 13 and I feel like it would cause to much trauma to everyone else,7,11uuca2,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11uuca2/i_want_to_give_up_i_cant_take_this_anymore_but_im/,6,"

I've made a post like this before and I'm back because it's worse, I'm going to keep this shorter then my other post because I just don't want to remember it but your free to go read it. In a short my mother is a very gaslighting, my way or the highway kind of person. She'll make you feel like shit just to get her way, she'll make you terrified of her just to get her way. She's always throwing harsh insults at me. She used to hit me until I was bruised but she stopped but I don't want to grow up looking down at my arms remembering where bruises and self harm marks were. I'm so tired it's not something I can take anymore it's not. I pray that God takes me away everyday. I'm homeschooled and I have no friends and I'm not allowed to leave the house. I'm not allowed to talk to any family apart from who's in the house. Which is only my mother father and sister. They've always been so much nicer to my sister. There's always been moments where she has not respect for anyone or anything yet my parents just let her be. She'll say stuff like I don't love you to my mother. She'll drop drinks and glasses and through all of this she won't get yelled at. My father is always busy if it comes to me. He's like a stranger in my house at this point. I feel like he doesn't even know me. My sister being as spoilt as she is purposely gets me in trouble sometimes. If I were to even drop a little bit of water my mother would tell me how annoying and worthless I am. She does it in such a toxic way She'll say it in an indirect way so that if I ever bring it up she'll say l never said that. Like when I was younger she hit me so hard and said she couldn't care about me unless I was passed out on the ground. I brought it up and told her she didn't care about me unless I was dying and that she said that herself but she just said she never said that but she did. I always hear people saying they have a mother or father like mine and that they understand but they don't. They're no being homeschooled by that toxic women. Their not taking tests under her watch. Your not staying in the house 24/7 with her. It's not like you don't see your cousins. I'm so tired of people telling me they understand but they don't and they always say that I am just being ungrateful or dramatic. I've done school from 7am -3am because my mother broke a glass and was in a bad mood. I was only 7. I ended up with so many harsh words and bruises that night.  I'm so tired I know people are going to say it'll get better.  I can't wait for it to get better its been like this since I was 7 I wanted to end it all at 8 I've done self harm at 10 and attempted at 10. I'm 13 and I still suffering I can't call cps cus I don't want them to get in trouble, but I can't keep living like this. I don't know what to do it's so tiring I just want to quit idc if it'll get better I'm not waiting until 18 or 19 to move. I don't want to grow up with all of this trauma I just want out. I don't want to talk to them about it they won't understand. They don't care either. My mother has done alot for me such has convince my dad to get me and my sister phones and playstations. But money and expensive things can't make me forget and it can't make me forgive. It can't make me happier. It not like we have a big house or alot of expensive things. I can't keep doing this but I don't know what to do.",1679160387.0

For the longest time i felt like i have been trying to surviving 
Priority was to aim for a better life, a stable job. Not trying to live day by day thinking of finances 
I was working 12-14hours a day during my school holidays to earn enough money to put me through school and pay for my food day by day
I could not afford to fall ill because that would mean not enough money for rent and food 
Barely have enough time to do my school work
And could not afford a social life 
Because that meant more spending which i didnt have 
I had no time to reflect
No time to connect finish the damn school and get the paper
After failing my final year 
I had to repeat
Which destroyed me financially 
But i pulled through

I got a loving bf 
Got the stable job not what i have studied for but good enough

And now everything starts crumbling down 
The constant pressure of financial is gone 
Which is good
But now what? 
I feel empty, i have time, i can reflect
The pressure was all i had to keep me going to a goal
And now that that is gone
I feel weird 
I got free time that i never experienced 
And i dont know what to do
I dont feel like i have a meaning anymore 

I feel the financial struggle and physical struggle with my job had strained me for so long 

At this point 
Because i cant properly work anymore 
I feel i lost a meaning in life

Lot of people tell me “work to live”
And not “live to work”

But what if all i knew is to live to work? And now that is gone
I feel i failed?
No career didnt make anything about myself 
I have achieved nothing 
I am a wreck 
I already attempted twice
Had a third initial plan but got too scared

I promised to wait till my therapy session 
But 
Im not sure if i can live to that day
It takes too damn long
And honestly 
It feels weird 
I am actually putting all hopes on it 
And if it ends up in failure

I do feel all my hopes will come crumbling down 
I have tried everything then at that point
Maybe i just can’t be saved
Maybe it’s just meant to be a short one 
I dont know anymore

It's good sometimes because I end up being less arrogant/pessimistic, but I end up just being used by people who know I'll try my gosh diddly darn hardest to listen to them and most likely be helpful and comforting for them. while I don't expect anything in return, I don't understand why people then choose to harm me.

I'm glad I am the way I am but it sucks. my last attempts at a romantic relationship have ended in me being ridiculed, shamed, abused (emotionally and once physically) and had my panic attacks weaponised against me (being a group of people intentionally putting me in a situation with full intent to cause a panic attack and (they said they wanted me to) have a relapse)

the only time I feel any sort of release is just lying in bed. as someone with autism it helps me let for for a bit. in the time ive been trying to live with my sh, depressions and anxiety, I only feel disconnected from it whilst lying in bed or making music. I feel myself craving more though, that being suicide. at this point im almost looking for an excuse to kill myself. I come from a good place, my parents are supportive (when sober lmfao), I have nice friends and I'm very capable.  the real reason is that I can't bare life anymore, not even from lack of trying at this point. I'm in a vicious cycle of self harm and torture thats been going on so long that's it's hard to pick an exact point where it started. 

what im trying to say is I have nobody to blame but myself. and that is okay! I love you all and I wish you the best of luck, the realistic part of me says I won't make it out alive but the optimistic side is still hopeful <3",1679189561.0

I am poor, stupid and unattractive and I will never contribute anything to society, I was born into poverty so the chances of me making it out of poverty are slim to non for me. I don't have any groundbreaking talent and I am not smart. My teeth are fucked and I have to pay at least $5000 for dental crowns to fix them, the way that this world treats the less fortunate is disgusting and I resent my mom everyday for not making sure she had everything together before having me and my siblings, if I don't commit suicide this week then I will do so eventually because I'm sick of struggling.",1679176009.0
979,Way 2 Go - vent,1,11v7784,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11v7784/way_2_go_vent/,0,"All the adults in my life growing up have pretty much failed me. Yeah, the kids were assholes too, but they were brought up like that. Not that forgive any those fuckwads. Fuck that entire town, I was extremely unhappy there and didn’t meet a single person I would want to meet again. I’m sure they are proud of that fact.

Literally just a bunch of middle age fucking freaks treating my life like a reality tv show. I tried ignoring it at times - it got worse. I tried buying in at times it got worse.

Now as a full fledged adult I’ve never had any friends, any relationships, can’t talk  to others properly - and a bunch of assholes are walking around living their life like they aren’t the reason I don’t leave my apartment.

I am speaking directly to you now - I know you’ll never acknowledge it - but you fucked up my life. I have 0 respect for you as people. I hate your children and I don’t want them in my life. 

You’re not funny, you’re not cute, you did real damage, and I personally - judging wholly on our interactions and their consequences- think you are a piece of shit.

You want my respect and gratitude but you also want to force me into awkward ass interactions with your kids - who were constantly lying to me. Then you repeat that for more than a decade, with new groups of people, until at some point I just give up on everything right?

And you this all behind the scenes so I am left wondering things like,how do they know where I am? Who are these people? Did they plan on me joining this university? This job? Did they plan everything? Does any thing I do matter - is all of this fabricated? Or am I just insane?  Will everybody I ever meet be like this? Can I focus on other aspects of life now and come back to meeting people later? Are they tying to make my kill myself? Do they fetishize my anxiety? Am I trapped? Is it even possible to earn the right to know the truth? What do they even want?

Why would you rather have me give up on life than not being in complete control of the people in it.

I got banned in another account for saying what I think you should do. I’m not going to say it here, but I believe it 100%. You ruined my life and I don’t want to live anymore - so it would be a kind of a poetic justice.",1679188968.0

983,I've been miserable for 15+ years and I don't have a way out,2,11v1eyh,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11v1eyh/ive_been_miserable_for_15_years_and_i_dont_have_a/,0,"I (26f) have been struggling with depression on and off for the past 15+ years. I've never hit a place where I feel good or stable. I feel ""okay"" for maybe a couple of months during the year but then I always cycle back to a new low.

I have some mental issues that make it very difficult for me to regulate emotions or maintain strong interpersonal relationships with people.

Overall, this has rendered me very lonely. When I think about any long-term goals, or reasons for being alive, the only thing I can think of that might be half fulfilling is having a family. The mental struggles I deal with I fear will interfere with my ability to have a healthy relationship with anyone, and I especially don't want any children I might have to be affected negatively by me.

Nothing else feels like it has any meaning at all. I don't really care to work as I don't find fulfillment in it. I try to make new friends despite how difficult it's been, and I can't seem to keep any around. I don't have any true interest in anything, and I hate it when people tell me to find ""hobbies I enjoy"" because there ARE none I enjoy (and I don't resist trying new ones). I feel like I'm becoming more apathetic towards everything as the years drag on.

I've tried various therapists and antidepressants. I've tried reading different philosophies and watching different people talk about their struggles. I have a stable job (for now) and even tried to work with a nutritionist to at least stabilize my physical health, but it didn't really help when I started to wonder why these little things even mattered when I'll never be able to pursue the life I want because my mental health is so wrecked.

I guess I'm just wondering what the point is of working and doing anything really when I feel like at the end of my life, I will be alone, mentally sick, and incapable of getting better. I really want to get better. I want to feel better and I want to be excited about something and it's so frustrating and discouraging to feel like trash every single day. At this point, I don't really know what I should be sticking around for.",1679174894.0
