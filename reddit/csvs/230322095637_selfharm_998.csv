0,Trolls and general internet safety,330,upnx11,selfharm,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/comments/upnx11/trolls_and_general_internet_safety/,32,"Hi all,

&#x200B;

We have been getting an increase of reports about trolls, creeps and overall horrible people dming users, and we just want to jump on this ahead of time

**Tl;Dr** \- stranger danger, don't believe everything you read on the internet, don't feed the trolls, we love you - Mod Team

&#x200B;

**Not long enough,** ***will*** **read (Nle;Wr):**

First and foremost **do not feed the trolls**. Trolls want a reaction out of you, they want some sort of feedback that what they've said/done has upset you, and responding in any way, *even to mock their attempts*, feeds them, and that's not what we want. 

1. Ignore the troll
2. Report their account (you can send a report on [reddit.com/report](https://reddit.com/report))
3. Block them so they can't continue to message you
4. (Optional) If you want, you can message the modmail with their username so that we can keep an eye out for them, but our advice will usually be to report to the admins and let them deal with it

The same applies for creeps who ask for pictures or in some way sexualise harming. **Do not engage with them**. Report and block them, don't interact with them in any way shape or form. They want to upset you and if they know they've got to you it'll motivate them to continue and maybe encourage them to look for another target

&#x200B;

In terms of internet safety, you shouldn't really be talking to strangers, you don't know who they are and anyone could lie about their age/gender/sexuality/location/species/opinions on [pinapple on pizza](https://imgur.com/gallery/tinP4)/etc.

You should always steer on the side of caution; don't reveal information about you that shows you're a potential target and take anything said to you with a pinch of salt. This doesn't mean that everyone you speak to is trying to hurt you, but it's better safe than sorry when it comes to your wellbeing and safety

&#x200B;

This goes without saying, but I'll say it anyway: you are worth so much more than those trolls. You're amazing people and we want to make sure you're safe. Your safety is the reason why this community was made in the first place and the best way we can ensure that is if we all look out for each other, and look out for ourselves too

/r/selfharm is a safe space and we will do everything in our power to keep it that way, but we need your help keeping it the emo-paradise that we have come to know and love so much. Report, block, and keep being awesome!

Love, 

The mods",1652554825.0

I try all my healthy coping mechanisms. Or try to do them. I'm worse than I've ever been. And you'd think I'd be okay because I have this plan to be living somewhere better. I have a roof over my head and a room. But then I think about how unclean the house is no matter how I try to clean it.

22,Short Term Strategies To Avoid SH,2,11xygyy,selfharm,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/comments/11xygyy/short_term_strategies_to_avoid_sh/,1,"2. Short term strategies

What to do when the urge to self harm strikes?

There isn’t time to start building the situation where the urge does not strike or you have the ability to override it. We need an immediate solution.

A.	I feel that the most effective thing for most people is use of cold water, ideally an ice bath, but otherwise a cold shower or even just cold water in the face.

There are some other activities which may follow this or substitute for it.

B.	Power poses. It has been established that adopting a power pose, even for a short period of time will alter the body’s chemical balance for the better. In ten minutes the dopamine and serotonin levels will rise while the stress hormone cortisone will fall. This is a short term change, but the levels will probably start to change for the better with repeated practice. If you don’t know what power posing is see [here](https://blog.ted.com/10-examples-of-how-power-posing-can-work-to-boost-your-confidence/) or [this four minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4ACeoqEjeA)

C.	Walking. Of all the exercises, this is the most basic and the one to which we are best adapted. It has a whole range of benefits including increased fitness, improved mood and space to think. The further you walk the better.

D.	Achieve something small. Jordan Peterson suggested that the place to start with problems is to tidy your room. Get one small thing achieved and you will start to feel better about everything else. If tidying your room is too daunting, limit to making your bed. This can be done as a thirty day challenge. Do it first thing every day for 30 days as soon as you get up and then you have one achievement.

E.	Contact a friend. It may be a good idea for contributors to this subreddit to pair up and be available. Due to time zone differences it may be best to pair with someone/other people in your own area. In my final post in this series, (an appendix linking to helpful resources) I intend to set up a geographical link system so people can contact each other when they need support.

F.	Gratitude. The practice of gratitude is an easy one, but surprisingly, some people can’t do it at first. When training long term unemployed young adults (who were compelled to attend), I used to prime the classes to overcome the negativity by doing a round of gratitudes in which everyone would say one thing they were happy about. Some people couldn’t start so I would list a whole series of good things in their lives (you have free Internet in the library here, you are in good health, you aren’t starving because you have been unemployed for two years, you live in this country, this course is nowhere near as bad as you expected, etc.) After a while everyone got the hang of it and I was surprised at how healthy most of the answers were (I’m grateful for family/friends etc. or small (I’m grateful that my pot plant is growing well.) Often pets were cited, so I would suggest getting a pet is another strategy of Shers. People with the “small” gratitudes sometimes used to be embarrassed at first, but then they started to realise it was a good thing to be grateful for small things and to be able to concentrate on them. The effect of such priming on the whole day was quite amazing. Maybe make a list of things you are grateful for and read it when the urge to self-harm arrives.

G.	Meditation. This is a little more difficult, but in a nutshell, here is how it works. The mind produces a constant stream of chatter. Eliminating this chatter allows the mind to clear and a sense of calm to return. To do this, you stop words crossing your mind, or, alternatively, rise above them so that you see them as something which you are merely observing. The ability to do this is like a muscle, very weak at first working for only a second or two, but with a little practice you can achieve much longer periods of calm. The most basic starting point for most people is to simply listen to your breath and feel it leaving and entering your body.
There are some other things you might be able to do, depending on your circumstances; a hot bath or sauna, a physical workout, punching a pillow until you a tired or simply going outside and looking at the sky.

It is important to know what you are going to do when the urge strikes and not to be caught in indecision. To that end, I suggest writing a list (do it now) of things that you will do when the urge to self-harm comes upon you. A small box containing items to help you along with the list may be of value.

Please feel free to use the comments section to add ideas and say what has worked for you.",1679440471.0

I counted because its a punishment for being the way I am. The more of them I can take, the more I've gotten what I deserve. I'm a disgrace. I have nothing to offer the world anymore, and all my days are spent having people tell me I'm not good enough in college or in my work. I had my hobbies but they're no fun anymore. I lost all my friends because I'm so insufferable and I dont know why. I'm sick of living with he disorders, being ignored by the healthcare system when I ask for help, and the threat of what would happen if I did get the help. If they put me in a mental ward, I would lose access to my HRT and my testosterone would come back. If that happened then My life is over anyway.

There isn't much room left on my left arm and I really try to avoid cutting my right because its made my left arm weaker and harder to move. I don't want that to happen to my right arm but I think it's going to end up going that way because there isn't any room left. My left arm is so fragile now, if i move it, some of the cuts come open and start bleeding again, but they're slowly closing up so I don't need to go to the hospital. I cut parallel and never overlap in hopes it makes the scarring less present because I need the blood and the pain but the scars just make everything worse.

I quit twice already. I quit in 2019 but relapsed in 2020. I quit in 2020 but relapsed in 2022. I quit in 2022 and relapsed 3 days ago. I'm to keep getting drunk and high as much as possible so that maybe I can forget for a short amount of time.

I was filled with so much internal hatred, that it just felt like the most logical step forward. “You hate yourself so much, so why not turn that fury into something physical” so I did. It started off slow, then just gradually built up. I was doing it whenever my emotions became too unbearable. However, I’m doing it just to cut now.

I’ve not just gone through all that pain, just for my fucking efforts to disappear. I want to see the entirety of my thighs covered in cuts. A reminder of what I’ve done. I want to see red everywhere. 

Is this the start of an addiction? Probably. It starts off by being used as a coping tool, then it transforms into something out of your control. It takes on a mind if it’s own and dictates to you what will happen. At this moment in time, the want to cut doesn’t come from a desire to inflict pain on myself, but to see how far I can take this new activity.

Blood didn't really have an effect on me when i was younger and I had no problem with choosing syringes over pills or syrup medicine. 

When I stopped doing selfharm, the hematophobia started to develop, nowadays I faint when I see my blood being taken out for blood tests, I get nervous and sweaty by having a syringe or sharp object around, I even gag when watching violent escenes on TV or cry when watching s/h escenes because of the shock of blood coming out.

I don't know if this is like a common symptom, but there is this colombian influencer called Juanda that was admitted in a psychiatric hospital after a suic1de attempt by s/h, when he reappeared in social media he narrated his experience and there was a part that really hit me because of the phobia he developed. He said that after coming out of the hospital, when he went to get a haircut his body kinda collapsed because of the shock of having a razor around him.

I want to know if anybody else has had this experience.

well i knew i wasn’t fully better cause the urges never stopped but i just assumed they’d always be there and i’d just have to always deal with them as a result of choosing fast recovery over actual recovery, like how every time i’m near a ledge or a lot of medicine or anything like that i still get the urge to attempt. also i have rlly bad mood swings (am going to therapy for them soon but still got a week or two) that cause me to have mood blips that make me extremely angry (gave my self a black eye, completely smashed my room up, punched a massive bruise on my leg etc), make me feel the same as i was at my lowest (most likely was depressed and had professionals say i was but got scared and never got diagnosed), extremely happy (uncontainable happiness, jumping, circling, rambling etc), couple other emotions, long winded way of saying severe mood swings basically. my eatings also still fucked and i know it, i use to be anorexic but now i’m more restrictive bulimia (not 100% sure if that’s the right word) and i hate it, i so much preferred ana and i so badly wanna go back, i just cut the word ‘FAT’ into my stomach because i binged again and honestly i missed this feeling. ik it’s bad and i feel like i threw a bunch of progress away, plus i have a bf that might see it depending on when i next see him, but i’ve missed the feeling of it cutting and now i’m a bit worried i’m not gonnna stop again, i can’t even decide if it’s good or bad cause i don’t want to get addicted again but i’ve missed this so much, i know it might be a good way to stop binging and id rather sh than binge but i can’t put my family thru this again not after last time, plus with how bad last time was i’m not sure i’ll live thru getting bad again, i didn’t even bother counting attempts (ages 12-16) cause of how many there were and that bothers me a bit but yanno, that’s life.

I don't want to give other people ideas on what to use, so I won't name the item. For the sake of this post, let's call this normal object item A. Normal, mentally healthy people use item A to do purpose B. Purpose B has nothing to do with self harm. 

I honestly want to buy item ""A"" for purpose ""B"". Item A could realistically be good for my health if used properly, but I don't trust myself not to attempt hurting myself with it.

I've thought about asking someone else to keep it for me when I'm not using it for its intended B purpose, but item A is not something someone like me would need help using or storing, so it would be really weird for me to ask someone to hold on to it for me or supervise me while I use it.

I didn’t really care until recently I’ve gotten an infection and realised that “oh shit this is actually important” 

And so I’ve been using these ‘pads’ (they’re like wet in something) that you put on a wound and it doesn’t hurt when you remove the bandage. Problem is it still sticks to the cut and when removed it takes the scab with, and undoes all scabbing.

Maybe this is just a part of the healing process, but it makes my cuts heal slower and it’s becoming bit annoying

Unsure if this is the right sub for this, but i need some help. My best friend has some serious self esteem issues. In addition to that, his parents are very strict, cold, and don’t understand him at all. He has a terrible relationship with them, and is FILLED with repressed anger. Last week i noticed some cuts on his arm. I asked him what they were, and he said that he was trying to let his anger out, and that it was his first time doing it. I’m extremely worried because i know he is a selfless person and he would hurt himself rather than hurting others, and i want to help him. I made him promise that he wouldn’t do it again but i’m not sure if he’s gonna resist or not. I was hoping some of you guys could give me advice on how to help him and keep him from falling into the sh rabbit hole",1679406879.0

I promise you the silver

Never use silver pens

you cannot rely on them

rather than silver they draw red

Red like rubies, red like a gem

Instead, use purple

And orange and green and blue

All the pretty colours,

more suitable for kids like you

Silver is good for carrots,

silver is good for leeks

But peach suits your skin better,

it matches your pretty cheeks

Silver is good for paper,

silver is good for cakes

I began self harming because I was being a dumb kid and needed an outlet for release but since then I've relapsed several times and each time I think I'm associating SH = happiness more and more. I get euphoric every time I cut with my heart beating really fast and my chest tightening uncontrollably in a good way.

My main concern is that I'm now beginning to find the concept of self harming with somebody/having somebody cut me very hot. This is somewhat alarming to me because it's honestly my first time having any specific fantasies and I don't want SH to somehow shape my desires so completely like that.

I’ve been at sh for years of my life now, to the point where almost every part of my body has some sort of scar on it, save for my face. The worst areas are my arms, legs, and ankles, so I tend to wear long sleeved shirts and leggings. I almost never wear shorts or short sleeves, and if I do I always bring a jacket or use concealer to cover up. Recently, I got to have the house all to myself, so I decided to indulge and wear a more revealing outfit, a pair of shorts and a tank top. I couldn’t look in the mirror, it was too much. But the worst part was when my cat brushed up against my legs and her fur felt so soft. I almost cried. I miss being normal and getting to wear t shirts in summer, I miss not having to wear soaks and shoes that went past my ankle, I miss when I could go out in a shorter skirt and not feel constantly on edge, always having to pull it as far down as I can to hide my legs. I wish I’d never begun cutting, and I wish I had never let it get this far. 

Even then, I can’t seem to stop.  I threw away my blades. I got a knife. I gave up the knife. I sharpened a fucking nail file to the point where it could wound. I started scratching at my skin, so I cut my nails. But then I started fucking biting myself. I just can’t stop…",1679340363.0

1.	Short term avoidance techniques with suggestions for an at-the-ready kit to defeat the urge to self harm.

2.	A general look at aspects of well-being dealing with the bigger picture of physical, mental and social wellbeing. Also goal setting and developing good habits

3.	Longer term coping strategies

4.	Dealing with the underlying issues

5.	Using these troubled times as a springboard for long term success rather than just learning to cope with current issues.

As I intend the series of posts to function as a long-term reference to help people move forward, I will welcome useful additions, suggestions, criticisms etc., but do not wish the threads to become bogged down with comments that do not significantly add to the purpose of the post. I might therefore ask for some posts which are otherwise quite legitimate to be removed from the threads.

There are some issues I will not be dealing with e.g. how to hide wounds, how to care for them etc.

Although I have never self-harmed nor had the urge to do so, I believe I have some insight into the issue and the underlying causes. I am no stranger to mental issues myself, but I cleared the last of the serious ones up twenty years ago and now feel that almost every day is a gift. My intention is to point to ways forward for people. Obviously, everyone is on their own path, but different paths may have much in common.",1679374722.0

despite this, i'd be entirely lying if i said i didn't miss it. it's not that i even miss the act of self-harming itself, it's moreover that it felt like the *one* time i was allowed to take time for myself. if i was physically injured, nothing else mattered but taking care of my safety. work & school were secondary concerns that i had an excuse not to focus on. i feel similarly about being sick; i've genuinely prayed to get sick simply so i could allow myself to rest without being plagued with horrible guilt.  


except now i'm still doing horribly. i'm weeks behind in school, i'm overwhelmed with work, and i can barely do basic tasks such as laundry or showering. everything feels so exhausting, but i'm physically healthy and nothing is wrong so i have no excuses to give the people around me. i want to self-harm just so i can feel like there's something wrong to warrant my poor performance.

124,4 fucking years since last time,5,11woilh,selfharm,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/comments/11woilh/4_fucking_years_since_last_time/,0,"So, I never used reddit for venting about this stuff when I was young but now I do know reddit and maybe writting about It may help?

I just cut myself, with a knife, like 7 times in a row after 4 years of being clean about It.
And it felt amazing. Fuck.
I never became addict with alcohol, I never did other drugs. But this felt like fucking falling into an old addiction like a drug addict.

When I was 12 I was very depressed, and It was when I started cutting myself.
Bullying, S.A from an cousin, bad relationship with my mother (she was the type of hit before talking), bad boyfriends choices, and having a close friend that was very depressed too and would share selfharm tecniques as a way to vent and try not to do It; I think all that mattered as why I started.

It was so fucking easy, like, I would suffer from panic attacks constantly and cutting myself would make an instant good relief and stop the attack. It would stings and hurt before, but even that was good, like I deserved It.
My mom actually made It worse one time she cuaght me doing It, looked me straight to the eye and said: ""This is YOUR fault, not mine. Your trying to make my life harder and looking for attention"", and then closed the door of the bathroom.
It caused me so much anxiety that I just kept cutting on top of the already cutted skin of my legs until I could see muscle.

It took a full minute to start to hurt, and then hurt so damn bad. I bandagage It the best I could until It stop bleeding and cleaned the floor.

That time was the worst I would harm myself, and tried to do better.

I would ocassionally harm myself with mild cuts in hidden areas, and I could stop for good when I was 20, four years ago.

Sometimes, when I was very bad mentally, I would be doing something normal and whising someone hit myself hard or some sharp things would magically drop and harm me, or even looking to sharp things in the kitchen thinking about It.
But I stayed strong, I didn't do anything.


And suddenly, I am no strong anymore.

I've been more depressed again, and now I'm not at my parents house or in as bad situation as I was at 12-16. I've been failing uni non-stop and lying to my relatives about It, having so little money even at a point where I don't know It the next month I will be able to pay rent of the bills, isolating myself and making my roomstes life hard because I forgot about simple chores constantly, and ultimately wanting to die (not actually trying, just thinking of a testament just in case) at the same time as I'm afraid of It.

I wanted to do better so bad but I'm still at the same end as I was at 12. But I am a fucking irresponsable useless adult now.


Yesterday I was in my grandmother's house, she was giving me chocolates and when I ate them, my uncle that was close to me gave me a hard punch in the arm saying I shouldn't eat those since I am fat enough.
He didn't meant to hurt me, he's just very strong for the type of work he does, and clearly he didn't thought he hurted my arm.

But he did, and It felt so fucking good.
The first thought that crossed my mind was ""punch me harder"". It felt like I deserved It.

And with that fucking thought in mind, unable to just not think about It, today I wanted to feel hurt when my panic started.

And happened that I had a knife in my hand in the kitchen, and happened that I was alone.

I didn't think It through, and I cut myself. Not too much.
Enough to see a drop of blood emerging from the cut.
And I know I'm sooo mentally ill and that I did actually fucking 0 advance in life since I was a teenager because It felt fucking amazing.

I want to say sorry, to myself of 12 years, that fought so hard because she thought that everything would be better and I would be mature, a bit more Happy and with a good work at 24.
I'm sorry.

Some backstory: 
In a relationship for just over a year now with a person I perceive to be my “one.” We are opposites in some ways, but most of the time we complete each other (e.g. I bake, he cooks. I decorate, he builds). Last month on the day before Valentine’s Day I discovered some shit that re-traumatized me on his iPad. We fought about it and as a result I was left feeling not good enough and frankly, pretty unattractive as well. Those are pretty essential pillars to my self-esteem, so in the weeks after that when we couldn’t stop arguing my anxiety increased tremendously. 

Now, a few days ago my partner tells me that the move we’ve been planning since the beginning of the year won’t happen. I’ve been learning his native language, researching neighborhoods, and imagining our future there. Not only did he not feel the need to apologize for changing plans, but he felt it appropriate to express his relief + mock my efforts to mentally prepare to move there + said, and I quote: “I would rather be alone in a place that I like than with you in a place where I feel miserable.” 

It was his suggestion to move there in the first place. I was willing to uproot my entire existence for him. Of course I am upset. What’s more, since we decided to move I thought I should tell my best friend. This best friend now plans to move back to his home country and I can’t help but think it had something to do with my own eminent departure. 

Today we argued very badly. It got physical from both sides while in the bathtub. A neighbor rang, concerned about domestic abuse

I am at my wits end with how to save this one remaining relationship in my life from tanking. Help, please :(",1679314272.0

i would also DETEST having to take more medications, go to a mental(?) hospital, or anything that'll take more money out of my parents' bank! i feel so guilty already. i don't want to burden them even more. they already spend too much for my 10+ pills consisting of vitamins, supplements, antibiotics, and medication. not to mention the tuition they'll pay when i transfer schools, and the 4-5 years worth of tuition they'll need to pay my previous school since it was free only if i graduated from there. 

additionally, me and my two siblings all suffer mentally and we're all administered medication and such. we also ALL have the same tuition problem for transferring schools for our mental health. jesus being healthy is expensive. i wish i could want to die because i just know i would be able to find a way, but unfortunately i am too afraid of the idea of ceasing to exist.

so anyway, should i confess? i dont want to wear long sleeves forever, but i can force myself to by rewearing dirty clothes etc if it means keeping my parents from spending or worrying more. i cut safely anyway- only with scissors and not deep. just enough to bleed a lil.

2) do slower and more deliberate cuts tend to cause more scarring or less? i usually don't get very deliberate but today i cut some words that i regret and really hope dont stay forever.

I’ve been dealing with severe anxiety lately and a few days ago I was having a panic attack so I grabbed a pair of scissors and started dragging it across my ankle. I did it on my ankle because I knew that nobody could see it and I could hide it with socks. Long story short, I didn’t draw blood but it stung when I got in the shower the next day. Last night I was really depressed and so I went and got a sharp knife from the kitchen. I cut myself a few times (on the side of my ankle) and all three cuts bled just a little bit. It was so reliving and the feeling of the cut stinging afterwards kept my mind off anything else. It was like I could finally breathe, I wasn’t stuck in my head at all. Over the next couple hours I would pinch the cuts or press on them when the pain started going away. As I was falling asleep I couldn’t stop thinking about the feeling of the knife on my skin, about the relief I felt when I saw blood. I really wanted to do it more but I was too tired to get out of bed so I fell asleep. The first thing I did this morning when I woke up was grab the knife and make a few more cuts. These bled even less and I wasn’t satisfied so I went and found a box cutter in the garage, sharpened it and cleaned it and then went to town. The box cutter didn’t work very well because I think it was still pretty dull and it was hard to cut in the same place over and over so it just made a bunch of small slices. Then I realized I could use a razor blade, so I completely tore apart a razor and then tried that. The razor blade made me bleed a lot and it hurts way less than the box cutter. So now I’m laying in bed with 12 slices on my leg that I’ve made in the last 24 hours. I know I’m going to do it again, but I can’t tell anyone because I’m ashamed.  Technically I have been harming myself since I was like 13, because I would dig my nails into my skin or bite myself really hard but this is the first time I have used a tool to draw blood. I’m 16 btw, my 17th birthday is in April. Anyways I just really needed to get this off my chest so thank you for reading :’)",1679253456.0

I'll call her Rose in this post. I also have another sister, Ellie. 

I'm away at university and only spend the weekends at home, so I don't get to see her that often. I found out last week, when she briefly showed me the cuts on her arm over video chat. I didn't get to say anything because she hung up as Ellie walked in on her. The next day, I got a couple of angry text messages, because she thought I had told Ellie. I didn't. Ellie found out on her own. I was seriously distressed by these messages, especially the one that said that she'll add more cuts if anyone else finds out. I called my mom to ask what's going on at home, but I did not tell her what I found out. Rose had blocked me, and so I couldn't talk to her directly. I tried talking to her over my mom's phone, then my sister's, but she didn't want to talk. Ellie eventually told our mom what's going on. I think it should have been Rose who tells her, but there's no way to change what happened. 

Eventually, Rose did take my call, but she refused to talk to me and only answered what I said over the call by text. She opened up a bit about cutting herself, told me she's been doing it for months. She sent me entries she writes in a vent diary. She wrote that she self harms because she thinks everyone sees her as ugly, weird and cringe. I told her that's not true, but I didn't really know what else to tell her. At the end of the call, she wrote that she wished she hadn't told anyone. I was completely overwhelmed by that situation. I feel like it's my fault somehow. Over the last months, Rose changed. She started hanging out with other people at school. She changed a lot about her style, her interest, her way of speaking. She got a lot more rebellious with our mom. My mom has to nag her all day so she'll do her homework. She barely has any motivation to do anything. She spends hours glued to her phone. 

Today I tried talking to Rose again. At first we talked about how she spends too much time on her phone. She told us that she doesn't know what else to do. In the end, she told me she often spends so much time on her phone because she listens to vent music and watches vent videos. She told me she self harmed again this week, and that the reason she told me is that she wants me to feel bad about it. And I do. I feel sick, and my anxiety has been getting worse since I found out that she's cutting. I don't want to make this post about myself but I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't even really want to be around her right now. She was literally smiling as she told me she wants me to feel bad. I don't know how to help her. Our mom has tried talking to her as well, but Rose doesn't want to talk. I asked Rose whether she thinks therapy might help, something I've brought up before, but she told me that she doesn't want help.

We all don't know what to do anymore. We try to talk to her, but she doesn't even want to be around us at all lately. I'm worried I fucked up my chance to help her. Does anyone have advice on how to deal with this situation? Any kind of advice on how to approach her, what to tell her, what not to tell her.

I don't know how many times, I've taken it upon myself to punish my body for all of its wrongdoings. 
Slicing away the sorrow with a blade, 
Carving little stories into the bloodied mess. 
The blood soon starts to trickle like a river, 
Not at all similar to the bursting ocean which lies inside of me, searing my heart with its salty waves. 
The blade drags across, the blood flows. 
Spilled blood splatters the floor, coats my hands
It smears across my thighs, my arms, 
Bluring the lines of my misdeeds,
Letting me hide behind it like a thick, winter shawl. 
Eventually the blood must dry. 
Fusing fabric to flesh, sin to skin. 
Great purple marks lie in their wake. 
Telling everyone what I am.
What I've done. 

For I am a monster, 
Yet I live not under any beds. 
I live in the cracks and crevices of society,
Collecting the crumbs of sympathy and woe, 
Tossed aside in this city of neglect. 
I need not your pity I scream. 
I need not your lies or words of comfort. 
For I am a monster my dear, 
A monster through and through. 
There isn't a sin in the book I haven't committed.
Not a lie in history I haven't told. 
And you ask me now, (or so it seems) 
why I tell the lies I do
But they're not lies I cry, 
It's the truth good and well!
If God were real, why, 
He'd damn me straight to hell!

And the clouds they seem to part a bit, 
The sun begins to rise, 
And I hope beyond reason,
 you can't see the teardrops in my eyes.
For I'm a monster through and through,
And I know you'll hate me too. 
There's no lies I will not say,
There's no telling what I'll do. 
I know one day you'll leave me, 
I know one day you'll see. 
You'll see the monster you deny
There's no way to prevent it.
I just hope that you wont cry. 

You'll leave me like the rest, 
And so resumes the storm 
For the only thing this monster deserves,
Is cruelty and scorn. 
It's carved into my legs,
It's carved into my heart. 
A life of pain, 
A life of lies,
Which is tearing me apart. 
I mean not to hurt you, 
I don't want to make you cry.
But I'm a monster through and through
That bits not a lie. 

And now I'm all alone again,
I've driven you away. 
The walls had crumbled, 
So I build them higher, 
To ensure this never happens again. 
But my foundations are weak, 
My bricks are made of straw 
Light one match and you will find me crying on the floor
For I'm a monster through and through, or so they say
There is reason for this sorrow.
I deserve this dismay. 

I bare not claws and teeth, 
But kindness and a smile 
I mean not to hurt you,
But you say I'm in denial. 
All I want is happiness,
Is that too much to ask? 
I want someone to stay and brave the storm, 
not cruelty and scorn. 
I want the love from stories, 
 the joy you find in books,
But monsters don't get that. 
All we get is complaints and funny looks.

And I know one day a Knight will come,
With his sword raised up high.
There'll be a flash of silver,
And my ending will be nigh.
My head will bounce off of the cobbles, 
My blood will surely pour
I hope the hope it doesn't hurt, 
I hope I die in bed. 
And the towns people will cheer, 
As they toss me in a ditch, 
For all they know is the monster,
 they know me as a bitch.
A heartless creature am I,
One deserving of such pain.

I don't know what I did,
But if it'll make you love me,
I promise, I won't do it again.",1679304653.0

I swear to God I’ve tried to get better- for her. I’ve been in therapy since 2014, I’ve found God and lost it and found it again. I’ve had decades of sobriety and I’ve thrown it away at times when I’ve been at my lowest. Ive been married and divorced and have had to start over twice to get away from those abusive men. 


But the feelings of failure overwhelm any kind of accomplishment I’ve managed in 33 years. The screaming in my head and gnawing at my wrists and arms is back. I can’t believe what I’ve put my children through just so I can still feel the dull buzz of what it feels like to get hit in the head by a man when were angry. Not that that’s how I planned it but thats what ended up happening and I question whether I pick these men all along - subconsciously. 


Because that is what I crave. To hurt and be hurt when I’m sad and mad. Even now I’m fighting the urges to have reckless meaningless s*x because I know it will just hurt me more. I’m fighting the urge to slam my head into a wall. To get high. 


I’m not going to do any of that (I hope) but my God when does it end? No amount of self care and sobriety and success after leaving is making a dent in how much I hate myself.

C) I am somewhat of an asshole in this story, but please read it all before judging me. D) This is not really a story about SH, but I don’t know where else to seek support and advice.

Today me (early teens F) and my cousin (early 20s M) got sushi. I was holding is daughter (12-18 months). She wanted something on my plate, and I gave it to her. I thought it was avocado at a glance, but it turned out to be wasabi. 

I realized what I had done almost immediately, but it was too late. She screamed and screamed. My cousin freaked out, saying things along the lines of ""you can't give a baby wasabi! why would you do that!? i'm going to go wash her mouth out right now!"" and he ran off with her. I sat in silence.

I love that baby more than myself. She's one of the only reasons I'm still here. I teared up, but was afraid to let it show. A few minutes later, he came back with the baby. She was smiling and happy, but I was screaming at myself internally. We had the following conversation:

Cousin: ""You done?""

Me: ""Yeah.""

""Good. Let's go home.""

*we drive to his home in silence. I was on the verge of sobbing. We get home\*

Cousin: ""do you want water or something?""

Me: *i barely croak out a 'no thanks'.*

""Hey, are you upset? Did I scare you in the restaurant?""

Me: *slightly nods*.

At this point, you should know more about my childhood. I only realized this a few minutes ago, but I have this mostly-unconscious mentality of ""you have to be perfect or no one will love you"". Let's just say that my mom ""gave me something to cry about"" every time I cried in the face of breaking the rules/getting a punishment/hurting someone else. 

If that baby was one of my siblings, my mom would have probably slapped me right there in the restaurant and yelled and made me feel extra guilty before shunning me for at least a month. I was unknowingly expecting this from him. In my household, you never ever let anyone know you're upset. And I just put myself in ""jeopardy"". I sobbed and hyperventilated, preparing for the worst.

He came at me, and I was bracing for pain. But he didn’t hit me, yell at me, make me feel guilty, or tell me to “stop crying this instant or there will be consequences”. He *hugged* me.

""I'm so sorry. Hey, come sit down. You never meant to hurt her. You just made a poor decision. I make those all the time. See \*shows a big scar on the back of his neck\*? A few years ago I tried to hold on to a motorcycle going 40 mph while balancing on a freaking skateboard. That lasted all of two seconds. \*chuckle\*""

""Hmmm...""

""And I've accidentally hurt kids, too. I must accidentally elbow her a million times when getting her into her car seat. Hell, I've even dropped you on tile once when you were a baby. I felt bad about that too.""

*I'm still hyperventilating*

""Here, let me go get you a bag or something. Deep breaths.""

*He leaves, and the baby comes up and hugs me, making me cry harder.*

""I couldn't find anything. Try taking deep breaths. I'm sorry I probably overreacted. See, she's fine. You're okay.""

I begin picking this encounter apart in my head. I've never had an adult apologize for something near this big, let alone when it was my fault. I tried picking the convo apart, looking for ulterior motives (shitty IK, but I was in shock), but I couldn't find any. 

All my life I've tried my hardest to be perfect afraid that everyone would disown me if I dropped a drinking glass or got a B in English. It was all I was shown growing up. My mother would shun me and make me feel bad when I did those things. I realized that he wasn't making me feel bad, I was. He just wanted me to feel better, but *I* yelled at me just like my mother would.

I even bought and ate a small jar of wasabi out of guilt. I threw up a few times, but I guess guilt does strange things to you. Does this count as SH (lol)?

How should I respond, and how should I go forward? I'm sobbing right now, and I don't even know why. I still feel like it’s my fault. Yes, I didn’t mean to give her pain, but I also failed to check her food before giving it to her, a “golden rule” my cousin taught me.

Its somthing about a year now. I am 17m. And It all started from one-sided love from me. It looked many times good, but every time it fcked up and the girl somehow ignored me or sent me to hell. The girl was really mean to me and totally not nice, but I was obsessed with her. 

Anyway, Smthing like 3 months ago I started to sh. Just with scissors without any blood, just some pain. Few months later it got worse and I started with razor blades, which were amazing.   I feel pretty shamed about myself and truly hate myself. A month ago I got drunk pretty bad (4.5 promile). And went conscious to hospital, thats the point where my parents and school (it was prom of my school) found out about everything. 

Worst part of this is that I do not have any reason do it. Now the love is gone, I lost every feeling. I feel so numb. Some may say I am just attention harmer, but I am not. I just want someone to truly care. Some of them say, they do and I trust them, but even though, I feel super lonely and have lonely panic attacks or how to call it. I just want someone to care and idk, text first xd 🥲. Just the smallest true low tho….. 

I am a bit of a perfectionist. Want to be best at everything I do, even though I do a lot of success, its not enough.  I have a great life and family, but still feel terrible! 

Sometimes I tell myself, that it is all in my head, couse this can not be real.  I have been clear for 10 days now, but here I am depressed as fuck with a scalpel in my hands wanting to cut myself so bad, knowing that I can not, with no idea, where to cut, without somebody spotting it.

I just want to end it actually, sh is useless. I have been feeling so numb past days, loss of reflexes, lot of depression and bad states and panic attacks, random texts from the girl, arguing and much more. Just end me someone please.

i never try to distract myself or anything when the urge comes, i just give in.

i feel like i'm not allowed to complain about it because of this. i mean i don't necessarily *like* self harming, i'm just not in the mindset to stop. i stop when summer comes and it's so difficult and it looks like recovery until september rolls around, i just keep cutting.

sometimes i don't think about it for a day but make 30+ cuts the next and barely even regret it. i only regret it when i realise they're hard to hide.

realistically speaking, if i knew no one would ever see them, i'd cut a LOT more than i do, because it's the only coping mechanism that works on me.",1679231325.0

269,I've managed to make a new friend who's kept me clean without even realising,6,11vhp8o,selfharm,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/comments/11vhp8o/ive_managed_to_make_a_new_friend_whos_kept_me/,0,"For the first time in a few weeks, I'm two days clean :)

It might not seem like much, but it's a lot better than what I have been doing. It was hard at first. I keep on having dreams about it. My urges are intense. But I have a new friend who I met a few days ago, and doesn't even know about my self-harm, and he's stopped me from doing it without even realising. 

He was on the phone with me all night and all day yesterday, and we talked the entire time about just random stuff. It was really nice having someone to talk to. We talked for like 18 hours until we fell asleep. We talked all day yesterday. And then last night, he stayed on the phone with me until like almost 4:00 a.m., and then texted me until I fell asleep. Those are the hours I tend to relapse. Yet I didn't, because I was so busy talking to him that I didn't even get any urges. I'm afraid of sleeping. But even though he was just texting me, I felt safer because it was like somebody was there, yknow? And I managed to fall asleep. I didn't even have an anxiety attack, or freak out as I was drifting off. I was awake one minute and waking up the next. There was no struggle. No fight. Just peace. The wars waging in my mind paused for a moment, and all was still and quiet. 

Last night He told me he wanted to keep me company so I wasn't scared, which is really sweet because when we were talking, I mentioned my insomnia and anxiety like, once. And when I did mention anything to do about those two things, he was like genuinely nice to me?? He didn't get mad at me or anything and was really understanding, and he was like ""I'm sorry you have to deal with that, I'm sorry bad things happen to you"" and nobody has ever reacted that way before. And he genuinely tried to understand. 

I wish I could thank him, yknow? He doesn't even know it, but he's helped me to stop hurting myself for two whole days, when I was stuck in a rut of hurting myself every few hours. He's helped me to feel better.  But I don't want him to find out. I don't like it when people know about this. Sometimes, it scares them or grosses them out, and they never look at me the same again. Or they just ghost me completely. So even though this new friend promised he wouldn't ever ghost me, I'm still worried that if he finds out about my self-harm, he will leave. 

And like even though I've only known him a few days, he's literally the best friend I've ever had. I mean, the dude's a carbon copy of me. We like the same movie genres, we have the same hobbies. We have the same opinions on music, and we even share a birthday month. And like every time I ask him if I'm annoying, he keeps on saying I will never annoy him and like if he accidentally interrupts me when we're speaking, he'll stop and tell me to go on, and finish what I'm saying, but like the way he says it is in a nice way. 

And now I'm worried, because we're online friends, and we want to meet up in a few years (got to get to know each other for a while first lol) and he was talking about water parks, and shorts, and how much fun we're going to have. He was shocked when I told him I don't own any shorts, and when I told  him usually wear like jeans, long sleeved shirt and a short sleeved shirt on top, he said it would be too hot for that where he lives. (He lives in a different country) 

Some of my scars won't be faded by then. And that's if I manage to continue to stay clean. And I'm worried, because as I said, he's the best friend I've had in like, well, ever really, and I don't really want to scare him off. So yeah. Just need to rant a little bit.

Earlier in the relationship I was an immature piece of shit to him. I always needed his attention and I’d get really mad at him if he wasn’t responding in under 3 minutes. I feel so fucking horrible for it. I feel like I can’t even live with myself for it. I fucking ruined him. 

Because of this, he’s too scared to ask for alone time. I’ve put this horrible emotional baggage on him and I can’t undo it. I’m trying to help him. I give him reminders that it’s okay to ask, I give him space whenever he asks for it, I ask him if he wants space or support, I don’t question it if he doesn’t respond for awhile, and I’m doing my very best to listen and understand how he is feeling because of me.

I feel like no matter what I do it won’t work. We both love each other. Neither of us want it to end. But he had said that if we can’t fix it he doesn’t know what to do.

I want to cause myself the pain I caused him and I don’t know how else to do it. Self harming made me feel a little bit better because it put me in more pain and it distracted from the pain too. But my god I feel so fucking horrible. I feel like I don’t deserve to live for what I’ve done to him. I don’t know what to do. I feel horrible. I keep self harming every few hours and I can’t stop.

This came across as far more disrespectful than I was aware of at the moment, and when my dad confronted me about it, I made another mistake on top of that by saying “but I’m not satisfied!” because I couldn’t resolve this issue tonight. 

When he said “It’s not about you,” I lost it. Except I lost it in a controlled way, very different from the wild outburtsts I used to have at myself years earlier. I felt so angry at myself that I was convinced I deserved physical punishment, yet instead of punching myself like I used to do, I hit a punching bag hundreds of times until it peeled off the skin on three of my knuckles. It took a couple weeks for the wounds to heal, since they kept getting re-injured. That was what I felt was proportionate punishment. Not saying I was right or you should do the same, only that that this was how I felt.

This was half a year ago, and since then I haven’t done anything like that again. This is another improvement on my past history with self-harm, since last time I became addicted to it. I feel like the difference is that in that instance, it was truly an exceptional thing. Both because it’s quite rare that I do something that undeniably selfish and harmful, which I felt warranted a return to that old punishment method, and because that time there was no particular moment where I had a breakdown. I spread out the punishment systematically, and at the same time made it more physically damaging than anything I had ever done in the past. The good news is that I both since haven’t lashed out at my family over my own OCD issues, and haven’t hurt myself.

I feel, in a primal sense, that people who do truly awful things need to be punished physically. And I have the sense that in this instance, I was merely applying that standard to myself. When self-help sites talk about self-harming as punishment, they always only focus on when someone is judging themselves unfairly. But they never get into the dilemma of when someone has objectively done something that warrants righteous anger, rage even, and that the perpetrator may see as justification for self-inflicted violence.",1679219926.0

It was the passion. Mister Marcel told her about the Dutch history of art. When he started to talk about Vincent van Gogh, little Mandy started to daydream. When her mom picked her up after school she rushed to get answers.

""Mommy, do you know a lot about Vincent van Gogh?"" She asked. Her mom was startled. Her girl asking about her favorite painter at this age?

""I actually did a presentation about him in sixth grade."" She looked at her curious daughter, not sure to tell her the gruesome detail everyone already knows about.

""You know he was really poor right?"" Mandy didn't know that. Everyone buys his paintings, how can he be poor?

""He also cut of his ear, and wasn't happy. He tried to end himself in one of the beautiful fields he painted.""

I’ve been doing some great recovery and I’ve been clean from cutting for almost two years now. However I still experience some extreme anger episodes that I have to deal with privately by myself in my room. Instead of cutting I slap the palms of my hands against the wall until it burns really bad (instead of punching walls ofc) it seems like it does minimal to no damage of neither the wall or permanent damage to myself.

I’ve never heard of any other self harm besides cutting and burning & although I have past experience I still have little knowledge about this sort of thing

I haven't been able to laugh genuinely in so long and when my partner of two years came to visit me only a few weeks ago I felt it more as a nuisance than anything (don't get me wrong, I love them with my whole heart but all I was thinking is ""why the hell are you here with me right now? don't you have anything better to do with your life than hang out with a self-destructive loser?"")

It's terrible, I know. i just don't understand how people have it in their hearts to even tolerate me.

I'm pretty well acquainted with self harm whether it be cutting, burning myself with scalding water, smoking weed until I throw up, or starving myself for days on end. I understand that what I do is harmful, I understand that what I'm doing to my body is just killing me faster, but I can't find it in me to stop.

Everytime I self harm I feel bad- mentally and physically. I feel bad about harming myself in the first place because there are people in my life that wouldn't want me to do that. They'd want me to get help and support and do whatever I can to make myself feel better. But why do they care? Why are there people around me that want to help me and be friends ""just because""? They can't see anything, I'm still alive, so why the hell do they care about what I do in my free time?

I guess my question is: Is there anyone that knows and acknowledges that what they are doing is wrong, knows they should stop and wants to stop but just can't/doesn't. I am not addicted to any of this (at least I'm 90% sure I'm not), I hate how it makes me feel afterwards, but I just can't stop.

I am aware that self-harm is a complex behavior influenced by different triggers, thoughts, emotions, and addictive tendencies. Specifically, I'm curious about the specific thoughts and emotions that can lead to self-harm, why it tends to repeat, and whether it serves as a distraction or replacement for overwhelming feelings. Additionally, I'm interested in exploring the sense of agency and the addictive nature of self-harm, including why it becomes an urge or a source of dopamine release.

However, after some time I noticed an almost textured surface at the deepest point. I got past it with no pain but on the next cut there was a sharp sensation that made me stop completely. 
I'm always careful to avoid major nerves but it made me recoil in shock. Perhaps it was just because it was so unexpected, and in retrospect it hurt little more than cutting to deep dermis, but I'm curious as to what it was, given cutting through fat typically feels like literally nothing. It didn't last long, nor bleed any more than usual.

This happened last evening. I yelled sharply from the window for her to come inside. She came in crying but I told her I was sharp just so I seemed like the “bad guy” and I just wanted to remove her from the situation fast. 

She was still a little upset and blamed me for not calling her in sooner. I explained that no one can read her mind and she needs to find her voice and speak up once she was asked questions about her scars. “You know what? That’s kind of personal and it’s dinner time anyway. See you tomorrow.”  She nodded and at least seemed to be listening. 

I continued that we have a responsibility to protect innocent kids and we can’t glamorize these things. I reassured her it’s nothing to be ashamed of and again, not mad at her. 

But I am scared as hell. Scared that she’s unknowingly grooming these kids to become cutters.  She likes to hang out on the front yard and the younger kids all flock to her. I mean, I can’t tell her that she can’t go outside. 

So, I’m looking for advise here. When she wakes up, I expect she’ll want to talk because it happened close to going to bed. I’ve never punished or judged her self harm, but that was before younger kids who aren’t mine were involved. Should I tell her counselor? Should I let her outside only with supervision?

Anyways my older brother and I where going to get checkups and vaccines updates but for some reason my mom had a tendency to make both appointments at once so we shared the room. She also always came in and didn’t let us answer the docs questions. So we do the normal weigh and height shit and go to the room where I volunteer my brother to go first.

So my brother does his thing and is my turn now. For some reason my mom lets me answer the doctors question this time. The funny things is the last questions were if I felt suicidal and if I felt ok and if life had meaning. I kid you not right after I answered they went straight to the vaccines update and lifted my sleeves.

The nurses stand back and look at me and my mom gets up and says we are leaving. We leave the room and my head is swimming and I’m back to the dream state but 10x worse. I felt like I wasn’t there, I don’t it’s hard to explain how I felt. Anyways my brother keeps saying what’s wrong with me and the car ride home is silent.

We get home and I run straight to my room because I know once my dad hears what happened it’s over.  10-20 minutes pass I think but soon my dad walks in the room and just stares and say how selfish and how I had no reason to be doing that.

He always notices when I relapse because he rubs my legs/thighs a lot and that’s where I self harm. He called me last night and is still on the phone with me now just to spend the night together in a way since he couldn’t sleep over tonight. 
I woke up at 5 AM (it’s 7am now) and self harm has been heavy on my mind. I haven’t gotten back to sleep yet. My depression is getting bad again and so sleep and staying asleep has been extremely difficult plus the AC has been out for weeks now and it’s causing its own load of problems with my family.

I just want to give in and let go for once but I know my fiancé would be upset, especially since we have been on call all night. I know that he’s going to come over tomorrow.
A contributing factor is that I found the series Ginny and Georgia. It’s heavy, and I have CPTSD regarding several of the topics Ginny and Georgia cover which makes it hit harder for me but I’ve tried to stop watching it but it’s an addicting series to me. It’s just triggering this desire to relapse with all the added stress I’ve got right now and I don’t know what to do. I know I need to stop watching it and I have but the episodes I’ve already seen keep playing out in my mind with the addition of my own memories regarding the relations I see between the show and my own past/present.

It doesn't seem that deep or big, so I'm surprised it looks like it goes down to the dermis, and I'm scared, especially with what this means for the future. I bet it's going to hurt later and I'm going to have to walk a lot...

Can I take a shower? If I can, should I avoid getting soap in it? Should I wait for it to stop bleeding (wouldn't it start bleeding again)?

And what would happen if I didn't take care of an infection? How painful would it be if I let myself die?

What if I left it open (no bandages or dressing) and let it scab? Would it even scab? Would it get infected, even if I'm careful (can't be careful because I'd have to hide it, meaning that pants would rub on it)?

My (28m) partner (36f) has self harmed this evening and I’m not sure how to move forward. I went and had a shower and then came out to her in the living room covered in blood with a blade in her hand. I took the blade off her and fetched some paper towel to stem the bleeding and clean some of it up.

She was triggered by us watching an old creative work of a friend of hers that in her words “had a character based on her that put her on a pedestal”. (For added context we’ve both been drinking since early afternoon, with this taking place around 10pm)

We’ve been dating for a little over a year and she has never mentioned self harming in the past or any previous struggles with it until this situation tonight. I have also never noticed any scars indicative of previous self harm. 

I have some understanding of the reasons people self harm and what they’re going through (I’ve self harmed in the past when I was around 16-17 years old while struggling with depression and have had past girlfriends who self harmed as well) but am at a loss as to how to deal with this.

443,It's not fair.,3,11tud81,selfharm,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/comments/11tud81/its_not_fair/,1,"I was trying so hard. One of my friends was helping me stay clean and it was all going great. But now I've fucked up again and it's all my fault. I feel like I've done something terrible. I wish that when the urges got too bad I was able to remember how much worse the guilt is so I didn't give in. 

My mum triggered me again. I asked her for bandages the other day, and she freaked out on me, treating me like shit. So I talked with a mental health assessor about it. About how it made me feel really crappy. The mental health person tried to explain to my mum I might feel insecure about my cuts and that's why I wanna cover them with bandages and my mum laughed. She said I did this to myself, so I have to deal with it, because its all my fault. Which is true. 

But then she said something that really stung. She was like ""Oh your cuts aren't even deep enough for bandages anyway. They're barely even scratches. Theyre just paper cuts, arent they? You just need to air them."" And then she started venting about proper self-harm. About how my sister was so much worse than me and that she'd even had to take my sister to the hospital a bunch of times because of it. I wish she'd stop always comparing me to her. In her eyes, I'll never measure up.

And then in the car she kept on going on and on about how at least my sister tried to hide hers and come up with excuses instead of asking for bandages. My mum actively bought my sister medical supplies. I'm relying on stuff I've managed to steal from school. And she was saying how my self-harm isn't even real because I only do it because my dad used to make me watch him self-harm. I've told her I don't like her talking about that. But she does it anyway. 

I tried to get her to stop, and she just yelled at me. By some miracle, I managed to suppress my urges. But then today she picked me up from school and I was in a good mood. So I started telling her about my day, and how it went, and I mentioned literally once, that my knees hurt a bit. And then she went on this whole rant about how it's because I'm so lazy and I never use my legs and I never walk anywhere and it's all my fault that they hurt and how I never do enough, and I should complain because its all my fault. I wasn't trying to complain. I was just trying to tell her about my day. I tried to explain what I mean, even tell her about when I go to the gym, but she said I don't do that enough either. That basically nothing I do is enough. 

And it hurt. And then all the urges from yesterday came flooding back. And now I'm sitting here, just staring at what I've done. I cut a lot deeper this time. I know in my heart that it still won't be enough for her. My legs were shaking so bad I could barely control what I was doing. They're all gaping. They're not deep enough though. Not for her. I don't think they ever will be. I'm almost out of plasters, so soon enough she'll find out about my thighs when I bleed through by accident. Force me to show her. I don't know if I'll do if that happens. 

I've tried to get her to stop. I can be doing so well, things can be going great. But then she'll say or do something. Or she'll get mad. Or she'll threaten me or talk to me about how I'm not good enough and how I never will be. And then the next thing I know all I can see is red. But the red is me, coating my hands, my blade, and I'm shaking and I'm scared and I have to just pretend I'm not or she'll get mad again. I have to force my tears to evaporate and paint the perfect smile on my face which is forced upon me. 

The guilt is a lot worse than I remember it being. It really hurts. And I feel even worse because my friend asks me if I'm clean, and if I am they tell me how proud they are of me and really hype me up, but I haven't relapsed since they found out, so I don't know how they're going to react. I'm worried they'll be disappointed, or they'll start hating me too. 

I just wish I could make her stop. It's not like I can really blame my relapses on her. But she contributes to them. I've tried to put it gently and explain how much some of the things she says hurts, but she just gets madder. She treats me like shit every time I relapse. Giving me harder chores, ignoring me, yelling at me- she sometimes even gets my younger siblings involved. And now I don't know what to do. I was having such a good day and now I've ruined it.

No one cares when you are fine
But when you break, you’re not so benign
You’re hurting me they say when they see
But really the hurting one is me

I loose control, fall back to the dark
Am scared to show and ask for your help
Why is it so easy to let you down
Slide to the floor as I’m bleeding out

The cold tiles burning my skin 
My throbbing veins crying within
The blood runs hot onto the floor
As I seek the relief of the blade once more 

Cutting again to not feel the pain
Bleeding out slow, feeling faint
Fall asleep crying tears of blood 
Cause all I want is the pain to be gone

Waking up at 5 am
Beginning to panic what if they see
Grab a rag start scrubbing the floor
Turn to make sure I locked the door

As I clean arms caked in blood
The panic sets in what have I done 
When they find out I’ll have let them all down
The guilt stings but the pain drowns it out",1679017532.0

493,Relapsed after almost 4 years,2,11tikcd,selfharm,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/comments/11tikcd/relapsed_after_almost_4_years/,0,"I relapsed after being clean of cutting for almost 4 years. I don't have anyone to tell this to, so I will just share this post out into the void. I never thought I would be here again, but here I am, hurting myself in a feeble little attempt to regulate my emotions. 

I genuinely thought I was over self-harm, so it really goes to show how little you can trust your own thoughts and convictions. What's true for you one day might not be true the next day.

I frequently get the urge to hurt myself when I'm feeling upset, but I never act on it. It's almost like an intrusive thought - I rarely actually want to do that. But for some reason, I finally acted on it today and didn't even try to fight the impulse. I don't know why I did. Maybe I had the lingering desire all along and this was the breaking point. I don't have any regrets, it just got the job done and that's fine by me. I don't even feel anything to be honest, I just don't want it to develop into a full blown addiction again. At first, it was just a light scratch, but before I knew it, I grabbed a tool and inflicted so much damage. I suppose my biggest issue will be having to hide the wounds while they heal. Oh well. I just wish I could've at least reached 4 years clean instead of ending it on an unsatisfying amount of time.",1679032352.0

If people are getting annoyed with the questions maybe you guys could make some kind of pin to help people who are new and want to know if their self harm counts as valid?

They provided a bunch of links below including 1 for group therapy. They said I can do group therapy in the meantime before I have regular 1 on 1 appointments. 

Basically I have no idea how long my referral will take to get approved. It could take weeks or months, and because I didn't see what he included in the form I can't even make a guess. The stuff I said could either be taken incredibly seriously or not so seriously, it depends on how the doctor worded it.

She took the news well and was very kind, but I’m worried about how she will act around me. I finally decided to let her see them today because it was warm and I wanted to wear a t-shirt in the house. She’s seen the scars on my thighs, but they aren’t very noticeable because they were all surface level/epidermis. This time, it was my forearm (very stupid in the moment decision I made because it was easiest and I felt invalid not doing it there before which I know is wrong but it’s too late now lol), and they were all dermis. So, obviously, they’re fairly noticeable. Still reddish/pinkish even after months of being clean. 

She gasped when I showed it to her and said my name all sad, and she touched them (my brother was also in the room and he kinda just grimaced and looked away which is understandable but painful). This didn’t make me uncomfy because I have a good relationship with her, but it made me anxious and sad/guilty seeing her so upset and knowing I caused it. I thought it wouldn’t bother me to be uncovered around her but now I’m terrified that she’s going to treat me differently or be upset any time she sees me. 

I don’t know what to do - whether I should stick with long sleeves as long as possible/until they aren’t noticeable (which will take a long time) or just accept that my family will be uncomfortable and wear the T-shirt anyway. Very conflicted because I don’t want to disturb or throw off my family simply by being in the same room without long sleeves, but also don’t want to deal with being overheated 24/7.

Without causing them more invalidation unintentionally by noticing it in the first place? Without making them pissed off at you for trying to care? Without accidentally triggering them more because of your own scars just existing?

I feel sad and upset at ourselves more than anything on this earth really, seeing my friends begin to destroy their physical body the same way we have, become aggressive at me for accidentally noticing, just because I value them as people in my life and can’t stand the thought those we consider our very closest friend(s) doing those same things to themselves. causing themselves possibly permanent irreversible damage too.

Knowing it could get worse for them too and even if they don’t ever intend to guilt me about it and are having a hard time, every time it makes me think we must be the worst person on earth for being unable to help them understand that I’ve gone through similar and felt similar anger towards others etc. about it and all that.

Even if it triggers us etc. it’s agonizing to watch truthfully and knowing it’s their choice in the end, despite seeing them as perfect people compared to yourself, and no matter what can be said or thought with it.

But I know asking for an easy way out would make me a crybaby so no I'll handle that somehow. But there is something else too... There is this girl in my class who started cutting and we actually sit next to each other. I was always hiding my scars like for more than a year. I had seen her coming with some bandages on her arms since the start of this school year. She goes around telling people it's an allergy but I was suspicious and one day she stared too hard and noticed a part of my uncovered wrist skin. Then showed me hers and ever since my relationship with her has been destroyed. I keep getting triggered whenever she comes with new bandaids. I'm competitive yeah and when we don't talk I wonder if she killed herself but when we talk I always feel bad because she doesn't really like me.

I haven't cut myself maybe 6-10 months now, I haven't really been keeping track of it. I started a few years back. First with the punching, then thumbtacks, then blades. Whenever I don't feel normal, I would cut, whenever I would feel happy, I would cut, whenever I would feel sad, scared, anxious, I would cut. It went on like that for months, started with once a week, who would get addicted to something you do 4 times a month?, maybe 2-3 times isnt that bad, 4,5,6, it went on until I wasn't counting how many times I have cut, but how many days I managed to stay clean. I still remember wearing pajamas and hoodies, I never imagined or even thought on how far I have traveled down the hole. 

&#x200B;

That was me, can I consider living a better life now? yes, ""you're fine now, you're ok"". good at studies, sports, and extracurricular activities, I am now good at everything I have to be good at. I feel comfortable for once. I always read about people here sharing their stories on how ""There is indeed light at the end of the tunnel"", people who had been doing it for years and managed to stay clean for a week, a month, a year, and a decade. I always envied them, with my life. 

&#x200B;

Maybe its not ok, maybe you're not doing so good. I have become a version of myself that is nothing inside, I dont feel like im a real person. No matter how many awards, money, attention, praises from strangers, love, or anything good. I just don't feel anything. At the start I treated this version of me as a strength. ""I went through everything a human can go through"". I feel pain? ""you have endured hundred of cuts"" Anxious?"" You have passed out before"" scared?"" you have voluntarily put a cold blade within your skin"" it was great. maybe not so much, I didnt notice it personally until people around me mentioned it. last year, I was on the 99th percentile the whole way, wake up at 3am- study until 5:30am, go to school at 6:30am, go home at 4pm, sports training until 9pm, study until 12am and repeat. Im still doing it now but I know I cant keep doing this, I am clean but at what cost, Im surviving on 3 hours of sleep everything, who knows how many mg of caffeine, I treat people around me shit, I have gone the whole way of not even knowing that my father has cancer, I dont feel love for anything, even those who clearly loves me, I dont feel happy or sad for anything. Every conversation I have is fake, every laugh, every movement. Even when Im alone. I want to laugh, I want to cry, I want to feel excited, and maybe just this one I want to cross the tunnel once again to even feel something.

I have some more permanent scars and have on some level (though I try accepting it) feel ashamed and even more ashamed of the idea of adding to it. so why would I feel like I want to? is this feeling addicting?

But then I found out she fucked my best friend and my other friend and promptly had another break down and carved 6 more into my forearm. Life was shit for 2 months after. I didn’t feel anything, didn’t interact normally with anyone and generally isolated myself. It was largely like that for much of the year after the first break down too. I was a shell of myself. A once popular kid reduced to nothing. 

However, I’ve now moved out of my hometown. I have no girlfriend, no attachments, no nothing except a passion for ENVS and Ecology and I longboard and snowboard when I feel tempted to cut. I feel I am starting a new and better life and it’s largely Bc I haven’t been cutting myself recently. I hope once they fade I can get tattoos and try to forget this aspect of my life. I hope everyone going through it reads this and finds hope. 

Ik it’s still early but it feels different this time. Last time I knew I would do it again the next winter but this time I won’t go home and will stay out west and I really want to beat this addiction. My best advice to y’all is to try new shit and expeirences and find a passion. Don’t go back to old stuff like exes or people you once hated. Find new people and find something you love and put your all into it. 

I hope that helps and I would love to talk to anyone if my phone allows it. It’s broken lol",1678989841.0

They helped me look, they didn't have any at the stores with self checkout, other ones we had to be ID'ed. But they were so helpful for looking for one.

Then after college, I asked my older brother for his spare hobby knife set. Using the art project excuse and he said yeah no problem u can keep it. I was like, excited at first?

It cuts stupidly easy, I'd used a pencil sharpener blade for a long time. With no pressure, the knife can cut to the same depth I had to press a bit on with the sharpener blade. I was relieved that I had this, and sorta got really light because I fucking got a knife to use.

Though I ended up crying before even using it because I saw myself in my bedroom mirror, ecstatic over getting a proper hobby knife with several different blade ends. My friend supportively helped me in search of one earlier thinking it was for art. my brother GAVE me the current one I'm using now thinking it was for art.

I'm scared I've gotten to this point. It feels like a new low, I have a bandana tied around my upper arm because I've ended up cutting in that way more obvious spot merely because my upper thighs are all covered and still healing. I'm disgusted by myself, I'm repulsed that I ended up throwing out my whole 'limited' cutting area because I fucking kept going too much and too little time. Didn't wait a few weeks for proper healing, and just went to my arm. 

upper inner arm, at least.

I started self harming at 12, with scratching, hitting or scissors. The cutting I think was at 14/15? always sparingly. maybe every few months. Now I'm 17 and it's weekly or monthly. I can't wrap my head around the concept that I've realised in a few more years, I could probably cut to a point of hospitalisation. I've actively begun to think while cutting, would I be able to cut deep enough to that extent if I tried? could I bring myself to do that?",1678955280.0

Her reasoning is that she wants to see how much there is - which i don’t think is THAT important at this point…

EDIT: Thank you everyone for being so kind. Everyone here is valid, and I mean no disrespect with this vent. It’s how I felt about myself at that current time, not about anyone else. You deserve love and support no matter what. 
.


I feel so inferior. 

My sc*rs aren’t even “real” ones. They’re flat or indented and barely have any color to them. Plus, they disappear so quickly and easily and it makes me feel like it’s not even “real” sh. 

I know a lot of us have posted about this, and I do apologize, but I really need to get this off my chest. I was taught by an ex roommate that “real sh is permanent” and my sc*rs “weren’t even that bad or real”. Once, I had given up on trying to get better, and had been actively trying to get the “real results”. But I know it’ll never happen. Besides, the more I push it the more it becomes difficult to quit. 

I feel so selfish for wanting permanent ones, yet at the same time, it’s been ingrained in my mind by someone else that I’m an imposter. The more I think about it the more guilty I feel for not “punishing myself enough”. 

I question my own reality and what I’ve been through, and whether I’m just dramatic or not. And the last few days have been really difficult. 

It’s as if anything that happened to me to cause the urges in the first place was all my fault and I am just pathetic. 

I had a dream twice that it got super bad, and I don’t know how to feel about it. Could it be related to how I feel? I don’t know. It’s just tiring.

572,I just fucked up hardcore,8,11sh5vl,selfharm,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/comments/11sh5vl/i_just_fucked_up_hardcore/,1,"TW: drug use, talk of wound

So I've got bipolar disorder, and for the past 8 weeks I've been in a severe depressive episode. It's one of the worst depressive episodes I have EVER had. I was diagnosed at 13 (but started showing symptoms around 10yo), and I'm now 37. I've been self harming regularly, by cutting, by starving myself, and by taking loads of illicit drugs. I'm also married to an amazing man who is trying so fucking hard to support me.

So on Monday I took a shit load of meth, and just let myself forget about how fucked everything is. I stayed awake until 5am yesterday. I managed to sleep for 2hrs, before having to get up and deal with a real estate agent, then go to a drs appt. After my drs appt I decided to spend the last of my money (which was supposed to be for groceries. Luckily this will force me to fast until tomorrow at the earliest) on buying some more meth, because when I'm high, my brain shuts the fuck up. So I got high again.  Because I was so exhausted, I spent the whole night laying in bed on the internet. At around 2am hubby came to bed, and went to sleep. By 8am the meth had worn off, and the depression came back with a vengeance. I spent 2 hours listening to my brain scream at me that I needed to cut. I tried to resist, but looking back I didn't want to resist, I wanted to cut. Cos if I was seriously wanting to resist I would have woken up hubby who was laying next to me. At 10am I gave in. I did a couple of deep styros on my forearm, which is just the depth I like. Then I decided I wanted to cut my thigh, so I did. But I fucked up. I cut WAY TOO DEEP. I hit beans. And not just a little bit of beans, this was a bean fiesta.

And I began to panic. I jumped up out of bed, trying to hold the wound closed so I didn't bleed all over the bed, and in the process I woke hubby up. Now he has self harmed in the past, so he doesn't judge me, but when he saw what I had done he freaked out. He started asking me why I didn't wake him up, and I couldn't give him a good reason. He immediately got the first aid kit, and began cleaning it up. Which was basically 45 minutes of trying to stop the blood. Then we put some steri strips and a dressing on it. 

Now we are sitting down watching tv, and I can just feel how upset he is that I didn't wake him up and see if he could help me, instead I cut really badly. He must feel like he is useless. I hate myself for making him feel this way. I know that if I had woken him up, and if we weren't able to stop the urge, he would have understood, and I would have still been able to cut. But instead I shut him out.",1678932845.0

She's 14, my grandparents adopted her when she was 3, and we took over her care when they passed.

I've become her favourite. This is not just me saying it, it's everyone. My dad says she looks at me completely different compared to everyone else. She was nervous when she was first adopted, and I was the first person allowed to touch her ears, the first person she barked at to sit on the floor with her. She acts completely differently to me compared to everyone else.
(Tw suicide here, nothing graphic)

She's the only reason I didn't go through with my attempt last year.

We had just had another dog put down, I had failed a medical for a job and it was just the last thing that ticked me over. I had a plan, stayed up all night to leave early in the morning. I went downstairs into the living room to leave my letters, and she came up to me headbutting me for strokes. I sat on the floor with her, she looked up at me everytime I stopped stroking her. It was then I released I couldn't leave her. So I made a deal with myself, I wouldn't go through with the plan until after she goes.

I think part of me was hoping things would get better then, that it'll be a couple of years before she started suffering.

Well, now she's going to be gone this time tomorrow, I was talking to my counsellor just last week about how I am dreading her going because shes the only thing I have in life that I feel like needs me. Obviously my counsellor was concerned, she said it is something we are going to have to work through.

Welp, we're gonna be working through it during my appointment tomorrow, have a feeling she's gonna be a lot more concerned about my safety now.

And we both have our own mental problems. I know she has some kind of emotional things going on but sometimes shes makes me want to die. The big problem is that shes my favourite person. I know the concept of a favourite person is somthing a person with bpd or bd (i cant remember what one) has, and im not trying to self diagnose but im so obsessed with her. I always want to be around her and talk to her and make her happy even if it hurts me or others. But recently she and i kinda had an argument. I have autism and adhd so im extremely impulsive and one night i was realy tired and  impulsive and i thought that her being my favourite person was a crush so i messaged her and said “her this is one of “op”s friends and they like you. After that i fell asleep. She obviously was confused and said “uh k” and the next day i read over it and apologised alot. Ill copy what i said from the convo so you know what happend. What i say will be said like “this” and what she said will be said like :this: 

“Hey mercy i just wanted to say that the person who messaged you that was me i wanted to know your reaction and i did it with some others too. Im sorry idk why i did it i was tired and impulsive im realy sorry if i made you uncomfortable” 

:I thought it was you bro, it was obvious but it’s okay:

“Im so sorry idk why i did it ive been wondering what your reaction to that kind of thing would be for a while i felt like i played with your feelings im so sorry i hope this doesn’t ruin anything”

: What? I don’t like you, you haven’t done anything? :

After that i said sorry a bunch of times and she stoped responding. A day later i asked her if everything was ok and she said i made her feel awkward. I felt terrible and when i went to school for the whole week she ignored me. I thought she hated me and relapsed so many times thinking she hated me. I tried to kms so many times cause i couldn’t live without her. It went on for about two weeks and i talked to a bunch of my other friends about it and they all said she was being toxic and rude but to me this was normal as she usually ignores me if i do something wrong. But today she waved at me in class and sat next to me on the bus. That was the most communication i had done with her for what felt like months. I got so exited and started stimming from excitement a-lot and people started staring. Then on the bus ride home i sat on a two person seat and tat one the window side. The bus was really full and she asked if she could sit next to me. The problem is that i love her so much and practically cant live without her but the other problem is that she made me relapse.

The first cuts have probably been the closest thing to an orgasm I had in the last five months or so. 

I thought I'd feel pretty bad after doing it, cuz last time I felt like shit (guilty/stupid/..), but actually this time I felt kinda ..nothing? Like, I don't care anymore. Ofc part of me it's still ashamed of doing it, especially at my age, but also I can't really see it as a negative thing anymore. It's just another way of trying to get by with life.

I do it so much more often now, at first I could barely go a month but now it's everyday. I told myself to wait just 6 days until I get back home (im at my parents house) but I couldn't. I feel so pathetic and like im not even in control of myself. 

I don't usually go to Reddit to solve my problems but therapy doesn't help me, I tried meds and they didn't help either, I can't talk to my mom because last time I told her I wanted to hurt myself she said I was guilt tripping her and I can't tell my dad because he thinks I stopped 5 years ago.

I have many undiagnosed mental issues, and many of the symptoms from those are my reasons for cutting, scratching and biting. 
One of those symptoms is... I do not believe we live in reality. 

So, when I first started college in 2017, a philosophy teacher told the class about the theory of dualism, and his example was ""triangles"". In the realm of the soul, we all know the concept of a triangle, but in the physical world it cannot exist because once you draw a triangle, it is not the concept anymore, but a specific one.
Long story short, I started drawing triangles on the hand of my SH dedicated arm and it helped me feel grounded in this ""physical world"".

Last night, I cut a triangle into my arm. 
I had been trying to quit for a while, that was my longer streak, 2 weeks I believe. I feel so ashamed of myself. 
I'm scared of myself and don't want to hurt my body but my obsession with triangles bled into my baby cut syndrome.
My boyfriend doesn't know I SH and told me explicitly he never wants me to do it. 
I don't know what to do and I don't know who to tell so...

I don’t want any sympathy just need to get this out because I feel like there’s no one I can tell this to. Everyone around me sees me as this happy person who loves herself and sees the best in anything. I’ve never so much as even cried to anyone. I’ve been so good at faking this for so long I feel like if I tell someone they wouldn’t take me seriously.

Im writing this post sh. I feel really stupid that I relapsed but today I just feel like shit and I don’t know why. I haven’t done anything like this for years. I really thought I was doing better. I’m diagnosed with adhd, GAD, and my bulimia has recently become anorexia.

Day after day I’m losing any motivation to do anything and I feel more useless than I’ve ever been. I go to a really good university that is the best school for my major. I used to be a straight A student. I used to be president of clubs and played sports. This was in high school. Now I almost never leave my house. I can’t get myself to do anything I don’t want to do, and all my friends have just been saying “you just need to do your work”, and I can’t explain why but I just can’t. I can’t focus or concentrate on anything and I hate myself for it. 

I think I want my friends and housemates to reach out and ask me if Im ok. No one has but I can’t blame them because I never talk about my real feelings. Recently I’ve been starting to think they don’t like me either. I know this isn’t really true but it’s a thought that’s constantly in my head. I feel like I used to be a lot closer to my friends but recently I feel like they’ve been excluding me from things. They go out to eat, study, shop, and party without me. All of them planned different trips and didn’t invite me. I know this is all in my head and that they love me but I just can’t shake off these negative feelings.

I don’t want to tell this to my family too. Ik my brother would tell my parents and this would break their hearts. They love me so much and I feel like I’m the worst child. I’m constantly falling short of their expectations but they always tell me how much they love me. I remember the look on their faces when I told them that I’d been purging and I never want to see that face again. They were doing their best to not cry but they just said they loved me and would help me get better.

I do have a therapist, but tbh I would never tell her this stuff. I’m really scared she would send me to a facility. I just want to finish undergrad before I commit to any serious professional help. I know I need it asap, but I can’t throw away my education. 

Anyways thanks for listening if anyone does, just writing this out made me feel better. I’m in a very safe and loving environment. I’m not a threat to anyone or a serious threat to myself I promise I  will get help before it’s too late. Just needed to vent.",1678939755.0

my college helped me apply for independent living and the place was wonderful. the staff were nice in the interview and the tour enticed me. it was close to college and everyone had told me i would definitely be accepted. i had to be open and honest about my mental health issues and they called the next day saying they won’t be able to give me a place due to my self harm. i self harmed multiple times after that and it’s the deepest i ever cut. i really can’t take it anymore. i feel hopeless and feel like i’ll never be able to lead a normal life. i got my hopes set up for a fresh start, and it all came crashing down in an instant.",1678905216.0

1 is henna but i'm kinda on the edge about this because i feel like it might stain them long term?? so i'm unsure if it's a good idea 

2 is those skirt wrap things but lowkey i feel like it would be weird asf to swim like with it on yk since they're meant to be just cover ups or smth

I made a post a week ago about overdosing on 3000mg of wellbutrin. After I took the last of the pills I could tell that something was wrong which is to be expected with that much of a powerful drug. I ended up calling 911 and going to the ER after I told the paramedics how much I took, I'll be completely honest..the only thing I remember upon arriving there was lying down in one of the beds, having my heartrate spike to 135 and get really nauseous. Safe to say after taking the drug test I was given medication to prevent seizures and was sedated almost immediately. I woke up the next day in the ICU after being given two drips that were solely about Keeping me sedated so I wouldn't go into shock with my condition, I was told by almost every nurse I talked to that I was lucky to have made it. I was in a very critical condition and if I took any more than I did or waiting any longer before calling 911 I probably wouldn't be here right now typing this. After all that I spent 4 days in an inpatient unit in the same hospital which was given due to the severity of why I was at the hospital in the first place. All in all I almost lost my life and that was very frightening to wake up to, it's given me a different perspective on life and I'm hoping I can maintain my sobriety regarding substance abuse.",1678848517.0

I just feel like I don't take my self-harm seriously(?), I've been clean from cutting for around a month, yet feel like I could relapse at almost any moment. And back when I did cut (more often), the cuts weren't even that deep, just enough so I would start to bleed and feel the pain. The scars aren't too visible, if you look closely you can see where they were. I just feel like I wasn't even trying to inflict any pain, just doing it so I could feel something. But I knew that I did it because I felt like I deserved it.

But cutting isn't the only way I harm myself, I usually starve myself (quite often), mostly because I don't like myself as I am & I know I deserve it. It's become a habit, I usually skip breakfast and lunch and try to ignore the hunger until dinner, because I feel like I don't deserve it and that I would waste the meals. 

And whenever I do something wrong, whether it be a math question or I say something slightly mean, it's a slap/punch in the face to remind myself not to make another mistake. It has also become a habit, I've done it so frequently it's starting to annoy classmates, teammates and other people around me. But they don't really try to help, they just get angry at me for doing it and tell me to stop and never do it again. If only it was that easy.

She has non-stop exams from next week to mid-June, facing two years of content. Her other best friends left her, saying that they felt obligated to love her, and that she was too negative and they couldn’t take it anymore. Her crush hasn’t been treating her well a week ago, though now her crush is treating her better too. She also has recurring headaches and anxiety attacks, and constantly felt that she isn’t enough, ugly, and a burden to everyone, though everyone told her she isn’t. She started self-harming around two weeks ago, I think. Now she has 23 cuts on her arm.

I worry about her so much, and I care about her so much. She isn’t taking care of her wounds, nor is she disinfecting her blade, which is old and rusty. So I bought plasters, alcohol wipes, and new blades (because I know she won’t stop self-harming, though I keep comforting her and told her she can come to me for anything and tell me anything, and she does, but she still does it). I tried to make up for every other best friend that she lost, I spent time with her whenever she wanted and whenever I could. I am better at studying so I taught her anything she didn’t know and made her study resources. She said she does it to cope, and to de-stress, to calm herself down, and to regain a sense of control.

Every single time she does it, I feel like she has cut my heart as well. This has been affecting me a lot as well, and goddamn it I just worry about her so much and I want her to stop hurting herself. What can I do?",1678871174.0

I want to start creating more openness to talking about self harm, not at all in a glorifying way but in a way that might be easier for people who do sh can find support, feel heard, and maybe even help to learn how to stop one day if that's the goal. 

I have been self harming since 10, cutting since 12 but am now 25, had a 3 year break from 18-21 and now I'm coming up on a year planning to stay clean. However I have tried researching self harm as I always felt I wasn't ""like everyone else"" until I found reddit forums where I realized there are so many different kinds of self harmers out there, but then why isn't there more discussion on it? 

I would love some book recommendations if anyone has some, but how would you all feel about a social media page dedicated to approaching self harm more openly, again not going to glorify or share pictures etc, but rather to investigate and help others like myself to self reflect? I just don't see any representation like there is for other addictions and figured if i knew people were interested, I'd happily start something where we can all work together to grow and heal ♡ 

My idea is to talk about my experiences openly, which will be a little scary, but then also have open discussions (maybe anon calling in or email readings) with individuals who are also wanting to learn, heal, and grow together.

I'd be happy to hear any thoughts, opinions, or anything else on this :)

683,I had to show my teacher.,35,11r989x,selfharm,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/comments/11r989x/i_had_to_show_my_teacher/,5,"It was humiliating having to strip in front of the doctor the first time I attempted and everyone found out about my self harm. There was only a thin curtain hiding my body from everybody else in the A&E waiting room. It was humiliating again to be told they were only scratches. I know it's medical terms and stuff. But being told ""Oh they're not so bad, they're only scratches"" isn't really something I needed to hear right then. 

Having my sister and mum gape at me was worse than the looks of the doctors. I mean the doctors see people like that all the time. But that was a few months ago now. I relapsed last night, tried to get bandages because some of them were gaping more than I was used to. Kept on reopening. So I asked my mum if she could get bandages. I did everything we agreed on when I was clean last time. In case of relapse I take her aside, away from everyone else. She's supposed to respond calmly to me because if she doesn't it makes me feel really bad and like she doesn't actually care. She's not supposed to force me to show her, and she can't, under any circumstances let my little brothers and sisters know, or let them see. 

But I was stupid. We made those rules in front of someone, which was the only reason she'd agreed to hear me out. She broke every single one of those rules. Yelled at me for deciding to do that again and betraying her trust. Tried to yank my sleeves up and all that. She tried again today. But I ran away from her and refused, no matter how much she yelled. So she called my school. They all know now. They know. 

It feels so humiliating. They were all giving me funny looks when I arrived today. I was confused. A teacher pointed out a burn on my hand and asked me if it still hurt. I shrugged it off. Until another teacher took me into her office. I assumed it was probably about my attendance. (I skipped yesterday because I couldn't leave my bed) She told me my mum had phoned my school and that she said I'd been cutting myself last night. 

And it was like my heart stopped. I tried to shake it off. Pretend like it wasn't true. But this teacher knew about my suicide attempt and stuff. So she could tell I was lying. I spent  over 40 minutes in her office. She tried to be nice about it. I like her, she is nice. But I didn't want to show her. She told me she couldn't let me leave until I showed her. I tried to protest. She said they could be infected, and I countered with the fact I'm trained in first aid and I know what I'm doing. She told me they could be too deep and I assured her they were not. She asked how many? Big or little?
 
It was all so overwhelming. She started to believe my original lie. Told me it was okay if I lied to my mum about hurting myself to maybe scare her, or if I did do it and there was only a few and they weren't deep. She said it was okay if they were bad too. She just needed to see. I had to close my eyes when I finally showed her to stop myself from crying. I showed her only my best wrist. I refused to show her any further up my arm where the deeper ones are. She asked about my legs and I lied again. Said there weren't any, because that's where the worst scars are. Ones I don't ever want anybody to see. 

I tried my best not to cry. She said they weren't that deep so it was okay. I must of pulled a face or something, or she must of realised her wording and quickly backtracked to not hurt my feelings. She asked me if they hurt and I just shook my head. They do a little. But they're not from last night. They're two days old, so they don't hurt as much anymore. I hated showing her more than anything. It took everything in me not to cry. She told me I did the right thing and gave me a sticker for my troubles. It almost felt like I went to the dentist and got  all of  my teeth ripped out with no anesthetic and was given a sticker in return.

But I love stickers. She gave me a hug and sent me to class. I couldn't really concentrate for the rest of the day. And my mum was still mad with me when I got home. She's told my whole family too. I hate having everyone know. I hate letting people see. But now they all know. Everyone knows I've relapsed again. I could see the disgust in the look one of my relatives gave me when I got home today. It hurts. But I guess I'll live. I just hate having people know.",1678807779.0

I feel the pain in my body, like physically; I feel like non one will ever love me as much as I love them; there is kinda multiple of my thoughts, yk like a sweet compassionate person who is great and i (hope)/think is the real me and then there's these other thoughts at the same time who is ugly and rude and so angry and just wants to hit someone or kms; I have like, imagionationships with ppl (lol what is that word) if u get what I mean; really loud in my head, like omg i have and assignment...i can't move my body im gonna sleep all day...and hopefully die...vibing to hamilton soundtrack in my head...throw the cup at her...hit smth...be kind you're a good person; GUILT GUILT GUILT; su!cide; acting normal; lying...!

I used to do it when I was younger, I don't have much 'to show' for it over my body, but I found the scratching hurt more than deep cuts, so that is what I did when I was bad. 

I recently have a life event which has left me rock bottom, unable to leave the house, and always in pain. If I'm being honest, I want to hurt myself. I need something, it's the draw of taking control, maybe of the only thing in my life I can currently take control over. 

I have held off doing it for so so long to protect my partner, not to trigger her or leave her feeling jealous of the fact I had. 

We had a big blow up the other day, and I did it, and now there is nothing else I can think of. It is all I want to do and it has control over me. 

I spend a lot of time on my own, me and my partner because of COVID became very isolated, and it was just us, then I got long COVID, and been trying to sort a wheelchair so I can leave the house, it's been months.

My partner now has a new group of friends, and is spending a lot of time socialising with people, whilst I am stuck at home. I feel jealous, I feel like I did when I was 13/14 again, like no one wants to spend time with me, even that my partner would rather be anywhere but with me, because when she is here she is sad, but when she is with other people she is happy. She tells me every day multiple times not to worry, but it seems so obvious that I should.

Sorry for the ramble, is it selfish of me, to do something I want to do to myself, when that is what I am telling my partner nearly every day to do, even though it hurts me? 

I dunno I am just so alone, I enjoy nothing anymore, and all I want to do is just stop existing so maybe the people around me will be happier. Because all it feels like is they deal with me because I'm here, but would be equally as happy if I wasn't. 

I wish anyone could help, but they can't or won't, and this is what life will be,

But i’m not close with them like that , i lost my bestfriend too so i’m left with nothing. Even though i have my phone back.. i have no social medias as of tiktok and instagram , i can’t go out , can’t hang with my friends , and i can’t go nowhereee.

So I took her aside and I quietly asked her if she could buy me bandages like she did for my sister when my sister used to self harm. 

And she immediately shouted ""why have you done it again?"" And my little brother and sister ran in to investigate the yelling. I tried to play it off, as just a question. She started proper yelling at me. For betraying her trust, and that it was all my fault because even though I said I wouldn't do it again I chose to cut myself again. I guestured to the kids and tried to get her to shut up. But she didnt. It only made her madder. She shouted it so loud that my little siblings got involved. They yelled at me too. Telling me it was all my fault. They didn't know what was my fault. Just that it was, like everything else. 

They're mad at me too. It hurts. I didnt mean to make everyone mad. It took everything in me to keep my tears in and now they won't stop. 

She was trying to pull my sleeves up and force me to show her again, and my baby brother and sister were standing there, watching. They would of seen. I don't like her seeing either. My dad used to hurt himself and make me watch and clean them for him when I was younger. It makes me feel like I'm becoming like him when people see them and I hate it. It makes me remember things I don't want to. I've explained it to her and she said it's stupid and she's my mother and I have to show her. 

I pulled away and she was yelling so hard the whole house, probably the whole street could here. ""You cut yourself again, how dare you!"" ""You betrayed my trust!"" ""When did you do this!?"" And it hurts. She's really mad with me. She won't stop yelling at me about everything, and when i try to explain she ignores me. When my mum gets mad at you she takes it out on you in every way possible. And now I'm struggling not to relapse again. 

I've sat her down before and explained it all to her to the best of my ability, countless times. Begged her not to shout, just to listen, to care. But she doesn't. She doesn't care about my feelings. None of them do. 

She can probably hear me crying right now and I hate it. I said I'm sorry. And now everyone knows I've relapsed again. She's going to text my whole family about it again, like she does every time. I only wanted some bandages. I was trying to be good and do the right thing. Why does it always blow up in my face? It really hurts this time. I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

I'm currently 18. I'm still looking for methods to stop this. I'm doing it less often now that I'm in a relationship.My scars are often inflamed and hyperpigmented (dark brown to almost black) for upwards of 20 months. My skin is a medium olive tone, so I'm aware the hyperpigmentation would be rather dark.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**THE PROBLEM:**I noticed since I've cut through that white layer of skin (*my apologies, I don't know the actual term for it*) that although I'm not squirting blood across the room, there are pools of it drenching my blankets. I'm gradually losing hand-eye-coordination as well, my fingers can barely grip things fully, and I can't draw the way I used to. My hands and arms shake and I feel stinging pain shooting up my arm when I reach out or try to use my arms' full range of motion.

I'm afraid to tell my doctor since it'd be humiliating if she made the assumption I didn't damage my nerves and that I'm just weak from malnourishment. I know what malnourishment feels like and it's certainly not this.

There are approximately \~170 scars between both of my arms, I'm not sure if it's the frequency at which I've done it or the depth of the cuts, but something is wrong with my arms and I'm so, so scared.",1678740096.0

i was rly angry and i never do this, but without thinking that much, i pressed really hard on the blade (new raz0r bl4de) and i almost started panicking over how deep it was. it didnt reach beans, it didnt bleed that much, but it’s depth was like 5mm. my usual is depth is 1-2mm and they heal very quick, but this one bled for 10+ minutes until i went downstairs to get band-aids.

immediately i got this swish of feeling of ’i need to stop’. i probably wont but the fact that its deep for me and barely hurt makes it all feel scary, like if i accidentally someday… fuck up?

im thinking if getting rid of my sharpest bl4des. the fact theyre so sharp scares me. whenever i get an urge to sh, i dont rly want to do it with sharp ones, dull would be better bc it wouldnt be that deep(i dont go deep with dull ones, pain)

I tried asking her from 2022 from nowdays and she just keep forgetting and doesn't book one for me, just for my sister.
I know she doesn't really care about how i feel, she just cares when she feels guilty because i show my anger, stress etc, but damn I'm asking for so long. I never really showed or expressed my honest feelings because she makes me feel guilty for them
I live in Brazil so it's literally free. It takes a while to book one but there would already be one available if she tried

I tried asking her for a reeealy long time, talking to the school so they can call her to help booking an appointment with some trustworthy professionals, i even tried booking one by myself (I'm a minor so it obviously didn't work)
She always tells me she is going to book one but she never does. She did one time but on the first appointment she had to talk with the psychologist, she didn't go because she forgot and it was cancelled 
This makes me feel kinda bad because she always does everything for my sister and she doesn't even have to ask for it, and my sister is going to be 21y very soon
There's a whole story about my sister and why she always have all the attention etc, but i hate talking about that because it makes me feel like a clown for always helping and being forgotten and i prefer not remembering all of that stuff

The 1 times i tried opening up with her she just kept saying how her life was hard and she didn't do/needed all that stuff and she kept threatening to beat me up if i sh again. She did beat me some times when i was little and sometimes recently (on the last 5 years), but it never really was that bad and i deserved it, but this time she said she would beat me up untill i had to go to the hospital and then be hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital like my sister
My sister used to beat me up when i was little and she did a whole lot of bad things that mostly i had to deal with the consequences, and yet she has all of the good things

I know my sister NEEDS all that attention, patience and good stuff (she was bpd), but that doesn't mean i don't need any
My family are all so patient with her but when it comes to me they call me a fucking bitch, demon and worthless because i defended my mom when my sister was beating her up (i grabbed a knife and pushed her away from my mom, but i didn't hurt her). I was the only one who consoled, hugged, helped her and my sister, gave her meds when she snapped etc, and still she doesn't care enough
Yk, I've always been the responsible, the one who takes the first step and the mentally strong one, but i want help to! I'm not asking her to take away attention from my sister, I'm just asking for f_cking help

I could keep talking about this forever, telling every single detail and everything that bothers me about that situation, but i think you got the idea. And no I'm not all that good, i did bad things too but not that bad, the baddest thing I've done is threaten my sister with a knife trying scare her away from my mom. I think I'm a good person in general
I don't like to vent, and normally i can handle things on my on, but I'm scared of being beaten up, so i want a way to tell her that doesn't make her thing that i'm mentally ill, suicidal etc
Also she isn't the type of mom that gets mad and screams on your face, she's calm and makes you feel guilty because you feel a little sad, she makes the situation be about her, but she doesn't notices it and nobody cares to tell her that when I'm the one she's doing all that stuff with

I don't have any trauma or mental illness and i don't want to be diagnosed, honestly even if i had something i wouldn't want to know. Ive been through some stuff but they're nothing I can't handle
I'm a healthy and normal person, i just want some support, everyone needs support 
I didn't seek help before because i had a bad experiences with my previous psychologyst, but now I've made up my mind

I’ve struggled really badly with cutting again after I was clean for awhile, and theres a lot of guilt and shame that comes with it. SH is not at all healthy, and I am in no way encouraging it, but it is very valid to feel the need to SH, no matter the reason. Your in pain, and when your hurt emotionally and your used to coping by hurting yourself physically, slip ups are likely to happen. Don’t be too hard on yourself. Messing up and SH again might seem like a huge deal, but give yourself a break and just try and get better from there. Loving yourself and not being too hard on yourself will help you a lot. Instead of thinking about your SH as how many days you were clean before your relapse, try and think of it as apart your journey to being happy. It can get rough sometimes, but keep fighting and focusing on improving little by little and loving yourself until you can say that your living a happy life, and you love yourself. Because even though I dont know you personally, If your SH I know your hurting and probably deserve a lot better, even if you don’t believe it yet. You deserve to be happy, the world will put you through so much, keep fighting and show the world your stronger then the pain it’ll show you.

I recently began cutting again on my arms after a long period of being clean.

He was respectful and kind, but I am concerned he could tell that something was wrong.

My questions are: To what extent are massage therapists in the State of Illinois required to report suspected self-injury? What does this process look like?

Alternatively, I am comfortable enough with my massage therapists that I am considering just having a frank conversation, that I am engaging in self harm and am also in mental health treatment. To reduce risk of exposure, my arm is wrapped in gauze with a self-adhesive bandage wrap on top. 

I would like to continue massage therapy, but I am concerned I may be exposing my massage therapists to secondary trauma in witnessing my self injury.

919,I relapsed after less than 6 months.,3,11ppt5d,selfharm,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/comments/11ppt5d/i_relapsed_after_less_than_6_months/,2,"I first started self harming back in late March of 2022, and that would continue for the next 6 months. That was until September when I cut my left forearm and I accidentally cut it too deep and I started bleeding severely. I was rushed to the hospital to get it stitched up, and afterwards I was sent to a mental clinic. I was supposed to be there for a week but I was lucky enough to get released after only 2 days.

Since then, I’ve been free from self harm for about 5 and a half months. I was still severely depressed during that time and I had many urges to start self harming again, but I tried my best to resist in fear of being sent back to that mental clinic. However, today I just couldn’t resist anymore.

I couldn’t use scissors since my parents won’t let me have those anymore, so instead I unscrewed the blade from a pencil sharpener and started making cuts on my shoulders and chest. As much as I hate myself for saying this, I admit that I felt proud and nostalgic for having done this.

The burning sensation and bleeding made me feel relieved for a few reasons. 1: It distracts me from the mental and emotional pain. 2: It gave me a sense of endurance. 3: the release of adrenaline.

I’m most likely going to continue self harming from now on, although I’m obviously going to be more careful not to repeat that same incident that happened before.

Lastly, I ask nicely not to try to encourage me to stop self harming. Although I took a 5 month break from doing it, my mind and body are still used to the feeling of self harm and it’s become one of my 3 main coping mechanisms. As bizarre as it may sound, I just don’t see why I shouldn’t be allowed to self harm. 

I understand that it’s a very sensitive action to take and I’m not glorifying it or encouraging it to others, but for me personally, it just helps to distract me from my severe emotional pain caused by depression and loneliness.",1678655057.0

I don’t do this for attention, I do it because I suffer with severe  bouts of depression and I have for years. I try not to do it, and I realise that it is a very unhealthy coping strategy, and that it understandably really upsets my mum. She cares a lot about me, and I love her more than anyone in the world. But sometimes my mental health problems just get too much for a few seconds, and I just fall into cutting myself. I feel very guilty about it. 

My mum and I recently had a big fight about it, and she says that it is completely insensitive, selfish, and irresponsible to go to work with these self harm scars visible. I really understand where she’s coming from, and I would absolutely hate it if someone were to see them and become upset while I’m trying to serve them (I work as a cashier). We have to wear a T-Shirt as a uniform, but are permitted to wear a long sleeve shirt under it if we want. She says that I simply can’t go to work with my scars showing, and that she won’t let me go into work without a long sleeve shirt.

I can’t help but feel that she is making me feel guilty about something I already struggle to feel comfortable about, and that she is shaming me for the very real pain my mental health causes me. I also feel that I would hate to upset people with my scars, and would prefer to cover them up (as I have meticulously in the past), but the fact is that it is extremely hot where I live, and it simply isn’t functional to wear two layers of clothing all day.

So… am I the asshole? Should I just suck it up and do the right thing, and wear a long sleeve shirt even though it causes me great discomfort from the heat, because I am responsible for the mistakes I’ve made, and I need to be extremely careful for how my scars might effect others? Or is my mum being hurtful and unsupportive?

For me, self harm used to be a very common occurrence. However through the years my usage of it has decreased, and I don’t do it as frequently as before. I also don’t cut as deeply or as dangerously - I use a mechanical pencil’s tip and the most it does is rip or graze into the skin like a bush branch would.

And since I know that for me, self harm isn’t something I want to do to danger myself, my methods are not as “physically” harmful to me as others. I’m sure that I know how to control it, because I also know that that is the only form of self harm I use that will make me feel better. So added together the low frequency of me actually doing self harm, with the fact that I don’t cut as deep or as dangerous, leads me to the question - why should I stop?

I don’t have any scars, only a few trails as the wounds heal, and it’s not a thing that consumes my daily life, only a stress reliever in certain situations. But still, people close to me tell me that I should quit it entirely. And while a part of me does want to quit, the other part of me is confused as to why I should - isn’t my method of self harm bringing me more benefit over drawbacks?

This is why I’m asking this - to seek advice or point out somethings that I may have missed so that I can fully be sure on the fact that I want to start quitting not for others, but for just myself.",1678647102.0

and I’m mad that I used up the last wipe of the wipe packet that I’ve been using to clean up the blood so I have to make up an excuse to go to the store so I can steal / get some more before I can SH again, 

but honestly I’m half wondering if it’s even worth cleaning the stupid fucking cat scratches up and just letting the blood dry because I fucking forgot to throw the wipe coated with my blood away so my mother’s friend asked me this morning “why were you bleeding?!” and I fucking blamed it on my dog and they definitely didn’t believe me so I’m just hoping that they couldn’t care less to mention it to anyone because nobody knows I am SHing

and I had a grand total of not even 2 hours of sleep last night but I gotta stay up and do a tedious task every 30 minutes or so for who knows how long and everyone has been tense as fuck this entire fucking weekend and just I simultaneously feel nothing and AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

okay thank you for reading my delusions too kind",1678640657.0
