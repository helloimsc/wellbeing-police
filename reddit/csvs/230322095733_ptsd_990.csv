6,"Reached Out to 60 Therapists, Only got on Waitlist for 5! Desperately Need Help - PTSD Memories Coming Back and Can't Sleep",2,11xw5ap,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11xw5ap/reached_out_to_60_therapists_only_got_on_waitlist/,2,"Hey all. As the title says, I have my repressed PTSD memories hitting me HARD. Based on research, I know the memories are finally coming to my consciousness because it's time to remember the abuse/trauma and process them. But the trauma/abuse is so disgusting and feels so real, I really need help. I can't sleep. I reached out to 60 therapists covered by my health insurance and sliding scale, but only got on waitlist for 5! Others haven't contacted back and/or are too full! So I'm on Reddit to seek insights (can't google the trigger. Googling the trigger triggers me!) while I wait to be seen (and contact more therapists with sliding scale)

Here's a really brief list of what I know:

1. During baby to toddlerhood, my parents gave me away to random people to take care of me (random as in parents knew nothing about them except for surface-level things like their name, etc. Long story, not necessary)
2. I was abused terribly. Landed in the hospital, almost dead, couldn't walk for almost 2 full years. Chronic lower back pain for the last 30 years. Found out the abuse may have injured my lower spine? 100% abuse - government's child services came to investigate my parents (they didn't know I had a babysitter). Sex is disgusting to me and pains me. Certain body parts hurt like hell during sex (not the genitals). I hate intimacy, not just sex
3. Certain figures trigger me - 1 of my professors did. This VERY particular trigger (caused my panic attacks during lecture) helped me figure out that the abuser was either a politician, an elitist, or someone up top.

This one is what I'm going through now b/c the memories came back last week:

When I was a baby and/or toddler, my abuser had HUGE tarantulas (I think that's what they're called but like really big, thick, brown spiders) crawl ALL OVER ME. On my face. Into my mouth. Into my vagina. Clawing my kit. (I'm dying while writing this.) I can feel ALL of it over and over. It's like I can't stop feeling and remembering the memory 

I know I need to process but I can't do it alone. I literally cannot stop panicking. Just writing this now, I am reliving the moment of the tarantulas crawling all over me. This explains why I hate sex, why I hate intimacy, why I hate being touched, etc

Every time I turn off the lights at night and touch the bed, the memories of the tarantula all over me (especially the genital area) keeps coming back. I can't sleep. I really can't sleep. More memories want to come out but I'm trying my best to suppress them until I can get help 

So my questions to everyone:

1. Anyone knows what this tarantula experience could be?. My friend theorized it could be a ritual the abuser did. I wish I could Google this but I'm worried an image of a tarantula will pop up and then I'll freak out 
2. How can I suppress these memories so I can sleep? I'm losing my functionality from lack of sleep, and I need to be able to work. I just need to get by maybe 1-2 more weeks until I see a therapist, or maybe even longer considering intake takes a few sessions!

Thank you so much. I appreciate any insights. (I've tried grounding by the way. It's just impossible. When I try grounding/being in the moment/feeling my body, I feel the tarantulas all over me even more intensely)",1679435814.0
7,Trying to figure all this out,6,11xjtpf,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11xjtpf/trying_to_figure_all_this_out/,4,"I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm in the right place, but I‚Äôve recently started to experience some signs and symptoms of ptsd.
(Also, I‚Äôm on mobile so apologies for format)

For some backstory, I‚Äôm married to a disabled veteran (he was already a disabled vet when we met, we didn‚Äôt know each other while he was in the military). 
I love my hubby very very much, but we have been through the ringer with his health issues: he has the occasional seizure, but about two years ago, he suffered a stroke.
He has recovered remarkably well, and I could not be more proud of his strength and perseverance, but lately I‚Äôve begun experiencing the odd flashback to that horrible moment. Very vivid, auditory flashbacks that make the whole world freeze over for what feels like eternity. I don‚Äôt know what triggers them, they seem to come out of nowhere. 

As frustrating and painful as the flashbacks are, what‚Äôs worse is that I don‚Äôt really have anyone I can talk to about them; It would pretty much destroy hubby if I told him, and as much as I love my family, I can‚Äôt trust them to not make a big fuss and blurt it out to hubby. I feel horrible and selfish because it‚Äôs not like I‚ÄôM the one who had a stroke. I feel like I should be so much stronger/better/happier/etc. and I do try to be, but sometimes (like today) it just knocks the wind out of me, and leaves me feeling like a failure.

Therapy is too expensive right now, so here I am venting. Thanks for reading, if you‚Äôve gotten this far, and if not,

8,kind of at the end of my rope,1,11y1auf,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11y1auf/kind_of_at_the_end_of_my_rope/,0,"Don't really feel like getting into it too deeply, but I'm mentally ill and traumatized. Have been for pretty much my whole life so far, probably always will be. I feel too broken to be alive, and like I'm too terrible to deserve to be anyway. I've always struggled finding things that excite me, but now there is literally nothing. Even the things that always helped or cheered me up more than anything don't anymore. I've been through this before, but this is the first time my anhedonia has been so severe. Now, things I used to look forward to for days or weeks excite me for all of two seconds. I don't know how I'm supposed to focus on fixing myself and working through so much/many trauma(s) while still working, paying bills, going to school, taking care of my pets and my roommate. I'm so tired. I just want to check the fuck out and have someone take care of me instead. I'm tired of it costing so much money to exist in this miserable fucking state of mind, and it costs even more to fix it. Not to mention I suffered from therapy abuse as a kid, so everyone solution for me to just ""go to therapy"" is literally part of the problem. I've also tried so many different meds of several types and different classes of antidepressants for over a decade, so I'm kind of just done with this. 
  
I can't stick around for the people who say they'd be sad anymore. I don't really believe them anyway. I'm tired of feeling like shit all the time, especially when I only remember feeling like this. Most of my good memories from my childhood are gone, and the new ones I make don't seem to stick. I'm at a point where my heart physically hurts every day (I've had several different exams and scans done, no physical cause to be found). Sex hurts from trauma. Knees/back hurt all the time because my body is physically and emotionally broken. I can't hold down any sort of relationship, and the only reason I can keep a job is because I simply can't afford to not have one. I dropped out of college because I became nonverbal and agoraphobic, but everyone I know is trying to push me to go back. I can't even think about it. I don't know what I'd study anyway. 
  
Long story short, nothing brings me even a scrap of joy anymore, and I don't want to put forth a ton of effort, go through a ton of pain to work through traumas and build a better life, only to find myself equally sick and unhappy decades from now. And considering most of my diagnoses are lifelong illnesses or have low recovery/high relapse rates, I can't help but feel like I probably will. I can't keep living like I'm not even alive or a part of the world. I can't keep existing in a state of hypervigilance and existential crisis.",1679446455.0

Last year this nearly did kill me if not for the fantastic support network that rallied round me. 

While I don't remember much of the blood tests and other IV treatments I had, I did spend a conscious week in hospital with a cannula in. This extreme form of exposure therpay did enable me to begin having vaccines which was huge for me and I was able to look at syringes and hear people discussing things like blood tests.

It was recently suggested I try hypnotherpay. During which while I was under I was asked to imagine myself and other people being injected. Multiple times I interjected and told the hypnotherapist I was uncomfortable. The hypnotherapist witnessed me have a panic attack and still continued. The week or so following this appointment I would have intrusive images and flashbacks to the traumatic event and have to go somewhere private and calm down, something that hadn't happened to me in years. This was about a month ago.

Yesterday during a doctors appointment it was suggested I have a blood test. Before hypnotherpay this would've made me uncomfortable but manageable levels of uncomfortable. But yesterday I had a severe panic attack and have since been struggling with intrusive images and flashbacks. I have just realised I'm due my second dose of HPV in a few months time and I'm no longer sure I'll be able to go through with it as I've been pushed so far back in my progress because of hypnotherpay.

Long story short my(27m) partner/friend (26f) was sexually absurd as a child. I haven't probed into details but waited till she felt safe enough and all I know is she was around 12, was by her uncle and due to reasons (unsure on specifics) he wasn't arrested or sentenced. 

Due to personal reasons with both of us the past yeae we've had a long distance friendship and we've grown both in ourselves and closeness, to the stage where we've half joked half been serious about marrying each other. 

I've tried to make her feel as safe and as comfortable with me as possible and the she tells me that after everything she's been through that she trusts me and honestly that's the proudest thing I could ever hear from her. 

The reason I'm seeking advice is she regularly shuts down when she's feeling overwhelmed or over emotional. Over the summer last year was one of her lowest moments and she pushed me away and denied pushing me away at the time. It was only in November/December time that she was finally truthful with me about her struggling both mentally and with her alcoholism. Truth be told I wasn't 100% honest with her as I could tell she wasn't with me and didn't feel comfortable with being emotionally open if she wasn't. 

We've talked and promised each other to be more open and honest with each other because we couldn't imagine our lives without the other. 

I'm planning on living abroad for 12 months and I'm worried she'll struggle and will completely shut down emotionally and wherever she means to or not push me away. Today we were trying to plan for myself to visit her as I'm not currently working and she kept saying that she didn't know wheather to let me or not ( she's working 6 day weeks, 12 hr shifts at the moment). Eventually she just shut down and completely stopped responding to my messages despite not being at work. 

I'm worried about her when I'm away but I'm more worried she'll push me away as she has said in the past that she doesn't deserve me. 

I know she's the only person who can seek help to get past her emotionally shutting down but any advice offered will be greatly appreciated. TIA",1679340780.0

24,How do you experience ‚Äòflashbacks‚Äô?,7,11ws146,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11ws146/how_do_you_experience_flashbacks/,15,"After 14 years I‚Äôm (F 25) finally asking for help with my mental health after experiencing what I think were some panic attacks. I‚Äôm only now able to accept what I went through was ‚Äòtrauma‚Äô and ‚Äòchildhood abuse‚Äô.

When I told my GP (General Practitioner) he asked me if I get flashbacks, I instinctively said no. After what I told him he referred me onto an organisation that help people with ptsd trauma. This was a surprise to me but I guess I never thought about what my diagnosis is and I think I‚Äôm in denial that I‚Äôm fine and don‚Äôt have one. I‚Äôm new to getting help and have never tried to diagnose myself. 

When I think back to saying no to getting flashbacks I am second guessing myself. When I think of flashbacks I think of something very strong coming over you and thinking and feeling like you are there again and not being aware of your surroundings and maybe smelling or being about to remember every word/detail but I don‚Äôt get that. 

There are times however, where I will just be reflecting on life when I‚Äôm at home, especially now i‚Äôm worried about what sort of questions I‚Äôll be asked by a therapist where and I remember an awful memory. I kind of go through the scene in my head like I‚Äôm processing it again (an example is when I was around 14/15 a family member grabbed a knife and pointed it at themselves screaming at me to stab them if I hated them so much). I don‚Äôt necessarily feel emotional and cry but I feel numb and my heart goes a bit faster like I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve been through experiences like that then I kind of get in my head that I must be broken or faulty because of what I‚Äôve been through. When I remember memories I can hear the voice clear as day and the angry mouth. of the person who abused me but I can‚Äôt smell something or see a vision or see white. What‚Äôs the difference between just remembering something and a flashback? 

(What is very strange is when I had my first panic attack about 1 month ago that was triggered by an item that reminded me of a memory that I feel extremely ashamed about and just remembering it made me so embarrassed and shameful that my heart started racing as if i just raced someone. Not sure if that one was a flashback?)

I'm being ate up by it all right now and i've no idea why today why yesterday. Why do i get these episodes of guilt even though people tell me its not my fault? 

I know he would have hurt other people before being put in jail. I was 13 when he(16/17) went after me and i didn't know what was happening. Maybe i could have reported him? 

Plus the newer unrepressed memories where there was another child a little older than me being assaulted like i was by her stepfather. Why did i forget for years? Why couldn't i say anything? 

I just, its all too much and the guilt is eating me up. 

I couldn't do anything, i was so young then (10) and i just feel so bad and i want to be sick or just dissapear for a while. 

Its all just going round and round in my head at the moment. 

How do i stop this cycle ? I do have therapy on thursday but theres too many days away. It all feels too much, too deep, tooo broken.

My brother started abusing me when I was a toddler, It was non stop beatings and put downs everyday, I begged anyone who saw it to stand up for me, I begged anyone to hear me, I even begged to die, But it was complete silence from the world and the god I prayed to. All throughout school I was constantly bullied by many people, Including my brother, The bullying got so bad that I developed trichotillomania at 9 and started ripping out multiple chunks of hair out of my head until I was completely bald and had scabs all over my head that I would constantly pick at until they bled. When the kids at school and my brother weren‚Äôt bullying me my teachers were, Telling me how ignorant and pathetic I was and that I was too stupid to learn anything or amount to anything, I started to hate myself more and more and became bitter towards the world, And I wanted nothing but to die since nobody would help me end my suffering.

CPS and police were called so many times throughout my life and each time they called me a liar and a attention seeker because my mom refused to believe my brother was an abuser and never admitted what he did to us.

I was on an unrelated errand the other day and was about a block from my grandparents' old home which was about the only stable place I had to go to in my entire childhood, so I decided to pay it a visit to see if anything came up emotionally for me there. I went to check it out and it was interesting and nostalgic, but I didn't feel anything particularly negative in the moment, if anything I felt sort of positive about the good memories there. I also visited the nearby park where I used to go with family and again, nothing negative happened that I noticed.

That night however, I had an incredibly vivid dream of someone breaking into my bedroom via the window above the bed and attacking me, it was more like a rabid animal of a person rather than a thief or 'normal' intruder and then as I fled the bedroom, I found two other similarly rabid people attacking me out in the living room, and I fought them off in the dream. Since then, I've also had a sleep paralysis episode which featured another intruder breaking into my current home and I used to have these experiences a lot but have been fortunate enough to not have had them for a few years now, until this past week anyway. 

It seems to me like I triggered something in my psyche by visiting that old house, though I have no specific idea of what it was in terms of a memory and I didn't feel any specific emotion like sadness or anger and so on when I was there. I'm wondering if I should visit more places from my past or leave it alone and would love to hear some stories from others who have had a similar experience.

My question to you is, have you visited your places of past trauma and did it have any positive effects, or assist in your healing journey long term after you processed the experience of going back there?",1679362545.0

Recovering from PTSD is just one part of the healing journey.

For example, my self-esteem and self-worth is still very low and something I have to work on.

Now that the PTSD symptoms are gone, my mental well-being does not depend on the bad things that happened to me. It depends on the good things and the lack thereof.

Since then I‚Äôve been avoiding my family house where I live with my dad and having been self-isolating in our cabin in the woods (about 2 hours away). I keep having PTSD episodes up here. I‚Äôm afraid of going back home as I don‚Äôt want to trigger any more flashbacks or symptoms. I keep giving myself a date but I can‚Äôt seem to motivate myself to go back home. My father is extremely emotionally abusive and violent and I don‚Äôt know if this has something to do with my avoidance.

It has been preventing me from seeing my regular therapist back at home as my anxiety is too high.

I had a doctor‚Äôs appointment near my house and drove back for the first time in weeks. I was triggered on the way down and being in the city triggered me. I ended up getting lost while driving, didn‚Äôt really know where I was and was dissociating. Felt unsafe driving. Stayed over at a friend‚Äôs place but was so overwhelmed that I left the next day. High anxiety.

At the cabin I feel safe. I have days where I am unable to do anything. Today, I just sat and stared into space without being able to do anything. I managed to cook lunch and go grab a coffee and that was it. Other than that I am staring. I also get into obsessive cleaning modes where I clean like a maniac. Other days I try to distract myself by watching movies, reading, journaling, laundry, going on walks. But majority of the time I‚Äôm frozen and staring into space.

I can‚Äôt seem to get out of the cabin no matter how hard I try. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm frozen here.

I have an appointment with a psychiatrist so I hope it will help me feel better. Also managed to find a trauma therapist up here, have an appointment this week.

I feel like this is ruining my life and I will have to expose myself to the things I fear. I don‚Äôt trust anyone and don‚Äôt want to be around people as well. Also can‚Äôt stop drinking.

Dose anyone else struggle in life? 

Day to day task? Even going outside the house? 

Im nearly 30. A family member passed away a few months ago. I feel terrible 99% of the time. I don't ear much. I don't go out. I have little friends. 

Im soley dependant on my wife, she works and pays for everything. I struggle to hold down a job for more than a few months. A few years ago I was injured at work, suffered a Head injury. Life has been down hill ever since. I'm in crippling debt, I struggle to find a job, I have no routine. I just struggle with everyday. 

Is this normal? Dose anyone else have these issues? Things are going real bad at the moment. I have no job, no friends, I don't go out, and I'm probably going to end up splitting with my wife. She can't keep paying for everything and supporting me. 

I feel like a dead weight. I can find another job but I last a few weeks/ months and loose motivation. I don't turn up to work, I just disappear. My previous employment history makes it hard because I was injured, so most workplaces find out after a background check. Makes it super difficult.

Maybe COCSA? Unsure really what it is.

So, when i was in my mid 20s i was told about a previous boyfriend when i was in my teens had actually been jailed for being a pedofile/rapist. Now at the time i felt a bit sick but wasn't surprised for some reason. 

Now in my early 30s after uncovering more memories of CSA/SA. I keep getting fragments of memories about him, i think i was around 13/14, he was 16/17 (age of consent in UK). I had an odd somatic flashback of feeling someone pulling my head down to give them oral on a bus when i was in my school uniform. And i remember it being him. Theres a couple of other flashs of him pulling my hand to touch his penis again when we were on the bus. And kissing and trying to touch me behind some trees.I had no idea what a relationship was tbh and he tried to convince me to do things i didn't want to do coz it felt wrong and gross. Like revulsion. 

I feel bad about others he did things too which lead to him going to jail. But i must have blcoked it out until last year but it still feels like i could have reported him sooner.

I feel so frustrated. And I'm sure it's frustrating for my therapist too, which may be why she never acknowledges the complexity of the problem. I am not seeing her now, it's been a couple of months that I'm on my own again. Anyhow, wondered if others can identify.",1679175097.0
79,Struggling with witnessing someone's death,6,11vadq8,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11vadq8/struggling_with_witnessing_someones_death/,9,"TW: death, loss, grief

I was 19 when I witnessed someone dear to me die in front of me. I'm not diagnosed with PTSD but ever since then, my life has never been the same since.

It was the worst day of life. The person was in so much pain and I couldn't do anything but just tell the 911 operator what was happening. What really broke me was when they reached for my hand and held it as they were dying.. they looked right into my eyes.. the fear in their eyes messes me up.. I cannot imagine what pain they were going through before their death. It fucks me up. If I could have switch places, I would in a heart beat.  Ever since then, I've been having nonstop nightmares.. sometimes I can hear their wheezing and convulsing in my nightmares. When I'm very sleepy and start to doze off, i get so many painful flashbacks of them dying.. of them laying deceased on the hospital bed after they took them to the hospital where they were pronounced dead.. I keep having flashbacks of me shaking them.. calling their name.. telling them to wake up.. wake up.. wake up.. ""I'm sorry but they didn't make it..."" Those words still haunt me.. I don't know how to cope with it.. 

It's been almost three years now and I'm still struggling to deal with it. I've been in therapy for a few months but nothing seems to help.. nothing seems to make those nightmares and flashbacks go away.. sometimes I just wanna join them in whatever afterlife there is.. 

A part of me is glad I was there in their final moments but another part is asking why.. why me? Why did I have to witness it? Why did they have to die so soon? It was a normal day, just like any other.. why..why..I'll never know..",1679197515.0

Their body is still alive, but mentally they are registering they should be dead and react as such. It feels like that with PTSD a lot of the time, at least for me. Physically you are aware that you're alive, and you go through the motions of life as much as you can, but part of you always feels dead, or that there's something wrong with this reality- like you're partially dreaming or something. 

You didn't ever think you were going to survive/live this long and now that you have, everything in front of you feels like an empty void and in the past is just that oleic acid covering everything, a constant reminder that drips onto your present that you shouldn't still be here and everything that broke you to this point playing out over and over again like that scene from clockwork orange. You can't escape, you can't look away. Malware infected brain. 

So you have very little sense of self and no real purpose/goals, you're not sure how to navigate normal relationships/interactions. You live in fear, and anxiety, and paranoia- and you still feel detached from other human beings like you're trapped in an in between state while the entire world and everything you could have been passes you by while you watch from that graveyard, trapped by chemicals you can't control but control you more than you realize. 

You go through the motions but they feel meaningless. You try to imitate what a normal life should be but it's a daily struggle just to live with it. The trauma weighs you down like a steel anchor and you spend every little ounce of energy you have to barely keep your head above water for what? The rest of the ants don't care if you're in the graveyard or in the line, they don't even really notice your absence. They don't know where you belong, or what you contribute, and neither do you. 

Oleic acid. Physically we are still alive, but mentally we came so close to death so many times the concept of dying feels more familiar than continuing to live. So you're stuck in a perpetual limbo of not feeling truly alive or dead- an ant slowly burying itself alive without really realizing what it's doing.",1679141086.0

From an arsonist's house fire in 4th grade (my Mom), bullied my entire teens because of it, to losing my entire direct family in just a few years. 

I have started to get these intrusive thoughts and flashbacks. The thoughts are always so loud that I can't hear anything else. I work in a factory and not even the 1200-ton press can break the veil. I'll sit in the bathroom and cry silently just wanting it to be quiet in my mind while also resisting the urge to scream and break down. 

I also had a long walk home one evening from work. My husband wasn't there to pick me up and didn't answer his phone. The entire time walking I was whimpering and crying. I started to get incredibly dizzy and had a hard time with my footing. I figured he'd fallen asleep (he did) but my brain kept saying he died. The last quarter mile I started to get delusional and felt like this wasn't real. Like this wasn't happening.

I get so upset whenever I remember that my cousin is a traumatic loss ""expert"" and not once has said so much as a hello to me and she knows everything that has happened. My friend who was like a brother is ignoring my cries for help now too. My uncle won't tell me where my Mom is buried. My dog has cancer. The list just goes on. I wish someone would listen to my problems but I don't want to burden anyone and most don't care anyway so I just remain mute.

I have one coworker who waves to me a lot throughout the day. I mean a lot. I wish so badly I could tell him how much those simple goofy waves help with my dumb PTSD flashbacks but I don't want to come across as attention seeking or flirtatious..

I'm having a hard time with work and my health. This is ruining my life. I know I need to just get used to being completely alone but I love company.

When I was 8 my family was having a campfire and telling scary stories. I got scared. I wanted to go into the house. My older male cousin (18) volenteered to take me in so he did.

I turned on the TV and was watching cartoons while he sat on the other couch beside the little chair I sat on. I heard him unbuckle his belt and I got scared. I remeber being frozen in my spot knowing that's a weird thing for him to do. 

I kept watching the TV too scared to ask him what he was doing. He told me to look at him and I did. He had his dick out and was touching it. I didn't know what was happening or what to do so I sat there terrified.

He kept touching it and then told me that I could come over and touch it. Again scared shirtless told him no thank you. He told me something along the lines of ""its okay"" insinuating that I should go do what he said.

He then asked me something else that I can't remeber. He then told me to not tell anyone and finally left.

I know I wasn't ever touched but I've always been afraid since then. Ever since that happened I've become a quiet and closed off person. I used to be so loud and outgoing. I haven't felt safe since then, and have been weary of any male I've come in contact with including men from my family.

I've always been very close to my older brother but since that happend I haven't even felt truly safe around him either. 

Any chance I get alone with a male or any time I'm with anyone male I fear of being SA and reliving that moment.

I feel bad about it. I know I haven't suffered any abuse like other people have so I don't feel like I got the right to be so traumatized from that experience. 

That thing has traumatized me ever since then. Now 10 years later almost the same age of my abuser at that time,  I would never think of doing that to a child.

My ptsd doesn't even come from the physical and emotional abuse from my parents, but sometimes I wonder if that's also traumatised me? I don't know.

I've noticed recently that any time an older person gets angry, especially if they're some sort of authority figure over me, I go into shutdown mode. I respond differently than I do to the other kind of abuse I suffered - rather than go catatonic and become unable to move or speak, I become overwhelmed with anxiety. I shake like a leaf, run to my bed or the biggest piece of furniture in the room so I can shrink into a corner, and all I can think about is how angry they are and how I'm going to get hit next.

My landlord came by to take the keys from my boyfriend's roommate (we all live in the same complex), and the roommate hadn't even started cleaning out his room. The landlord lost his shit, started screaming at him about how he's never on time and always makes him late. It was completely justified and everything he said was true, and it wasn't even directed at me, I was in my bf's room with the door closed. My boyfriend asked why I was suddenly whispering rather than speaking at normal volume and was trying to get me to stop chewing my lip and picking the skin from my fingers and I'd not even realised I was doing either of those things. I was shaking like a leaf and cowering in the corner of the bed with the blankets piled up around me. I was saying we should be quiet or he'll know I'm here and even though he never cares I'm in my bf's apartment rather than my own, I was really scared I'd add to his current anger, or because he was already mad he'd be mad about stuff he normally wouldn't care about. 

My boyfriend was just really confused trying to tell me the landlord didn't care I was here and I needed to stop worrying. He was comforting me but he couldn't understand why I thought the landlord would get angry at me, and I was trying to explain that being in this situation made me feel exactly the same way as when I'd be listening to my dad beating my brother upstairs for perceived slight and knowing he'd come for me next just because he was mad. That after hearing it all he'd bust in the door of my room, launch things from around the room at me complaining about a mess that didn't exist, knock over my bookshelves, and inevitably grab my arm too hard and drag from the bed and beat me too because I ""made the room a pig sty"". No one's parents are perfect, but my bf's are both very emotionally stable and available people who never physically punished, so although he can try to comfort me, he simply doesn't understand what's happening in my brain and body.

It just fucking sucks man. Like it really sucks to notice something knew that comes from the trauma or traumatic events. Like my body just does things now that are not normal and it's become so natural I don't notice at all. 

I'm wondering whether I should try to seek ptsd therapy or regular therapy for the things my parents have done to me growing up even though they're not the people who caused me to have ptsd. Does anyone think that's a good idea or could give advice on if therapy would help?",1679139268.0

They had this thing he did called the 'rotty rumble' which scared the daylights out of me, but now I find it kind of wholesome for some reason.

Anyways, she wanted me to come out, and when I went out the Cherry came to sniff me, tried to lick my hand but I didn't want that so I lifted my hands to my chest. Cherry was in front of me and probably took it as a sign to play (or fight) and barked why jumping on me, knocking me down. I started having a panic attack and my cousin rushed to hold the dog back, still barking.

&#x200B;

That wasn't the worst part of the weekend though. They brought me to where they were taught karate at an old friends house. I'll call him banana (I'm hungry right now and plus I need to cope with humor). Banana let me through, and immediately two little dogs came sniffing my legs. I started to panic a little, but was reassured that they wouldn't bite and were nice.

After karate, I didn't see the dogs much as a threat and even pet on (I'm proud). But when banana was talking to my aunt and cousins, I went to go see inside the gym and went around the couch.

One of the dogs was deaf in one ear and blind in one eye and came at me, growling and snapping at my ankles. BOOM panic attack. I felt so dreaded, like I wasn't in the moment. I felt like I was dying. I also started sweating.

Banana made his dog go to his room and shut the door, I was frozen on the floor and couldn't move. It took some time (and some comforting from my cousin) to be able to go out the door. It was very awkward in the car.

The night I was staying in my cousins room, I couldn't really sleep. Everytime I heard a little sound, even just a creak in the floor, my eyes would snap open and I would stand straight up. My cousin sleeps heavily, so she didn't notice. Later that morning, I was told  my actions are 'unreasonable' and 'dramatic'.

It‚Äôs terrible. As bad as it sounds, I‚Äôm currently being triggered by being around anyone or anything that makes me think my brother (violent alcoholic abuser) is near, which includes his baby. 

I feel so incredibly bad for even being triggered by a person, let alone an innocent baby but I can‚Äôt help it. I can‚Äôt help the panic that fills every part of my body just by being near the baby or even hearing her around me. As hard as I try, I still break out into panic attacks and have to work really hard cope. It‚Äôs hell. I hate the attacks so much. I thought I was getting better but things got bad again. It makes me want to avoid anyone and anything that triggers these types of reactions. I just want to stop hurting and suffering. I want to be well. I don‚Äôt want to be shamed and ostracized for not wanting to be around people that trigger these feelings. It‚Äôs not my fault that the baby reminds me of her dad. I‚Äôm not mean to the baby, I just don‚Äôt want to be around her because I can‚Äôt take it. 

Anyway, it seems my family doesn‚Äôt really care about any of that though. All they see is the baby and that I‚Äôm being mean to her because I don‚Äôt want to be around her. I‚Äôve met her but I have no interest in forming a relationship rn because I literally can‚Äôt take it. I can‚Äôt be around her without panicking. Plus, I don‚Äôt want to open any part of my life to my brother because he is scary and dangerous. I don‚Äôt want to be forced to be around the baby unnecessarily. They don‚Äôt have to bring her here but they choose to do so, even knowing how badly it affects me. I don‚Äôt want to be ostracized either just because I need to prioritize my own well-being over someone else‚Äôs baby. This whole situation just feels terrible. 

I mean, I know the baby isn‚Äôt responsible for the abuse my brother inflicted on me. It‚Äôs just that I can‚Äôt help the reactions that I have because I‚Äôm still trying to heal from ptsd and panic disorder. I didn‚Äôt do this to myself. I wasn‚Äôt the one who went on a violent drunken rampage that stole my peace. 

It just feels like I am the only one still suffering when I didn‚Äôt even do anything. My brother gets to have it all. He gets the acceptance of the family again just because he had a kid. He gets to live life free of fear. He gets to move on. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm just surviving. I don‚Äôt get to be apart of the family because it‚Äôs not a safe space for me. I‚Äôm desperately trying to force myself to move on while being plagued by debilitating panic. On the daily, I get shamed for having reactions to trauma and triggers. I just wish I had people who understood my struggle. I‚Äôm not choosing to be ‚Äúmean,‚Äù I‚Äôm just trying to cope with incredibly hard feelings and panic disorder.

Now last year some sexual trauma (csa)  from childhood came up and lead to a diagnosis of PTSD. 

We have been affectionate like kissing etc, like its feels good but i don't want to trigger myself by doing anything more right now. But i feel like this is something he needs to know right? I don't want him thinking its him im resistant to you know? 

I am in therapy to deal with my issues which he knows about. 

Most people are telling me not to disclose anything yet but we are early 30s so im like its not like we are messing around ya know? We want to be open and honest.

Little short background: raised in a cult, currently estranged from all immediate family. I‚Äôve been in consistent therapy for 8-ish years and have made a lot of ground, especially in the last 3-4 years. 

I have struggled with work/career my whole life, and was unable to work for a couple years - like 2017-2018? I am doing much better than I was then and am close to graduating with my masters degree. I‚Äôm recently engaged, overall feel way more stable. I still go to therapy once a week and use Xanax for panic attacks.

I switched jobs in December and I‚Äôm beginning to feel like I made a huge mistake and completely destabilized myself. Panic attacks and ptsd episodes had been greatly reduced, but now they‚Äôre happening multiple times per week. I‚Äôm panicking in my sleep, and at least 1 day per week can sometimes be spent with waves of panic. I know the job itself isn‚Äôt right for me and I‚Äôm actively searching for a better fit - like it‚Äôs beyond a reasonable accommodation. But that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm stuck and sometimes start to panic more or feel trapped (a major trigger for me). Although this job isn‚Äôt for me, I still know that I could benefit from more flexible scheduling and telework. We‚Äôre allowed to telework, but it‚Äôs ‚Äúsituational‚Äù and always has to be approved - no set telework schedule. Also, as I‚Äôm looking for a new job, I know this will be important to me. I do also like to come into the office sometimes, but my tolerance is low and I also need to it to of kind of consistent.

I guess what I‚Äôm wondering is how do I look for a job and consider accommodations? I don‚Äôt even know how to word this question. I have finally reached a point where I can seek out a job that can be done via telework or remote (accounting - I switched to auditing and I know audit will not be good for me long term, so applying back to accounting jobs), but I don‚Äôt know how to navigate accommodations.",1679073224.0

Almost exclusively revolving around castration. The dreams happen about twice a month and have been going on for about a year and a half. 

Some context and trigger warning:

My high school girlfriend accused me of cheating (rightly so) and then squeezed my testicles with the intention of popping them.

I'd hesitate to self diagnose ptsd when a therapist hasn't. 

On the other hand my ex REALLY fucked me up. I've never experienced fear like that before; all consuming and completely paralyzing. There was no warning, no time to prepare myself. 

We were in her car and had just finished kissing. She asked me if I loved her, and i said of course. She unbuttoned my pants and slid her hand down the front of my boxers. She grabbed my balls firmly, but not tight enough to be uncomfortable.She was holding me in similar way to how you'd milk a cow. She had them both. A terrifying thought in hindsight. Then she asked me if I was cheating on her with a mutual friend. I had, but i lied and said no. It was hard to sound convincing, she clearly didn't believe me anyway.

She started squeezing. Hard. There was no slow build up of pressure, just an instant crushing force. I grab her arm out of reflex, my fingers make divots in her skin Before I could realize that this is actually happening irl, she told me to tell her that I love her. I don't hesitate. I look her in the eyes and she's got a smirk on her face, not a full smile but almost. I tell her that I love her, only her.

She squeezes harder. I can't move anymore. I can't breathe. I can only watch. I spent what felt like an eternity starring at where her hand dissappears into my boxers. I eventually break my eyes away. I look at her. She's not smiling anymore. Her face is lightly trembling. I immediately realized that she's putting ALL her strength into ruining me. I want to hit her. I want to break her bones. But I can't let go of her arm for some reason. Maybe I was frozen in fear. Maybe I had a mental block stopping me from hitting the woman i love.

After about 2 lifetimes go by (really maybe only 10 seconds but it's impossible to tell) she releases me. I double over in pain, resting my head on the cars dash. 

POP!POP!POP!

Waves of sharp pain shoot through my stomach all the way to my neck. She's flicking me! I rip her hand out of my pants and get out of the car. She drives away and I walk home. We dated for another year but i never trusted her for another second.

Fortunately my testicles still work but I still suffer from pain years later. 2 doctors have told me there's nothing wrong and that sometimes things just ache for no reason. A therapist suggested that it's in my head because I still miss her. Personally I disagree, I feel like i don't miss HER as much as i miss having a gf in general. I haven't dated since we broke up partly because I'm trying to sort out my mental health and partly because I'm ugly.

On to the dreams:

The dreams vary and my memory of detail is rather limited. However I do remember the feeling of absolute panic, fear, and sense of dread.

My most recent dream was only a few days ago. It started with me cooking in the kitchen.i remember telling myself to be careful and not burn myself. I was frying chicken on the stove and I somehow bumped the pan. Scalding hot oil flew all over the front of me and began burning me. The oil soaked through my pants and melted my scrotum. I tried to hold my testicles onto my body with my hand but i feel like they were no longer connected. I hold them in place with my hand and waddle over to the gun cabinet. I take a gun and shoot myself. 

I woke up in a panic with a tightness in my chest. It felt pretty much like how you feel when you feel like you're falling then you wake up. Maybe a bit more intense with a feeling of dread to go along with the fear. 

I'm wondering if there's a way to stop reoccurring nightmares. Even management would be great- im just tired of being afraid to sleep.",1679044216.0

In this shock/numb phase I was as calm as can be. You could not tell that I had been infected with PTSD. 

I couldn't eat, I was scared... but a part of me felt at peace. A part of me felt insulated deep inside. I felt calm within myself and my mind.

I was still okay. I was still powerful. 

I guess it makes sense. It was the early stages of PTSD... It didn't have time to ravage destruction. Just like for example the early stages of a war are met with initial shock... but there is still that insulation factor. There isn't destruction everywhere... yet. 

However... years go by and that numb factor has gone away. At least for me. I am no longer insulated anymore, this metaphorical war has had time to wreak havoc in my psyche.

I no longer feel calm. I no longer feel insulated. I quite simply no longer feel safe.

It took me a long time to accept that I have PTSD...but now it's unmistakable. Nowadays, years later I am always anxious. I hear some people won't have symptoms of PTSD until years later... and I believe that it's because their ""Numb"" Phase lasted longer.",1679028879.0

I said no and Ill just wait around hete they push we walk there and its over 10 downtown blocks in the dark with fucking screaming strangers everywhere‚Ä¶ and insist its a big grocery store thats not crowded when I dont enjoy andy shopping. They also said they were getting 2 things. And kept offering to buy me something and I said none of this is a joke. Bbuting me something doesnt fix anything and I dont want you to buy me anything! Ill wait at the cash out since youre going shopping around this huge place and then we have to walk 10+ dt blocks back. Then they say we shouldve brought THE CAR. I asked if they own one and they say mine and I say hell no I dont drive dt or to places i have never been and your shopping trip wasnt needed at all, I shouldve gone home when you became inflexible and insistent we walk a few blocks and its a 40 min + thing in the dark; I shouldve turned around and waited at ur building to get my stuff and go home instead of stay here later. Why cant people stick to the plan? Pretend you and all your problems are fake and your assets are theirs to use?

125,TW: Does anyone else lay awake thinking of the toxic relationships they've had in the past?,6,11tndf4,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11tndf4/tw_does_anyone_else_lay_awake_thinking_of_the/,13,"About 5 years ago I had a boyfriend who constantly threatened suicide when I tried to break up with them. They were incredibly abusive. Extremely manipulative, almost violent and would throw things at times. There was also another relationship that caused a lot of mental pain. Pretty sure my amygdala is enlarged.

Currently I'm involved with someone who is super kind and understanding of my situation. Thankfully.

Yet somehow thoughts of the past consume me. I get the urge to unblock my ex and tell them how horrible they were. (I would NEVER actually do that though lol) 

It feels like there is no justice. They walk around playing the victim when really they were the one creating a victim themselves. And I refuse to be a victim but things have definitely had a negative effect on me. Especially my short term memory. It's embarrassing when my friends tell me we've already talked about something but I can't remember.

How do you get over abusive relationships? Any vitamins or supplements that help? Exercise? Healthy habits?

From the ages of 3-11 I was abused and molested by a neighbour girl (a year older than me) and her parents. I have only recently reported it after the memory burst intonky kind one day as a barrage of flashbacks.

I survived!

From primary school to the very end of highschool so 5-16 I was bullied relentlessly. Physically and verbally I was treated like an animal someone hated. I had very few true friends and only one of them went to my highschool.

It's thanks to those freinds I have survived to this day.

From 11-16 I was molested by a man 5 years older than me. This was an almost daily occurance and he had a girl my age and a disabled girl with the mental age of a 5 year old join in. The guy and the girl my age would teach her what to do to md. The poor girl had no idea that she was torturing me because she thought it was a game.

I survived.

Age 12 a girl in school kicked me so hard in the stomach she caused my appendix to swell to the point I needed it removed. Then when I returned to school 3 girls ganged up on me and kicked the stitches out of me.

I literally survived someone's attempt to kill me.

Age 16 I lost my virginity to a man who was 23. He was too rough and left me bleeding for a week. I tried to get out of the relationship because he was a neo Nazi but he wouldn't let me leave. I finally got the courage to leave after I find out he is sleeping with my 13 year old cousin. He then went on to murder a man for being gay a year later. The body wasn't found for years, so I found out when I was 21. I had to give him a character reference and give the police a statement describing losing my virginity, every horrid painful gruesome detail. This was then read out in court. 

I still survived 

Still at 16 I found out I have a life long condition that will only get worse for the rest of my life. It is the first of many. 

I'm still surviving through the pain caused by this daily. I now have over 20 conditions and they're life altering. I am an electric wheelchair user because of constant dislocations. I can dislocated a shoulder or a hip just by sleeping funny.

Age 18-19 I was in a physically abusive with a 27 year old. He beat me to the point my joints would dislocate from my body. I only left him because I was forced to by freindsz after he beat me in my workplace so badly my whole left side was dislocated (shoulder, hip, knee, elbow and wrist). My friends wouldn't let me go back to the first home I ever rented. 

Thanks to my parents and friends I got through that.

19 I was sexually assaulted by a freinds flat mate when I tried to leave their house. He grabbed me and dragged me into the room and threatened people's safety if I screamed. The flat mates were all disabled except him. I believed he would hurt them. The police didn't believe me because ""no-one heard anything ""

I almost didn't survive that. 

19 again I met a 30 year old man who taught me what swinging was. He included tricking me into sleeping with people older than my own parents. The swinging was fun but kicked off a sex addiction which lead to me sleeping with over 300 men and women combined. He took me on expensive dates and bought me presents but wouldn't let me meet his son. I just this moment realised now I was a sugar baby and just didn't bloody know it! Anyway one day he came to pick me up for a swingers party and I was trying out a wheelchair as part of my physio and I was practicing in the dorm common room which had all around windows. He saw me through the window, made a face, dropped the roses he bought me and left. He later text me saying he ""COULDN'T SEE ME AS SEXY ANYMORE BECAUSE HE COULDN'T GET THAT IMAGE OUT OF HIS HEAD!""

Screw that guy but I survived him and learned swinging is more fun in my control.

TRIGGER WARNING SUICIDE DISCUSSED A LOT AFTER THIS.

Age 20 I took two overdoses as I couldn't handle everything that happened in my life so far. The first one caused my heart to stop and it had to be restarted.i was drunk out of my mind, I drank 2L of rum before I left the house (I still can't drink rum to this day) I remember nothing between passing out and waking up. I had an out of body experience during the OD, watching myself take the pills from across the room. As soon as the last pill (54) was in my mouth I snapped back into reality and regretted my decision. 
Also during the OD recovery period I was allergic to one of the IV medications and nobody noticed me going into anaphylaxis. My mum came for a visit and Found me swollen and unable to breathe. The nurses had a change over and the new nurses just thought I was fat. 
The second wasn't as many pills but I had drank three bottles of wine, a freind of mine slept with the guy I liked after I asked her to introduce me. I was in earshot. I rifled through the guys cupboards and found and took every pill I could find. Which fortunately was not enough. And again after the frenzy I snapped back into reality, I called one of my best friends (she was my maid of honour) and she drove as fast as she could breaking speed limits to come and get me. She drove my ass to the hospital to get my stomach pumped.

Thanks to my freinds, my quick thinking once my right mind kicked in, my mum for saving me from an ironic death and especially the ambulance staff and the doctors who literally brought me back to life. I survived.

Age 20 I meet my son's father. We were together for four years. During this time we became engaged and set our wedding date, bought the dress, spent ¬£10k on a wedding in a castle. He ended things while I was in hospital on life support. But let's rewind just a little bit, from day one I told him that my condition would worsten throughout my life and had many comorbidities (conditions it can cause) and I would deteriorate. We decide to have a baby sooner rather than later as the older I am the less likely I am to survive pregnancy. I go through pregnancy aged 21-22 with my son with a 3% chance of survival, this dropped to a 0.01% if I have a C-section. I went through 3 days of full blown labor with no dialation. The doctors had never seen anything like it before (this will be explained soon). 

I survived a C-section after the most painful labour for three freaking days! Thanks once again to amazing skilled doctors and nurses, HCAs and other hospital staff!

Age 22 diagnosed with a 1-1million medical condition that causes bones to fuse wrong. I have an open fontanelle but fused pieces in my spine and a FUSED PELVIS! This is why I didn't dialate! It was physically impossible as my pelvis couldn't move to adjust. It was also why I suffered massive pelvic pain at the final trimester.

I'm surviving despite this and all my other conditions!

Age 24 I feel a pain in my chest and I am struggling to breathe. I ask my fianc√©, the father of my child to drive me to the hospital. He says no because he will be late to his new job (my brother in law was his boss) so I push my manual wheelchair to the bus stop slowly but surely. I make it to the bus stop and promptly collapse to the floor. I wake up surrounded by people, all neighbours who knew me from the estate. They had a blanket around me and a pillow under me, they asked me where I lived and I whispered the number while pointing down the road. They ran and got my fianc√©. He gets there just after I am loaded into the ambulance, he asks if I Will be okay, the paramedics shared a look and said they didn't know. They asked if he was coming and he said he was going to work and walked away without so much as an ""I love you"". I find out my lungs are coated in blood clots and had to undergo procedures to break them down. I couldn't breathe alone and couldn't talk. He waited 3 days before coming to the hospital didn't call once to check if was okay either, he then sat across from me and said this exact phrase ""I CAN'T HANDLE YOUR HEALTH ANYMORE!"" and called off our marriage and told me not to come home. Not to come home to my home, in my name, adapted for my needs as a wheelchair user.  So when I was ready for release out of the hospital I was asked my address for the ambulance drop off and I had a breakdown. I didn't have an address to give them. I had to call my mum and ask her to take me in. She opened her home to me and my son, though I moved into a friend's house after a week for my mental health. I lived with my friend for 6 months with my baby in a travel cot. This was my first time being homeless. I had to find a house for me and my baby. I finally did but we have now moved 5 x in 8 years.

 I survived another health scare and the end of the life I had planned ahead with the first man who had treated me right.

Age 25 my son's dad met a new girl, she has become my son's step mother and my ex's wife. I'm fine with her these days but back then I wasn't because of overstepping boundaries from her. Admittedly I'll thank her for this, my son's dad hadn't seen him in 8 months because he didn't want to see me. She told him ""if you don't start acting like a dad I'm never giving you kids"" unfortunately they then fought for full custody and I got supervised only visits. My son's dad acted like my conditions were worse than I let on.

I survived this and now have full shared custody. Though his dad takes him if I am in hospital or too ill.

Age 25 I meet my soulmate. He is the most kindhearted, warmest, sweetest, caring, most wonderful souls in the universe. The yin to my yang. My everything. We were a swinging duo to be envied. I loved everything about him and he was the perfect other half. If I could turn back time I would have never left. I would hog tie the old me in a basement and throw away the key to live a lifetime with him on my arm. Anyway not the point, the point is I royally fucked up. I suddenly had an urge to go back to uni again in the place I was assaulted. I saw it as an opportunity to face my past and get over my trauma (spoiler alert it didn't work)!. So off I move 100 miles away from everything. Including my son. Yeah I had a psychotic break I'm pretty sure after all the stress my son's dad caused.

I survived this with so much regret.


27I meet my soon to be ex husband. We met online, had a whirlwind romance where we were living together in 2 weeks and married at 5 months in. The first year and a half of marriage was bliss, then c-19 hit. Suddenly we were stuck together 24/7 which to begin with was great, then we both became depressed and frustrated, but he took.his frustration out on me. He withheld sex, using it as a weapon, started insulting me, ingraining into me that I was ugly, stupid, fat, lazy etc. A few times he has thrown stuff at me including a concrete hand casting kit. I finally left this year.

Now I must concentrate on surviving through every day.

30 left my abusive ex husband but had to live in the same house as him. The day after I told him things were over he sexually assaulted me in the early morning. I was forced to report it to the police when I broke down crying in my doctor's office. 

I'm still surviving...

31 I finally got help from the homelessness team in my old area. I've been living in hotels for weeks and my ex husband is still abusing me from a distance guilt tripping me about my stuff taking up room, or our dog or anything he can come up with. 

I will get through this! I AM A SURVIVOR!

Now this is a message for me. If you are reading this, you are doing enough, you are worth it, ask your freinds for help, you are beautiful, you are outgoing, you are an amazing mother, you do deserve love, you deserve to be happyn

Keep on surviving!!",1679047945.0

I'm in a quite good relationship at the moment (since around 2020), I mean, there are some issues but there's no abuse like in my past relationships. I don't have friends with whom I can talk to though, so I started to actively search for them in a way or another, or at least connect to people in some way, in fact I started attending uni lessons and got this app to find pen pals, text people from all around the world.

What I realized though is that when I think about talking to people on the regular, or even just messaging people (especially men for some reason) I get this fear that I'm cheating on my partner and I will self-sabotage in some way and sabotage my relationship. I feel like it's a sort of fear of having another deep connection and that I'll develop feelings for the other person, but also that they will flirt with me and disappear if they find out I have a boyfriend (?) I don't know how to explain it better.

But I think it's linked to the fear of having no control over my actions, which I'm sure it comes from times in the past where I felt like I had no control, and there's some shame for sure. I just wish I could know better how to face this because it's really scary to me. I also thought this has to do with trusting myself but I get confused, I thought I trusted myself enough to not fear these things.

Not long after, she found out that her ex, whom she was very in love with at the time (considered marriage), had a baby with another woman which was conceived whilst he was with her.

Over the span of just a few months, my sister changed from one of the most organised, pro-active, hardworking, eager and physically healthy people I know into a complete recluse with no interest in anything or any idea of what to do with her time. She's been given leave off work and is seeing a therapist which I guess is good. She's also been offered anti-depressants but seems quite reluctant. 

I'm still very worried though because she's unrecognisable. She can't even cook herself a meal or watch the telly. She barely leaves the house, except for yoga which she attends at an insane frequency that still seems dysfunctional in like the opposite way. IIRC she attends yoga everyday or 6 times a week.

She was saying that I seemed like I was very high functioning and seemed like I was doing great. I found this concerning because I feel horrible inside. I am excellent at hiding my feelings.

For example I had an ex roommate who would get angry at me for doing things our other roommates did as well, including himself. He would also blame me for things that happened even if I didn‚Äôt do them. He also used my episodes as a weapon and painted me as a childish or idiotic person, and i couldn‚Äôt have a say in anything because I was ‚Äòcrazy‚Äô.

Another example is my partner and I had a falling out with a friend group. I had mentioned they did something that hurt my feelings recently and they got very angry at me for it. My partner was fighting for me on my behalf but I was blamed for ‚Äòcontinuing the argument‚Äô despite talking only after my partner did. and also I was essentially called selfish for bringing up an issue at all.

I don't know if I should just try to not bring it up or if it would cause awkward silences. We aren't really close. 

U might be wondering why I would invite her over after what happened. To be honest it's more of a way I can escape from current reality of strict friends and family and just be with someone so chill and just get a release of life. (Not sexual)

i froze from the second i saw him stop his car infront of us in the middle of traffic, when i saw him approach us carrying something i thought it was going to be the last thing i ever saw in my life.... i froze and could only stare in shock as it happened, he left and i began hyperventilating and crying, which was only made worse when he kept driving next to us for a little bit to intimidate us, the uber driver was very calm through it all which i feel both thankful and sorry for because i cant imagine how many times shes been in a similar situation. i arrived at my destination, a hospital and i couldnt even talk to the secretary so i had to type my doctors name and my name in my phone and show her.

i sat in the waiting room for a good 30 minutes nauseous, dizzy and feeling little zaps of electricity going up and down my body.

a couple of family members were with me when it happened but they didnt make much of it and told me i was overreacting. later i found out they didnt notice the man had a gun, i did because i was sitting right behind the driver.

i still cant shake off the anxiety and the fear, i had never seen a gun (outside of security guards) in real life let alone been in a violent situation where a gun was involved. i am still shaking right now, my vision feels blurry and i have the chills.

When I was in 5th grade the school told everyone there was an armed intruder. Our teacher made us hide ib the back of the classroom with water bottles and safety scissors. She told us a detailed plan on how to take down the intruder. I thought I was going to die and had excepted the fact I was going to loose my life defending my classmates (alot of which were people who have bullied me since 1st grade) 

For hours we sat there thinking there was a armed intruder and that we would be killed. Hours after the enitial lockdown we were escorted out by police. 

The next day they made us return to school with little to no help. A few days later they found out it was a glitch. (I don't understand the specifics) but for days I believed it was real. 

I don't know what to call this. It wasn't a sch**l sh**tting because nobody died. But armed intruder technically isn't right either.

All my laughs are fake ones. I could sit with anyone and talk for hours with them. Talking made the whole world a little easier. I could talk and talk and talk endlessly. All I wanted to do was talk as a kid. It brought me so much unexplainable joy to share experiences. 

But now life has fucked me up. After multiple repeated horrible traumatic experiences and the realization that my childhood had actually entailed quite a lot of abuse, I have become isolated and secluded. All I want is to be left alone yet simultaneously I want someone else to stand by me in silence. I have no friends anymore. 

Battling through severe depression and CPTSD and social anxiety makes relationships so terrifying and exhausting. I don‚Äôt have the energy to even maintain eye contact. I find no joy in normal conversations. I don‚Äôt want to talk to anyone. I‚Äôm terrified of physical contact. I feel like people around me are so shallow. From being the bubbliest, brightest, most talkative person in the room I‚Äôve turned into being the quietest and seemingly saddest person in the room. Complete polar opposites. I never thought my personality was going to take such a huge turn. 

My gay self used to always crush on most quiet girls and would always go and try to make them laugh as a personal achievement. With the first girl I loved, I‚Äôd enjoy me acting as the sun and her being more like the moon. It was a rather traumatic experience with her. Now I‚Äôve become that ‚Äúquiet girl‚Äù.

How I wish I could just have a partner in solitude. I want someone else to make the first move platonically. I‚Äôve been making the first move my whole life and now I‚Äôm sick.

WARNING: This gets really dark really fast, so the faint of heart should turn back. 

*My dad was a bit of a drinker.*

I was in third grade. I was a bit of trouble child (mostly a slacker) in school. Not at home. God forbid. I hid my report card and he found it. On his birthday. My sister told me he found it so I hid outside. Big mistake. 

Worst hide and seek game ever. He came outside with his shotgun. He went to my pet rooster, who shares my very rare name, and shot his head off. ‚ÄúThe mutt is next if you don‚Äôt get your ass out here!‚Äù I continued to watch from my spot in the bush. My dog was indeed next. I cried out and he found me. He chased me across the yard and tackled me. 

After carrying me inside by  the back of my neck, he broke my nose on a wall. Blood spouted from my nose, down the pale yellow wallpaper, and seeped into the carpet. Told me I‚Äôm a failure. Shoved my bloody nose back into the wall and brought out ‚ÄúThe Slapper,‚Äù a leather belt he carved up and kept in a bucket of water; you know, for these special occasions. He made me stand with my arms out, moving them up and down. For three hours. ‚ÄúIf I could do this in football practice you can do it now!‚Äù 

(Yeah, that high school you dropped out of in 10th grade?) 

Periodically he‚Äôd come over and tire his arm out with that belt. Blood covered me. My face, my spiderman shirt, my blue shorts, socks. But the back was the worst. He didn‚Äôt go for my ass. Lacerations covered my tiny back. Blood slicked the back of my shirt and shorts. I still have the scars. 

(I *used* to be reminded every time I look in the mirror. I‚Äôve healed enough now to see myself as who I truly am and not the helpless, abhorrent, bastard abomination they tried to mold me into.) 

After I missed dinner and said I was hungry, he threw my rooster‚Äôs head at me and told me to eat it if I was really that hungry. I wasn‚Äôt. 

He made me clean the blood until I passed out at 3am. The next day, he cooked my favorite meal, took me fishing, and bought me an RC car; unheard of. 



So yeah, that‚Äôs a bit much for‚Ä¶ what a seven year old? 

That anniversary is tomorrow. 

I‚Äôve missed almost a week of work and have ignored all my responsibilities. Outwardly I seem fine and happy and enjoying our new puppy. But inside idk how I feel. It‚Äôs a mix of ‚Äúwhy tf can‚Äôt I have a decent family‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy tf do people keep treating me like shit.‚Äù Anger, humiliation, deep sadness, self disgust, and negative self talk have inhabited my brain while I sit and play Skyrim for hours on end. I‚Äôve had night terrors for the past week as well. 

I told my fianc√© the whole story today. She held me tightly afterwards and we sobbed together. She noticed that I still blame myself. ‚ÄúI should have done better in school.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf I came out of my hiding place I could have saved my dog.‚Äù Sounds absurd hearing it aloud. My father was a deranged maniac, none of that was my fault. He killed other pets of mine, it was inevitable. I never deserved this. 

She suggested that we both write letters to our younger selves, and no matter how painful or uncomfortable, we will share them with each other. I might share mine on here later, who knows. 

I love this woman to death. She‚Äôs a ride or die kinda gal and she‚Äôs always had my back. I‚Äôm going to marry her ass so hard. 



Post Script: 
To give some people a sense of relief: I was saved when I was in fourth grade. Adopted into a semi-functional family. This certainly wasn‚Äôt the only event in my childhood, but through therapy and meds, I have healed immensely. Additionally, I have a great support system.

I‚Äôm preparing for my next therapy session tomorrow where I want to talk in more detail about the abuse and how violent it was - both physically and mentally. 

She had rules that I had to follow to show that I was committed to her and loved her. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to speak to or write text messages to other girls - friendships were completely out of the question. She had the passwords to my Facebook account and my phone records and emails because she said that I would give them to her if I had nothing to hide. But that meant she was constantly logged in to my account to see who was messaging me and what I was saying, looking through my phone records to see who I was texting and calling. We were on the phone together for hours at a time because we were long distance and I was never able to do anything for myself.

She would get angry and shout and accuse me of cheating on her when the rules weren‚Äôt followed and would end up using blackmail to get me to do what she wanted. 

She used to ridicule me, invalidate me as a person and undermined me, even though she said that she loved me. She was physically violent towards me on more than one occasion and said that I deserved it. She told me that everything that was wrong in our relationship was my fault. I was the one to be blamed. 

She sexually abused me by using sex as a manipulative tactic to show that I loved her even when I didn‚Äôt want to and made me feel guilty when I said no. In turn I would be made to feel like a failure and not a proper ‚Äúman‚Äù.

She faked a pregnancy scare to get me to say that I would be committed to her if she became pregnant and that we would be a family together.

She ridiculed my family to get me to be against them and tried to put distance in between me and the closest members of my family to the extent that I couldn‚Äôt tell any of them what my relationship was like. In fact no family members or friends knew about how shit the relationship was until years after. 

I spent the time in that relationship in constant fear of what was going to happen next. My anxiety was so severe that I started to self harm as a way to punish myself when I broke the rules. I was just so unhappy and I felt as though I could do nothing to change my situation because it was meant to be love. 

In the end, she decided to break up with me because she no longer needed me for her to love herself. She just used me for more than two years as a way to boost her ego and her self-love. She took advantage of my kindness and generosity and ability to be so loving. 

The physical and emotional violence still traumatises me now. It‚Äôs almost like the version of me in that relationship became part of my identity. It‚Äôs completely fucked up my relationships since and I don‚Äôt think that it is possible for me to be loved. I still feel like I deserved the abuse even after so much time has passed.",1678980143.0

161,Writing a character who quit his job for 5 or so years to recover before returning to the job (his PTSD is from working incidents etc) Is this somewhat realistic?,2,11svcrl,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11svcrl/writing_a_character_who_quit_his_job_for_5_or_so/,8,"Obviously everyone's experience is different and my character still will struggle with PTSD symptoms from time to time but after 5 years of being away and being in regular therapy he feels ready and functional enough to return to work. 


He will continue therapy and he's not ""cured"" but he's functional enough to get back to work. 


When you read about a character or watch a character on tv who's treated for PTSD, how short of a time period of recovery is completely unrealistic or improbable to you? I've seen many shows where characters deal with PTSD symptoms from events in the episodes and they might be shown struggling for one or two episodes and then go to therapy and recover for one episode but it all theoretically seems to happen over a year or less of the character's life. This always felt very unrealistic to me but logically it makes sense for plot and writing purposes because the audience wants to ""move on"". 


I want there to be a time jump 5 years or so where my character has been away and this is mentioned frequently and my character is different returning and continues therapy



Edit to add additional information: 


The Trauma he experienced was quite severe so I wonder if 5 years would be enough recovery time for him but he's not against therapy even before his trauma and he has a very close relationship with his whole family as they have a pack dynamic. 

My character isn't human and is essentially like a human/wolf dog hybrid type of creature who can pass as a human with odd quirks and behaviours. Because the family is so involved with everyone (including the fact the the majority of family members all live together in a group of houses like a private gated community or... to outsiders they may seem like a cult) is heavily involved in his healing and recovery. They all partake in caring for him and doing therapy together. I might even have them all (or a significant number of them) travel together to a place away from their jobs in the countryside and they all just focus on reconnecting and healing without pressures of their lives. 


For additional context: I'm writing a tv show and/or graphic novel (it depends if the pilot gets picked up) but I like to think out the big plot points far ahead... this happens close to the end of the show up to 6 seasons or so. It is a a combination of a bunch of shows/movies that inspired me so it's like a combination of: Criminal Minds, Supernatural, Fringe,  The Blacklist, BBC Sherlock, X files, Men in Black etc. 

Essentially my characters are part of a secretive organization disguised as the RCMP/CSIS where they consult on or take over cases suspected to be dealing with paranormal or non human threats all over Canada. They investigate crimes committed by non human persons, crimes committed by humans against non human persons and cases like monsters and ghosts etc. The overall population of Canada is unaware that there is a significant number of non human people (aka monsters like vampires and werewolves etc) living (mostly) peacefully among them. 

However the trauma my character suffered was more than what people in the real world suffer. 

He was brutally murdered by a demon possessing his friend/work partner/beloved family member's body...so, seeing their body killing him face to face. 

Then in his death he's sent to purgatory (This is inspired by supernatural as I hope that ideally it could be like a spinoff show written in the same universe) where all non human creatures and monsters go when they die. He's stuck in this wilderness that's like the stuff of nightmares where he is forced to stay in his wolfdog-like form in order to stay alive and keep running away from all the creatures that would prey on him as the monsters have no other food sources other than each other. He's never stayed in his canine form for so long and he's forced to be animalistic for nearly a year. He never speaks to anyone or trusts anyone and he never resorts to hunting and killing for food. He survives off of picked over scraps of carcuses of humanoid creatures because he's starving. 

In life, he basically ate just like a human and even though technically he could eat raw meat no problem...he didn't. So starving, feeling like an animal, being constantly on the run and in fear, consuming the flesh of creatures that were people and look like him... yeah... it's awful. 

But my other main character manages to rescue him from purgatory and bring him home and in doing so he's brought back to life but the trauma of what he's been through take a toll on him. And the family is somewhat traumatized too because A) they mourned a family member who was murdered and murdered by a possessed family member B) They learn for the first time where they go after death which is a huge shock and is obviously very scary. 

So they spend the year mourning but also trying to figure out how to bring him back, how to stop the baddies who killed him and threaten the organization and their family and how to potentially change the outcome of where they end up after death. 


So it's a lot and the main character has gone through a lot more than the rest of them. Luckily my second main character is very understanding with him because she's had millennia of years on earth and many traumatic experiences and shame and guilt. For example: Living through thousands of wars but especially WW1 and WW2. She is somewhat damaged by all that she's seen so he knows that she would never judge him or push him in his recovery. 


I want to make sure that the ""problem"" of a character suffering from PTSD isn't solved by catching the bad guys or drinking or kicking butts and it's not going to be fixed in a few episodes



Also note; I'm not diagnosed with PTSD I do believe I have it or at least a mild case of it where it's never been debilitating per say. Lots of different smaller traumatizing events and health crisises etc. So I understand how triggers can work and how odd they can seem. 

For example, I have a weird sorta PTSD type of response subconsciously to when I smell mussels and curry. I ate curried mussels at a restaurant and I didn't know at the time but I'm very allergic to them so I thought I just had food poisoning. Ever since if I smell or taste curry it's like my subconscious freaks out and I get incredibly nauseous. 


Unfortunately because I didn't know that it wasn't food poisoning I ate a whole lot of mussels on Christmas eve a few years back and it's was So.Much.Worse. 


I legitimately thought I was going to die it was so bad. I won't go into extreme detail but let's just say that the force of being so sick burst the blood vessels in the whites of my eyes in the capillaries of the skin in my face and upper chest etc. 

So now smelling seafood and curry gets me very anxious and nauseous. 


But I've experienced other things like a severe mental and physical health crisis during college and 6 years later I still haven't healed from it and I have chronic anxiety ""nightmares"" of being back in school and having anxiety attacks. In that sense I do understand how PTSD can be debilitating to the day to day because I still struggle with the dreams and I have no recovered my self confidence to return to school again and handle the stress. 

And other stuff but the less common well known causes of PTSD that is associated with it.



Another one of my characters has PTSD but she's functional at her job despite occasionally having flashbacks but things like super strong thunderstorms trigger her because she was a nurse in WW2 and worked close to the front lines and had experienced bombing very close to their tents. 

The sound of thunder but especially the rumbling feeling in the air and in the ground sets her anxiety off.

He has a very supportive brother who's paying for his treatment, but his mother is the devil on earth, she thinks this whole situation is because he's lacking god in his life (she herself barely attend churches or seek good whatsoever) and she actually beats him up when he has crisis. 

They are very poor and only his older brother pays for everything in their house. His mother doesn't work and neither his wife, they both abuse the kids (17, 19 and 23 years old) often. The older brother stands against her and won't let her harm anyone when he's home, but he works all day to provide for the family. 

I told them to leave the house and go live by themselves but the older brother (who's also a good friend) told me that if they left her mom, she would probably live on the street, and she's also a suicidal so he doesn't feel like abandoning her is the right thing.

A person I went on a few dates with and I both have a history of trauma involving sexual assault and homelessness. After those few dates last winter, we stopped interacting for the most part last spring. Unfortunately, however, we ended up having several unplanned run-ins, one of which is nearly an hour away from where we go to college. During that run-in, though, I was about to leave when she arrived. I was alone while she was with someone, and I was riding a motorcycle which meant when she approached me after seeing me, I was very vulnerable. At that moment, I started getting scared, and wasn‚Äôt great at handling her concerns. Due to the run-ins, she thought, for clear reasons, that I was stalking/following her. Since then, we‚Äôve had several multi-hour long discussions about it involving her asking me a substantial amount of personal questions and describing a lot of assumptions she had made, too many for me to address. Since then, we‚Äôve reached a point where we ignore each other in passing, but I still feel my heart race whenever I see her and get nervous and we‚Äôve both left rooms to avoid each other. In another set of circumstances, we could have been friends, but as it stands, we keep retriggering each other. I have no idea what to do and every time I‚Äôve talked to her, it feels like I‚Äôm talking to a different person because she says almost the opposite of the previous conversation. When we last talked in October, she didn‚Äôt know what she wanted, and said she‚Äôd decide, but when I reached out a few weeks later about it, she never replied. I just want to stop having nightmares about this and reacting when I see her. She isn‚Äôt aware that I‚Äôm scared, so it‚Äôs also not like it‚Äôs her fault, and I don‚Äôt want to tell her after our last conversation involving me being vulnerable in a way I didn‚Äôt want.

This is something I've kept bottled up. I haven't told anyone about my thoughts. I just try to laugh about it. The only one I've remotely revealed this to is a firefighter/medic friend of mine. Laughter has always been my way of dealing with negative things.-A few years ago, I came across someone who was pretty much dead. I can say with certainty that it was an opioid overdose. I had to do CPR and can remember everything from the labored gasps every 10 seconds, the crunching with compressions, to his cold skin, etc. He was ice cold even through thick nitrile gloves. I couldn't find a pulse, but I feel like I may have missed it. What really hurt me is the number of people that passed by him prior to me arriving. Even while doing compressions, people passed by without even slowing down to look. I disagree with his life choices, but it doesn't mean that he deserved to die. I've spent a great deal of time trying to feel my own pulse with the same gloves (new pair), and I'm able to do it every single time. I'm crying just typing this out even though it has been years. When I got home, I completely broke down, and I still do when thinking about it. I see videos of situations like this and realize that I had been staring at the screen but not consciously as it replays like a movie in my head. I keep questioning whether I made myself look like an idiot in front of the fire department, who I admire. Actually, admire would be an understatement. I hate looking stupid.-Everyone who knows about it gives me a pat on the back and tells me that I saved his life, but I feel so much guilt. I wonder if I missed his pulse or overreacted. They found a pulse when they put the EKG stickers on. I just can't forget this. I don't deserve the title of 'PTSD' (as if it was some award). I haven't been to combat or seen a pile of bodies. I've never been abused. I've seen someone soaked in blood from head to toe and helped them, but it didn't do this to me. I just don't know. I can't minimize those experiences just because I'm weak.-The big thing is I can't figure out why I go out of my way to revisit that location. I become on edge when I go there, looking for another OD. I carry a stethoscope and narcan now because I don't want to look like an idiot. I've spent hours studying advanced first-aid. I've been blessed to be at the right place at the right time and administered aid to many people until the medics arrive, but I felt good about those events. This one, not so much. I don't know what to do about it. I don't want my family to know how I truly feel about it because they praised me. Maybe I want to be a hero. Maybe I want to save others. Maybe I want to be more useful. I don't know what it is. I try to go out of my way to help anyone, whether it be medically or if they're broken down. I feel an obligation to sacrifice myself for others.

Oddly enough, I'd love to be a firefighter/medic, but after this, I don't know if I could handle it. If I can make somebody's day better or save their life, maybe it'd help.-I think I'm just rambling at this point, but I needed to get these feelings out and I hope you can make sense of them.

TW: Mentions of child abuse and neglect 


I grew up with my momma, my brother and I lived with her 99% of the time as my parents are divorced and my biological dad didn't seem to care about me growing up. I have a younger brother, who he always treated way better than me while at his house. My bio dad is a huge narcissist with bipolar 1. He refuses treatment because he believes he is perfect, with no issues at all. His gf was a disabled 3rd grade teacher in a wheelchair. Something else I should probably note, I am disabled with arthritis and had it since I was 8. My dad never tried to sympathize, he only cared about her and my younger brother (who was also treated like a king by the gf). I was always treated like trash. Insults of my weight grew from him due to my disability. He would always call me fat, piggie, etc. His gf would constantly snap at me, getting mad simply because she was jealous I loved my momma and not her, NEVER her. Why was she so jealous? Because she couldn't have kids due to her disability, and was jealous I had a momma who loves me as a child. My momma is my rock and will be till the end of time, she was and is the only adult that cares about both my brother and I, and she makes sure to get us everything we needed and wanted.


 My dad only really cared about his money and sex. He would constantly cheat, and I tried to warn the gf but she put me down. His gf is now single, has cried apologizing for how bad she treated me, has tried to tell me I was right all along, has given me money for my high school graduation, and has tried to make amends... But I'm not putting up with her shit anymore, blocked her on Facebook so she couldn't try to message me.
My dad is still around till this day and has literally 5% custody of my little brother, who now also refuses to visit him, so I still get called fat by him every now and then if he tries to pick my brother up, and we fight verbally if he tries to pull some narcissistic bullshit, but we mainly keep to ourselves. 

Due to constant nightmares of trying to escape his house and the panic attacks occurring more and more, I went to my psychiatrist. My psychiatrist diagnosed me with PTSD a few years back. I was just recently put on Prazosin for the nightmares, works great!


My problem is that I don't feel like I'm traumatized enough to have PTSD. I constantly compare my trauma to other PTSD patients, the absolute abuse they would describe feels absolutely a million times worse than mine, so what am I doing with PTSD if the trauma isn't nearly enough like other people?? I understand that his gf and him were abusive, but I don't think it's enough to develop PTSD, simply because I don't believe it was traumatic enough. My brother and I lived with our amazing momma 99% of the time, and my dad would pick us up for dinner every other week for a day or so. I lived with her my entire life, and she goes head over heels to make my brother and I happy. I am so loved by her, she's my favorite person in the world.


So the big question remains, how do I have PTSD?? I lived with her (and still do)  LITERALLY all the time, barely had visitation with my dad since I absolutely refused to go as a kid. How does that little time spent with him cause me to have PTSD? I wasn't hit or beaten, I wasn't SA'd, there's no reason why I should have this, my trauma to me simply isn't even remotely enough to have the same PTSD diagnosis like others have.


Does anyone else feel like their trauma wasn't enough to develop PTSD? Is this normal to consider? I feel like I'm all alone in this because I'm the only one who has it in my family. Others have also agreed with me and have told me that I shouldn't have PTSD because I wasn't traumatized enough. I figured that at least I could vent about it here, maybe someone else feels the same way.


Edit 1: Thank you guys so much for the kind comments and advice. Before I wrote all this, I truly believed that I had no right to have PTSD. Or trauma. I've felt like this for 3 years with therapists along the way, but nobody truly understood how I felt. Somehow, these comments made me realize that I do have ACTUAL PTSD, even though I was diagnosed, I felt like my PTSD was a mockery of others with it. I still need to work out how to process the trauma, but I feel like today I made a step towards understanding my PTSD, for the first actual time in my life. Thank you guys so much for the help,  I'm finally realizing that my trauma is valid.",1678909310.0

TW: SA

It did not go well at all. My newly placed IUD is probably being rejected by my body. Long story short I'm in excruciating pain and that's why I needed to see him.

7 months ago a male doctor was checking my heart and lungs and he had his hands on my breasts instead of my back orbshoulder. He also started touching my thighs. I haven't seen a male doctor since.

I had to make a urgent appointment because of the pain and was able to get squeezed in today. I knew it was a male doctor but I thought I could handle it. You never know how bad it is until you're faced with the possibility again.

I want to say that the doctor did nothing wrong and was just doing his job. He was sorta holding the side of my stomach/hips to check for pain. He was pressing down on my stomach/ top of my vagina to check for pain. That's when I started to cry.

There was a nurse in the room btw. I had to hold her hand. Then he was about to do the exam and I completely lost it. I started sobbing very loudly and said I couldn't do it and he said that's completely OK. 

I had the biggest panic attack I've ever had. I was able to reschedule tomorrow with my regular OBGYN but I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight. I don't want to deal with the nightmares. 

Again this is not the doctors fault he did everything right. He was a nice doctor I just couldn't handle it.",1678909073.0

We didn't place the cause at the time, but after that she hit about a 2 week period of time where she couldn't function. She lost her job because she couldn't bring herself to go. Eventually she managed to regroup, got a new better job and things were back on track. 

About 2 weeks ago, psycho changed his number again, sent her another text. Once again she wasn't able to go into work, and honestly this time it's even worse. She woke up with me once and said she just had a flashback that she was with him again. I just kept repeating to her ""You are in our warm bed, no one is going to take you from here, you are welcome here as long as you want"" (psycho regularly forced her to sleep in the yard). 


Anyway, I finally convinced her to change her phone number (was hard for her, it's a number she shared with her husband so it has strong sentimental pull). She has an MD she talks to every few months, I think maybe I can try and get her other help (she's afraid of therapists that use notebooks), she's currently on adavan and prazoin. 

This time it's worse than the previous... it seems like it's escalating and I have no idea how to help her. I'm sure her losing this job is a matter of time, I'm working on trying to find her a work from home job. But in the meantime just trying to figure out what to do to start her feeling normal again. I've tried helping her handle small trips out. Monday I was able to get her to go to the gym with me for 30 minutes. Tuesday it took a very long amount of time to convince her to come with me to pick up a sub from a place right next door. Today she couldn't even bring herself go to visit her friend that lives in the same appartment building as us, she says she couldn't bring herself to get out of the bed today except to go to the bathroom, can't even bring herself to eat the half of the sub she had left in the fridge.


I'm at a loss, is trying to push her for small safe trips with me doing more harm than good. Her losing her job again is going to suck, but it's not the end of the world, I can keep us afloat.  I know there's no magic bullet, I'm trying so hard to help her through this one, and get her able to do the things she likes to do again, but I'm out of my depth by far... I don't know what to do to start her into the path of stability again. I feel like the things I'm doing are making things worse.",1678921775.0

Since I dealt with a pretty significant loss in court to my abusers over a month ago, I ended up spiraling into a full blown relapse. 

- I‚Äôve started having flashbacks more often and nightmares again even though I take medications designed to help me sleep through the night peacefully, so even in sleep, I get no peace. And I‚Äôve started talking in my sleep now to where I end up disturbing my own sleep.

- Eating has become difficult to where I can‚Äôt even bring myself to eat or I flat out just forget to eat for an entire day at a time or longer. I‚Äôve had days where I don‚Äôt even eat at all.

- I‚Äôm having serious trouble focusing at work so much to where I‚Äôm exhibiting old OCD symptoms that were caused by my PTSD in the beginning and it‚Äôs so exhausting dealing with these repetitions to where I have literally started to fall asleep while I‚Äôm working and am getting to the point to where sometimes I don‚Äôt even think I can work anymore even though I love my job. 

- Hyper-vigilance has become a constant state of being for me. I‚Äôm easily startled and jumpy, and when I‚Äôm angry or upset, I end up having outbursts and snapping at people I love very much.

- And now, even worse, the past couple of weeks I‚Äôve started socially withdrawing from everyone in my life, and I don‚Äôt mean to, but lately, mentally, I find the idea of isolating myself and sleeping because I never feel rested or like I ever get enough sleep so much better than being around other people.

I really don‚Äôt know how to cope with this. I thought it was job burnout but I‚Äôm starting to realize that I‚Äôm actually relapsing, and I don‚Äôt really know how to start feeling better until my next psychiatry appointment. I feel like I never have any energy or motivation or happiness and I don‚Äôt even feel like myself anymore. 

**My question:**

Have any of you ever been through a serious relapse, and how did you overcome it? And how long does it take to recover? 

I have survived trauma throughout my life and have dealt with minor warning signs of a relapse many times, but this time I‚Äôm actually struggling with a major one.

Rape, interpersonal violence, etc. After being diagnosed when I was younger I did some intense therapy to try and subdue my triggers (ex: panic attacks from sirens, smelling smoke, etc.) In my adult life I met with a therapist post abusive relationships and did some massive work with her as well.

My doctor never documented it. When I started mentioning bits and pieces in school no one reported it apparently. As far as the system is concerned, I‚Äôm lying and absolutely nothing happened.

 was one of the worse things for me most of the time because of the sheer scope of devastation it‚Äôs caused me.  
I‚Äôve been told multiple times it‚Äôs not my fault and I don‚Äôt believe it deep down because if it wasn‚Äôt my fault then why was it never reported by the at least 6 or so adults in my life ever?

Why am I at this stage? Why did no one care at any point to do something? Why when I had a mental breakdown after remembering the entire thing did people just disappear because they didn‚Äôt want to deal with the fallout of their mistake if never getting me help?
I feel neglected and unwanted, no one fought for me and those that said they would were just all talk. 
If it truly wasn‚Äôt my fault then why did no one in my life ever care about doing the right thing when they had no problem doing it for another family friends kid when a similar event occurred?

One of my first reactions when my therapist asked if I had ever considered PTSD was ""but I've never been in a war or anything.""

I know PTSD doesn't discriminate on what the trauma was and that people get PTSD over a variety of traumatic events. Most of the time, I recognize the things that happened to me were traumatic and that I have mental and physical symptoms related to those events. I match so many of the symptoms, so I don't doubt that I have PTSD.

Today I am struggling with something I get every so often: ""it wasn't that bad."" I think that's because I was able to lock away the experiences and not deal with them (consciously, at least). Now that I am aware, it feels like I am constantly finding new triggers, and it has kind of ruined my sex life. I used to be hypersexual, but now I get so anxious and distracted that I avoid it. I feel like I am moving backwards.

The feeling is, like, I am ding this to myself. I am manifesting these symptoms because I am crazy or want attention or something. (I hide my MH stuff around everyone but some of my immediate family, so I know that idea is silly, but I still feel it.)

And I keep coming back to ""it wasn't that bad. You are overreacting."" Like yes, some people have gone through worse experiences than me, but I am still hurt. I try to keep in mind the example of ""someone who drowns in 2 feet of water is just as dead as someone who drowns in 200 feet."" But it's hard not to feel like I am being attention seeking or looking for an alternative to just being depressed/anxious (because that feels like a personal shortcoming without a cause). 

I am so mean to myself. Why do I feel the need to dismiss my trauma? Anyone else do this? Peace to everyone.",1678883736.0

TRIGGERS WARNING!

Hello... I don't know how to start this, please I only ask you to read everything completely before judging me, because I don't even know if this is a trauma or if I am a horrible person in reality.. .
I am a 17 year old teenager, when I was 15 I had a boyfriend who was 1 year younger than me, that is, he was 14, but he was exposed to all kinds of pornography from a very young age, and he was very knowledgeable about it, despite of his young age. I had also seen porn as a child but nothing out of the ""normal"". In one of our talks, he confessed to me that he had seen zoophilic and pedophile porn and that he liked it but that he would never act on it, because he had been abused as a child, he did not know how to take it, I just understood and told him that it did not affect anything. , well, he just saw and didn't hurt anyone, but nevertheless I suggested that he talk it over with his therapist. HE got angry with me and told me that he would never tell anyone about it, and he stopped talking to me for 2 hours, until his anger passed (he always did this, it was a kind of constant manipulation that existed in our relationship) In During this conversation I confessed that I liked to see murder cases and stuff, but sometimes they were so murky that my body reacted badly, and anxiety, anger, etc. they became a kind of excitement(?) but it overwhelmed me. , instead of making me feel good or something (this is important because he would use it against me later...).
How our relationship was based more on virtuality when we were in a pandemic, we were sexting... (here comes the most horrible thing, please if you are sensitive or think it could be a trigger, don't read this!!) In one of those times that we did sexting, he wanted to try me and told me to watch a video referring to bestiality, he sent me the link and iodine, but I didn't want to see it, because it disgusts me, no It didn't turn me on or anything, I told him that, but he got angry and he treated me badly, so I felt obliged to tell him that if I liked him... I shouldn't have done it because I became his sex toy :( of course I had to obey everything he asked, because if he didn't he would get angry (had happened before but not as often) from acceptable to shady fetishes... I don't know why I agreed to do all that, the truth is I regret it every day of my life, but I was very afraid of losing it, I was afraid of doing it angry, I did not want to make him feel bad, for a long time I repressed this, but now it came back and the lpa and disgust are killing me, I know I didn't like any fetish that I fulfilled, because I felt pressured to do it, but sometimes that pressure turned into excitement :( and no DO YOU KNOW IF I REALLY LIKED IT? And am I going into victim mode to not accept who I really am? Because I tried myself several times and those fetishes disgust me and reject me. And I know I would never do it again, but sometimes I feel like I should be in jail and I should die.",1678903823.0

I‚Äôll do my best to tell my story. I‚Äôve been a law enforcement officer for the past 20 years in a large metropolitan area. I‚Äôve had a good career and enjoyed several coveted assignments, gang unit, undercover narcotics, homicide detective. It was the dream career that young officer coming out of the academy would hope for. Over the years I‚Äôve been around at least 100 murders, many more shootings, dead children, fights, car wrecks, stabbing, suicides, all of it. A few years I was involved in two officer involved shootings in the same year. Never was involved in one before that and haven‚Äôt been in one since. Right after that year I still felt fine. During the riots in 2020 I was involved in some heavy undercover work around the riots and was nearly robbed and attacked while working undercover. 

Shortly after the riots I started feeling off. I‚Äôd spend my days dwelling on past calls or instances, even some from early in my career. Replaying the shootings, the dead bodies, going through scenarios in my head of car chases, fights, etc.. just occupying my thoughts with these things. My sleep went to hell around this same time and for the most part now I can‚Äôt fall asleep, have terrible insomnia, when I do finally fall asleep I try to lay in bed until the very last minute I can until I‚Äôm almost late for work or I‚Äôll sleep half my day off away and miss my family.

I started to notice the problem and decided it was the best for me to leave the big city police work and relocate my family to a rural part of the country and get a cop job with a department that nothing happens and has no crime rate. 

I‚Äôve been there now for six months and I feel like its getting worse. Like now ALL I can think about is those incidents from my past. And how I‚Äôd rather be there at least in the mix. It kind of reminds me of the hotel freak out scene from the movie apocalypse now.  It‚Äôs consuming me and I can‚Äôt figure out how to free my mind of the thoughts and situations from my past. I want a fresh start. Or just a reset.

My wife isn‚Äôt really much help, she gives me these ideas and solutions that are not helpful at all ‚Äúread a book, get a hobby, make new friends‚Äù isn‚Äôt really helpful when I‚Äôm haunted by my own head constantly. 

I also can‚Äôt talk to my real friends about this either because they will think I‚Äôm weak.

They wouldn‚Äôt believe me if I said I might have ptsd. I don‚Äôt even know if I have ptsd.

I do know that because I have kids and worry about them I would never hurt myself. So at least I have that going.

I've been in a few relationships \~6-9 months over the past years, through college. Some were awful, some were okay. The last one I completely torpedoed because of my unprocessed trauma and tendency to be highly reactive. He was a good person, a sweet, sensitive soul, and comforted me and told me to ""trust myself"" when we parted. I regret many of my actions, my distrust towards someone who was trustworthy, and the pain I caused that broke apart an initially good connection.

It's been almost a year since that last breakup, and I am moving forward in my life. I've also finally been able to talk to my close friends about how I experienced physical, emotional abuse, and witnessed physical, emotional, and sexual violence as a child. Even though I had read about those experiences in the abstract, I was so far in denial and pushed down those experiences. I feel ashamed sometimes to think that it took me over a decade to tell anyone about this, even in vague terms. But I'm finally feeling better in my own body, and think I could be a good partner to someone.

Currently I have a job, friend circle, and am building community through sports and volunteering - and mostly am okay on my own.

How does one go about restarting to date? How does one know that they won't repeat the same mistakes of letting their emotional reactions take over? What does it look like to actually trust a new person in your life?

I am keeping a meditation, yoga, and exercise routine, getting better at diet and sleep habits. Unfortunately my therapist is terminally ill, and doesn't have much energy - I haven't had the heart to find a new one yet, even though I'm not benefiting from the current sessions because I can't stop thinking about her dying.

My partner and I both (likely) have PTSD. I have diagnosed PTSD following an abusive relationship and assault in adulthood, and my partner (who has not been diagnosed) also has a history of an abusive relationship and assaults in his late adolescence. We have been struggling lately as both of us have relationship trauma, but seem to keep triggering each other. For example, I am uncomfortable with having someone know my location constantly or having to constantly be texting someone due to experiences in my past, and he is uncomfortable if I do not tell him what I am doing or text his regularly throughout the day because of his past. We try and find compromises, but a lot of our miscommunications get escalated and both of us end up spiraling and being overly defensive. Reading books on PTSD really helped me in treatment, but I have been struggling to find any about couples where both partners have PTSD. All I've found is about when one person in the relationship has PTSD and how their non-traumatized partner can support, but I need something a little more specific for us. 

TL;DR, are there any resources (like books, articles, etc.) about relationships where both partners have PTSD? Or anyone have any personal experiences on how they've been able to work with their partner to find compromises and understanding? 

On a side note, my partner is not currently able to go to therapy (hopefully soon!). He has been in therapy before, but didn't find a lot of help in the typical coping skills. We also really struggle with finding coping skills for him when the common ones don't do much for him.",1678795209.0

Although I do plan to get it back it's still hard.  And for a second there I was thinking I am insane for being so codependent on something material (although I work on it, which will make fixing my situation a bit more complex.

A-a-anyway. After I had my pity-party yesterday, today I made a list of what to do before pawning it.  Like the practical removing info just in case and all that. And then I wanted to sort out why I keep procrastinating on it and then it really hit a PTSD trigger. When I got PTSD I was away from home, and also didn't have a smart phone at the time, my phone didn't work in the country I went so I was using payphones (yes in this day and age). I had thought I would find work easily as well as a place to stay... ended up having to do a lot more than I thought on a phone or computer, borrowing electronics from my later abusers, using 30min library computer use a day to look for jobs and... well anyway, that summer was the closest I've been to many messed up scary situations, experienced many of them, got multiple traumas and had no resources to get out of it. I mean I got out but ... I hadn't taken my laptop because I somehow thought all will workout and I will earn enough to get a new one. I didn't. I felt cut off from options, I was cutoff from many options, because I hadn't known how the city worked. I hadn't known I would need to search for the place of living and the job more online than offline. I hadn't known how wrong things would get and how helpful it would have been to not be constantly cut off from my friends and relying on my abuser for the first month and a half to relay messages for jobs from his phone. I didn't know how many comforts my laptop had provided them and without them in the middle of life-threatening situations I had no clue how not to lose every layer of what or who I thought I was. I thought I was shattered so bad that I'd never get most pieces back.

I know I'm giving up a material thing for only 30 days, and I still have my half-broken, slow-working but still working old laptop. That I will still somehow do everything, just slower. That this time I'm not away from my friends and not cut off from family and NOT in danger. I know all of that.

But for some reason giving it up stirred that old trigger, that hurricane of memories, which made me cry for 2 hours straight. I can't get rid of that feeling I guess. That if I hadn't been this stupid to assume things and leave my laptop at home- maybe I would have found another place to move away from those people, or found a job faster or something, anything, instead of being cut off from the world without books, music, internet, my email, my friends, my parents, and OPTIONS. Giving up this laptop will be for a short time(I hope so) but it does dig into that feeling. That if I had my laptop it would have changed the variables to my side and maybe I wouldn't have been in that HELL for 4 months. 

I know it's a stupid trigger, but it got to me. 

So I'm letting it be, and I will enjoy this last night with this laptop (for now), and I will journal. And then I will do what I have to and give it up for a moment/a month/etc. And cope. It just hit me hard for a second. And just when I start thinking I know my triggers so very well... PTSD does not seize to surprize you.",1678819485.0

I am not sure if he sa‚Äôed me, but I haven‚Äôt asked my mother or sibling about it (since they remember the abuse) 

My sibling was sexually assaulted by a man 2-3 years ago and I do harbor guilt towards that since I did kinda feel off about him (which i didn‚Äôt realize until afterwards, I wasn‚Äôt there when it happened) They have a boyfriend which they bring over and do stuff with him (which I can hear all of it since their room is right next to mine) Its just the bed banging against the wall but it still disturbs me. I feel psychically ill after it and sometimes I feel like crying. I‚Äôm having trouble discerning if im just incredibly paranoid over something that didn‚Äôt happen to me, or if these dreams and a possible memory are all real. Its eating me alive",1678738835.0

I went to sleep last night with just an strong weed edible in my body. I usually drink everyday, not to get totally drunk but to keep the nightmares away. I once used weed, melatonin, exercise‚Ä¶those things worked for awhile. 

But two years ago we (myself & other survivors) started the process of taking our abuser to court. As we shared our stories, repressed memories came back. As I saw his face, memories came back. As I spoke to his lawyer, I got passively blamed for my rape. 

In these two years, weed, melatonin, exercise couldn‚Äôt subdue the harrowing nightmares anymore. Alcohol could. 

I dont see myself as a ‚Äúsad drunk‚Äù which is delusional, objectively. I am a very joyful, comical, animated person - drinking or sober. I don‚Äôt cry when I‚Äôm drunk, I mostly just find things to laugh about. Avoid seriousness like the plague. Of course, its always the extroverted ones who suffer the most.

Last night I went to sleep without a drop. I had a nightmare that I was being stalked & groomed for sex trafficking. When I caught him the police didn‚Äôt believe me and neither did my parents. In fact, he used the power of speech to convince my parents to help him with his next victim. I was in sleep paralysis - knew I was sleeping but couldn‚Äôt wake up. I had dialed ‚Äú911‚Äù on my phone - in real life, because I was so scared. 

Today I feel worse than a hangover. I feel fragile and sore in my heart and body. 

I dont know where I‚Äôm going with this post. I just feel helpless that I can‚Äôt cope healthy anymore since the trial. And that poisoning my body every night comes easier than suffering through these nightmares.",1678748115.0

I was raped by my aunt when she was 12 and I was 5. I‚Äôve gone through the so much since fully realizing my trauma and in that time I‚Äôve struggled to go to the police.  It was never reported despite a pediatrician and childhood psychiatrist being notified, they instead told my family they were on the fence as to if something happened so they suggested I‚Äôd forget due to being so young and that there wasn‚Äôt a reason to separate my rapist and myself. 
So I basically grew up : birthdays, vacations, cooking, baking doing everyday basics and errands all of those memories are tainted and come right to the surface. I have a hard time finding and maintaining a job despite weekly therapy, meds and a psych. 
Recently I was working up the courage to try and finally report it to the police since no one ever did it and there‚Äôs no actual record of it happening. I‚Äôve been very reluctant because I‚Äôve spoken to survivors who did or are going through the process. I know I‚Äôll be re traumatized again and again by people who don‚Äôt know how to handle it and will likely not say or do anything to help make this horrific process easier.  You will be dismissed, your trauma will be minimized and scrutinized even with proof and hopefully they actually document it. 
I was planning on bringing my father because I loyalty have no one else and for the most part he‚Äôs very supportive because he knows it‚Äôs true. He was there that night and 5 year old me came down and told immediately after it happened.
Well I finally asked and I didn‚Äôt get the response I needed nor expected.  He got very cagey and dismissed the idea that it would really do much and kept telling me he‚Äôd go with me but I‚Äôd better be sure of what I was doing and it was said with anger and some fear I could sense. He seemed reluctant to go and decided it would be a good idea to remind me if I did this it would effect more than just me. 
I saw red and said I wouldn‚Äôt be had to do if someone in power at the time had. I blame the doctors first and my parents at a certain point because they knew and pretended like nothing happened but don‚Äôt say this aloud generally. 
I felt nothing but anger and disappointment. It doesn‚Äôt matter that he says he‚Äôll go, the way he sis it and other things he said, I don‚Äôt trust him with this anymore. Barely spoken more than 5 words to him since then. Less cold shoulder, I truly have nothing to say. What good would it do to chastise him on my disappointment or right to justice? 
And then I found out from one of the few I confided about my rape actually went and asked if they remembered anything. They said ‚Äòyes , we were playing doctor. ‚Äò according to the source and the source has no reason to lie. 

I never want want see my rapist again, I want them punished, I want it known what she did. I want them on the registry I want a restraining order I want them gone from my life. I don‚Äôt want to be afraid to go outside. I so sick of worrying that I always see them out of the corner of my eye. I‚Äôm sick of feeling like the shameful family secret that needs to be kept in the dark. 

I‚Äôm just silent now, he tried joking with me today and I truly felt nothing so I didn‚Äôt react and he didn‚Äôt speak to me much today. 

And now I feel I have no one by my side to go to the police with. The others I confided in aren‚Äôt an option. And now I‚Äôm worried I should seek a lawyer before I do nothing and I can‚Äôt afford that.  I‚Äôm lost once again",1678756325.0

I did go through some minor trauma when I was SA'd as a kid however and the consequences are still catching up to me. I don't know where else I could discuss this, so I'm sorry for interfering this space. 

Now onto the issue. As I already said, I was SA'd as a child. Back then, I started to be afraid of men. I wanted to work on this with my therapist to nip the issue in the bud, but she deemed that it wasn't serious enough to discuss so I tried to work on it on my own. It worked and the fear disappeared, but then I got into a relationship. 

The guy was nothing but sweet to me, but I couldn't felt but feel scared. I had panic attacks, my anxiety got worse than it ever was and I had to break up with him because my mental state worsened so much in that relationship. 

After the breakup, I got better again. Much better. There were setbacks, but I got to the point where I could even let a guy get close enough to sleep with me and I had no fear, no issues, no flashbacks, no nothing.

And now I'm in a relationship again, 5 years after the previous one ended and the same pattern is happening again. He's incredibly sweet and gentle, but I can't help but feel scared and anxious, it got to the point where I can't even hide it anymore. He noticed it,  we had a discussion and he's doing his best to calm me down anytime I spiral down again, but it's been too frequent to my liking. 

I don't know what the triggers are, I've been in relationships without anything happening, I've been able to get close with guys without anything happening, but the two relationships where I've been with seemingly perfect guys I can genuinely say I love/loved, it's been the absolute worse. I don't want this relationship to end like the previous one did and I don't want my boyfriend to make me feel all these negative emotions when he's done nothing to set them off.

Can I even do anything? Will it get better? It's been around 9 years since the initial incident and it's not like it's even been bad enough to warrant this kind of reaction. I got better over and over again yet I always fall back. I'm really lost. I want to be a good partner, yet I don't feel like I can be with all those things setting me back.

My episodes have been worse as of late. I have been reliving the trauma involuntarily, namely at night. As a means of coping with it, I do something I call ""rewriting"". I have the belief my mind, in some sense, is still in that moment perpetually shocked at what I have seen. And I am forced to see and relive it, however, what I try to do is rewrite the moment by hugging those that have failed me and hurt me the most. I try my best to face it through pushing myself to forgive in order to move on. It is no miracle cure, but it's my personal way of making the moment more digestible.

I try to think about the positives of the moment like my sibling's support during the tragedy. And I try to speak positive (NOT EXCUSE) of those that hurt me to try to avoid resentment building inside me. I try to be genuine about the compliments, even if some of the actors there were strangers, I do surface level comments (i.e I think your hair is nice! I like your shirt!). Or imagine giving them a platonic hug or giving them a gift.

Because I know that what they did was terrible, and I am suffering. I am in my right to step away from them permanently, say the worst things about them, curse them to hell and back. But I find forgiving them to be the hardest thing, and that's how I know that forgiving them is the best way for me to cope and deal with my trauma personally. They took something that I don't know will come back. But I wouldn't wish the same on them. It's like an exercise.

I get exhausted continuously forgiving. It's not easy. It's not a cure. I don't do it every day and would not recommend anyone to force forgiveness every single day because it is a mental effort to do so. It's not even reasonable to some or my family. But it makes me stronger in my own way.

I don't know if this post will help anyone, but I just wanted to share what helps me in hopes of potentially helping someone out there. Just to tell you that while you can't rewrite the past, we may have the ability to rewrite how we feel towards it with time and slowly move on.  Thanks for reading!",1678728994.0

I go to school and study electrical engineering,I climb ice, am getting into alpinism and generally do extreme outdoors things, I think it‚Äôs a product of a heightened fight or flight that I can‚Äôt get over. 

Anyways! Now to the part I really need some advice on‚Ä¶

I didn‚Äôt know how to socialize with other people since the abuse happened at ages where you usually learn that type of thing but last year I managed to make real friends, it didn‚Äôt feel like I had to fake it around them the whole time and I think I‚Äôm getting to that point with some people this year too. My problem is that when I get to a certain point my gut reaction is to disappear for a few weeks to stop getting close to them. I‚Äôve been seeing a guy recently too and it was nice, fun, relaxed at first when I didn‚Äôt think I liked him that much but after having a few really fun times with him something in me changed. I feel less relaxed and less able to joke or be myself around him, I feel pressure for some reason and my gut reaction is to ghost him (he‚Äôs my neighbor so I can‚Äôt tho, shouldn‚Äôt anyways). Can anyone help me put what‚Äôs going on more concisely/help me figure out how to work thru it? I don‚Äôt want my relationship w him to be ruined, or my other friends for that matter. Any input is appreciated 

Another thing: no one knows what happened 10-16, I know it would provide a lot of context to the people I care about in regards to how I act sometimes.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Fresh out of a relationship with someone I am now realizing was a covert narcissist and have no one to talk, writing this post to help process and feel less lonely.

I am 32 and have CPTSD from childhood trauma. As part of CPTSD, I have a lot of fears about trusting people, especially men. I recently started a treatment program specifically for PTSD and was feeling slightly more hopeful.

A few months into treatment I met the man of my dreams online. He was shy, funny, intelligent, respectful, kind, generous and so many other wonderful things. He made himself appear extremely gentle and calm. I felt a deep connection to him the second I started talking to him. Like me, he also had a childhood trauma background and was in therapy to work on himself. He admitted he had bipolar disorder but was on medication and had a track record of stability.

It's hard to find people who believe in taking care of their mental health. I shared little videos on PTSD and childhood trauma and he acted like it resonated with him and I believed we could build a stable, healthy future together. I saw hopeful things on social media, like a post saying ""the universe puts the right man in your life during your healing era"" and I let myself begin to believe that that was true and him being in my life was a sign I was on the right path.

There were red flags. Before we met in person he had a panic attack and kept me up until 3 in the morning on the phone saying scary things about thinking I was out to get him. He had mentioned before that his mental health issues included some paranoia so I spent a few hours on the phone comforting him. At the end of that discussion he said he really appreciated how patient I was with him and how no one had ever treated him that way and that by staying up comforting him I had shown him we could have a relationship built on mutual compassion and empathy. I believed his victim narrative that he had been mistreated in the past and hoped I had shown him I could weather the storm, and knowing I would also have moments where I would falter I thought he would be understanding and compassionate for me in the future.

He came out to see me. It started rocky. His grandfather had recently died, he had at some recent health complications and he even said it wasn't unexpected. We'd been talking for months at this point and I was surprised by how hard he took the death. Someone I had never heard of was now a very influential, inspirational person in his life. He spent a solid week leading up to seeing me milking the death of his grandfather for comfort. I gave him the benefit of the doubt. The day he was supposed to fly to see me I could sense he was irritable but I wasn't sure why.

He showed up to the air bnb I rented and he was much more charming than I had expected. I fell in love with him immediately. The week went really well and he was extremely delightful and attentive with one major exception:

The first night he showed up I made a move on him and ended up giving him a blowjob. He finished and then acted like he had no interest in reciprocating, which was very unlike the person I had been talking to online who had portrayed themselves as someone who would rather give than receive. I was immediately icked out and was like ""uhhh what"" and he shut down super hard and was struggling to respond. I could tell his response was mostly shame but there was some anger in there that worried me. He didn't yell or get violent or anything, he just physically shut down and was very measured in his speaking. After he calmed down he mentioned that I had said something to the effect of ""I will give you a blowjob for taking the trouble to fly across the country"" and even though I was like ""I wouldn't want my first sexual encounter with someone to be one-sided even if someone said something like that to me"" I took him at face value. Not only that, but he brought his dead grandpa into it and was like ""I can't believe you'd treat me like this after knowing everything I've been through with my grandpa dying...I didn't even want to make the trip but I still did"".

We got over that moment and the next morning he was super charming and seemed like someone who just needed someone to love them. I talked to him about love languages and had him do the online quiz and he struggled with the questions. One question was ""would you rather receive a gift from your loved one or hear them say I love you?"" he said gift and his response was ""saying I love you can be manipulated or misused, but a gift is a gift."" This broke my heart. I felt so bad about how this sad little man must have been treated to say such a thing. I stopped the quiz and comforted him. I told him I loved him by the end of the trip.

He came to see me a month later, he didn't want me to be alone for christmas which for me was a really big gesture. The vibe was kind of off. We had a few little fights (again about him being sexually selfish despite on the internet proclaiming to be quite the opposite). I felt a bit like I was struggling to keep his interest despite his words saying he was crazy about me. The last day he was here we had a big fight. Something I said hit a nerve with him. I apologized and tried to explain but he was cold to me until he left for the airport.

I felt anxious about the way we parted and when he got home I wanted to talk to him about it  to make sure we were ok. When he heard that my topic for discussion was not showering him with love for making the trip he responded with ""OH WOW"" and shut the conversation down immediately saying he couldn't believe I would do this to him after such a long trip. I ended up breaking up with him as part of this conversation because he was being so wild but it's almost like when someone is being so insane your brain wants to make it make sense and give them the benefit of the doubt so I forgave him.

A few months go by. I get little tastes of the real side of him. One time I turned down a request to fool around over the internet and he mentioned something to the effect of just wanting to make sure I was taken care of so I don't go get it from somewhere else. I got upset and asked him why he would say that. He got really mad at me and turned the situation into ""you don't let me express myself"" and not ""I just passively implied you would cheat on me"". He knew I liked that he was in therapy so after this fight he told me his therapist was on my side, I took this in place of a real apology and I think he learned he could get away with bad behavior if he made it look like he was talking to his therapist about it trying to improve.

Despite all this, he was super loving and attentive. Very love bomby. He wanted to talk to me on the phone during his commute home. We would watch movies together and bonded over our love of cheesy 90's horror.  We had the cutest inside jokes. He was romantic and extremely affectionate. He literally talked about how he just wanted to be a cute little guy and I ate it up.

I told him about growing up in foster care and about how I've never had a support system. He wanted me to move across the country and live with him. He dramatically announced on his second trip that he decided he was going to buy a house and I could come live with him by the end of the year. We fantasized about our dream home and dream life and he offered to build whatever I wanted, set up a home work space for me, get a backyard for my dogs etc etc.

For someone with my background, it seemed like everything I wanted. a home and stability with someone I loved and who loved me and who maybe wasn't perfect but was on the same journey that I am when it comes to mental health and we could support each other through the good and the bad. I had mentioned to him that I wanted to talk about how I would contribute financially to the house as I have a good job and don't want to pay rent to my boyfriend but also didn't want a free ride but also buying a house together at that stage was a lot and he wouldn't engage on the topic and plodded ahead like he was buying the house 100% on his own. I wonder now if he was planning to use this as leverage on me, something I now suspect he did in past relationships.

Then we entered the devalue and discard phase. One day while talking about buying a house he snapped at me. I made a joke about wanting to live near a craft store which he took seriously and yelled at me that ""he's going to live where he wants to live"" and basically calling me dumb and shallow. I told him it was a joke and got really quiet. He expressed that he knew he had done wrong and he was sorry but there was a tone that I now see as like ""well, this is how I am. You're gonna have to deal with it."" We got off the phone because I had to to go to work.

The next day I expected to resolve it and honestly I expected an apology and to just move on but he came into the conversation super heated. I stopped him and apologized for making a bad joke that started everything in the first place and he still continued to lay into me when again he very much was the one who should have apologized for snapping at me. I was extremely taken aback and tried to get him to slow down and think about how he was talking to me. I gave him multiple chances to see how hurtful he was being and I asked him if he was committed to speaking to me with love and respect and he wouldn't answer and so I told him if he was just going to lay into me like that and not stop when I'm expressing that its hurtful I couldn't be with him.

He then went into abandonment mode and shut down. He just went into a panic of ""are you breaking up with me"" and just completely end of conversation. I tried to cool down and come back to talk it out later and he sent me a 3 page google doc titled ""for clarity"" that is the most bizarre, nonsensical, victimized gaslighting I could imagine, including bringing up his resentment for how insensitive I was during his first visit (his version: You were ""horrifyingly insensitive"" after my grandpa died. My version: You came in my mouth and acted like I was insensitive for expecting reciprocation). I was absolutely shocked by how far he was twisting to say he had done everything he could when literally the only thing he needed to do to avoid conflict was say ""I'm sorry I snapped at you"". This is also where he starts to show that he was data collecting and is ready to use all of my worst fears and deepest insecurities against me, including saying that me breaking up with him must because he unwittingly ""triggered my borderline personality disorder"". I do not have BPD. I had told him when I was a teenager going through extreme trauma I acted out in ways similar to BPD and that that label had been erroneously used against me during that time.

I was too far in at this point though, and tbh my therapist kind of pushed me to stick with it. I don't blame her, I hadn't told her how shitty he was being and most of my issues have to do with me terminating relationships early so she tried to give me some tools for us to try to improve communication, namely taking a break from stressful conversations and coming back. I talked to him about it and he seemed agreeable and like he was invested in fixing communication.

So, two weeks after that incident we get into another fight. Its actually pretty minor and could have been easily avoided. I had texted him to see if he was down to fool around long distance. He sent me a really vague and confusing answer and then when I responded confused he just left me hanging. In my head I was giving him the benefit of the doubt since I didn't know if he was busy or what but was upset that he didn't follow up to explain why his response was so weird and so I tried to talk to him about it and he immediately said I was being mean (I said I felt confused and rejected, he said I was being mean to him and unfair.) I tried to connect it to our earlier fight about him just snapping on me without understanding what I was saying or why I felt that way and he freaked out and told me I was escalating the discussion and it was out of control. I was confused because I had said very little and was actually pretty calm. He demanded we talk on the phone about it, I did because I wanted him to hear that I was completely calm. In the matter of like 2 minutes he weaponized every mental health tool we had talked about to shut me down when I had not said more than 2 sentences. He just kept saying I was escalating the conversation and I was going to break up with him and we needed to pause the conversation ""until I was ready to come back and see him as someone who loves me"". I had to work so I ended the conversation baffled. Again, it lasted about 2 minutes and it was 90% him telling me I was doing every unhealthy thing in the book to him in response to me trying to tell him I was a little upset.

The next morning I didn't hear from him. Around 4pm his time I texted him expressing that I was upset that he shut down the conversation the night before and then didn't reach out to me. He had the audacity to shame me for expecting him to reach out because he had, and I quote, ""just woken up from his 3rd long nap"" of the day. That was the moment I realized he didn't give a single fuck about me. I had spent so many nights coddling him and comforting him and really babying him thinking that our relationship was built on ""mutual compassion and empathy"" and that when I needed his support and understanding he'd return the energy I had put into him and if I would have ever taken 3 long naps instead of wake up and comfort him if it had been the other way around he would have lost his shit.

We didn't speak that day. He kicked the can until he could get an excuse for needing to wake up early for work the next morning and that we'd talk the next day. The next day he had the audacity to tell me he was too stressed from work and asked if we could talk the next day. I said that was a bummer but ok and he acted like I was holding a gun to his head and making him the bad guy. If you can't talk to your hurt girlfriend because you're too stressed out from work obviously thats a big red flag since life is stressful and not an excuse to neglect people.

The next day he texted me after work asking if I still wanted to talk. I said not really. He said ok. I said ""I don't really think you want to hear or deal with anything I have to say"" and he never responded which speaks volumes that a few days before I was the love of his life and he was considering marriage and now he's fine never speaking to me again and letting me feel like he doesn't want to hear or deal with me.

Its hard to explain, using even this many words, how effective the love bombing and fantasy life was in reeling me in. Through his manipulation I thought he was just like me, I even thought he probably also had PTSD from childhood stuff he told me but I see now it was mirroring and the truth was much more insidious. I invested so much love and gave so much for him because he promised the world and I see now it was just a bottomless pit of taking.

I'm glad I only spent 7 months letting this person suck the life from me. I'm devastated about the loss of the fantasy dream life we had planned and I'm really struggling with a lot of the ramifications, but I do feel freer and lighter. It's so insidious how the jealousy and temper flares changed my behavior and made me feel so restricted when he lived across the country.

The thing that hurts the most is how it feels like a regression of everything I've worked on in therapy. It feels like it just reaffirms all of my negative biases that men are harmful and will go to elaborate lengths to manipulate and hurt women. I see now that my codependency makes me a target for covert narcissists and I have no idea what a healthy man or healthy relationship looks like or how to connect with someone who isn't fundamentally damaged. I truly believe this person was everything I was looking for out of a partner and it feels so discouraging to be knocked down this far by someone who seemed so attentive when really it was just collecting information to hurt me with later. I feel like I will never feel safe and secure anywhere but alone.

How do I learn how to connect with healthy people? Where they are? How to find them? Do healthy men exist? I can't think of any straight married people I know whose marriages I'd want.

256,How do I help my former fianc√©e-now partner cope with my traumatizing past?,0,11qovl1,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11qovl1/how_do_i_help_my_former_fianc√©enow_partner_cope/,0," I used to be a COMPLETELY different person before my current relationship, I was gross, narcissistic, dishonest, manipulative, hypocritical, hypersexual, and misogynistic and everyone in my life let me be. No one at all pushed me to stop doing the things I did or to change as a person until I met my current partner. She made me aware of everything immoral and what was harmful to others in my past lifestyle and now after educating myself and seeing on my own how bad so many of the things I did were (and how normalized they are by people who don't bother to educate themselves on the true impact), it‚Äôs hard for me to comprehend what kind of person I was fully. I did so much because the predators and perverts (patriarchy) on the internet made it seem normal, and no parent or girl held me accountable. 

I am 21M. I found porn at 13 and watched it until I met my partner when I turned 19y. I did the majority of the worst things I‚Äôve done at 16. Just to put into perspective how recent my ‚Äúpast‚Äù is.

My partner is the first person I‚Äôve ever told about everything I‚Äôve done including what I‚Äôve done behind closed doors, because she‚Äôs the first person to ever ask, and I was never forthcoming. She pieced a lot together just from learning how I spoke about girls to others and went from there. To get an idea of what she can‚Äôt stop getting flashbacks/intrusive thoughts about, here are some of the things I‚Äôve done:

I dated and pursued many 14yo as a 16yo when I just wanted them for sex

I took advantage of a vulnerable 13yo and kissed them (without good intentions) while at a dance as a 16yo then dated that 13yo as a 16yo.

Masturbated to close friends‚Äô(minors) social media

Masturbated to girlfriends‚Äô friends‚Äô and SISTERS‚Äô social media(minors)

Looked for masturbation material in a girl‚Äôs prom dress try-on YouTube video(that her bf was in)(a minor).

Masturbated to celebrity deepfakes and upskirts

Masturbated to actresses in shows I obsessed over for years and years and watched with girlfriends and my sister

Opened gay porn on 12yo sister‚Äôs laptop as a 14yo, exposing her to porn in a vindictive way and she has admitted to causing her trauma

Called celebrities(mostly skinny young blondes) ‚Äúhot‚Äù to my sister, brother(7yrs younger than me), and girlfriends throughout my teens, sexualizing and objectifying so many teen girls

Had a type for petite teen blondes and outright said that was my favorite porn category while talking to a guy friend about a girl I ended up dating, and I only dated short skinny girls.

My current partner is a spiritual demisexual voluptuous curly haired brunette dancer, who‚Äôs thiccer & more athletic than my skinny self.

In the first month after we met, I showed her a TikTok of a young blonde skateboarding and said ‚ÄúOoh, skate towards me‚Äù moments before we saw a movie where I said a blonde was hot both in such gross ways.

Within a week either right before or right after I started dating a girl I sa‚Äôd her identical sister. I also masturbated to them and their third identical sister‚Äôs posts on social media. I also cheated on them by kissing an ex, before I lost my virginity cheating with someone I barely knew. Did I mention the girl I cheated on told me she couldn‚Äôt have sex because of trauma from rape!?

My partner has her own betrayal trauma on top of all that I‚Äôve given her. And I didn‚Äôt instantly become a good man. I was abusive in so many ways for like 9 months and even now, after a year and 7 months, I still need to improve in a lottt of important ways.

It's hard for her because she feels like she's trying to love a predator and my lack of talking/remembering triggers her because I hid SO much. She's dated men who said they would get help and it didn't work but they were older and she wants to work things out due to how much I have changed but I abused her and neglected her while she was hurting from my past, including taking advantage of her sexually with coercion, after yelling, aggression, stonewalling, changing stories, excusing actions, hiding big and small issues, and abandoning or shaming her for her tears and anger while I treated her this way.

I can‚Äôt comfort my partner when she‚Äôs suffering. I also can‚Äôt talk. Like I can‚Äôt make conversation, I can like never find the words for what I want to say, I can never explain why I‚Äôve done the horrible things I‚Äôve done and therefore can‚Äôt explain how I know I‚Äôll never be that person again. I also am still trying to remember all the details of everything that I‚Äôve done because I fucked my own memory up by blanking out what I did and can‚Äôt remember shit so she‚Äôs left to try to fill in the blanks and wonder.

There are a hundred things everywhere every day that trigger her and remind her of my past. She's doing a lot of work, trust me. But there isn't a whole lot of help when it comes to particular subjects like this, and that's where we both struggle. I want to help her in those moments either. It's very important for our present and possible future.

PLEASE don‚Äôt say ""get therapy"" or ""she needs to get over it"". I'm looking for a therapist and go to SAA meetings and if you think she ""just"" needs to ""get over it"" you must not understand and that's not helpful. Me looking for how to help her cope with trauma I've given her should not be seen as setting the bar high, it should be the basic standard for someone in this position in a relationship. If you traumatize someone and want to be in a relationship with them you kinda gotta make them comfortable enough to do so.

Also I want to reiterate and clarify that what really makes ALL this too much to deal with is the fact that I butchered the disclosure process. I hid so much and so many people making them seem like a bigger deal or more significant than they were. And I hid so many details from so much as well. My partner had to find out so much on her own and what I did tell her she had to PRY out of me for months.",1678748328.0

There's a slow but sure way of erasing those thoughts. I taught it to myself after reading up on Cognitive Behaviour Therapy.

They're there and **have become entrenched through repetition** which over time, will tend to worsen (greater frequency, stronger). The reverse though can be done consciously to squelch them and (eventually) fade them away completely.

Very simply put, you need to adopt an attitude of suppressing them the instant you recognize each and every one of these negative thoughts starting to run through your brain. When you get to the point where you're managing to stop that sentence or phrase at the very first word or two, you've made excellent progress.

Keep at it, and they just won't even be managing that (but, you still need to not let them return and run free). Eventually even that residue won't exist and you're zero involvement (I suspect though, that our subconscious continues to deal with them).

&#x200B;

here's a specific example of this in practice:

Let's say you have and can readily recognize an undesireable intrusive recurring ""dark / negative thought"", such as (trivial example, to avoid triggering readers) ""**I'm going to be abandoned all because my fwb is staying at her other fwbs for a few days.**"" (likely not that one in practice as that's a transitory circumstance, but it'll do for demonstration purposes)

The instant you're aware of that thought starting up, ""**I'm going to be abandoned all because.....STOPPED**"" you DO NOT let the thought complete, you use your recognizing it as your cue to IMMEDIATELY stop that thought and do not allow it to progress to completion.

This, weakens the thought's: (a) Intensity, (b) Frequency, and, (c) through such practice you become more skilled at recognizing those thoughts sooner, and, become more effective at dealing with them earlier and earlier until you're literally stopping it before one word gets out (you will come to recognize the impulse behind the thought). So even this partial early success, is useful on many levels as the preliminary step,",1678673127.0

(to be clear i have no control over this and it is involuntary)

now my sister (who also has ptsd) told me how much she absolutely hates that i do this.

I had a triggering experience today. At no point was I ever in any real or actual danger, and I assured myself I was safe. I knew it might be overwhelming so did my best to prepare and rest before. During the event, I was aware that I was overwhelmed/overstimulated, and nearing my limit, and made sure I was doing what was making me feel the most safe, and that I always had an escape plan. i had a medical appt. I was able to explain to the nurse why I was there and that I also have anxiety and ptsd, because I knew I was about to express ""unexpected"" behavior. And I would need her support. She was very good and helpful, when the doctor came in I still froze and lost the ability to speak at times and understand what was to be expected of me, but I was able to maintain what I was and was not comfortable with. As I left I tried to reassure myself everything was okay, and that I was not in any danger nor had anything harmful or dangerous taken place. As I got home I saw signs that they will be doing work on the street in front of my house for the entirey of next week, and so I knew I needed to make a plan, to either not be in my home or to make my home as safe as possible during that time.

Wasn't a reality I was ready to face.

Last year in November I made the mistake of reaching out to my ex who is extremely triggering to me and even though I quickly cut communication back off, the damage had been done and I spiraled **hard**. I was starting to get in trouble at work and decided to face the music and use my work's EAP program to see someone. Cut to December and I see my current therapist for the first time. I'm *much more* open with her than I normally am with therapists. I guess I was just ready? Then, after asking some clarifying questions, she says it, **PTSD**. It was real, it was confirmed. And dealing with that reality has continued to rock my world.

I mean it makes sense, if fits, it lines up with so much in my life and it was reframed so fucking much for me. I've been reframing a lot of thinking because I know for sure now. But it hasn't been easy. I keep feeling raw sometimes, like an exposed nerve if that makes sense? I have experienced renewed anger at the people who hurt me. I won't detail all my trauma, but honestly in hindsight I don't know how it never came up before that I might have PTSD.

1. I‚Äôm usually not stable enough to continue (ie not being able to function on a basic level or active suicidal thoughts)

I‚Äôm kinda annoyed to some degree because I‚Äôve been told I won‚Äôt get better until I process this. 
Basically, I‚Äôve been really interested in psychedelics as I realized it will force me to face what my brain has been hiding from me. My psychiatrist has recommended it, and has told me to look out for studies for psilocybin. One issue is that I have bipolar disorder, which disqualifies me from a lot of studies. Another issue with bipolar disorder is that there‚Äôs a chance it can trigger psychosis, but like to some degree I think it would still be worth it if I could process some thing or get some perspective . even though psychosis is really bad, I feel like if I know it‚Äôs a possibility I can be ready to deal with it with a med change with my psychiatrist. The other option is ketamine which is much easier to source as it is legal here, but it seems like he would have to do it multiple times and insurance doesn‚Äôt take it.

This post might be long because I don‚Äôt know how to best explain what I mean. I went to rehab back in October for cannabis and bipolar disorder. 

In my first week I had to pick either the grief and loss group or trauma. I said that neither applied to me. I was told to go to the grief and loss group and my life has never been the same since. I spoke of some of my childhood experiences and they said that my parents have been gaslighting me for years, that what my father did to me is sexual abuse, that both of my parents were physically, verbally, and emotionally abusive and that my first time having sex was rape. I also found out that I have been dissociating for years. 

I won‚Äôt go into detail about what I said. It‚Äôs too hard, and the shame I feel for even speaking about some things is deep. It‚Äôs not like I had repressed memories, I‚Äôve always remembered my experiences- I just never thought of them as trauma. 

The rehab ended up being a shit hole anyways, and I left and went to trauma therapy in an IOP setting. It was very triggering. I hated it. I hate trauma therapy period. I never want to speak about what I said again. The IOP indicated I have PTSD as well. I was almost done with IOP but I quit because it was becoming too much to handle. 

I ended up relapsing on pot, and have been in a haze for over two months. I stopped smoking pot two days ago because I knew it was making me feel lethargic and apathetic. The problem is every time I‚Äôm sober I can‚Äôt stop thinking of trauma therapy and all my heart does is ache. I really just feel like I need to bawl my eyes out but I don‚Äôt want anyone to hear me. 

I don‚Äôt know what to believe or feel. I don‚Äôt know if I view my experiences as trauma. I don‚Äôt want it to be true. The problem is my life makes sense and ptsd symptoms do fit me which is breaking my heart more. How can my first sexual experiences be considered rape when it was my fault? That means I was raped four times when I was 17 and I willingly put myself into those situations. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. I don‚Äôt know if things were just blown out of proportion by the therapists and the group. Maybe I didn‚Äôt explain everything correctly.

-I've been in multiple major car wrecks.
- I've been bullied (which I don't like admitting) 
-Had a parent disappear when I was 12
-I have deep self harm scars and history with that
-But the main one's I want to talk about is Solitary Confinement and finding my sister's dead body and encountering the dark side of the internet..

I'm trying to make this short. I know it sounds like a lot at once but this all happened over my lifespan
 So I've been brutalized by the police which I won't get into, had to spend 6 months in jail and spent 16 days in Solitary, I know that doesn't sound like much compared to people who had to spend years but it still haunts me. It is literally torture every hour in segregation. I have a major fear of EVER going back to that place. 

I found my sister dead about a year ago. That one haunts me. And I won't go into depth on that one either.

The main one right now is my morbid obsession with true crime and gore sites. All completely legal stuff of course. Forum EYEBLECH has traumatized me beyond repair. But I do it to myself. And I regret it. I've seen horrible cartel videos, suicide videos, just horrible things I wish I could unsee and stories of true crime that I wish I could unhear. 

I stay busy all day but when I am alone or try to sleep all this shit comes back in HD flashbacks. Also recently got diagnosed with autism. I've had depression and anxiety disorders which I won't get into all my life. And yeah. At the moment im diagnosed with acute ptsd. Ugh have I been through too much for a 23 year old?

So I'm really confused over some things with my parents because it took me a while to accept that their behaviour was odd/off/abusive/neglectful in the first place. Never mind this stuff im going to discuss now. 

First my mum-
She has mental health issues, me and my brother were both caregivers to her as she could not go out alone/needing a lot of emotional support etc the list goes on. But with me she did and still does talk about her relationship with my dad, their sex life and how she didn't feel forfilled. Shes explained situations where she had a foursome with tow of their friends and selpt with these people....all things id rather not know honestly. She admitted to me recently that both her and me would get massaged by the male friend (he would later assault me and his own step child but thats a whole other story) she told me this thinking there was nothing wrong. Who in the hell lets a adult male 30s even touch their 9/10yr old daughter. So she let that happen....there has been mutiple times where she's not seen anything wrong or not done anything about situations we were in with our dad (physical/mental abuse but not to her).

This is where i feel soooo sick- My dad. 

-i think i was around 8ish i was asleep, i woke up to my pjs bottoms having been moved and i felt weird like something had been done but i have no memory other than this and feeling like it was that male friend or my dad. 
-as i was developing my dad would make comments on my body, be touchy feely like touching my arms etc but making sure it was just me and him like he wanted to chat- this would happen when he was drunk when he wasn't angry. Or ask me to sit close by him/on his knee etc i remember feeling weird about it but i was terrorfied of him then so not much i can do. This was throughout teen years.
-when i was in college so 16-18 not sure on specific age when he was drunk and i was walking passed him laying on the sofa he reaches out and grabs?/strokes my private area, im in shock and feel disgusted immediately, couldn't eat for days after or feel normal. He 'realises' his mistake when im like wtf and says he thought i was my mother. I say realises like that because he's made a shittonne of mistakes while drunk and i swear purposely doesn't remember the things he's done while drunk. He's always been one of those types to brush things off and say its not that bad etc or threatens us when we speak of things he doesn't want to face. 
-also at some point in these years shows me and my brother a porn site on his computer. Like i know we were older but this is weird right?

I am 33 y old woman. I live in Iceland and moved here 4 years ago. I am from Croatia. 

I was sexualy assaulted when I was 5 by my brother. He physically restrained me and threw me down atairs and on bicycle too.

My father stopped contact, and payed nothing no alimony after divorcing mom when I was 7.

Both my parents are autistic and father has something else too.

They both worked hard because we struggled and mom was not home when brother did things to me.

My father took me to his parents house and I wanted to go to my grandparents and cried peed bed, he got angry, took my toys , locked in cellar and angrily said that I can get it back when I come home. Despite , I kept crying loud until he got annoyed and took me to my mother's mom.

My mom raised me up and always anxious and paranoid.

I loved animals, piano,  gymnastics and mostly art. I would watch cartoons and read comic books for hours. I found myself there. Despite all, I was very happy healthy child.

In school when I started I kept getting bullied but I never did anything. 
Once I snapped and pushed girl into closet in class because I lost my temper. She was my friend and other friends circled around me, bullying me about how I am in love with one guy.

I wanted to go to art school because later i started to draw a lot and had visions what to draw. 
My mother said to go to business high-school because artists are poor.

I was in high-school bullied again. I started to dissociate in math class in exam. I looked at teacher and she looked at me. I felt guilty for feeling like I am in water drowning away. I wrote every without thinking.
I started to overeat and listen to rock music. I was in library and my task was to listen to all CDs at the time that they had. I burned it to mp3 and listened on way to school and after, to wash fear and boost my self esteem. 
I never spoke about it. I was never good with expressing myself. 
Few girls pulled my pants, mocked me, called me names, etc. I was isolated, they treated me like Im not cool enough plys I was best student and they hated it.  I really liked studying while they hated it.
I nailed school and went to university for business as mynmoms wish.
My mental health started to become more and more screwed. Anxiety,  heart arythmia, depression,  panic attack before presentation twice. Had friends but always hid myself because I ft like less.
I studied 2 years longer for Bachelor of economic because I hated it. Then 1 year longer Master's. 

Meanwhile I was in few relationships. First guy was gay, and made a balance sheet about me, second guy had mother who killed herself and he was emotionally totally distant. He left me because he felt his penis was too small and that when we grow up, that I'll leave. He completely shut me out in one day.
He was only thing that I liked. And I was depressed,  crying, breaking, floor was shaking, I called him million times. Until mom took me to doctor, gave me antidepressants and I continued studying.  When I cried, mom came to help but I would say go away, and she would.  Then she went on balcony and started smoking. While I listened to The Cure, Pantera, Keane and so on, piano music. I screamed sometimes and music was loud so it could muffle my pain.
Later I was kn long distance relationship with weird mentally ill man from Finland and I was delusional that Ill come to Finland we would marry etc..It was like for year I think and he was like never available to talk but I kept hoping. My dissociation got worse from staring in computer and thinking of man who was kilometres away.
I broke it off and went to therapy but It was few interviews and antidepressants.  
After some time I met guy at salsa dance, we dated. His father was sick and would say that we can move in to upper part of house, then next day no. He didn't like me because I fucked his son for hours and  he banged on door. This boyfriend was cheap, financially, and once said why I can't orgasm with penetration abd why i need stimulating my clitoris.He wanted marriage only if I get pregnant first, but I am moral, rational and romantic,  and it has to be engagement,  marriage,  then children so I never agreed. I saw in his computer he watched transsexuals. He was on weekend with colleagues and he got drunk and sat on lap of his boss.
He dumped me and never heard from him. I trued to reach him but never saw him. Oh yes we engaged only because I insisted and he farted in jewellery store when we picked cheap ring. Then he sang along to one song"" Not yes not no"" that played in mall. When he left me he said "" you could have at least suck my dick once""
But I didn't because I had no attraction to it. Because my brother did that to me.

Anyway I had a friend that I met at university,  he was artist who was selling his art there. He left his ohone number and gave me painting of geisha.
After I broke up with my fiance, he started to hit on me and we startes to have sex. I wasn't interested but I was too depressed. Unfortunately with time I discovered that he is seriously mentally ill. His parents were on heroin back in 60' hippies.  He was raped by his father,  his mother performed fellatio on him, so he wouldn't stop her from taking poppy tea. They were all on everything that they could get. His father abused him and mother. He beat them up. He broke chairs on him if he wasn't drawing properly. 
That's what he told me about his childhood. 
I found this out later. His apartment was disgusting,  cockroaches would come sometimes from things being unclean and food.
His father died from overdose on galaxy, synthetic weed. After that ex went into terrible depression. Some time afterwards his mother tried to commit suicide. And second time, with pills from my exes friend, she succeded.
Ex went crazy. One time his friend and me were in his apartments and he locked us all up because his money was missing. I tried tp take keys but he came and said that i killed his mom. He looked like he was a demon. I was ready to kick him with beer bottle. But I was cunning and when he went to another room, I took keys and ran far.
Unfortunately I couldn't break up. He hit me in back on street, chased, stalked, insulted, ignored me for days when he was on drugs with friends, we sometimes talked sexy on phone he put me on speaker so his friends can hear and they laughted and said That I can come and they can smash my pussy.
He threw rock on my window.
I started to work in office and was anxious a d depressed I couldn't fit in I hated it.
I started to volunteer and went to Turkey and later to Iceland and at the time I texted guy from Iceland for long time, and after a year when I went back to Croatia,  we decided to meet and we met in Tenerife but I cried since beginning because he was silent, not caring and had extreme pain after operating hip. He was sexualy abused when he was 13 from his stepfather. He never addressed issues and his brother told me that he smashed table once and jumped out of car. He played guitar and his froend visited often and played music. Way he played music made me cry it touched my soul. Because I was crushed that he didn't love me and was not talking about emotions. 
We ended it after a month. His guitarist friend had my contact and we chatted.
His grandparents took me in until I get apartment. I worked in day care, after school for kids.
Friend of my ex offered to rent his apartment.  And I agreed. I had low salary, and he rented me his social apartment and overpriced and made profit on me. We started to date and he moved in but was hesitant to pay rent or it had to be 50-50. He wanted baby and me too. I got pregnant first time we didn't use condom. He was not convinced that Im pregnant.  When I told him, he was in shock wanted to scream. He said we barely know each other, we should travel before settling etc. My heart literally broke. I was so ipen hearted and in love but this killed me.
I gave it a thought and decided to abort. I had no insurance in Iceland yet so I flew to Croatia.  I went out of anesthetic hysterical crying saying are you my friend you speak Croatian to nurse.i was working with kids all these time in day care, watching fathers, mothers happy coming for their kids, and I had baby in belly and I was broken hearted. 
I went to Iceland and he was bitching about abortion being mean. My ex helped he drove me to airport and back. He was silent but he always had heart and helped. 
On my mom's initiative I took that guy with whom i had baby, to Croatia for summer vacation because we already bought tickets. One day in Croatia I had bad depressed episode and I wanted him to hold me and support.  But he was using tramadol to numb out and he did nothing. I went to another room and hanged myself but i didn't move chair..  He heard me choking and came and untied me. Afterwards on vacation I went to mental hospital because of depression but they were old-school and not good so I went out. 
I came to Iceland,  relationship continues while I got into waiting for rehabilitation and lived with him because I had nowhere else to go. I wasn't working.  Later I got into rehabilitation,  covid came, and rehabilitation did not help me. Then doctor put me on waiting list for another rehabilitation and I waited a year. Meanwhile My disc prolapses on spine started to hurt more and more. 

While in relationship with him that lasted from February 2020-August 2021, I started to self harm by choking myself and hitting my head and thinking to hang myself. I was living with him but I went to woman's shelter because I had no home and he was emotionally and financially abusive.  He lied about how much money he has. He lied and when he would be gone for 2,3 days, he used speed or coke but told me he needs space and is depressed. 
It took me a long time to see that by accident in his phone messages. I started to rent rooms but had to change a lot.
I am pagan and prayed to spirits with mom and grandmother and I finanally got social apartment which then I pay less rent. 
Still I went back to him. He banged on my windows shouting that im cheap fucking bitch. He called police on himself claiming that I took his keys. 
He coerced me into anal sex slowly and once didn't stop it when I said stop. Later he called police said he raped his girlfriend and what to do. 
He dumped me in August 2021. My cat went missing and I got food poisoning. 
I started to heal and was still waiting for therapy. 
In December same year I met man H. We fell in love and He is man I am in love now.
Since I started relationship I told him im not ready because of PTSD. But we couldn't resist each other. So I was often projecting and thinking that he is perverted or sadist. My ex watched snuff porn when on speed so that might have contributed. Also he groomed me into some light BDSM but it was toxic because relationship was and I did not felt loved when he was tying me up or role play. He had some sleep fetish that we tried and I thought it was sick.

So back to current boyfriend  , with H, there was accident.  We were in car and I was pushing him to answer something and he didn't because of his adhd he couldn't foucus and something happened and I got panick and said stop car. He said he cant because we were on road but road was small and he drew like 30km per hour. I screamed he stopped and he said I acted like a child but i felt threatened claustrophobia.  I went running and felt paranoia and fear in my body. I ran ran and he drive with car followed.  I hid in building but he found me and prevented me from exiting door and I kicked his leg and ran away. I felt so much pain.Then later I called him because i was far from home. He drove me to print house because that was what we intended to do in the first place. We had argument there and I kicked his car and there was slight damage. He got very angry. And threw my stuff on floor insulted me and drove away. I was crying crazy crying to home walking.

Another time he stood in my way again after argument and I think i attacked him. Another time I attacked him and I think two more times. One time he shut my mouth because he thought that would stop me from being in panick i think. When he stood in way he was so sorry about it and he said he was afraid to loose me and wanted to make things right.

Afterwards there would be situations when I would go crazy, hitting him, kicking, whipped his face, something always provoked me and I felt attacked but he never understood and never calmed me the way I needed. But often he never took a grudge he forgave and cried.

He has adhd abd trauma too. His mother was emotionally highly abusive and intrusive. Still is but he blocked her from his life. He got medication after three months of our relationship because it woke him out of depression.  Concerta. But he wasn't helped by it.

With time when we would get upset he would not stand in my way, he would walk away slamming door or crying, 
Meanwhile i started therapy and was trying to use skills so I refused to talk and would walk away from him when I felt very upset. Unfortunately he did not have enough strenght to stop his dysregulation and he continued to talk to find  solution, but i was too stressed to think or tolerate his feelings or mine  so  then Id hit him or myself or scream. 

With time things got better we broke up often and managed to progress.  He got ritalin and wellbutrin recently.  He is waiting for his therapy. 
But instead standing in my way, he wanted to stop triggering my ptsd  so then Often he would ignore my calls or block me when I was hysterical crying or insulting him when he was not able to be around me. I only wanted him to comfort me but more I pushed more he went away. 
I stopped trusting him so much because when I would harm myself,  he wouldn't answer ohone.
I felt thst he is sadistic and punishing me fir his mothers treatment of him.
But he was so disregulated himself that he would cry, shake and hit head when I would be so emotionally disregulated and he felt guilty so he wanted to stop himself from hurting himself and saying things that might hurt me. He often has problems finding words.
Anyway we progressed but him  hitting his head and me mine and abandonment were still there. He broke up a lot in order for us to heal seek therapy not to kill each other, and we managed to deal with it bit would come back together.  Max separation days was 54 days I think.

Shitty therapy i got was harming me and puting stress on relationship because it was talking therapy snd talking is too difficult for me. But at least they diagnosed me with C PTSD December last year,  3 months ago.

Related wise:
Today, we are broken up for 32 days.

I started EDMR therapy and, now first SSP actually first because of dissociation and lack of emptional support. Because i live alone here. I can't go to EDMR until i progress with SSP to lower dissociation. 

I am on waiting list for trauma therapy from government and it will take 8-12 months wait so i started EDMR and booked another trauma therapist too.

Im not sure how is my boyfriend.  We are in no contact. He is doing his best to heal.

I have talked about things he was bad at,  but he has a lot of positive sides, kind heart, intelligent,  artistic,  loyal, diligent, kind, helpful when not disregulated, loving, giving, honestly gives all. Buthe has mental issues like me. Trauma and adhd. He is also seaching fir EDMR privately because waiting for government therapy is loooong time.

I wrote this because I am heartbroken knowing that I need therapy,  wondering if I can heal, if he can heal. 
And I am so stressed knowing I kicked and whipped and hurt man I love. He hurt me too but I was physically violent and I know I will do it again if I get overstimulated. Thats killing me. I love him and he loves me. Id give my kidney for this to work, thats how i love him. He feels the same. But I cannot proccess things we did especially my violence. I keep thinking i deserve to be alone because abuse impacted me to snap and he deserves woman who he will not have memories of her kicking him. I will be broken if I let him go. But sometimes I think I need to because I am too fycked up, he probably thinks subconsciously low of me because he knows most of my history.and how can I be woth man that I abused physically,  I can't it will linger forever and kill me.

But I also feel shame because he started ti stand in my way and followed that time, and I had no violence before that. So I might not be monster.  But Am I cureable or broken.
He had no bad intentions,  he didn't want to loose me. But I feel discomfort for what he did. 
I Dont want to blamehi and myself.  I feel we both are guilty. But i often feel like a monster for hitting and kicking him.

I got diagnosed with C PTSD and autism last year...its still new..

My heart is broken.

352,Totally numb,2,11n7to1,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11n7to1/totally_numb/,0,"For the last few years, I have gone through one thing after another in rapid fire succession  - starting with a major trauma that has had devastating effects on my health/body/life/finances/etc and then subsequent medical trauma, a highly abusive relationship, job insecurity, poor living conditions, family stress, betrayal, and so on and so on. I have been on high alert for so long now, without a reprieve, that it's become normal. I got some bad news today and had no reaction whatsoever. I felt nothing. I have this near constant feeling like something terrible is going to happen at any minute and am no longer shocked when it does. It's like I'm already primed for the worst case scenario. I hate living like this. I *should* react - I *should* get upset and cry and feel something, but I don't. I've gone totally numb. I genuinely don't care. 

I don't know if this is a sign that I'm doing well or that I've reached the point of complete shut down and disconnection. I'm worried it's the latter. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? This is very unusual for me and worrisome. Thank you for reading.

Editing for clarity:

TLDR: I accidentally triggered close friend/roommate, he‚Äôs been behaving strangely for the entire day, and I want to know if there‚Äôs anything I can do to help. 

Edited the rest a ton bc I wrote it w/o proofreading & think it confused at least one person:

I live with a friend (A). A‚Äôs been diagnosed with CPTSD. There are some people he‚Äôs cut out of his life whose presence or mention seems to send him into a serious rage. One of them (B) used to be a very close friend of both A & I, but B really is a serious a-hole. A & I both stopped talking to & about B & honestly have better lives bc of it. 

In a group snapchat today, A, some other friends, and I we were posting old photos. I accidentally posted some that had B in it through carelessness.

A‚Äôs been he‚Äôs been quiet in his bedroom with the lights out but occasionally punching walls, slamming doors, and muttering to himself for like 10 hours. Mostly quiet, I occasionally here him snarling or whispering ‚Äúf‚Äî-ing motherf‚Äî-er‚Äù and stuff like that over & over, then, less often, hitting things. 

B was really terrible to A at a time when A was enduring more serious abuse from other people (the things I think caused A‚Äôs condition), so I feel like the emotions are all tangled up together, and seeing B has triggered his anger about the injustice he went through and how a bunch of the people who harmed him (and they really harmed him & others, there were deaths involved) are very financially well off, safe from prosecution bc of their connections, have families and emotional support, etc. 

A‚Äôs usually a nice, warm, helpful, and conscientious person. Earlier, I felt like I ruined A‚Äôs day. Now I‚Äôm kind of freaked out that it‚Äôs much worse than that. 

Is there anything I can do or say? Or just gtfo of his way

Updated 3/10: he calmed down considerably last night. I‚Äôm going to try & find some PTSD resources that fit his schedule & suggest them in a few days. Thanks so much for all the advice, even if I didn‚Äôt take it I appreciate the effort!",1678333389.0

TW mentions of sexual abuse but not details. 

So had a session today with my new therapist and i just wanted to full out sob. 

We were discussing how worthless i feel and got to me being angry about a friend saying nothing was done for her when she was going through sexual abuse but i know that it was. Like her mum quit work to look after her own kids, got social services and a psychologist involved etc. Anything that could be done was done and she walks around like no one helped her. 

I don't want to be angry, i can't say well at least you got help because i never did. Hell i didn't remember the extent of my own sexual abuse until last year when it can back in flashbacks. I wanted to sob for the child i was who got no help and red flags were ignored and even when that one time i was asked if things were okay i'd already been silenced for years so couldn't talk about anything. 

I just..... it seems so deeply intrenched into my soul this hurt and i can't even process how to act right now i just know that im hurt and angry but i don't want to be angry any more, i should be over this by now. I feel like my dad when im angry because he always was when i was young.

But they held fast. The owners of those boxes won‚Äôt give in to my demands. They take their job of protecting me very seriously.

Today, as I sit, the car running, the sun sinking, the rage seeps into me like poison and threatens to tear me to pieces.

John always liked the reveal of a working girl opening the door.

He had grown up poor, born to a broken family with no father, in a small town deprived of opportunity. By working hard, constantly sacrificing, he now had the money he only dreamed of when all he knew was the freezing bite of cold nights. For the next hour, he knew he would be able to find warmth in the paid embrace of whoever was behind that door.

‚ÄúWelcome, Oppa,‚Äù she said softly in broken English, nervously fidgeting with her hair in the lingerie provided by the agency arranging this encounter.

John lifted her head to properly look at her face in the dimly lit foyer. ‚ÄúYou are beautiful,‚Äù he said, in a voice both distant and formal.

He would always say that. And yet, this one was special. She had come specifically recommended to him by his booker---while taller and a bit awkward, she certainly was the type of young, thin, foreign, and inexperienced provider reserved only for the best clients. John had visited all variety of women over the years; he was a relatively handsome man, tall, pale of skin, with brunette hair. Yet, it was not his looks, that had led to the invitation to meet her this evening---it was his wealth and most importantly, his reputation with the agency for being discrete.

‚ÄúPlease remove your shoes, and I will take you to my room,‚Äù she said with a slightly forced smile.

The sex wasn‚Äôt memorable. It never was with a girl so unpracticed, and John had no interest in making her uncomfortable---other, more experienced providers, had disclosed difficult encounters with clients. There was something about John that made past escorts feel at ease and speak openly about the hardships of the profession. It had been quite clear this girl‚Äôs eyes would wander at times, and John suspected she had been imagining another place, far removed from where she currently found herself. She did try to please, and John took a certain amusement in watching someone so new to sex work fumble their way through such a mechanical routine.

John placed her head on his chest and took her hand in his when he was finished. ‚ÄúYou did well, thank you,‚Äù John studied her face ‚Äúyou really are quite pretty.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you, Oppa,‚Äù she replied. ‚ÄúWhat will Oppa be doing for dinner?‚Äù she asked in a rehearsed manner.

John indulged her curiosity replying, ‚Äúperhaps I will pick up a burger on my way home.‚Äù

‚ÄúI love In-N-Out Oppa, American cheeseburger is my favorite, double-double! I love everything about America,‚Äù she said enthusiastically.

‚ÄúYou are cute, but America isn‚Äôt all that great, there are plenty of terrible people,‚Äù John replied.

Taken a bit aback by the remark she laid there quietly.

‚ÄúTell me about Korea, you are from there, correct?‚Äù John said, a vaccination scar clearly visible on her shoulder---typical of foreign-born individuals. He had particular tastes that had been articulated to his booker regarding tattoos and scars. Many years ago, John had begun insisting upon only seeing providers who possessed no body marks, or if they did, they must not be distracting. The most common scars he had encountered were c-section or breast augmentation scars---often with a tattoo covering them up. John had glanced more puzzling tattoos hidden behind lingerie. An older provider claimed one to be a tattoo she was given in her youth after being raped. While well done, with no visible scarring, this innocent girl currently in his arms clearly had had breast and facial surgeries. John had tried to stop asking about escorts bodies and made it a point to never see the same provider twice---less attachment was better for all parties involved.

‚ÄúI am from Seoul,‚Äù She replied.

‚ÄúTell me what you miss of Seoul,‚Äù John inquired.

‚ÄúI miss my dog, my grandma, and I like K-pop,‚Äù she said with complete sincerity, ‚ÄúI watch YouTube videos in between clients,‚Äù her tone noticeably altering midsentence, worried that she might have broken the fantasy she was expected to provide by referring to other men.

‚ÄúI do not mind; I am glad you find time for yourself,‚Äù John replied warmly. ‚ÄúYou can show me your favorite artist if you would like.‚Äù

Welcoming the invitation, she grabbed her agency provided phone and played a video from a newer group John was not familiar with.

‚ÄúI am sorry; I do not know this group. I am aware that you are a bit younger than me, but I was personally partial to Sonyeo Sidae and Kim Hyun-a when I was your age,‚Äù John said.

‚ÄúOh! Kim Hyun-a? I didn‚Äôt realize Oppa liked sexy girls. I am sorry I am not that sexy,‚Äù she responded, comfortably and playfully.

‚ÄúYou are plenty sexy,‚Äù he replied, fondling her breasts for the remainder of the appointment.

John was escorted to the front door. He leaned in for one more kiss and then softly said, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be seeing you again.‚Äù

‚ÄúGoodbye,‚Äù she whispered.

  

**John II**

John returned frequently to see her before she was spirited away by the agency to her next unknown location. He taught her everything that gave him pleasure, and in turn, he learned what pleased her. The sex became exhilarating. He still recalls her dumb little squeaking moans and their unbashful giggles when she fell off the bed in a failed attempt to dismount him. Her improvement was drastic as John corrected her posture and the arches of her back. She would ask him of ways to take him deeper and how to become accustomed to his taste---which she had habitually washed from her mouth during prior visits.

They broke all the rules together. Mimicking a ritual John and friends played in his youth, they would swap her hair ties from her wrist to his, and then back to hers, as they locked fingers---bodies connected. John insisted that she look him in the eyes and call him by his name rather than ""Oppa""; she happily complied. Together, they began turning all the lights on to see each other more clearly and would move the mirrors scattered across the room or hang clothing to cover the known cameras the agency used to monitor the encounters. When laying together, John would have her remove the lingerie she would greet him in and put on his oversized college sweatshirt. She had his phone password, and she gave him the password to the phone the agency gave her. John would book multiple hour visits to be the last client of the night---often lingering late, using their extra time together to talk and hold one another. She would look at pictures of his travels to Africa or the ocean view from his home; she divulged to him she was not allowed to leave the apartment---having spent the last few weeks inside.

John still reflects on the last time he saw her. It was a rainy evening; she wasn‚Äôt particularly careful, playfully rolling around in his sweatshirt. John could clearly see the burn marks on her hip.

‚ÄúWhat are those,‚Äù John said coldly with a stare fixated on the brand.

The look of dread that overtook her awkward face and what she did next shattered John‚Äôs heart; slowly, taking John‚Äôs hands with her own, she placed them over his eyes and whispered, ‚ÄúOppa, do not look at that,‚Äù almost if pleading for him to return to the state of blissful ignorance he had allowed of himself with her.

‚ÄúI used to be poor; at times I had to live out of my car. I struggled, and eventually, my life got better. I cannot help you, but I hope you are able to find happiness in your world,‚Äù John calmly replied. A single tear ran down her cheek, hastily wiped away by her small hands. ‚ÄúI do not want to pay for your body anymore, may I leave early?‚Äù John said with a slight tremble in his voice.

‚ÄúLet me wash you,‚Äù she said sweetly. She took John to the shower and gently and passionately wiped his body. As he stared at her, he showed her a faded scar slashed across his forearm---inflicted by someone he thought he had loved. This time, she didn‚Äôt try to hide her tears, rinsed away by the running water.

Walking to the door for the final time, she abruptly stopped him, firmly took him by the hand, and slid her hair tie onto his wrist with a kiss.

‚ÄúGoodbye,‚Äù she whispered.",1678324822.0

374,How would you move forward with family if your abuser is part of the family?,8,11m5ud8,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11m5ud8/how_would_you_move_forward_with_family_if_your/,3,"I‚Äôve been struggling lately with how to approach family life since I‚Äôve healed some and am not as affected by the PTSD related fear of my brother. I just don‚Äôt know how to act. I was hoping someone might have some suggestions for how to move forward in a healthy way all around. 

Awhile back, my brother traumatized the hell out of me with his drunken violence. He‚Äôs an alcoholic and tends to fight when he gets drunk. He ended up fighting with my disabled dad and I had to step in to help my dad. It was terrifying and messed me up for a long time with debilitating panic attacks. I was scared of my brother and anything that reminded me of him, so I went NC with him for the past two years. My family was NC for awhile but they eventually got over it.  

Now, it‚Äôs like everything is back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù with everyone except me. My brother didn‚Äôt change, he‚Äôs still a violent alcoholic. He just hasn‚Äôt turned his violence our way in awhile. Although, he did attack us twice after the time time he beat up my dad. Also, he did apologize to the family after the attacks, but it was forced. It doesn‚Äôt really mean much to me because his behavior never changed. However, I think everyone was more willing to accept him again after he had a baby last year. 

Anyway, it‚Äôs just that I don‚Äôt know how to act moving forward and that stresses me out so much. It makes me want to distance myself from the family but I know that wouldn‚Äôt make me happy. I‚Äôve healed up to the point where I‚Äôm not terrified of my brother anymore. I mean, he makes me super uneasy but I don‚Äôt panic at the sight/sound of him. I‚Äôm still NC but I‚Äôve seen him around and been relatively okay lately. I want to be able to hang around my family but I don‚Äôt know how to act with him. Am I supposed to be nice? Do I ignore him? Should I just be cordial?

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I think I‚Äôve forgiven my brother for a lot. I‚Äôm not as angry as I once was for the ways he hurt me and made me suffer for his actions. I still don‚Äôt trust him though. I think I‚Äôm still a little scared because I wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable talking to him. Similarly, I don‚Äôt think I would feel safe hanging out with him but I want to be able to be around neutral family spaces. My entire extended family congregates around my mom and they‚Äôre all okay with my brother. My family are the type to never reject anyone despite what they have or haven‚Äôt done. My brother will always be welcome in those spaces. Consequently, to be involved with the family, I have to be okay with seeing and possibly interacting with him. So how do you move forward with someone after they‚Äôve been a panic attack/ptsd trigger because they were abusive?",1678304337.0

To make a very long story short (er) my brother and I had an extremely bad childhood. I am currently in therapy and have been trying to heal and he hasn't been willing to accept help yet. 


Things have been getting worse and worse lately. He's threatened suicide multiple times and thankfully has never attempted. 

I got a call from him tonight and he was calm and apologetic by the time he called. He and his wife got into a really bad argument and without the details got the closest he's actually ever been to attempting. He will not accept help and won't allow his wife to take him to the hospital. I can't get the image out of my head and I can't fathom how he and his wife felt in those moments. We've lost family to suicide before and I can't lose him too.

Can I request to have him eval'd as his sister even if his wife doesn't? I have no clue what to do in this situation and I feel so lost.

I originally went to see her for EMDR therapy. However that has not started. She has said that I am not in a place to be able to do it (not stable enough). I have been in good places for some time over the course of time I‚Äôve seen her so I don‚Äôt fully understand. However, I completely understand that you have to be in a good stable place constantly and I have been at times. I‚Äôve had some traumatic experiences happen to me and they continue to affect me and I just want to feel better. I‚Äôve brought up that I want to do EMDR but she continues to say it‚Äôs not a good time or she says ‚Äúyes we can‚Äù but it never happens. I‚Äôve communicated with her that i want to do it and she knows that‚Äôs why I originally went to see her. She is not cheap either. I see her every week for an hour and costs $200 per hour. I also pay out of pocket. It‚Äôs a lot of money and it‚Äôs hard pay about $800 a month on it. I guess I still have some hope that the EMDR will happen. During the sessions I find that she talks a lot about herself and her experiences (I‚Äôd say about half the session is her talking about herself). She also repeats stories about her life. I swear I‚Äôve heard many of her stories multiple times now. I also find that she tells me about the few coping skills she‚Äôs given me over and over. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve learned anything new or anything that I‚Äôve found helpful. The thing that bugs me most is that she has been consistently late for months now. We do zoom sessions and she‚Äôs always at least 15 minutes late. At times she‚Äôs been over half an hour late. I get that she has other clients but she does not give me the extra time to make up the hour. For example if we had a session at 2pm and she gave me the zoom like at 2:20 then we‚Äôd still need at 3pm. She doesn‚Äôt really transition well when the times over either. I‚Äôll be talking about something and she‚Äôll say ‚Äúwe have to finish for today‚Äù and that‚Äôs it. Most of the time she lets me know about an hour before that she‚Äôll be late at least. I have brought this issue up to her and she has apologized but it keeps happening. I don‚Äôt know what to do or how to approach this. This is the longest I‚Äôve stayed with a therapist and if I stop seeing her I will have to find someone else. Where I live there‚Äôs a shortage of mental health support and I‚Äôll most likely have to go on a waiting list. I‚Äôm not the best at confrontation either. I‚Äôm a people pleaser and I find it hard to bring up how other peoples actions are affecting me. I don‚Äôt know if being late for every session, promising to do a certain therapy and not following through or having a therapist talk for half the session about themselves is normal. I know if you are reading this you‚Äôd say just talk to her about it but I‚Äôm hesitant to do so. I know her time is valuable but it also costs a lot of money and but I don‚Äôt always feel like I‚Äôm getting what I pay for. At this point it feels like a money pit but I do want to get help.

__________________________________________________________

      The last time my family and I went back up to Michigan was probably a few years ago after this happened. We went up to Michigan for 2 weeks, and stayed in a motel instead of the trailer where the incident happened.
       My family and I went out to eat, and my elder cousin (we just call her cousin but she's actually my father's cousin.) And her boyfriend all went out to a restaurant. First off. I didn't want her boyfriend to come. 
       He's the one who did it to me so I definitely didn't want to be near him. But, the whole time while sitting at this restaurant being separated from him, The time went slow. 
       Everything was slow and I just remember, not engaging much in conver unless it was between my parents and or my brother and eating but not eating fully.
       I then remember the last day of that 2 weeks, before leaving we stopped over by that trailer again where she and him lives (still to this day) and all he did was stare at me with no remorse. I was terrified to go in the kitchen past him. I would run past. 
      Or would be terrified to even get close to where his chair was even if he wasn't there. My parents could see it, and they did because ever since that 2 weeks of the lunch and then being forced inside. Plus my brother making fun of it calling this dude my ""boy toy."" 
      My parents thought it was best not to go back up there to which we haven't gone back ever since then besides day trips to the beach but not even remotely close to where they are located and where we'd go.

I was lightly bullied until I turned 14 but name calling and dumb comments I could deal with compared to the beatings I was used to have almost daily 

I won't go into too much detail on what I went through as it is to much to write and I rather forget some of the things 

Either way for soon 4 years ive been mostly free from any of the shit I went through but yesterday my friend blew vape smoke into my face when I was talking and it got into my lungs wich made me cough, the other people there started to laugh at me for not tolerating nicotine, I shrug it of the first time but now I'm quite upset but I control it

Then my friend does it again and this time I lose all focus and all I see is the picture if my old bully pinning me against a wall laughing at how skinny I am while punching me in the chest

I feel a sudden rush of adrenaline and anger and kick back to reality but now all if the sudden I'm beating up my friend wich I would never do otherwise because I know how he is and shit but I stop and run towards my ""highschool"" or what you call it

I try to work but I cant stop thinking about my old life and how I used to feel, ofc my teacher sees something isnt alright so he takes me aside to ask what's going on and I tell him about the vape incident and also what I did to my friend or at least what I remeber doing

Then my classmates give a dumb comment like ""stitches get stitches"" and I heard that all the time before and I hate that word along with ""didn't ask"" and  "" who asked for your opinion"" because I heard them so much before

Either way I then get a memory of one of my bullies saying that thing to me one time after I told a teacher of something they had done 

This memory didn't leave and I couldn't really focus, I was phasing around the workshop where I have my industry classes trying to work but I was so lost didn't know where anything was and losing my mind 

I then feel that I cant handle it anymore and I tell the teacher that I need to go

I don't remember what happened after that except that I was sitting in the school nurses office covered in tears and at that point she is telling me that what I'm describing sounds like PTSD and that I need to get help for it 

I then went to lunch and tried eating but it didn't go well because it was like I had forgotten how to eat with knife and fork 

Everything felt somewhat unnatural but familiar aswell as unknown, the other school building next to mine gave me anxiety by looking at it as all I saw was my old school 

I couldn't go past other students without feeling anxious and in panic so I try and look straight into the ground and listen to music, I remeber my mom calling me to buy food or something but at the store she is screaming at me in the phone and I'm almost crying because I'm so confused because I don't remeber anything or know where anything in this store is located even tho I go to this store daily 

In the checkout people walk past me I think I don't know all I do know is people looking at me for some reason 

I started hearing stuff in places so I put in my headphones and tried ignoring anything and focus on the ground while walking to the bus

Everything went black for me after that and I'm home in bed 

Today I feel very down and people with similar personalities to my old bullies give me anxiety 

I looked up PTSD on 1177 my country's health website just some hour ago and some videos about the matter and for me personally it feels like i have PTSD or C-PTSD but i hate to be such a hypochondriac so I feel ashamed to even try getting tested for it because I don't want people to look at me like I'm an attention seeker or someone who wants to be ""special"" 

Idk really what to do and im scared to go back to school tomorrow because I don't wanna see the other school building or the people who did the vape thing to me 

Idk how much help I will get here so I will post this on places I think I can get advice",1678290636.0
382,What To Do,4,11m4h3u,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11m4h3u/what_to_do/,3," I have always struggled to characterize my experience as sexual abuse, even though I know it was. I was adopted when I was 6 years old by the man that my mother remarried. Prior to that, she was in a physical abusive and often times dangerous relationship. The man that she remarried, was younger than her by five years, and only 15 years older than me. He was awesome to her, and patience with both me and my older brother. He was also a police officer. Early on in their marriage, they had a child together, and she died shortly after birth. They divorced when I was 9, but because he adopted me during their marriage, he had visitation, and paid child support. He wasn't the most involved, but he was there when it mattered and I looked up to him a lot. 

Fast forward 3 years. My brother and I woold stay at his house on Thursdays for visitation. At the time, I was having a hard time in school and was getting bullied a lot. I would cry at night because I hated school and worried about what they day would bring. So, on occasion, he would hear me, and I would go and sleep in his room, on his bed, with him. I was at the beginning stages of puberty at this time, and another boy in my neighborhood was too. I told my dad that this other boy had looked at each other's private parts and explored some curiosities. He told me that it was normal to do so and told me that he and another boy when he was young did the same thing. At one point, I remember sitting up in bed, and he did not have the blanket covering his torso or groin area. He was wearing lose boxers, and he flexed his penis and it bounced in his boxers. He did this a couple of times, and he laughed about it. He seemed comfortable about it. He then told me that I would not have to go to school the next day if I let him kiss me. I was confused, but he said that he wanted to kiss my butt. He had me take off my clothes, minus my t-shirt, and had me lay on my stomach. He then proceeded to kiss all over my butt-cheeks slowly and in a lingering manner. Then my memory stops, blank, nothing else. It‚Äôs a complete black-out past that point, and no matter how hard I try, I can‚Äôt remember what happened next. What I do remember is him telling me not to tell my mother because, ‚ÄúI could lose my job.‚Äù 

Fast forward again to two months ago. I‚Äôm 33 years old, and for the first time in my life, I decide to go to therapy for what happened, because it has been eating me alive for 21 years. That person is still very much in my life, and I have to interact with him often. He has remarried, had 3 children, and has two step-daughters. All of his children are under the age of 18, and live with him and his wife. Therapy was going fine and I was making progress, although I began to develop feelings of anger and almost-hatred towards him, but I never wanted to confront him or anything like that. As a professional, I‚Äôm a therapist as well, and I was under the impression that my personal history information (PHI) was protected and I could not be compelled to report the abuse. Well, during a session, I told my therapist that I wanted to share what happened with my brother, but I‚Äôm scared to do so, because I don‚Äôt want to hurt his relationship with ‚Äúdad.‚Äù He asked me why I felt a need to protect ‚Äúdad.‚Äù I told him about him remarrying, having 5 kids, and not wanting to hurt his relationships. He then asked me how it complicates things knowing that I‚Äôm a mandatory reporter. I was perplexed. He said, one could argue that your experience alone is sufficient evidence to warrant a report, in order to protect the kids in the home currently. I began to feel panic immediately. I told the therapist that I wanted to talk about the experience, but I did not want it to be reported. He told me that without an address, he would find it challenging to report it. 

I left the session feeling lost and panicked. I consulted with an attorney who is also a licensed psychologist and he told me that my PHI was protected and I was not mandated to report, despite children being in the home, because I was the victim and not the professional treating the patient. But, he told me that my therapist IS mandated to report it. My therapist only needs an address, but I am reticent to provide it. I don‚Äôt want the kids to get hurt. I talked to a mentor and she asked me if the other children being blood related to him changed things, and I‚Äôm not sure. I want to believe I was the only one, but at this point I‚Äôm so lost. Part of my wants to give the address so that I can finally stop carrying this damn thing around, and the other part of me wants to protect the kids and him. I‚Äôm so conflicted here, and could use some support and advice.

I am a 34 year old woman. I recently returned from a trip to Cuba with my mom that felt magical up until the last night. She and I went for a walk after dinner, and because we had to leave early the next morning, I decided to be in bed by 9. I had water bottles in the fridge that were not used, and one that I had been drinking out of that had been opened. I drank from the one that had been opened (big mistake). I fell asleep and woke up in the hospital two days later with a catheter and only minor memories of what happened the day before while I was being medically assessed. 

So my mom, who was documenting and who thankfully advocated for me, has told me how I was found. I was found naked on my bed face up and I had vomited. I had been turning blue, so I was immediately put into the recovery position and was eventually responded. I was also robbed of 40 bucks (really not the important thing) and my door was left partially open. 

I feel so violated and struggling to understand why this happened. A part of me wants to remember the event, just even to know who it was. I feel like it‚Äôs good that I don‚Äôt, but I feel so angry that I can‚Äôt even confront this person directly. The resort and the Cuban hospital are blaming me, saying that I tried to take my own life (I did NOT) or that I just left the resort and got overly drunk (I did NOT). They refused to do a kit, so precious forensics were lost. I did it when I got home, but by then it was too late. 

A part of me blames myself, but I know that it isn‚Äôt my fault logically. Right now, I‚Äôm filled with thoughts about ‚Äòwhat if I had done the evening completely differently‚Äô, ‚Äòdid I give someone the wrong idea‚Äô, and almost wishing I could know exactly what was done to me and why I was just left that way. I can‚Äôt stop ruminating and having flashbacks to screaming and thrashing. I‚Äôve been having nightmares, and I‚Äôm scared to drink anything at a restaurant unless I see it open in front of me. 

I‚Äôve enrolled in counselling, but the waitlist is quite long. I‚Äôve sought out some other resources that have been good so far, but I‚Äôm just angry and sad.",1678242272.0

391,PTSD symptoms after a relationship,3,11lrm8s,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11lrm8s/ptsd_symptoms_after_a_relationship/,0,"Not entirely sure if it's better to post this here or in r/BPD but I think I'll do it here. The TL;DR is my psychologist and I realised some break-ups I have been through were traumatic for me, even the ones without abuse, partially due to my BPD. I have never heard of others having this kind of trauma and have not been taken seriously in the past, and so I am looking for support and stories of others.

I recently started up treatment for my PTSD and I had an appointment where we tried to make an overview of all my trauma. I always said I have two events that caused my trauma, two acts of SA that happened to me when I was 19. However, this talk has really changed my views. We went a bit into the SA and I explained how I reacted during the events. The psychologist explained these reactions are most prevalent when there is existing trauma.

We went a bit deeper and I explained the intense reactions I have had after break-ups. My entire life would be taken over by the memories of the relationship, I'd be terrified to run into them but at the same time want to see them, I'd get terrified if something reminded me of them but also indulge in it. I always felt incredibly embarrassed and alone about these things because people would just tell me it was a short relationship and I should let it go, so I hid it. When I got my BPD diagnosis a couple years ago, this all made a lot more sense, especially after reading other stories online. I can't explain how much it meant to me that I wasn't alone in this.

Anyway, I explained how the relationship I had before my current one, 5 years ago, still haunts me a lot. I get panic attacks when something reminds me of him. There was an abusive element to it for sure, he pushed me hard once but then didn't remember, and started getting more bitter and hateful towards the end of the relationship. After I broke it off he was ruthless, tried to turn my friends away from me, tried to tell me things he knew would hurt me the most and when I would get upset, he would say I shouldn't be upset and should get over it. Really felt like gaslighting because of how covertly hurtful he would be and then make it feel like I made it up. I still really struggle to figure out what is real and what isn't when it comes to myself.

The thing is, I also got these strong reactions to an earlier break-up with a guy who wasn't abusive at all. As I said, I panicked about things that reminded me of him but also tried to indulge in them because of how much it had swallowed my life. I would dream about him constantly and wake up feeling like time has stopped. It was also a kind of self-harm, I think. I thought of PTSD at some point, but I remember googling it and everywhere it said that abusive relationships could cause PTSD, but not just break-ups. This lasted for years until one psychologist said she would like to try EMDR. I had EMDR for this break-up situation \~5 years ago and it helped so much. It feels much more behind me now. I just want this to happen with my last break-up situation too.

I told my current psychologist this and she said break-ups and especially the nasty ones might be traumatic to me. I feel like it all makes a lot more sense now, because I had pretty much those same symptoms long before my SA, they just got stronger since. My BPD might play a big role in this because of how invested I get in relationships and how strong my fear of abandonment is. The thing is, I've never read stories about something like this being a trauma. Does anyone else relate to this?",1678266937.0

I scrolled up further and eventually found CP. I immediately brought his phone to the police station and reported everything.

This is going to be really long. I don‚Äôt expect anyone to even read this. I just really need to let this out somewhere where people don‚Äôt really know me.

From the age of 12 to 14 I dated an older guy- he was only a year or two older than me but was in my school( yeah I probably shouldn‚Äôt have been dating to begin with but hey, can‚Äôt change it now ). He was extremely controlling, possessive and abusive. He had a lot of mental health issues himself. About 6 months in he started with the verbal abuse, controlling everything I did and wore, I had to be home and call him on our landline every single night at 8 pm and stay on the phone with him until I went to sleep. If I wasn‚Äôt home I was thoroughly questioned. 6 months in was also the time we started doing stuff together sexually. I was Catholic and firm on not wanting to have intercourse until I was married. He hated me for that. Soon enough the consensual stuff we were doing was no longer consensual. A year in the physical abuse started. He would shove me hard up against brick walls, his door/walls, he nearly suffocated me one time with a pillow, slapped me a few times, etc. all during that he became even more controlling and was sexually assaulting me almost every single time we were alone together. Except because I fought hard to not have intercourse and to keep my virginity he would rape me anally. That destroyed me. I hated myself so deeply and was so ashamed. I had injuries I couldn‚Äôt explain to my family and I was too ashamed to tell them what happened to me. I tried so many times to leave the relationship but every time I ended up going back because I was so afraid. I finally left for good when I was 14. He proceeded to then stalk me for almost 2 years after that. Showing up at my house when my family was gone, calling us in the middle of the night threatening me, cornered me at school, and then put a knife to my cousins neck in the school parking lot trying to get information about me ( my cousin lived with me ). He also threatened to come kill me and my entire family. The cops wouldn‚Äôt do anything until he physically harmed me again. He eventually stopped and I haven‚Äôt seen or spoken to him since even though we only live 10 minutes from each other. I‚Äôm 26 now and I am still SO ashamed of the abuse I endured. It took me 10 years to even begin to truly process it with my therapist. My now husband is amazing and helps me so much but I am still so ashamed. I see others talking about their SA on social media as a means of healing and letting other people know they‚Äôre not alone but I can‚Äôt. I still hate myself. I still hate that he violated me so deeply. I hate that I now have life long health issues from what he did to me. I‚Äôm still just so so fucking angry. I still have night terrors and flashback like nightmares pretty regularly. Even the thought of seeing him in public makes me sweat and my heart rate go through the roof.

I read about studies that had 80% efficency in treating PTSD within a 3 month time frame in which 100mg MDMA was administered once every 4 weeks. People were supervised by a psychologist and had to integrate what they had learned throughout the weeks afterwards.

I had 2 MDMA sessions with 5-6 weeks time in between. First session felt enlightening, as in that I felt so much emotional stuff and I could understand why I felt this way and I wrote down a lot then later on tried to integrate it as best I could.

419,Like a neverending spiral. My story.,1,11l4bms,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11l4bms/like_a_neverending_spiral_my_story/,0,"Hey all,

I wanted to give some brief background on me: I am a 34 year old man who has now been in multiple mental health programs for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. I come from a history of physical and emotional abuse from my family. But I fear that's not the main issue. 

I fear I'm facing something I'll never be able to get past. My abuser I fear groomed me and tried to brainwash me.

I met him two years ago when I moved into an apartment which I no longer inhabit. (Even talking about this is traumatizing.) This man came into contact with me by locating me in the parking lot and we quickly grew a friendship.

What I also found out was that, unfortunately, this man had a particular darkness to him. He had Satantic ritual books lying around his apartment (I never partook in any of these), and was able to put me in trances at times. He also gaslighted me, and did things like draw a firearm on me and threaten my life on multiple occasions. I believe me put cameras in my apartment--which was one floor above his--and tried to watch me (I had a video sent to my phone of my room on one occasion). He put hallucinogens in my drinks when I would be at his apartment. This was at a time when I had been drawn away from my family. There were also times when he took me to Atlantic City and liked to sleep near me. One night I even heard his wife scream at him, telling him that he ‚Äúran a f\*\*king cult.‚Äù This man tried to instill thoughts like conspiracy theories and drive me away from my family.

His wife eventually filed for divorce, and he threatened her life as well as took all the money out of her bank account. He eventually moved out of his apartment and vanished off the face of the earth. About a month later, my entire energy dropped and I started to feel as if I was being watched. Things like electric appliances going on whenever I would walk by, my actions being controlled by him from a distance, less motivation, and overall a sense that my life was not meant to be lived. I know for a fact that this man hacked one of my phones, and I led a very paranoid lifestyle. He lied about being in the military and having a ""high security clearance.""

Fast foreword to now. I consistently see patterns in my life such as the same people appearing at social events at the same exact time, seeing the same numbers such as ‚Äú33,‚Äù seeing flashing lights, and not being able to sleep. I feel like I'm going insane. My right ear gets blocked periodically. I fear I am possessed, or that that man took part of my soul, or that my life has been cursed in some way.

I don‚Äôt know what to do or what to think anymore. I am now in an outpatient mental health program and am on lithium, as well as getting ketamine treatment.

My life is in shambles. I am seeking answers because I am so lost and I fear this man did something to me that I can't move past, or that PTSD can't even explain.

If anyone has any answers, or any feedback, I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it. Thank you so much. Blessings to you all.",1678207526.0

This abuser was my stepfather, but my biological father is causing me a lot of stress as well. 

&#x200B;

My relationship with my father has been rather temperamental throughout my life. Him and my mother split up when I was 4 and up until I was 16, I would typically spend the weekend with him. Until maybe 11, it was every Friday and Saturday night, then I would return home to my mum on Sundays. We were pretty close when I was young, though it was possible he was a little protective too. I was his only child and from ages 5 to about 13 or 14, I had seizures. Thank fuck I grew out of these eventually (I joke puberty fixed it) but my body could not regulate its temperature very well so when I got too hot, I'd be physically sick or have a fit. I don't remember these fits often happening around him, they were usually when I was with my mother. But he had taken care of me when I was physically sick before. 

Which, umm, feels like quite the contrast in comparison to how he treats my mental health. 

&#x200B;

Mum got with my former stepfather when I was about 11, my sister was born when I was 12. I didn't trust him at all when he first came into our lives, and I wish I never did let my guard down. I can't believe I never realised how manipulative he was, he threw tantrums when he didn't get his way and a lot of our holiday memories are him threatening to ditch us in Scotland or wherever we were. It was like he bombed us with affection just to retract it whenever we did something 'wrong'. I think it's because of him that I got used to letting people step all over me or doing things I didn't understand or agree with, because I wanted to keep them around me. 

The sexual abuse started when I was 15, I barely even understood the concept of sex and embarrassingly I knew so little about my anatomy. I had no idea why he touched the 'less-sexual' parts  of my body like my hips before it escalated, my mum worked nights so she wasn't there when it got so much more inappropriate. I really had no idea how to respond, but I was scared if I didn't let him that he'll start retracting his love again, I guess I was so used to him getting angry for not obeying him that I let it happen. I wish it didn't take until I was nearly 17 to realise how bad it was, and only because I thought about mum and if this counted as him using me to cheat on her.  

&#x200B;

I had serious mental health issues showing themselves when I was 16 and I didn't understand why I was having constant panic attacks. Maybe it was my brain knowing something was wrong, maybe it was all that stress finally letting itself out. My relationship with my dad was damaged a lot by this, I struggled to keep in touch and he got mad at me for it though he never reached out himself. I told him about the stress but he just called me pathetic and that memory just never went away. I had so many panic attacks around him but he wouldn't take me seriously, and eventually we broke contact until I was 20. 

&#x200B;

Eventually my stepfather ended up hitting my mother and they permanently split up, but I saw him as my only remaining father figure and couldn't cut him off the same until I was in university. That first year of university was painful though there was physical distance between us, he constantly messaged me and guilt-tripped me when I took too long to respond. He sent messages too that I didn't realise were so weird until others looked at them and pointed out how suspicious they were.

In my second year of university (2019) I met a girl who would be my partner until 2022, and I finally let her know what happened. I was getting so many weird sensations and intrusive thoughts that I didn't realise were signs of PTSD until I was told what happened to me was abuse and my counsellor at the time filed a police report for me. I failed that year because of the stress but when I was at the start of the next academic year, my mother reached out to my father. I guess she told him what happened, but I was really surprised that she put him on the phone that day. After that we got back in touch however and we talk every week now, which kind of leads to why I'm so upset now.

&#x200B;

Despite knowing what happened, he still doesn't take me serious. I started medication this year and when I told him it was to manage stress, he laughed me off saying I had nothing to be stressed about. I threw out some science-y stuff about my brain having a chemical imbalance so it freaks out, but it really made me feel so embarrassed. So much I wanted to snark back 'I have nothing to be stressed about? I constantly have nightmares and am going to see that bastard in court soon', but I really didn't want to have another falling out with him. 

We've seen each other since this happened, I haven't brought it up but it's still bothering me so badly. My mother is supportive and so are my siblings, but for some reason I can't get over how my dad sees my problems. Maybe I was overreacting back when we originally fell out and I had uncontrollable panic attacks, but I thought he'd understand why I was upset now and take it seriously. I'm due to call him up tonight but I'm terrified to do so because this keeps bothering me and I'm scared I'm going to snap at him. I don't feel like I can express my feelings to him at all, even though I know I can't control the nightmares and the PTSD ain't my fault.",1678195610.0

It was not love at first site but there was for sure a connection and that just got deeper over time. I fell for him and I fell for him hard. He was an MP in the army. He deployed. I can still remember the calls from overseas. When he came home, he seemed ok, not himself 100% but nothing anyone said to worry about. Then he was discharged from the army. I was laid off from my job a month before. We were never married but we had talked about getting married and me adopting his 4 year old who I helped raise because his mother split when he was an infant and had no contact with him. He was from florida and there was no longer a reason to stay where we were. So we packed up and the army moved us to florida. 

Thats when is all went south... 

He was having nightmares, and was in a deep depression and was threatening to kill himself and he would have the bursts of anger for no reason. I had begged him to go to the VA and he said that there was nothing wrong with him. One time i came home to everything in the closet being on the floor including the shelving. When I asked what happened, even in my gut I knew, he told me he did alot of things he couldnt talk about or tell me about and if he could I would hate him and he would rather just die than live with himself so he tried to hang himself. When he was telling me this with tears in his eyes, my heart was literally hurting for him. I thought if I loved him enough it would take away his pain. It didnt matter how much I pleaded with him, he would not go seek help. Some times he would just get angry, slam the door, get in his truck and speed away. I was in constant fear that he was going to hurt or kill himself. I dreaded unknown callers on my phone. I would literally hold my breath if I saw a cop car driving on the street. It was tearing me apart. But we had a 4 year old at home and he needed me. I tried to shield the son the best way I could. 

But then there was the other woman......

One day while given the son his nightly bath, he said, ""mommy, I saw daddy kiss miss missy at the park today. Daddys friend was nice."" Talk about a gut punch. Not only was there another woman but she had met the son. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, he said she was just an old friend. But one day I got out of work early and I was gonna surprise my man with his favorite meal. But when I came down the road there was another car in our driveway. One I didnt recognize. As I came in the door they were both on the couch, he jumped up, he was caught.. She didnt move. I was speachless. I asked where the son was because he was suppose to be picked up from school hours ago and he said he was playing in the room. I walked to the spare bedroom, closed the door, locked it and broke down. I had just moved across country for this man. I knew literally no one but his family and a few people from work...I never felt so alone. He started pounding on the door. And by the tone, i knew he was triggered. I refused to talk to him until he calmed down. He kicked in the door, broke it off the frame. I had never seen the look he had in his eyes before. His son is now screaming and crying and Missy is just chilling on the couch watching this unfold. I jumped up off the bed it startled me. He came straight towards me. I was against the wall as he demanded I speak to him.

Then something happened that never had happened before

He slapped me across the face. His son it screaming leave mommy alone and still this missy chick is sitting on the couch. I told him to back off and to never lay a hand on me again, He stated that I didnt know who he was, and I had no right to tell him what to do. I pushed him away, and before I knew it, there was a gun against my head. I had never been so scared, who was this man, why was he doing this to me and in front of his young son. As he started talking about killing me, he was ranting about things I knew nothing about, and he lowered the gun.. I took a chance and pushed him as hard as i could and he fell onto the bed. I grabbed his son, and ran past the couch to the front door. then I felt the pull backwards, and he grabbed his son out of my arms. I made the choice to leave the house anyways. I called the police. The entire event unfolded and the missy chick never left the couch.

I got a restraining order, and went no contact with my ex for 11 years.

I thought about him and his son every day...

My exes father recently passed away. His father was more of a father to me than mine was. So I reached out to my ex. He apologized for everything that had happened and he stated he knows there is no way he can ever make it up to me or change what happened. He stated that it took losing me to realize that there was a problem. Ha states that he went through counseling and it trying to become a better man. He said I was the love of his life...

We have chatted for a few months now, and he asked me if there was any chance I would give him another chance.

So, my question for everyone out there, is can a man recovering from PTSD really recover fully or will he always be triggered? I have never loved someone like I loved him and he sounds and appears to be the only man. And I feel the connection we had again.",1678146053.0

A lot about the trauma. My friend is very great about it. I've asked him many times if he's okay with it. He keeps reassuring me that its okay, that he's here for me and that me getting to talk about it is worth however it may upset him to know that kind of stuff. The exes were, mostly good with it. That doesn't really matter much to be honest.

I've had some (many, maybe 8 over the last ~10 years, im 21 now...) therapists, and with a few i could actually talk about it too. The thing is, its so much. To this day, I still find new things to consider traumatizing in my past. Some memories that were hidden, some things I knew about vaguely, but never realized how much they affected me to this day, how much they played into the overall narrative of the traumata (?) perhaps. I've spent the last 5 years slowly opening up to my best friend, many drunk nights especially.... and theres still things I can't say out loud, at least in detail. Memories I can only repeat in my head over and over, like a broken video recorder. 

It feels like majority of my life, like fucking 80% of it or so until this point were nothing but pure trauma. Its like id have to tell someone every fucking horrible moment of my life, and it would take months of nonstop talking, probably longer, just for me to feel like someone finally gets it, like they got the bigger picture, everything.  And I want to get it out. 

I wish I had a therapist, where even if it took years, I could tell them every single thing. And when I was finally over they could understand why I am so hurt. Why im so fucked up. Thing is, my insurance kinda caps out at 2 or 3 years. I've went through every loophole to even have this much therapy over the years. Breaks here and there once they stopped paying. But that wouldn't be enough, not with one hour per week. Plus therapists who said they ""didn't know how to help me anymore"" after I had told them about the major incidents.. 

and I feel like most people also just dismiss how much these smaller things add up. They don't see how to you, these things happened in contexts. Contexts of constant awful things, aggression, betrayal, everything...

Unfortunately, a cousin of mine died, and nothing could be done about it. The thing about this was that they were REALLY close. My brother hasnt been the same ever since.

Before the accident, my brother was a really distracted, laid back and cheery/ extroverted person, whom seem calm despite challenges, sometimes anxious (as if in excitement). After the accident, he's been acting unusual, being more irritable, anxious and impatient about events. He's been drinking quite alot ever since and has done some reckless driving. Hes been experiencing weird symptoms, which can be noted specially at night.

At night, he usually screams and talks in his sleep, twitching aggressively to the point of waking up screaming and crying, unable to sleep again, someone having to sleep with him to calm him down.

Since he was a child, he's had this "" gift"" of seeing ghosts, which seem  to run in the family as well (me having it too). What's strange about this is that, he's been having the same vision or at this point, hallucination about my cousin straight up staring at him and ""warning"" him about the future. He's very disturbed about this this, to the point of having nightmares about this as well, and I mean, almost every night.

I've noticed that he's depressed and suddenly talks about us ""not getting  surprised"" from him not waking up from his sleep one day. I dont know whether this is suicidal behavior or not, but he's definitely not alright. 

We've tried to help him, but he's scared of recieving help. I've done some research about this but seem to find nothing and at this point, i dont know what we can do to help him. I was wondering if this could be caused due to trauma, or even PTSD. I was wondering if someone can relate or could give advice, I would highly appreciate it, thanks.",1678153225.0

About 18 years ago I developed PTSD after a traumatic event. Over the last decade or so it‚Äôs been pretty under control and I have really come a long way.

After the shock wore off, I‚Äôm feeling much more optimistic about it all but, overall, it‚Äôs just this waiting game until we get the additional test results and can figure out a course of action. 

About 4 nights ago the nightmares returned which means the stress is getting to me. Last night was really bad and my husband had to wake me up multiple times. The nightmares just absolutely suck and even once I‚Äôm awake, it takes a few hours for me to put them aside and return to normal.

But the other half, it feels as if I'm seeking the same validation, and desperately trying to save our friendship like I was during my trauma. She's constantly apologising for every little thing, and telling me it seems like I don't care about her and I want to leave her, which is very stressful. 

When we first talked again in December, I had made her promise me we wouldn't become friends again, because I couldn't trust myself to stick to that rule. And after two months of daily messaging, calling and generally acting like friends, we titled ourselves as so again. During those two months, I would tell her things like ""We should stop talking when school goes back"", she would get sad, and expressed being against the idea and start apologising for no reason. So I'd stay. She's goes on about how no one cares about her, or likes her, so I'm always the one to swoop in and say ""No no, I care about you!"".

They are now married meaning that my primary trigger, my daughter‚Äôs stepmom, is in my life and can‚Äôt be avoided.

I‚Äôve spent 5 years trying to overcome her as a trigger. She‚Äôs always showing up to exchanges and events and has even appeared at places I talked about going to. I stopped sharing plans with people after that, and it stopped.

I can‚Äôt avoid her without withdrawing from my daughters extracurricular activities.

What is a normal expression of anger?",1,11kdju5,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11kdju5/what_is_a_normal_amount_of_anger_what_is_a_normal/,3,"I was raised in an environment of rage and abuse, as I'm sure many of you were. Because of that, I have no idea what is a healthy way to deal with anger, and what to expect of others who are angry.

In my case, I used to have intense anger issues - I threw a knife at my dorm room wall repeatedly and smashed furniture over someone I love saying something that made me feel vulnerable type of anger. Ive since gotten therapy for this, diagnosed with PTSD among other issues, and found out I have epilepsy with my pre-ictal and post-ictal phases taking the form of extreme frustration. I'm dealing with it, and don't feel consistently angry anymore: but when I do I tend to self harm to release it. 

My partner also grew up in abuse. He used to cry from anger, but now he's taken to throwing things - never at me, but at walls and stuff. Never a knife either or anything that can do harm, it's just very loud and very triggering. I forced him to go to therapy and he came up with a plan using the TIP method to calm. However he still has his tantrums, but he now goes into the bathroom with the shower on to throw stuff. Not as bad as seeing it I guess, but having someone I love behind a locked door with the sounds of something being beaten is super triggering in itself.

I just don't know what to expect. I read a lot about people throwing stuff when angry, and he insists that it's a normal form of release. Ive talked to counsellors who told me that it's ultimately up to me to decide what I'm willing to put up with, and that it isn't abuse just because it's triggering, it becomes abuse when it's directed at me or it causes me harm and he continues anyways. 

What is normal anger? What is normal expression? I don't know, I was robbed of a ""normal"" upbringing and now I'm going by the words of what others tell me is normal.",1678135845.0

449,Need massive venting (Extemely Long Post),4,11jt4xg,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11jt4xg/need_massive_venting_extemely_long_post/,3,"Dunno where to even begin with this absolute mess in my mind. Just woke up from a horrible nightmare, and my brain isn't exactly functional at the momemt. I'm a novelist, meaning I'm usually too wordy for my own good. Oh well! I make no apologies for my chosen profession, considering I became this as a direct result of my PTSD.

I ""died"" in USAF Basic training at Lackland, AFB, Texas, when I was 18 years old. Obviously I didn't DIE-die, or I couldn't be typing this on a phone in the darkness of a strange back patio. I'm fairly certain this vacation triggered the nightmare, as I'm in an unfamiliar location, far from my house. 

But yes, I did flatline as a result of some terrible people, and it's pretty much ruined my ability to trust other human beings. I trust my cats more than any human being, because people've been so deceptive towards me, to the point I should have died at their merciless hands. I'm not really 100% sure how I survived, either. So let me just get into the meat of this dish--you don't win friends with salad!

I joined the US Air Force straight outta 12th grade, barely 18 years old. Went to the MEPS for my initial testing, physical etc. (Apparently I have abnormal feet. Neat!) After HOURS of testing, it's finally time to pick preferred jobs in the service. I was shocked and horrified to learn I had to pick 3, and whatever one became available first, that's what I was going to do for the next four years. I wanted to do ATC, and put that as my first choice. As it turns out, if you want to be an ATC, there's EVEN MORE tests unique to that job! 

To be sure I could even choose that as one of my options, I had to go take another hearing test which was much quieter and much harder to hear than the standard radio frequency test they gave us already. Despite always listening to heavy metal at volumes which would melt concrete, my hearing was the absolute best it could be, and I nailed that test, too. You have to press a button depending on which headphone a sound is coming from, and man, I think it's easier to hear dust settling on a pillow. Then I had another test with this dude who looked like an evil scientist from a Saturday Morning cartoon. He was explaining to me how I needed to have a certain cranial cavity volume and it had to be in the correct places, due to the altitude I would essentially be living at my whole career.

I get sworn in as official government property, and they tell me I'll likely get a call in around 9 months. I got a call four DAYS later telling me ATC was opening up and it was time to decide whether I wanted to accept or not. I asked ""can I think this over?"" I was told ""yes, you've got 30 seconds.""

I think that right there was a major crux in all of this. I was not physically nor mentally ready to go from civilian student working in construction yards, to soldier, in a single week. I don't know how many people can actually do that. I only know I'm not one of them.

Two weeks into Basic, I got sick. REALLY sick, in fact. The CO Doctor at the infirmary of the 320th (""The Rock"") was as absolute punkweed. Told me I had a cold and gave me cough syrup and Tylenol. I made the mistake of telling him ""Sir with no undue respect, I believe this is more serious than a cold."" Oops, I'm an NCO telling a CO how to do his job! Even better, a fresh E-4 was standing outside the door, and comes stomping in with his boot clickers screaming at me ""You think you know more than a doctor? Think you can run your pisshole wherever you want around here?"" Had to give two of those dumb paper slips out, one to each of them. I forgot the name of them... 347s? Maybe? I forget... it was so long ago. They're little squares of paper each trainiee has to make with your name, which squadron and dorm your outfit is with, and your TI's name. You have to make these yourself, to hand out when you get in trouble. I had to hand out 2, for daring to care about my health, and get cussed and screamed at by two people, while sitting in silence.

Then, in his arrogant fury, this Doctor gets out a form and starts filling it out, telling me ""you think you're so educated on this? You think I REALLY don't know what I'm talking about? Fine. Here."" Hands me the form. ""Go get chest X-rays at Wilford Medical Hall. Return the x-rays to me tomorrow."" So, I talked to my TI and got a buddy to join me on the trip down to Wilford. Get x-rays, waited hours to get physical x-rays in a folder. Took them back to jerk doc, went back to the dorm and went to bed. The next morning after PT, I'm instructed to head to the 320th infirmary.

I go into the doc's room, and he does the dejected glasses drama removal. Puts my x-rays up on the lightboard, pointing at these white marks all over my lungs and says ""okay... you were right. You have acute bronchitis."" He actually apologized to me, which was the only time a superior ever apologized to me. Gave me much stronger cough syrup with codeine, multiple days of bed rest, and sitting details only for 10 days following that bed rest. These are orders from a CO, and supercede any orders my direct TI could give me, as TIs are also NCOs.

This was when it all went down. 

I'm laying in bed around 6:45pm, feeling pretty dead. All the noise of the dorm sounds like a rave party to me. I was only in bed for five minutes when an element leader comes up to my bed with an absolute attitude, decrying me as lazy and unmotivated. I tell him I have doctors orders for bed rest, and he actually fingers his way through my night display uniform and is not only looking at them, but reading them aloud to the entire dorm. Even my TI was not LEGALLY allowed to look at my doctor's orders, much less a mere element leader.

He hangs onto that ""sitting details only"" bit while ignoring the bed rest which has to come first. He moves away and I'm just done with his crap, try to close my eyes again. Next thing I know I'm being dragged by my right arm and leg out of my top bunk, smashing bones into the steel bedframe as I fall out. Then all four of my limbs are being used to carry me down the A-Bay, down the aisle between beds, straight into the latrine. Having been in bed, I was wearing only a brown t-shirt, tightie whities, and ankle socks. Please remember that I had BRONCHITIS at this point, because the four element leaders didn't care, as they forced me to clean the urinals with my bare hands. At one point I asked for rubber gloves, and they just laughed at me and told me to toughen up. Their sadism didn't stop there, either. Because then they made me clean all the pipes under the sinks with chrome cleaner, which contains ether... which I was now inhaling directly, on a filthy tile floor of a bathroom used by SIXTY MEN. 

You may be wondering why I say ""made me"" or that they ""forced"" me. Like, I had a choice, didn't I? Well, objectively yes, I did. But when an entire dorm pretends to not see what's happening? When absolutely nobody so much as raised a single word in my support? It takes a lot of your guts away, especially at a mere age of 18.

It still didn't end there. That first element leader STILL wasn't satisfied yet, and tells me ""since you like to run your mouth so much, read the entire BMTSG, front to back. Every word. Out loud, loud enough for the entire dorm to hear you.""

The Basic Military Training Study Guide is a 300~ page long TOME we all carried a copy of at all times. You're expected to have memorized the entire thing by week 4. Not simply have read it, but memorized it ad verbatim. Every single word. I managed to yell out up around the 80th page by the time 8PM hit, and it was lights out. I went to bed feeling worse than I'd ever felt.

And then, the next morning? Time for the 2.5 mile run, in the 20 degree freezing morning. Every part of me told me to refuse to run, to just make a big deal about it, take the punishment and make up for it in remedial PT later. But I was so mad... I was absolutely furious unto madness. I didn't just want to run, I wanted to smoke my entire flight and make them look weak; that a sick child could outrun them. And you know what? I did. I will never get over that absolute joyous thrill of watching one of the element leaders who had just tortured me last night PUKING his guts out on the pitch. A TI came up alongside him and screamed out a volcanic array of ""RUN WHILE YOU PUKE. DID YOU JUST GET YOUR VOMIT ON MY GRASS? MOVE YOUR ASS. MOVE. RUN. NOW."" He started crying like a pathetic baby while sluggishly shuffling his feet and flailing his arms like a t-rex.

But that moment was short-lived. As I then had a very interesting thought come into my head. ""Where did I leave my legs? I know I had them when that guy was throwing up. Weird. I didn't... wait. What?"" Those were the last lucid thoughts I can recall. Apparently I passed out on the pitch right before the goal line. I had a dream while I was ""out."" I was back home trying to hook up a Nintendo 64 and PlayStation to our big entertainment center, and fumbling with wires. When I became lucid again, I realized those wires were all plugged into ME. I had a single thought at that very moment.

""I want my mom.""

I was broken and battered more than words can express. Then I get asked by a doctor ""what were you running for? Why weren't you excused from PT?"" I told him bronchitis isn't a valid PT excuse and he looks at me quixotically, and says ""you have viral lung pneumonia. You shouldn't even have been walking. You're lucky to be alive."" He was also NOT happy with the infirmary doc at the 320th. But I didn't tell him what happened in the dorms that one night.

I ended up being transferred to the 319th, ""Crutchland,"" where injured or incredibly ill trainees go temporarily. Once recovered you get put into another flight that was on the same training week as when you left off. However, in my case, I wasn't just sent to the 319th, but to ""the B dorms."" Dorms B-9 and B-10 were the ""You're being sent home"" dorms of the 319th. Most people there had major stress fractures in their shins, and needed months of recovery off-base before being sent back.

I, however, was not going home temporarily. I was being kicked out. I'd just spent a week in Wilford with a vapor tube being lodged down my throat every 3, 6, 9 and 12 AM & PM, for seven days in a row. Guess how much rest I got in that time? That's right... none. For a WEEK. And then I'm being kicked out? After being FREAKING TORTURED? AND KILLED?! Great. Okay. Cool. There's no justice in this world; learned that at 18 right then and there, lemme tell ya what.

Somehow things stayed about as bad. Colonel Dunbar (yeah lady, I still remember your name... I will never forget your name) who was in charge of Lackland, AFB, decided to wait to sign my discharge papers. Waiting and waiting and waiting... until I was in Basic training for longer than it even takes to finish Basic. When did I finally get discharged? Two days before it would have changed from Erroneous Enlistment to Honorable Discharge.

TWO. DAYS. SHE WAITED ON PURPOSE! She threw me off to the side until they would've had to be decent human beings to me. As in the end, I was discharged under the pretenses of ""inability to maintain military composure,"" that my enlistment was a mistake, and blacklisted from ever joining ANY military branch in the country for the rest of my life.

Now I get PTSD nightmares, where I'm rejoining the Air Force and getting tortured again. I can never speak up, or do anything to defend myself. The worst ones are where the latrine is a serpentine network of catacombs, and there's a river of filthy water flowing through it that I'm supposed to clean, while completely naked. It's always full of urine, feces, and skeletal rotting corpses. People are all standing up on rafters above me, fully clothed, looking down on, and mocking me. It always looks a little different in the dorms, and one time the dorm was in a Final Fantasy-style airship for some reason.

But I always ask myself the same question, for nearly 20 years now, ""why do I keep rejoining? I don't want to be here. How did I end up here again? I don't even remember going to the MEPS.""

Then I wake up, reminded that I'm an ardent and horrific failure at everything I've ever wanted or cared about doing. I've battled with suicidal thoughts on a daily basis all these years because of how severe it gets, even just in my dreams.

There's only one thing I can do well in any capacity; one single, little thing... I am a damn good writer. I had to become one, because I'm still incapable of expressing these things verbally. Instead, I decided to not just escape, but create a world for others to escape into, too. I know I'm not the only person who's had to endure such things, and so it became tantamount, in some way, for me to help others.

I have written ten novels in the last 20~ years, the majority of which was written while I was my dad's caretaker, during his last decade of life. 

It's all so bittersweet for me, as I never would have explored this talent unless my life was destroyed out from under my feet. And so, this is the only sword I have to combat the endless throngs of personal demons.

And no matter what anybody does to me, or says to me; this skill is MINE. It belongs to ME. It's MY weapon, and I will fight so long as even a single molecule of blood exists in my body; for not even Death himself could take me down.

So what can mere men do to me? I say; nothing.

Only I can make myself hurt. Only I can make myself bleed. My dreams, nightmares, all of my pain--mental, and physical.

It's MINE. It belongs TO ME.

454,I have extreme sexual repression & possibly Sexual Aversion Disorder for sexual assault as a child and negative beliefs on sex at an early age,1,11k0aj0,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11k0aj0/i_have_extreme_sexual_repression_possibly_sexual/,0,"I was assaulted at 12 by my cousin. My brain shut off that memory and a few months after I turned 18 it popped back up, last year: Ever since then I became slowly aware of how my assault effected me and it‚Äôs has been killing me. 

When I first found out about sex, I was told it was sin and should never be comitted by my parents. Which led me to have my own beliefs on sex. Being that sex entirely is a sinful evil act that committed by evil greedy people and there are two ways of making babies. The sinful way and praying to god to have a baby. I believe in this until the age of 13-14 when I found out there was only one way of making a baby. 

I was also exposed to porn and masturbation at an early age. Line around 10-11

I demonise, hate and am disgusted by people who have sexual desires and act on them. I see them as selfish evil people who have no emotions but pleasure and feel the need to avoid them at all costs. I see people like this because my brain likes to view people with sexual desire the same way I view my assaulter to protect me from being potentially assaulted again and also from my negative beliefs on sex. 

I hate the topic of sex and every mention of it I become agressiv, angry, guilt, shame. I‚Äôve never experienced anything sexual since I‚Äôm a virgin but I can imagine being terrified and having anxiety if I‚Äôm ever put in a situation where sexual acts are possible. When sex is brought up especially if it reminds me of my sexual assault, my muscles and body tenses up, I become emotional and want to cry, sweating and huge amounts of anxiety and panic. This often leads to breakdowns. And lately I‚Äôve been experiencing this a lot. Ever since my repressed memory popped up again at 18, I‚Äôve had multiple breakdowns when reminded of sex and my sexual assault and nowadays I feel the need to breakdown multiple times a day and it takes a lot out of me to stop. I also try to actively avoid my feelings 

This is has lead me to have issues with my body and how is see it. My body feels sexual desires, and that‚Äôs a problem to me. I hate it. I think I‚Äôm disgusting and there‚Äôs nothing I can do to change it. I hate my body for it. I‚Äôm a virgin, and if I lose it, I will demonise myself as much I demonise the others. I don‚Äôt think I will be able to ever handle the fact that I had sex without wanting to k** myself and despise it so much more than I already do. 

I even I identified myself as an asexual for a few months becaue i couldn‚Äôt handle the fact that my body feels sexual urges. I felt so happy and comfortable for once in my body, I loved it so much. I realised I wasn‚Äôt a sexual and just used it to cope with the fact that I hate my body an anything remotely sexual.

This has lead to an increase in suicidal thoughts to the point where it is unbearable. ( I became suicidal and depressed at age 9)

These feelings are killing me. I cannot beat to live with them any longer.I need so advice to  how to cope with this? 

Is it only sexual repression and sexual aversion disorder or is it something more or something else?

Also does anyone else feel this way?",1678112724.0

It‚Äôs never gotten better, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll get better. 12 years out the window, not knowing what‚Äôs wrong, and now knowing what‚Äôs wrong, still can‚Äôt fix it. My beliefs about others harming me are so deep, I just can‚Äôt change them, no matter how many exercises I do on paper. Has anyone ever gotten better? I know there‚Äôs no cure, but did life ever become worth living after the trauma. I just want to die all the time, I fantasize about it. Other than guilt, my cats the only thing that really keeps me from just ending it. I just feel hopeless. What‚Äôs the point if nothing works? Has anyone found anything that works? I just feel so dead inside

Edit: I just want to thank everyone for replying. It‚Äôs not the first time I‚Äôve felt that way, but it was absolutely terrible.

For someone afraid of confrontation, I have this need to confront my abuser. I want to get angry, yell at them. Shame anyone who is currently sympathetic to them. But I can't. Because it would make me a bad person if I went to that petty level. The abuse I've faced eats me up inside every day, and I've heard all the advice I could. 

""Focus on yourself."" ""Keep moving forward."" ""Do some self care.""

I'm not ignoring the advice. It's all reasonable and good. But it feels like no matter how much I practice mindfulness and self care, I'm still stuck with this need to confront my abuser. I want the power that was taken from me. 

Even if it didn't make everything worse for me, would it *really* be better if I got my chance to yell at them? It'd be out of my system, but then what? Any sadness I feel afterward would be frustrating because ""confrontation was supposed to make me feel better.""

464,jaw issues???,12,11iyke7,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11iyke7/jaw_issues/,20,"I was diagnosed with PTSD around October of this past year. I started having fairly excruciating jaw pain that just got worse in December or so. It was giving me a lot of trouble, I would wake up with throbbing headaches‚Ä¶ That would easily last throughout the day. I would wake up in the middle of the night because my jaw would be hurting so much.

And then after about a month and some change, it stopped. Pretty much out of nowhere, suddenly.

I thought it was weird‚Ä¶ But I didn‚Äôt question it, as it was so painful, why would I question not being in pain anymore? I figured that maybe it was just a temporary thing and I was done with it, it wasn‚Äôt a problem anymore. 

well, I woke up yesterday with my jaw hurting again. At least before when I had the flare up, my jaw didn‚Äôt pop when I ate/talked. Now it is. I can tell that it‚Äôs getting worse, it‚Äôs only been another day since it started, but it‚Äôs worse than yesterday. And if it follows the same trend that the last flareup did, it will just hurt more and more each day.

I absolutely know I need to go to the doctor, I have a appointment with my PCP this coming week. But my understanding is that this is something that can stem from PTSD. And I really feel like that‚Äôs the only thing it can stem from in my case as well. My close friend also has PTSD, and she told me that she deals with jaw issues from her PTSD as well, and that she was told the only treatment for this is a mouthguard. And from the research I‚Äôve done on the Internet, that seems to be the case.

So just to clarify, I‚Äôm not really asking about treatment for this, I‚Äôm just wondering how common it is for other people like if you experience it. and if it comes in episodes like this for other people‚Ä¶ And for those who have had the PTSD diagnosis longer than a year, unlike I have, if this is a ‚Äúit‚Äôs just the reality now‚Äù sort of thing aka if this will keep happening. I am also wondering, if anyone has had this in an episodic sort of way, if they notice when/how the onset of this happens.

The main things I spoke about were the car crash I was involved in two years ago, the bullying I‚Äôve experienced since I‚Äôve started school, the abuse from my nan, there are some things I wish I had mentioned but I was too scared to. My cousin would continuously hit me and at some point threatened me with a knife to my throat which has caused me to have an overwhelming fear around people holding sharp objects ever since. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a knife, scissors or a razor, if I‚Äôm not in control of that object I‚Äôll immediately go into flight or fight. I said nothing about this as the only person in real life who knows about this is my friend, I‚Äôm 14 now and this happened when I was 8 and. I don‚Äôt want to cause any arguments in my family and it isn‚Äôt like I can prove it. 

Anyway, the woman I was talking to had me do a CRIES assessment and she said my marks were very high and when I got home I searched stuff up about it and learnt that it‚Äôs a brief screening for PTSD. I told my friend about the CAMHS appointment and she said that it won‚Äôt be surprising if I do end up finding out I have PTSD, I‚Äôve honestly been suspicious of it for a while now. Most nights I worry about sleeping as I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll have more nightmares, there is a common theme of sharp objects, being screamed at, car crashes and accidents, getting beaten and being unable to fight back, never being strong enough to defend myself, being ignored as if I‚Äôm not there, being tortured, I remember I once accidentally fell asleep on the sofa next to my mum after I woke up in the morning when she came in (this is when I used to sleep on the sofa a few months, it went on for two years and it sucked) and I had a dream where she was screaming at me, she wouldn‚Äôt acknowledge anything I said, she begun throwing things at me and I all I could do was yell ‚Äúshut up‚Äù in response and I ended up yelling that in real life the second I woke up. She scowled and said ‚Äúyou shut up‚Äù and before I could even proceed anything I just started crying, not because she told me to shut up, I just did and I don‚Äôt know why. Outside of nightmares there‚Äôs the fact that I constantly feel on edge, I always feel like I need to be prepared for something bad to happen. Sometimes this gets so bad that I feel a need to keep a knife on hand incase anything happens. I feel terrified when people raise their voice, even if it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre happy or even if it‚Äôs not directed towards me. Sometimes it reaches a point where I can barely breathe, it happens so often for so many stupid reasons. I cant really go into much more detail currently as Reddit is lagging horribly while typing which is annoying but I will proceed to copy and paste what I‚Äôve written in my notes.

I want to talk to my mum about this as the woman at CAMHS said something about a team that helps with trauma however I may have to do a 10 week thing for anxiety. I want to mention the possibility of PTSD but I‚Äôm scared that she‚Äôll think I‚Äôm being stupid as I‚Äôm 14 and I‚Äôm worried that that‚Äôs generally how I come off when I speak about this. I don‚Äôt want to have PTSD, I just want confirmation as to why I feel like this. I hate it, I hate being left in the dark about this. My mum hasn‚Äôt spoken to me about the CAMHS appointment and acts cold when I try to talk to her about it. A week after I had the CAMHS appointment we found out that we‚Äôre getting evicted in April I believe which is fucking terrifying. I don‚Äôt know how I can get used to anywhere other than this shitty flat I‚Äôve lived in my whole life. I want to stay here with my friend as she‚Äôs the only person who I actually see as family. She‚Äôs said that if we‚Äôre unable to find somewhere to live I can stay with her and if we have to leave the area we‚Äôre currently situated in I can live with her, that‚Äôs what her and her mum have said. According to my friends tennis coach who used to be a psychiatrist she says that based on what she knows about me it‚Äôs likely that I have PTSD based on what she‚Äôs been told. She‚Äôs also says my mum exudes narcissistic traits which isn‚Äôt surprising and it‚Äôs another reason as to why I‚Äôd like to stay with my friend. All of that is for another time but my best bet is to stay with my friend if all goes wrong. If my mum can‚Äôt find somewhere she‚Äôll have to stay with my nan who as I‚Äôve previously said is abusive and thankfully my mum isn‚Äôt forcing me to see her, even more so since the CAMHS appointment due to the opinions given by the CAMHS woman.

TW: sound and blood,71,11icv3b,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11icv3b/nsfw_fatal_accident_at_work_tw_sound_and_blood/,16,"Note: I‚Äôm currently speaking with a therapist and we are working on coping techniques for me. I still have a hard time talking about this to anyone at work and I find that speaking with people outside of work is easier. The next two paragraphs are for some context to help you better understand. I‚Äôm going to keep other details as vague as I possibly can. 

I worked security for 7 years, went to police academy and failed out 1 week before graduation, and supervised part of a warehouse for almost 2 years. The training and knowledge I have lends itself in the story below. I now rent cars in a very busy operation. 

The parking garage where we rent cars has low clearance and we have our customers sign an addendum stating that they cannot bring large vans inside the garage; they must call 15 minutes prior to arriving and we will meet them and process the return.

One evening a customer brought a van down to the parking garage. Two of our company drivers were trying to move this van out of the garage. One driver decided to go up on the back of the van to check for clearance. The other driver inside must not have seen this and was slowly backing up the van. I was inside our office along with some other coworkers and my supervisor. Myself and two others were watching this unfold and were puzzled. Suddenly, I heard this loud cracking noise and saw the man on the back pinned against the van. It sounded almost like metal getting smacked super hard or the sound of a branch breaking. I soon realized it was the sound of bones breaking. 

The two drivers didn‚Äôt see the low support beam. By the time the driver backing up the van heard and saw, it was too late. The man on the back of the van was crushed between the van and the support beam.

I sprinted over to the van and was one of the first ones there. My supervisor arrived shortly after me she and knelt down beside him. The driver on the rear fell down and crumpled onto his side in the recovery position. I don‚Äôt remember seeing where the blood was pouring out from, but there was dark red blood on the ground and he wasn‚Äôt moving. My training kicked in. 

I directed some bystanders to call 911 and for the now growing crowd of onlookers to get back. Remembering the ABC‚Äôs and MARCH, I ran over to where we keep the bleed bag (it was more of a pouch) to see if I could get some hemostatic dressing for the bleeding. Of course, when I got back he hadn‚Äôt moved from where he landed. I didn‚Äôt see his chest moving and at this point I knew he was dead. 

I don‚Äôt remember feeling anything for the next 30 minutes except for a sense of urgency and an eerie calm. To prevent everyone from freezing and panicking, I barked out orders to give everyone clear and concise tasks. While my supervisor was on the phone with emergency services, I redirected all of our operations to prevent people from walking into the scene or witnessing the man on the ground. I checked in on all of my coworkers: 2 were crying uncontrollably in the back room, one was clearly in shock, and one girl asked if he was going to make it. I flatly told her that he was gone and I didn‚Äôt think he suffered. 

Police finally arrived after about 5 minutes. We continued with the modified plan until another supervisor arrived on scene and closed the area down.

I was placed at a corner near the scene for the next 4 hours while police closed it off and started their investigation. The feeling of calm and urgency left me when the adrenaline wore off. I was restless and hated faking a smile and pretending nothing happened while I redirected traffic. The feeling soon changed to anger and frustration for not having any new safety policies or trainings after I asked for them 2 months ago.

I was finally able to provide my statement and went home. I went to work the next day and all of upper management was there. After speaking with some on-site counselors, I finally felt the weight come off my shoulders, broke down, and went home. 

I couldn‚Äôt sleep for the first two days, I kept seeing it happen over and over again. I spoke to my wife, some friends, and finally got in touch with a therapist. Work transferred me to another location and now I‚Äôm trying to move forward. I still have some nightmares and some loud noises still trigger me.

He and I hung out for three days and had a solid connection. He and I would just talk for hours on end. He told mutual friends that he liked me. I wasn't supposed to find out, but everyone told me. All my friends were hyping me up saying ""oh, he likes you‚Äù, or ""look, your boyfriend's here!"" 

I went up to my crush and asked him if he liked me. He told me that he had a girlfriend. After, he blew up on our friends, texting them ""why'd you tell her?"" and ""you promised me you wouldn't say anything!"" Our friend were shocked about the girlfriend, but no one believed it. It seemed like he made it up because he was too embarrassed to admit he liked me. So I requested to follow him on social media. He left it pending for two weeks before rejecting it. It was then that I knew he really did have a girlfriend, because he clearly did like me, so would he say no? I overreacted, and I blocked him. 

Two months later, they broke up. Literal days after, he started looking at my social media. It's been two years, and he always looks at it. I know that it doesn't mean anything. I get that sometimes people are curious to see what other people are up to, but let me ask you this: if you feel whatever about someone, are you going to be looking at their profiles everyday?

The entire time throughout my childhood I had anxiety and health issues, but my parents wouldn‚Äôt take me to see a doctor. Ever‚Ä¶I had scoliosis thanks to my school nurse noticing and she spoke to my parents to take me to a specialist because my curve was pretty bad and that with my young age surgery would benefit me. My dad refused that and instead had a family friend who was a chiropractor. The man would adjust me for free, but he made my pain worse‚Ä¶so bad that there would be days that I couldn‚Äôt move my neck, (he also wasn‚Äôt actually a chiropractor and inappropriately touched me) my dad didn‚Äôt care and I think he knew what he was getting me into and maybe thats why it was free for him. When I told him the chiropractor made me uncomfortable he said I was being ridiculous. 

My father was, and is, an awful human. He is a pedophile, drunk and narcissist. He abused my sister and I. Sometimes he would lock me in small ice coolers when he was drunk, throw me into walls, yank my hair, not let me have locks on my doors, read my diary, log into all my social media accounts and threatened to kill me when angry. He would strangle me when he was mad at my mother and would only stop once she said sorry. 

My mother was an alcoholic who gaslighted me very often, she crumbled what my view of reality was. She also had agoraphobia, paranoia and was extremely mentally abusive. Once I had a kidney infection and was urinating blood, crying and vomiting. She told me if I wasn‚Äôt such a whore this wouldn‚Äôt happen. My best friends mom who was a doctor came to pick me up and took me to her clinic. She said I almost died and was glad I called her. She hated my parents and wanted me to live with her, but trying to fight that would have been too dangerous at the time. My dad was too unpredictable. 

I developed endometriosis when I was about 13, (i wasn‚Äôt officially diagnosed until a few years ago but had all the symptoms) I would soak through ten pads a day and curl over, black out and moan from the pain and feel exhausted, but my mom said that was normal. She fat shamed me, didnt believe me when I told her about my dad abusing me, pulled me out of high school junior year, and forbid me from seeing my friends because I treated them like my family. I found an online high school program and secretly finished my degree. I got scholarships and wanted to study in college, I qualified for financial aid because we were under the poverty level. I had to get a parent to cosign and my mother wouldn‚Äôt cosign financial aid for me to duel enroll in college. She wouldn‚Äôt let my dad either. I knew where she kept IRS documents and stole them, forged her signature and enrolled. 

I finally turned 18 and moved in with some friends‚Ä¶my dad found out where I lived and would show up often, sometimes to bring me food from friends or try to convince me to come back home.

I refused and one day woke up dizzy, wheezing, pain, unable to walk with a fever of 101. My father showed up to my house again told me it was probably something I exposed myself to it by changing my flat tire on my vehicle‚Ä¶both my parents wouldn‚Äôt let me tell anyone that I was sick and on the brink of death. I obviously defied those demands and contacted my best friend‚Äôs mother who was a doctor. She picked me up from my house, had to carry me to her car and brought me to her clinic, she tested me for toxins and it was positive for arsenic. My mother found the chemicals my dad had hidden away in a cabinet and later told me when the diagnosis came out. My fingernails fell off! My bffs doc let me live with her while I healed. It took 3 months to rid it all from my system. To this day I wonder if it triggered any of the issues I have today. This also made me fail college. 

To this day I believe a mix of my genetics, environment and mental anguish caused irreversible damage to my mind and body. I have panic disorders and multiple diseases.",1677979624.0

My mum on the other hand has very very sensitive and fragile skin. She medically has some sort of iron haemoglobin issues that means sometimes bruises randomly appear on her body and a single scratch on her skin can take days to be gone (she is very prone to bruising unlike me) 

Recently I‚Äôve been starting to fight back the abuse. I was twisted and pinned into this wall. She was so much stronger. Her adult force on me was far more than my force on her. The only thing I could use were my nails to grab at her arm. I finally freed myself and had two welts across my face along with the inside of my cheeks blistered because of how hard she pressed them (hurting consistently for three days now). The welts went away in two hours. My glasses were so badly twisted from the impact that I had to take a screwdriver and tools to actually bend them back into place.

im a cis (or something) woman for context.

my sexual trauma starts when i was as young as 5, but continues throughout my entire life, mostly in the way of being groomed. groomed unknowingly by adults, groomed by men who wanted to take advantage of me, groomed by society. being hypersexual my whole life i think as a response to trauma. its too much to get into and this isnt therapy so i dont want to get into it but. i cant even masturbate most of the time because it makes me feel disgusted to think about touching myself. i cant think about sexual things, can't think about having sex with my boyfriend, sometimes i don't even want him to touch me. i tried to give him a blowjob a couple weeks ago and had to stop because i felt like i was going to pass out or throw up. this started last winter and has just gotten worse and worse and worse over the last year. i thought i just had low libido because i was stressed. ive even questioned if im actually asexual. but i want to have sex, i want to feel close to my partner.

it's even affected my gender expression in a way, feeling disgusted by the way other people look at me.

it just started in the last year, i used to be such a sexual person, i loved sex, i loved talking about sex, i loved taking nudes, i loved sexting, anything sexual was like a core part of my personality. in a way im glad its not anymore. its gotten to the point where i feel like sex hurts my soul. i feel like sex is a waste of time. i told my boyfriend i dont want to have sex anymore because im ""depressed"" and it ""feels wrong"" which is true but i think the full berth of it that im not telling him is more grim.

i googled why i might feel guilty for masturbating and an article came up talking about ""if you masturbate you'll learn how to make your partner feel better too!"" and felt sick to my stomach. i thought ""fuck making my partner feel good."" after being groomed and used for so long i dont fucking care about making anyone cum. fuck you.

tw: mentions of rape and discussing the mental state I was in

So for context: I'm 20f, bi, demisexual (ace spectrum), I'm single and nor interested in anyone right now, also can't and won't do hook ups due to being demi. I was raped three years ago, diagnosed with PTSD and taking meds. I'm in therapy, but I don't have money to do it as frequently as I want to

And pease, try to be nice, I'm doing good right now, otherwise I wouldn't post it, but I still can get triggered if you start to blame me for not saying no and stuff during the thing, my brain just did what it had to do to survive and god knows what would've happened if it didn't. And also please leave out judgment about my sexuality and discussions whether or not ace/bi ppl exist. Thank you

So I realize it's not a pressing issue right now, but it will be someday and I want to have advice on what to do in that case.

I was raped by the man and I'm bi, so I thought I won't have an issue with it when it comes to women, but I do. I had my girlfriend (girl who is a friend, yeah) interested in me, we were at a bar and at one point went to the bathroom to vape a little bit. I wasn't drunk, she was kinda a bit at that point. She confessed she had feelings for me and started touching me and stuff, we never actually did anything and she is a survivor herself, so she made it very clear that I can say no at any point. Nevertheless I froze. I couldn't say to her that I didn't want it for a couple of minutes. I just went back to that state, ""mb if I just wait and don't do anything, they eventually will get bored and just leave me alone"". I just started dissociating from my body a bit and was prepared to wait it out, but I managed to pull myself back into reality and told her to stop. And she did. We talked about it, I said I don't like her romanticaly, therefore I don't want to do anything sexual with her, she understood and we still talk like friends. 

But the coming back to the state I was in really scared me. I had flashbacks to rape the next day. I never want to feel like that again, but I understand I most likely will. And also I read one post here and ppl were discussing in the comments how much stronger men can be than women, I just also afraid that if I fall in love with a guy, I'd be too scared to have sex with him ever. I don't ever want to feel helpless. Even if they give me explicit permission to say no, I now know that I can still freeze and dissociate and it is difficult to pull myself out of it, it's like you just want everything to be over, you don't feel there at the moment, you just think if you wait they finally will leave you be. 

I also knew my rapist and were in love with him before rape (luckily, once I've realized what happened, it just disappeared immediately. Even before I realized), it was a long process of him violating my boundaries over one year period. So I don't trust my judgement when I fall in love, even though I knew it wasn't healthy and broke it off before rape myself. And I just feel like I can't trust myself anymore, especially when it comes to men. I fall in love really-really rarely and with ppl of different genders, I don't have many experience bc of it. 

I understand that this issue almost likely can be resolved only with a partner and I'm not even in love with anybody right now, but it is bothering me in the present moment and having information makes me calmer. Also, mb there is something I can do right now to prevent this from repeating? 

I'd be really grateful for your thoughts on this or if you can just say smth niceüòÖ",1677949040.0

My parents bought a ticket to travel to Turkey. One of my biggest triggers for PTSD is to do with the fact my main abuser was Middle Eastern.

Turkey is not as Middle Eastern as, say, Iran, but still I'm getting mad anxiety as it is just thinking about it.

The trip is in June and my parents don't mind if I refund the ticket. But I feel like I may let them down and miss out.

At the same time, its only been a year since diagnosis/PTSD developed and I still struggle with strongly linked triggers. I have learned to deal with most triggers but the thought of being in a place that's alien to me and reminds me constantly of the abuser.

Its hard thinking about it. I don't know if I feel comfortable being in that country knowing I could flashback or panic attack any moment- and how is that dealt with over there?

Im seriously considering cancelling the plane ticket, or talking with my therapist on Tuesday.

Either way, does anyone have experience jn this kind of actuation?

I‚Äôm currently at school, where some really unlucky bad stuff happened that makes it really hard for me to feel safe here. I find myself often struggling with staying present due to a lot of flashbacks, overthinking/anxiety, but also trouble thinking. 

It has manifested a lot in social interactions. For example, I went to the aquarium yesterday with a friend and could not focus on actually looking at the fish and instead was in my head, and I know it seemed to my friend that I was just bored and disinterested. Today he texted me a joke about fish and it took me a good bit to remember we even went to the aquarium. Beyond this example, my anxiety/flashbacks has definitely made me less aware, withdrawn, and less fun to be around which has negatively impacted my relationships. 

I don‚Äôt want to continue living like this, but plan to stay here to finish up my degree at the end of the spring. Does anybody have any tips on getting out of your head, not succumbing to anxiety/paranoia and quickly snapping out of/preventing flashbacks?",1677944917.0

Today I (21) was sitting in class and we are currently discussing the topic mental health and especially depression. We were watching a movie about a young girl who survived suicide and she talked about being bullied in the past amongst other things.

I am a lesbian and have homophobic parents, so I went through a shitload of homophobia and emotional abuse after I had come out of the closet when I was 15; I was rejected by my parents for who I am. I have nearly no memory of my life before that, so I always thought this was the point where me being traumatized really started, which lead to my mental health issues now.

Suddenly while I‚Äòm sitting in class today I had the most random flashbacks, remembering I was bullied intermittently between ages 12-15, remembering I had my first serious suicidal thoughts before I turned 13 (like goddamn I was really so young?); remembering how I felt incredibly alone and emotionally abandoned by my parents to the point my dance teacher became more of a parent figure to me than my actual parents ever were at age 15. Remembering I had no real friends at all before turning 16. 

I literally forgot all of this and it really baffled me how this suddenly came back; I kind of can‚Äôt imagine I really went through all of this? I‚Äòm at a way much better point mentally now gladly and I also have a healthier relationship to my parents. 

But like, do you ever realize ‚Äúholy shit my childhood really was that bad so it makes sense I turned to be fucked up like this today‚Äú?
How do you deal with painful memories like these? I mean, I guess it shaped me into the person I have become today, and I certainly grew from it, but holy shit I wished I could go back to my 14 year old self and give them the biggest fattest hug ever. This person felt so lonely for so many years. Like how did I even survive this lmao

507,Can anyone relate?,1,11hwg6s,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11hwg6s/can_anyone_relate/,1,"
Well, this may be long and jumbled but I will try my best to explain everything. I'd love have someone read this but I understand if it's too long. So, I've struggled with depression, anxiety, and OCD since I was 8 years old. I was diagnosed with all three early on in life. I am currently 24 and was diagnosed with PTSD 3 years ago from a lot of stressful events that happened around 5 years ago and some stuff in between. I'm a very sensitive person. I feel everything. My senses get overloaded easily. Etc. I've had sleep issues ever since I was 13. They seem to be getting weirder and more stressful as I get older and more stressed. So around December I got covid. It triggered an OCD spiral that I couldn't get out of and essentially it created a lot of associations and flashbacks of things that happened 5 years ago. I haven't had emotions tied to my trauma ever. Until recently in December. It hit me suddenly and I began to spiral with flashbacks, panic attacks, losing weight, shaking everyday, not sleeping, etc etc. I was a complete wreck. I would shake all day long. Get no sleep. Cry all day. Get flashbacks non stop. Panic all day. Etc. once this started consistently going on all day everyday, my derealization/depersonalization kicked in really badly. My depression got insanely bad to the point I felt ready to k!ll myself. I gasped for air before falling asleep everynight, I have nightmares, bad dreams, wake up every hour confused and disoriented. I'll wake up feeling so dark and depressed like my world is crashing. Like a huge dark cloud is over me. Everything feels distant and fake and dark. Even thinking about my parents or sister or my house, it all feels dark and fake and I don't know why. I have racing thoughts before falling asleep. These thoughts are jumbled and don't make sense or have any correlation to reality. I fall asleep and within an hour I'm tossing and turning and half awake half asleep. While I wake up these times throughout the night I wake up feeling disoriented and saying and thinking random shit that seems like an alternate reality. I keep feeling the same feeling as it happens like every night now. How my night of sleep goes, bleeds into my day. Throughout the day I'll remember what it was like to feel confused and disoriented thinking weird thoughts that make no sense. It takes me back to how I felt in those moments and it freaks me out and makes me really depressed. I know a lot of these weird symptoms happen only surrounding sleep but it feels like psychosis or something during those times at night bc it's so confusing and disorienting. I hate feeling out of control. I have a fear of going crazy. During the day, my senses are heightened and pick up on everything. I feel groggy all day. Sleep deprived. Not thinking straight. Depressed as hell. Everything feels dark. All the symptoms of DR/DP. I have a hard time eating. I panic non stop. I had to stop my life lately (I can't work, go to the gym, hang with friends, drive, leave the house, etc). I've been to two psych inpatient units bc of how out of control I felt. I lost 12 pounds from my stress. I am already light weight so it's detrimental. 110lbs down to 97/98. Was able to bring it back up a little bit but it's a battle. I don't have an eating disorder. Anxiety just hits me in my stomach. All day long I suffer ocd intrusive thoughts and have rituals and compulsions. I feel crazy and alone. I over analyze everything I feel or think bc of my fear of losing touch with reality. I am nervous I have irreversible brain damage from all the stress. I know writing this doesn't capture what really has been going on and I understand that. I just want to know if anyone has every felt so stressed that every second of the day and night, they are bombarded by mental issues? Strange sleep issues, panic, depression, feeling of darkness, DR/DP symptoms, racing thoughts, senses heightened, weird feelings u can't explain, etc. idk. It's so hard to explain.",1677926861.0

My PTSD comes from street violence, War, and my job in a violent field.  Here is what has helped me. Brief bio: Combat Vet, work in mental health field.

Your healing is a journey, and may not be quick. It takes dedication and good support along the way (friends/family/therapy). If you don't have family support, groups can help.

After the first tip, not necessarily in order. I do highly recommend the first:

1. Having a therapist, one I trust and feel comfortable with. You don't need to open up, immediately, but you should feel comfortable with them. The therapist could be male, female, trans, younger/older, whatever you feel safe with. If you don't connect to them after a time, feel free to ask for a change, or make the change yourself.
2. Know where to get help (quickly, if needed). Here in NY, people can get help faster if they visit urgent mental health care facilities, or emergency rooms. You should not have to pay out of pocket. If you have no insurance, there are places that do sliding scales.
3. Medications: finding the right fit, dosages, and if there are side effects. Medication effectiveness can change over time, however.
4. Arts: I do photography and writing, but any art may help you. 
5. Exercise; gym, cardio, yoga. I find Yoga and Jiu Jitsu help a great deal.
6. Mediation (guided, mindfulness, Transcendental, etc.)
7. Exploring different types of therapy; DBT, CBT, drug and alcohol treatment, group therapy, psychedelic-assisted treatment, and marijuana.

You can't likely do all of these at once if you have a busy lifestyle. Mixing and matching may be a good option.  I am not saying this would work for all of you, but it's worth a shot if you haven't tried some of it.

I was terrified to go because when I was a kid my mom let the nurses and doctors SA me in exchange for prescription drugs and i get very triggered now. I haven't seen a doctor except once since i was a kid and i have avoided all health related stuff until now.

  So i went to the cardiologist and i went back and got weighed, the nurse took me into one of the rooms and took and EKG and stuff, then started with the weird.

Nurse - ""You know your very young to be in here, im much older than you""

Me - ""okay... how old."" 

N- ""42""

She then starts asking about my drug use, i tell her i used many things (i wont list all) but im sober now. She keeps asking for more details, keeps asking why i would use XYZ drug. Her tone felt evil and at this point I have a bad feeling. 

 She sits down while im still on the bench thing and starts reading my file;

N - "" anxiety, i have that too. depression, okay. PTSD? How is your relationship with your parents?""

Me - "" I dont talk to them anymore.""

N- ""why not?""

Me - "" They abused me and are severe drug addicts""

N - "" Oh im sure they mean well, my dad is a drug addict""

Me - "" No, I dont want to talk to them or have them in my life""

&#x200B;

At this point im dissociating so hard i stop seeing color and the walls are swirling and melting

 N - ""Okay your heartrate is ---/---""

Me - ""okay what does that mean?""

N - "" I dont know, ask the doctor when he comes in here, (aggressively) what were the numbers?!""

Me - "" Im not sure im heavily dissociated""

N - "" Okay we need you to focus, we need you to pay attention so we can help you.""

Me - "" I cant really help it, im trying my best""

N - ""Try harder, you have to actually try""

&#x200B;

Now im fucking pissed and i can literally feel my heart twitching and i lock eyes with her with a scowl

N - ""(sweet motherlike voice) Hey no-one is going to fuck with you, the doctor takes care of me and my grandma, hes really great!"" 

She also kept saying how hot it was in the room, it was cold if anything, but she asks me to move and sit on the chairs so she can get on top of the table i was sitting at and she stands on top if it to mess with a vent on the ceiling, then leaves the room. 

She comes back and sits in the chair next to me and hands me a glass of water, puts her arm around me and starts rubbing my back and says;

N - "" so why dont you like nurses?""

Me - "" I said my parents were drug addicts, i was payment most of the time""

N - ""Oh""

Nurse then immediately gets up and walks away, gets the doctor and I dont see her again.

It has been weeks since it happened but i have night terrors again and ive been hallucinating really bad again, i cant stop replaying it in my head.

512,I snapped out of a post episode shutdown after 2 days instead of weeks recently,7,11hhqeb,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11hhqeb/i_snapped_out_of_a_post_episode_shutdown_after_2/,2,"I had a bad episode for the first time in 2-3 months. My past response is to completely shut down and isolate for days to over a week. Then put out the fires I made by doing so. 

I used all my willpower to notify my professor just so she is aware and I will be in class online next day. It took 5-10 minutes to do that, but wow felt like eternity. Kept typing then deleting. Knew I was just going to spiral and if continues I'll end up just not saying anything. So caught myself and just hit sent. (it was so badly written, but my professor replied immediately and said its okay and not to worry)

  I even had someone reach out and ask if I was okay. I of course didn't respond, but that text did help snap me out enough to do some self care/love.

  I made some comfort food, and mellowed out alone. 
In the morning I tried to attend class, but due to storm wifi kept going out. I just want to shut down, this is some bs... I have no reception so second I had wifi for a min I ask my professor to record the lecture and apologize. Again she says not to worry and will record it.

  I just lay in bed and try not to spiral. I can't drive anywhere cus not in the right mental state and its raining hard. So here I am alone with my thoughts and little to no distractions...

  IDK, I just kept telling myself ""action leads to feeling"" and I got up after a few hours to force myself to do some mundane tasks.  I found doing tasks that require no thought paired with focusing intensely on my breathing seems to work well.

  What I do: Think and say outload ""Inhale (as I inhale through my nose)"" *pause*  ""exhale (as I exhale through my mouth with slightly pursed lips. kind of like an O)"" The pause is like with windshield wipers. very brief. 

  I do this as I dry/wash some dishes, pick up cloths, scrub the stove, recycle the accumulated plastic bottles.

 It varies, could be 5 minutes or 30 minutes later. This isn't enough and intrusive thoughts start flooding in more. The second I notice this I add more to the breathing. On inhale I consciously expand my stomach as for out as it goes, on exhale I deflate it as much as I can, like I am trying to pull my bellybutton to my back/spine.

  When I can do this with little to no thought, I add to it again. This time imagining a wave like motion. As I inhale the wave comes down the back of my stomach deep into in my belly. As I exhale the wave comes up as my belly button pulls to my back and out my mouth.

I do this and keep doing no thought tasks. I honestly am unaware of time when I do this. My body is constantly moving and I am so focused on breathing my brain doesn't have a chance to even think about anything else.  
  
  .

  What happens is this: 
  
   While cleaning and focusing so hard on my breathing I feel like I am completely unaware of time. There is no before, there is no after. All I see is this stove that with every scrub, every wipe is becoming cleaner and cleaner

  at some point while cleaning the stove my eyes search for more grime or whatever to clean and my eyes start rapidly moving all over looking for more to clean. When it can't find anything it snaps me out of the cleaning/breathing state I was in.

  Maybe 5 minutes passed, maybe 30 or 1 hour. It doesn't matter. Here I am now in the aftermath of what felt like eternity while doing it, feeling a bunch of things.
  Things like: happy/accomplished as I look at a now clean stove. conflicted because its over and I am now ""back to reality."" 

  Since I was/am in a hypervigilant state, taking in everything I possibly can and it is a new memory my brain just starts replaying it over and over again (like how when I get triggered and relive a flashback).  

  So what am I now reliving what feels like 10 or 100 times every second now?  Me cleaning a stove. Feels like it will never end. I tell myself with every wipe or scrub it becomes slightly cleaner. That there is only X or a finite amount to clean. Logic and reasoning have no place here to me. cognitive dissonance kicks in. My brain rejects all log/reason and I genuinely feel like that no matter what I do this stove will never be cleaned. 
  But here I am staring with my own eyes at a clean stove and touching it with my fingers. I kind of have a ""huh"" moment. This felt like eternity, but had an end, ""when have I experienced this before?"" My brain feels like its being overclocked as it scans through a lifetime of memories and brings them all up at once. ""dang, this has happened a lot actually... Like thousands of times."" 

  I can feel my emotional state shift as my brain is forced to comes to terms with it being wrong earlier and I actually feel disappointed lol. I end up feeling the need to comfort my own brain and tell myself ""its okay, these things happen."" 

  I just kind of accept that all of this (the episode, feeling like there is no before or after and stuck reliving traumas or unpleasant memories) was not the first time and it will probably happen again in the future, it is just a part of my life, something I cannot change and that is okay, because one day this too will end. 
  What I can change is my response to it. I know if I do nothing I will just keep spiring, isolate, push everyone and everything away until I do something, anything positive and come out of it. 
So of it doesn't matter if I delay doing it by weeks, years, or a few hours, I'll have to eventually come out of it. Past experience has taught me that.
   So I choose to sit with it for a few hours in real life, experience my traumas, relive them for a bit (yeah it was my personal hell, I was treated horribly, and I get angry/sad but at the same time kind of feels ""safe"" or comforting in a weird way). Then I get happy and smile because if I am reliving the traumas, that means I am no longer in those times now. 

  Yeah no shit it would be amazing if the traumas never happened to begin with, but guess what? If I never went through it I'd be a completely different person. This is all a part of me and what makes me who I am. I struggled hard with finding meaning from all this. I spent about 10 years going through everything over and over again. I know how it all happened, what I or others could/should have done differently. In their minds they did what they thought was best/right at the time. I said everything I wanted to say to them. 

  My peace is this ""Everyone tries their best, and that is all anyone can do."" Not best as in for a very specific thing, but best as in overall with everything considered. 

  Like how someone has a long day at work and is too exhausted to cook so they snack on chips or eat fast food. It was the best they can do at the time. yeah sure maybe they could push harder and cook or make healthier options. But they didn't so their best at the time was fast food. Maybe years later they they have health problems from all the fast food, and keep doing it. Still their best. Maybe one day they spend a few seconds considering a healthier option, then eat the same amount. Those few seconds of even considering a healthier option is the best they can do that day. In my mind just because one can physically do more, does not mean they aren't doing their best. 

  I am starting to go off tangents lol. I have a strong urge to delete this and not even post it. In the past I would try to go back, revise, make it as good as I possibly can, prolly spiral. Then not even post it it cus ""what's the point?"" or if I do post it, I'd feel like I have to upvote and reply to every comment because I know I can do it so if I don't then I'm not doing my best. 
  But that isn't right, posting this as is, is my current best. Maybe    I reply to 1 or 2 comments, maybe I do reply to all of them. Or maybe I reply to none and delete this in the future. Whatever I do end up doing, I now know and accept is/will be my best.",1677883966.0
513,Do you keep yourself awake because you know sleep will be worse?,3,11hlmar,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11hlmar/do_you_keep_yourself_awake_because_you_know_sleep/,5,"I am exhausted. I have two young kids, I work full time and I am pretty much always physically and mentally tired. But most of it is self-inflicted. I know that if I fall asleep I‚Äôll have horrible, panic filled nightmares. 

Some are indirect. Memories recovered from the recesses of my mind and contorted by my subconscious into a bizarre dream that leaves me confused and anxious. I know it is some sort of subconscious interpretation of past events, dreamified to the point of weirdness. My trauma twisted into something more like scenes from a fantasy film than my actual life. 

In some ways these types of nightmares are worse. I feel unsettled, anxious and frightened, and yet I have no idea quite *why*. I am left feeling that sense of dread and unease over the past and the future, but I can‚Äôt even properly identify the trigger for my restlessness. 

Others are direct. A flashback in dream form. I either watch events unfold, as a passive observer, or else I am in the scene, taking part and reliving it. I don‚Äôt know how to act when I am involved in the scene. I feel all the emotions of the time, but an elation that I‚Äôm getting a second chance. I vow to do things better this time, but the outcome is always the same. The despair is crushing. And I scream and scream, and apparently it comes out in real life, because I wake up my wife and kids with it. But I am stuck in the nightmare and I can‚Äôt escape. Sometimes I know it‚Äôs a dream, other times not, but I always feel the panic and claustrophobia rising in my chest. 

These dreams make me feel crushed. The band around my chest gets tighter, and I feel like none of my breaths are deep enough. I do have a lot of flashbacks anyway, but there is something so immersive about the dreams, I feel like they‚Äôre a worse form of torture. The pit in my stomach deepens and fills with the emotion awakened by the dream. Despair, guilt, anger, sadness, dread, regret, panic. They suffocate me. Every single night. And I‚Äôm sick of it. I HATE it. 

I‚Äôm exhausted, I desperately crave sleep. And yet I intentionally keep myself awake, scrolling through my phone, reading, anything to stop myself from drifting off. It is so unfair that sleep is a necessity. It‚Äôs so frustrating that the restorative powers of sleep are overwhelmed by the crap that goes along with it. I could be so much better as a parent, husband, brother, better at my job and happier, if I could just rest. But I‚Äôm standing in my own way, because I HAVE to, to avoid the nightmares. I just want to weep sometimes, it makes me so angry and sad and I feel like I‚Äôm failing my wife and kids by being a sleep-deprived zombie. But being woken up by my screams is probably worse. It is the choice between a punch in the face and a kick in the balls.",1677893545.0

515,TW ‚Äî PTSD has ruined my life. (Just venting),2,11hl81r,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11hl81r/tw_ptsd_has_ruined_my_life_just_venting/,1,"***Very big TW for many things***

Throwaway because god forbid anyone find out who I am. I'm rambling a lot in this because I'm in the middle of an anxiety attack and am extremely sad, so I apologize and thank you very much if you even read this through

PTSD from a past relationship has completely fucking ruined my life.

Last year, after a few experiences in my life with abusive people, I got into another abusive relationship. Except in this one, they love bombed me and raped me almost every day for nearly two months.

I had to drop out of university. My parents used that as an opportunity to tell me they won't be supporting me financially any more (especially since I won't be doing 5 classes per semester when I do rejoin. I'll be doing 3 as that is what is best for my mental health). I accepted a part-time job that leaves me mentally exhausted because I have not had a routine in MONTHS and desperately needed it (I am autistic and have ADHD). Since I dropped out, I lost access to my bus pass. I was borrowing a friend's, but somehow I lost it and my friend says they don't have time to make an appointment to get a new one (I said I'd fully pay for the replacement). I can't afford to take the bus by paying out of pocket, and the low-income pass is still way too god damn expensive. I *definitely* won't qualify for disability, despite the amount of shit I have going on that constitutes as a disability, so I can't get the disability pass either. I can barely afford my rent, personal needs, phone bill, etc. I am trying to rely on $40 gift cards from my university's sexual assault support centre, but with the state of our economy, it doesn't exactly help. I can't find another full-time job because no one will hire me as I am now newly 20 years old without a license and I have no qualifications/important experience. My autism and ADHD make it not possible to get a retail or food-related job as it would lead me to become suicidal again, so that's not helping in finding a job. I also just need a job that doesn't require me to travel by bus, but that's next to impossible when living out of the city. My 20th birthday was also definitely the worst birthday I've had in my life. My 18th and 19th were spent in quarantine, my 19th being forgotten by almost everyone except for one of my long distance friends and my parents. At least this year only one person forgot, but I didn't get to see my dad because I had to work that day (my dad is my best friend and since the PTSD started, not being able to be at home with him and my dog in an environment I feel safe and secure in, and I know, is indescribably difficult). Two of my friends wanted to do something with me for my birthday because they forgot last year, but then one of them forgot it was my birthday until two weeks later AGAIN, and the other never brought it up so I never did anything for my birthday. In casual conversation when I reminded my one friend who never brought up celebrating, they said that I just need to find things to do by myself and I have never wanted to scream at someone so badly lmfao

I hate my life and I hate myself for so many things. My list of regrets is so long that it 's choking me. I am doing CPT, but CBT is not made for neurodivergents, so it's honestly a living hell most of the time, despite somehow making progress.

I also feel the need to explain that I know I am privileged in terms of my financial situation with my parents if I wasn't in my current circumstances. They just sprung it on me at an *extremely* distressing moment and my mother is *not* a good mother, so she presented (and still does) the situation inappropriately/unfairly. They pressured me to get a job in high school, but I was severely mentally unstable at the time, meanwhile very occupied with a gifted arts program.",1677892505.0

That I never wanted to do those things, someone groomed me and then coerced me.

Ive felt numb almost all the time since therapy, my skins crawling like its covered in dirt i cant get off, I can't sleep and any tiny bit of emotion I feel makes me want to sob and wretch and break things.

Hi, this is my first post here so I‚Äôm not really sure how to go about this, but a little warning if you don‚Äôt wanna be triggered I just need advice. This also might be a long story. I went through something traumatic a little over a year ago where my sisters pitbull that she had for 4 months mauled our family cat of 16 years. My mom & I were in the middle of this attack to the point where I had bite marks on my hands from my cat & the dog. My cat had her bones and neck broken & she died on my lap when I finally got her out. I ended up going to the hospital bc 
 fingers were so messed up & losing an entire nail. My best friend had to drive me there and had to help me bathe the next day bc I wasn‚Äôt able. She had to take out my dead cats fur out from my hair. So naturally I had really bad ptsd after all this happened from the smell of death, to the noises, & seeing it repeatedly. I used to scream myself hoarse from how bad it got. I still can‚Äôt sleep over the nightmares I have of being attacked and my cat being attacked almost every other day. It also took almost an entire year for my fingers  to heal completely. I still have pain from my fingers doing everyday tasks. They said it was an accident & that no one saw it was coming as of if my warnings for weeks didn‚Äôt matter. They called me selfish & a brat bc I didn‚Äôt accept or like the dog. My mom said that it‚Äôs in a dogs instinct to attack as if that justifies this situation. My mom has forgiven her & is trying to get me to forgive her to bc this hurts my sister too. Yet she did nothing to help the situation. I  can‚Äôt forgive her bc she ended up keeping the dog that did all of this. I felt extremely disrespected & hurt from this decision bc it was like she chose a dog she had for 4 months over me & our cat. It also sucks bc the dog is named after my birth stone so that‚Äôs completely ruined for me besides the point. My sisters wedding is coming up in a few weeks & my family is trying to force me to go & guilt trip into going cause they want me to be there. I don‚Äôt know what to do cause I have absolutely no relationship with my sister. I also don‚Äôt want to go to a party & celebrate two people who caused me an extreme amount of pain and who made these decisions of getting & keeping the dog even after all this happened I don‚Äôt know what to do & I‚Äôm extremely hurt. I never had a good relationship with my sister & to me this was the last straw for me to try & salvage any kind of relationship with her. I keep crying bc I would love to see all my family bc I don‚Äôt see them very often & to be able to dress up in a fancy dress. Other than that I‚Äôd be completely miserable the whole time and be looked at like I‚Äôm the problem at the party. I‚Äôm so tired so If anyone has any advice for me please.

But he would also sexually abuse me, do things to hurt me and then laugh when I cried, would threaten to break up with me unless I dropped everything and made myself sexually available to him whenever he wanted (even in the middle of the night‚Äîwe didn‚Äôt live together either). 

So I‚Äôve been working on healing. I feel like I‚Äôve made good progress. The last two years I‚Äôve been dating someone new who is amazing and thoughtful and patient and kind. The only problem is that while our sex life started off as very healthy, the pas few months, I‚Äôve started to feel really guilty and ashamed about any sexual thoughts or acts. It‚Äôs killed my sex drive, I feel so uncomfortable and anxious about the idea of sex. There‚Äôs been a slow decline in the amount of sex we have. We have started seeing a couple‚Äôs sex therapist together.

However, last night he told me that if our counselor doesn‚Äôt have any advice for us in our session today, that he was going to ask me if we can be polyamorous.

I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù to fantasise about your own death like that? Or visualise suicide or lethal accidents without any intent to act on it?

536,PTSD & nightmares - melatonin?,35,11gbf79,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11gbf79/ptsd_nightmares_melatonin/,35,"Hey guys,
So I‚Äôve always had very bad nightmares. They‚Äôre usually always related to my traumas. 
I also remember my dreams (sometimes to a point where I‚Äôm not sure if it actually happened or if I dreamt it - even with every day basic stuff) I barely ever forgot them.

I‚Äôve taken prescription medication in the past to help me sleep which was always great. However my GP won‚Äôt keep me on them due to the fact you can develop a dependency on them. I‚Äôve also taken illegal (illegal in Australia anyway‚Ä¶) drugs to help me sleep but I don‚Äôt want to continue that. Both of these options help me to NOT dream which is what I want basically.

So the alternative for me was Melatonin. It was great at the start however now I‚Äôm getting the typical fucked up nightmares with them. They‚Äôre renown for their nightmares so this sort of defeats the purpose. 
I woke up at 3am this morning from one of my usual bad nightmares & refused to go back to sleep (even though I‚Äôm drowsy from the melatonin).

Has anyone else experienced this? Or have any recommendations for me? 
I just don‚Äôt want to dream anymore. I can‚Äôt take anymore nightmares.",1677785135.0

I was so excited to go since unlike at the facility i was staying at at the time they didn't keep you within a fence or take away all internet access. Unfortunately though my parents refused to give permission to let me do the interviews i had to attend to get in. My therapist and the staff at that facility, everyone fought so hard and even brought dhs/cps into it concerning all of my mothers previous physical abuse + the fact that nearly every time i went on home visits i had a full-on mental breakdown and had to be picked up by the police and taken home after disassociating for hours just walking the streets at night. 

I stayed at that facility for 9 fucking months practically for nothing, 6 of those months was just me waiting for a program like that to open up so i wouldn't have to be in contact with my abusive mother or neglectful father any more. Now that my only clear chance of genuinely getting better was taken away i feel so fucking depressed. Within the past two months I've had to visit a nearby psychiatric crisis center for relapsing into self-harm again. I had to throw away alot of my meds because id get overwhelming impulses to try overdosing on them. 

I have some anxiety meds left to make me calm down when i get panicked but in the back of my head im always pondering suicide and have begun planning it in the future.

559,Coming to grips,1,11g9720,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11g9720/coming_to_grips/,0,"This is something new to me... I am working with a therapist/coach and realizing a lot of things about me.

I want to get this in writing since I think it will help me.

I am married and have 2 teenage kids. The younger one is proving to be challenging. They are pushing the boundaries and testing how far they can go with us. This is important to the story, just bear with me... I have been soft discipline-wise and careful to not offend my youngest. Since they were toddlers they (I use 'they' since I am trying to remain somewhat anonymous and not reveal details that will id me, sorry) would have tantrums when things didnt go their way... I guess I learned the path of least resistance... so this has been building up and causing tension between me and my spouse... to the point I was asked to leave the house...

Upon leaving we started couples counselling and it turns out I have PTSD stemming back to my childhood, my dad, and later the loss of my mom.

I have to admit that looking back I have been very numb for a while... going to sleep I could be gone in a couple minutes. No problem sleeping. I think realizing something was not right with me. I have trouble making plans, making friends, sticking with goals, etc.

I am all in with my therapy, dont get me wrong... it is just weird coming to terms with what has happened to me, and mostly now answering ""Who am I?""

My dad was quite absent. He worked long days. My mom was the foundation in my family. She worked hard, and when I was young (12, 13) I realized my mom was supporting the family mostly. My dad provided the basic moneys for the house, but my mom still needed to be wise with our money. My dad had a good job. We then moved countries and my dad decided this was a good time to pursue his own interests, trying to make a career out of a hobby... so more than ever, my mom is left supporting our family.

Eventually, he cheats on her, and they get divorced... I am 18/19 by this point. My sibling has been married for a few years, so for the last while its really been me and my mom. She was fantastic as a mom. She constantly praised me and was my strongest cheerleader. Looking back, these years is when I was at my most healthy emotionally... I had friends, I was happy.

About 10 years ago, my mom passed away. It was quick in that she was diagnosed with a brain tumor and 2 months later she was gone. I saw her the night she passed away... paramedics were gone and she was just there... I said my good byes and I will not forget that night.

I grieved greatly for a couple days, and then I was 'fine'.

So we fast forward a couple years... I get laid off from this massive company, which is in a downward spiral... I had been there 14 years. I quickly find another job and am there until the pandemic...

At first things were ok, company make some adjustments, but layoffs... 8 months into Covid, I get laid off... I have severance as I had been there 6 years... Once that starts winding down I get back to the job hunt.... I have a couple good interviews, but nothing comes out of it...

I end up on a contract temp job through an agency. Been here 2 years now...

So this is where our brains start connecting the dots and making 'sense' of our world... my being laid off, not finding good work, being a temp for 2 years and the company dragging their feet getting me full time... yeah, thats my dad. I become that little kid again, feeling I am not worth the attention of my dad, feeling worthless, feeling powerless. I end up in an emotional pit, just stuck, not being able to move... my spouse becomes my ""mom""... I am looking to her to prop me up, to be my cheerleader to help me... she did do that, but she is tired after 2 years... she does not need a 3rd child to take care of, especially when you have 2 teenagers going through their own pandemic issues...

My therapist uses EFT and got things moving within the first 30 mins of dealing with her. I am at the start of this healing process, but i still have good days and bad. I have not explored my emotions as much as I have in these last 2 weeks. 

Looking back I recognize I became numb to a lot of what was going on in life... issues with the kids, I was just not moved to action... like hoping the issue would just sort itself out on its own... my poor wife, not sleeping, having anxiety, and me just falling asleep in 30 seconds.

I am coming to grips with the thought that this is PTSD. Maybe there was some depression too? I dont identify with depression in the sense that I did not have suicidal thoughts... though i recognize a difficulty establishing friendships - because i had nothing to offer, or something.

I am feeling better and working towards a point where I can return home and be the father my kids need, be the man my wife married and once again wear the pants in the family.

&#x200B;

My father is a selfish man. I know he has his own issues, and I am coming to terms with that. He must have his own abandonment issues.

My fear of being like him, being selfish has made me do the opposite. I took on too much in my house and had to do everything... not because my wife is unable to cook, or do the shopping, or anything else.... I just had to do it. I think I needed to show I was needed, that I was present, that I was not abandoning them. But when you aim so far to please, you end up smothering... its too much. I failed to stand up to my youngest and show there is a limit. 

My dad did not harm me on purpose. He has his issues. Whatever they are, this was not personal. My mom tried to shield me, upbuilding me, protecting me. But like a virus, even if we take precautions, we can still get sick... and in this case, I was still affected. My mom's attempts to help me failed in the end - thanks brain. But now I am coming to grips with this truth. I am trying to accept that I am great (not to be a narcissist), that I am worth more than I believed. I was successful in my jobs because I was good at them. Companies fail, that was not my fault. I can be a strong person, I am a good worker, I married a beautiful woman, and have so far raised 2 great kids. I need to focus on my victories.

I am hoping that I can fully put this behind me and find that balance in my life. But I am afraid also.

I am afraid of returning home and failing hard. Maybe that fear is good for me?

On a side note - my wife still loves me, and sending me away was to allow me space to heal without the daily burdens. I love her for that... She is holding down the fort and doing great at it. Its hard being away. The longer I am away, the more I want to be better... the more I want to be myself again.

My mom was my best friend besides my husband. My husband and I live in my now only dad‚Äôs house. 

I went in her room and I couldn‚Äôt get up or turn her over. I should‚Äôve known but I finally lifted her up up and was an inch away from her face. I hate describing it but I need people to know so they might be able to help. 

Her lips were purple, her eyes were half open, and there was stuff coming out of her right nostril. 

I ran downstairs to get my dad. I called 911. I knew there was nothing I could do. My parents had such a beautiful relationship. They only stayed in separate rooms because my mom is messy and my dad is ocd clean.

I couldn‚Äôt and still can‚Äôt believe it. There was no autopsy because my dad doesn‚Äôt want to know if he could‚Äôve done something. He‚Äôs been a wreck. I have told him about these flashes and he said it was my ptsd.

In many ways, I'm a walking stereotype. I served in the infantry, fought in some wars, and one bullet wound, 2 abdominal lacerations from sharpnel, and 3 Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBIs) later, I am what I am now... good-humored, intelligent, and loving 90% of the time and extremely angry and dangerous the other 10%.

It's difficult for me to overstate the dangerous part. I hate it, but a particular trigger for me seems to be driving; there are just way too many aggressive drivers on the road and the way I have been conditioned to deal with aggression is with overwhelming violence. Sometimes, while I'm driving, I'll see someone indulging in their own little road rage incident, just generally acting reckless. If they're tailgating someone or being threatening, I just can't help myself, I'll insert myself into the situation. Usually, I'll do the same to them, or cut in front of them and force them to slow down or something. I know I should not do this because that person is probably just having a bad day, or is late for work or something. Predictably, they sometimes then turn their anger on me, and this is where it gets scary. It's scary because they are only pretending to be this crazy, dangerous, psycho person, and... I actually am. And I'm terrified of what I might do. So far, I guess I come off as intimidating enough that everyone just decides its best to not escalate any further with me, but at some point that won't be the case.

Enter, the trauma. As I said. I'm a walking stereotype. I have survivors guilt, nightmares from my combat experience, and am, as one person once described it to me, a moral casualty because of the guilt I feel over four men that I killed at very close range in Afghanistan. This experience had a profound effect on me. It darkened my mind and blackened my soul. I had killed one man in combat before this, but it was at a range of about 150 meters, and it really didn't affect my psyche in the same way. It's hard to describe the effect, but I feel like once I realized how easy it is to kill, even at close proximity, I became afraid that I would do it all of the time. For many years, I thought I was a terrible person for feeling such a rush in those moments; what I thought was joy. I thought this must be how serial killers get off. Am I the same as a serial killer? Only through many years of therapy have I come to realize that it was not joy but the feeling of massive adrenaline and incredible relief that I was the survivor in that lethal encounter.

I've been to every kind of therapy that they offer veterans and have been on most of the meds at some point or another, but I am currently off of everything. I've made a ton of progress over the years and recently even got married and am expecting my first child soon. My wife sees the scars on my body and the hearing aids that I have had to wear since my service, but she doesn't know anything about anything else. I don't want to be this way, and I want to be a better person for her and my future child.

Is there anyone else that suffers in this way? And if so, do you have any advice on how to control it?",1677723332.0

He was living in Phoenix Arizona, and I live on the east coast, but because of the pandemic and subsequent lockdown, I couldn't make it out to visit him before he passed. I felt extremely guilty, and I still do, as I still haven't been back to AZ since his passing. He was a medevac in Vietnam, and his cancer was caused by exposure to Agent Orange, or at least that's what I was told. His death was also extremely quick, as far as cancer is concerned, only being diagnosed in September of 2018. I've also repressed every memory of the entirety of 2020, either through drinking, or smoking marijuana (which is legal where I live). Every time I do try to bring up a memory from his passing, I get depressed, angry, confused, and hateful mostly towards myself, which is why I have those memories repressed. I don't want to hurt myself, or anyone else, so I keep those memories locked away. Never let them out. My dad was my hero, I looked up to him, idolized him. He meant everything to me, and I never really got to say goodbye. I mean, I called him on the phone every day up until his passing, but... I never got to say goodbye in person. I never got to... I actually can't continue, as I'm becoming increasingly emotionally distressed the more I write about this, so I'll wrap this up.

1. Is it possible that I'm dealing with PTSD, despite not seeing my dad pass away with my own eyes?

2. Is there any way I can get help for whatever it is I am dealing with?

3. Is there any form of therapy that's helpful for a situation like this?

569,Is this PTSD?,5,11fm378,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11fm378/is_this_ptsd/,4,"All my life, whenever I think of my memories of my childhood, it always feels like there‚Äôs a wall of fog around them. I can strain against that wall all I want, but it feels like my brain won‚Äôt allow me to view those memories. It‚Äôs just foggy.

A couple days ago I took a small amount of Adderall. I have diagnosed major depressive disorder and I‚Äôm working on getting diagnosed with ADHD.

Everything was normal until I went to go to sleep. I went to bed depressed and I just kept wondering why I am the way I am. Like, ‚Äúwhy am I so depressed? Why do I feel so broken?‚Äù

It got me to think about my life and I started to shift towards my childhood. Except this time there was no fog. I remembered it all.

I won‚Äôt go into it, but I was frequently sexually assaulted from kindergarten to second grade. I didn‚Äôt know that until the night I took Adderall.

Long story short, I had a four hour panic attack that night. I couldn‚Äôt breathe, I couldn‚Äôt stop shaking, I was sweating, I couldn‚Äôt think. It took around 11 hours total before my heart stopped racing and I stopped shaking entirely. I didn‚Äôt sleep at all that night. I felt like I would have to relive everything if I let my mind relax so I kept it busy. I recited powers of two over and over all night long.

The next day, once I felt calm again, the fog returned. It doesn‚Äôt feel like the panic attack happened to me, and I feel like i‚Äôve completely dissociated from the memory of
my childhood again. Everything just feels like it didn‚Äôt happen to me. There‚Äôs no emotion, and hardly a memory at all.

I guess what i‚Äôm asking, is this PTSD? I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with me.",1677713903.0
570,Why aren‚Äôt we funding this!?!!?!!,7,11fivm5,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11fivm5/why_arent_we_funding_this/,2,"TW‚Äôs :Childhood trauma, suicide, depression, drug use.

Ok, TL:DR up front.  I have years of childhood trauma.  I Recently had a breakthrough experience with MDMA that has imprinted on my brain and removed my aversion to touch, and allowed me to engage with my experiences in a manner that didn‚Äôt leave me a sobbing mess for days.

The short version here is my mom used to beat the shit out of us growing up.  When that wasn‚Äôt happening I was largely ignored because I liked to read and write poetry and talk about physics which made me a weirdo to my cowboy culture family.  My dad killed himself when I was 16, and I almost caved in my moms new husband‚Äôs skull with a golf club when he threatened to kill my little sister.  

This kinda messed me up in ways both obvious and subtle.  For most of my life I walled off that part of me and pretended it was normal.  It wasn‚Äôt until I had a total breakdown and sought therapy that I even thought about how it was affecting me.  My therapist recommended reading The Body Keeps the Score, and after reading the examples in that book and about how trauma works in your brain I realized that it wasn‚Äôt normal what happened, but my bodies reaction to it was almost textbook.

Talk therapy has been going well, and I‚Äôm still doing that, but I was talking about MDMA with a friend of mine and she cleared up a bunch of misconceptions I had about it being a party drug that just makes you want to dance.  My wife also thought it would be good for me so we agreed to take it together.

I had no idea what to expect, and I thought at best it would be a temporary ‚Äúfix‚Äù like getting blackout drunk.  I was completely and blissfully wrong.

At first I was waiting to just get high, but I never really felt that.  What I felt was a desire for physical contact that I thought I wasn‚Äôt allowed to have. I convinced myself that my aversion to touch was just ‚Äúhow I am,‚Äù but I had that veil not only ripped down, but it got burned up.  My wife and I cuddled on the couch and listened to music and talked.  She complimented me and asked me questions about what I felt like as a kid, and I found that I could answer her without wanting to break down in tears.  It was like watching a car accident safely perched on a cloud, and it was incredibly productive.

I asked my psych about it and he sent me a clinical study (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01336-3) that confirms with empirical evidence that my experience wasn‚Äôt really unique.  

I thought at first that I would wake up and go right back to my hole the day after, but it‚Äôs been a week and I still feel a fundamental difference.  I woke up this morning and I had my arms around my wife which is something I don‚Äôt recall happening in 15 years of marriage.  Normally if she tried to cuddle with me while I was sleeping I‚Äôd wake up in a panic.

I know this is anecdotal, but we really need a reckoning on drug scheduling in this country (USA).

I was raped in 2021. Since then I've been slowly healing and I've come a long way, even though I still have far to go.

I know that it is common for rape victims to be assaulted multiple times, often by different people, and it feels....inevitable, for me.

To my knowledge, this is the only time it's happened to me. But it feels like because it wasn't the ""violent in a park by a stranger"" type of assault you hear about in the news, it doesn't feel like it ""counts"" in a way. And I keep getting these feelings like it SHOULD happen again. Like I'm just in limbo waiting for this next inevitable rape to happen. On my dark days I still get urges that I should hook up with someone shady on grindr, get myself into a situation that can get worse, and just get it over with. 

I felt like this as a kid, growing up without the knowledge that I was actually a trans man, being told that when I grew up I WILL have a man fuck me and I WILL have to bear children. And that damaged me for years to the point where I was not careful about my welfare for a while when I was older (this is about ten years ago now). 
This feeling never left me. The guilt and shame and resignation that this is the lot I have been given and at some point someone is going to come along and collect what's due.

Idk what I'm getting at here. I just want someone to listen, give me some advice or make it stop hurting. I hate how much I think about this and for how long it's been going on.",1677629379.0

Don't really know how to start, but I've entered in a new relationship with a girl that I really like but sometimes we have deep talks and she opened up on her past life, she didn't have an easy life starting from her childhood she was sexually abused from her brother in law, never had a father figure because she was abandoned from him even if they reconnected in the future but failed again and now they don't talk, she never had a healthy relationship which the last one was the worst one, he was really toxic manipulative and used her financially emotionally and forced her to have a treesome even if she was not interested, she did it to make him happy and because she didn't know how to give a voice to her feelings and needs.

Now she asked me if was an intelligent idea to reach out to him because back in the days he came uninvited to her house asking to reconnect, but she just want a healthy closure and go on with her life in peace because she don't feel secure and having nightmare of him showing up and stalking her, so she reached out they had a talk and she got a little depressed because of old negative emotions, but at the end of the day it was worth it because they managed to understand that they need to live their life in peace.

Most of the days she is good but sometimes she let intrusive thoughts like not being enough or being scared of me that I'm gonna change in the future and she says things like maybe I'm not good at this (romantic relationship) and have anxiety for the future or the unknown, on top of this we are doing LDR so all the negative emotions comes up (and it's the only time when it happens) because she never had any problems when we are together and she is the first that says that we are solid she loves me and she wants a future with me.

In starting to getting info on this behavior and it fit perfectly on PTRD in a branch of PTSD related to past relationships and abuse events, can you guys tell me or give me info on how to help her?

Or maybe somebody that experienced the same things, did you got better and what worked for you to got to this point?

She is doing therapy but she wasn't sincere 100% with her because of guilt and shame.

Or, so I thought. I've always had PTSD symptoms. A therapist once used the phrase ""We'll never know if it was [Genetic Disorder] or CPTSD that caused these symptoms, since they look so alike, and there was never a you that existed without trauma.""

Ouch.

The CPTSD symptoms since I was 14, that I can remember. Certainly coping mechanisms before that, a generally quirky kid, and an ""old soul,"" ""act your age,"" ""enjoy your youth,"" child. 

When I went to therapy for the first time since I was court mandated to, within the first session they mentioned I cycled through nearly every PTSD symptom. My current therapist felt the same way.

However, now that I'm just now out of the traumatic shit, I'm showing more symptoms than before. Dissociation, constant chest pains from anxiety, Derealization, roughly the same intrusive thoughts in amount, but their quality feel more severe. More anxious, assuming the worst, even the tiniest hiccup feels like the world is collapsing around me and everything I've created that is peaceful is breaking.

My therapist said this is the POST part of PTSD. I, semi-jokingly, asked them if what I had before was PRE-PTSD. I know it's just the complexity. I'm scared they're going to get worse. Some things are better - I have less nightmares, less insomnia, less sudden sadnesses & nearly no depression. 

I'm just scared I'm going to be nothing more than a walking mental illness. I already had like every fucking symptom of PTSD. Maybe not in high quality, but it fucking hurts. I'm fucking scared each and every symptom is going to be hopelessly exasperated and I'll ruin the peace I have. 

I'm scared of the part of my subconscious that is so scared of the calm that it's solution is to burn everything to the ground. It's my own thought, my own voice, and it begets no action. It's simply an anxious thought. But I hate every anxious thought, every chest pain that sends me through a panic attack, the weakness of struggling to order food once the cashier tells me they're out of the third items I've tried to order when I've survived countless sexual assailants, 2 narc parents, and countless abuse. I feel weak & anxious & helpless.

At the same time, for the first time in my life I am calm. I feel loved. My friends are kind. I have a place to call home. My work is good to me. I travel. I eat decently. I struggle like a normal person does, with things like overhearing someone gossiping and wondering if I should say something to the person being talked about. My biggest stressor in day to day is cleaning my room, or looking at the news. 

But my brain just wants to has up the old shit in the car. It's scared, and I know in a way it is right to be. It's fear served it well for some time, and we're only in the clear by a few months. 2 months and some change, really. 

I know it's not a lot of time, and thag it will likely improve instead of get worse. But i'm scared of the opposite. I'm terrified of the POST just all adding up at once. 

Fuck CPTSD. Fuck having a trial period of all the symptoms and still it getting worse when you're finally free. I'm scared of being trapped with a trauma of my own organ's creating, a side of my brain mutating and staging a mutiny against me.

Hello there.
Just to make things clear, I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder, not PTSD, but several people within the psychiatry field have said that my case looks far from bipolar. I was diagnosed a year ago after what my psychiatrist called a suicide attempt and she hasn‚Äôt consider to re-diagnose me so far.
This is going to be long and this is going to be detailed, so I‚Äôm sorry in advance. You don‚Äôt have to read this if you are sensitive to topics that have anything to do with guns and child abuse.
I‚Äôve been through a lot. Some of the weirdest events in my life include these:
- At the age of four my parents left me behind to cover my vitals in a roly poly-like position when a drunk man pulled out a gun and started shooting. Long story short, when the shooting was over and I unrolled hoping to see my parents rolled up beside me, I saw them walking away casually like it was your typical vacation day with the family. The police were involved (the guy shot a dog in its leg). At nineteen I reproached my mother for leaving me back there, but she said it was no big deal, her argument being ‚Äúhe had no gun, just a crossbow‚Äù. However, I clearly remember the shots being so loud my ears felt muffled, and crossbows aren‚Äôt that loud.
- I‚Äôve been abused by my mother for the most of my upbringing, physically, mentally and medically. Most of the physical abuse was just beating me up, but a couple of times I genuinely felt she was trying to damage my body seriously. Also, for whatever reason she believed that smashing me on my back unexpectedly would cure my scoliosis. This especially made me kind of nervous and jumpy to the point of being convulsed when touched on my back in my teen years. Also, she gave me homeopathic injection shots (she is not qualified for that) which gave me leg seizures, and at that time I thought I could lose my legs for good (sorry I was a pretty dumb kid)
I no longer suffer from jumpiness, but I had recurring dreams about fighting against my mother and my arms being too light to deliver a proper punch or defend myself. Later these dreams transformed finally giving me the power to fight back, but now I mostly beat her to death by the end of these dreams. I also have a recurring dream of crawling in a crowded street half-unconscious, feeling like I‚Äôm dying, no one bothering to help me despite the street being crowded. These ones are extremely hard for me, I can‚Äôt wake up, I can‚Äôt die, the only things I can do are crawl and suffer. 
I do get triggered and I do have memories of the things I‚Äôve been through build up uncontrollably in my head, but it‚Äôs as if I don‚Äôt care. I don‚Äôt know how to put it into words.

622,Forgiveness seems impossible,2,11dzcwa,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11dzcwa/forgiveness_seems_impossible/,4,"Hi everybody, I had to swollow the anxiety for this 1 my first time posting so please excuse me being a noob.

I will try keep it short as possible. Growing up I had 2 significant traumas and the worst of the 2 being my father passing away when I was 12. 
I have a very disfuctional family all drinkers very aggressive and violence is the norm, even the women in my family have toxic masculinity. 

My uncle John (my mom's brother) is defiantly the worst of the family and one day his son got into a fight with the neighbours kid and my uncle went crazy and came after me for not doing anything about it and knowing his aggression I was scared shitless so naturally I ran to my dad and my dad tried to stop my uncle from coming after me, they ended up in a fight and my dad got killed in the process. This all happened right in front of my eyes. All I remember after that was the most intense fear I had ever felt in my life I could see people screaming but I couldn't hear a thing over the ringing in my ears, my heartbeat was so violently strong it felt like my head was going to explode. The memory of this feeling has never left me.

In the beginning I forgave my uncle ( I thought I did atleast) but at that young age I couldn't  even begin to comprehend how that day would affect the rest of my life so I always had the attitude of wjat ever doesn't kill you makes you stronger. The problem is I used that as a crutch to avoid dealing with anything and I spent my teenage years very withdrawn.

I am now turning 30 this year and I have a small family of my own. The best thing that ever happened to me and I honestly don't know what i would have done without my wife being there for me all these years. My daughter has brought back so much joy and innocence to my life what i thought was lost forever.

My first problem is my family doesn't  speak about anything which explains why they are so dysfunctional so I have  ever even gotten a simple im sorry from my uncle. Way to proud, nobody in the family even speaks about my dad anymore because they just want to avoid the subject entirely, and second problem is the older I get the more angry I get. I get angry because now I realise how much my uncle stole not only from me but my daughter too. I k ow my dad would have been the proudest grandfather and that probably hurts me the most. I'm angry because he stole mine and my dad's first beer together, he stole my first driving lesson, he stole the proud look on my dad's face at my wedding, he stole my daughters grandfather he stole my best friend.

Now its been about 18 years since my father passed and at this point I don't want his apology that will only serve to make him feel better he is 18 years too late.

I need to find a way to forgiveness maybe its myself I should be forgiving I don't know. Another poinyof anger for me is the court case for the murder of my father was thrown out of court, because I live in South Africa the courts and government are extremely corrupt so him being in a much better financial position then me he could pay the courts to "" loose the documents"".  All I know is this hatred is killing me and I cant carry on like this because the irony is I am busy becoming my uncle. I have become very short tempered and aggressive lately the smallest thing will set me off and I have tried my hardest to keep my daughter away from that.

I know trauma makes you feel completly alone I the world but what everybody is doing in this thread is wholesome just reading some posts makes me feel less alone.

I accepted that he did it not because of something I did or who I am but because of who he is. If I was replaced by a different girl he would've done the same thing. I accepted that the only way I could've avoided it was never meeting him at all. 

But like when it comes to accepting and forgiving it as a whole I just can't. I'm just like fuck that shit. 

Idk what I'm angry at. It's not like I want him to pay. He is out of my life and that is good enough for me. I'm not necessarily angry at myself. I don't know what specifically is in my way of accepting and forgiving everything that happened but I just I can't.

This fucking disorder makes me a person who thrives on imagined violence and wishes for the death of my abusers and those who tell me I deserved it. I never thought I would be this type of person before. Why the FUCK do people especially therapists insist you should accept your trauma and abuse??? Therapists were part of me being traumatized anyway so don't tell me to go to one, but they constantly just say ""accept it"" like they want me to be happy about being abused or accept that I deserved it. When pressed they'll say ""No, no. That's not what I'm saying"" But what the FUCK are they saying?

I fucking looked up the definition one day, read the manuals, and it basically means to never be upset about my abuse again as if I'm not entitled to an emotional reaction. It's not allowed. It's a Bad, Unallowed feeling to be upset about my abuse. I hate these people. I'm not going to accept my abuse. If being happy about my abuse and never being allowed to feel anything about being abused is the path to ""healing"" it fuck it. Fine. 

I will be PTSD forever. Even if it kills me. I'm miserable. I frequently think suicide is the only way out and I just recently got to a point where I'm not so depressed and suicidal all the time, but PTSD might make me take my own life anyway. Finally, I don't want to die, but I feel like I need to because PTSD is wrecking me, but I will deal with it as long as I can rather than accept my abuse. I'm not accepting my abuse.

I'm new here and I'm not formally diagnosed with ptsd, but I feel I definitely have a form of it from my early childhood. I grew up in an old shack type of house with my extended family. I can't give too many details as my parents use reddit. I was raised primarily by my grandparents who are amazing people. I was an accident and don't know my birth father. My younger sibling was born 2 years after me. We grew up in a moderately violent household. My mother wasn't ready for children. It became normal for me and my sibling to ""get the rod"" every day or two from her. My new father who I grew up thinking was my birth dad was seldom in the house as he worked constantly. We were hit with random objects all the time and then hit for crying or being scared. My father never hit us, but he was hard on us to grow up to be his version of men.

Once we started school it got worse. I took the blunt of everything being the oldest child. It effected us both differently, my brother growing to be a softer person and I grew up to be a serial liar and eventually a sociopathic type of person. I'd have to lie to stay put of trouble and avoid being struck when I came home from school. It got out of control and I'd lie about everything to anyone I could for no reason, and I'd hurt my friends at school emotionally for no reason. Then I'd come home to all types of mental and physical abuses from my mom or constant lectures from my father.

As I grew to be a teen I was an outcast socially at school and the lying and manipulation got a lot worse, and the stigma from what I did destroyed me as I just wanted to have friends but couldn't stop playing with peoples emotions. I became extremely depressed. Eventually towards the end of high school my parents divorced due to their really bad relationship. The abuses we had gotten calmed down a good amount till visitation and custody battles started. At this point I was 18 years old and was used by my parents as a mediator in-between them both to relay their stupid problems, and my brother was a kind of bargaining chip with the custody thing. I snooped around in the paperwork to learn my dad wasn't my birth dad at that point.

I ended up hooked on different drugs and was a mess. I contracted venereal diseases from serial dating and just not caring at all. I moved out and my brother went with my father. I met a girl and we were together for 3 years in a relationship that drove me to extreme alcoholism. She cheated on me and I lost my house. I ended up in jail a couple times and had to move back in with my mother and her new husband, who is a really good person and he seemed to straighten everything out with my mother. She became a lot nicer of a person and her temper calmed a lot. I was extremely depressed on arrival and attempted self termination 7 times. I started a band and it's been an outlet for everything.

As of now I'm off of drugs, sober 4 years and work a great job. I'm with my future wife but am still struggling a small bit with drinking sometimes.

He did this constantly,  infront of my friends, infront of his friends, and infront of all the people that walked past it happening in the streets. 

At the same time he would try and beat up my pregnant mum but 5 year old me would step in the way to try and protect her, at this point my mums ex was beating her up everyday, I still remember the glass smashing on her head and other not so nice things, not to mention the time that he tried to kill me which led me to get knocked out and bite my tongue into three pieces in the process. When I was a baby I was also blinded in one eye because of my brother  

The way my childhood was really effected the way I grew up, I‚Äôve never been able to trust people, I‚Äôve always been scared of doing or saying something that people don‚Äôt like. Every minute of the day outside or around people I feel like everybody is looking at me, saying things about me or thinking things about me, I think this is due to the severe bullying I went through in school.  I can‚Äôt get any hobbies, I try to make friends then it‚Äôs like I forget they exist and I just forget to speak to them. My two mental states are what I‚Äôd describe as very manic and complete nothingness which is very dissociative though.

I used to compulsively measure and rank the traumatic incidents in my life and compared it with everyone I came across to. 

I remember sitting in group therapy and mentally created a hierarchy of who I thought had it ‚Äúthe worst‚Äù I wouldn‚Äôt even bother to listen to that person again in group therapy if I deemed their trauma as ‚Äúnot enough‚Äù.

I was ultimately a victim of my own hierarchy too I was filled with so much shame all the time whenever I ranked someone else as having ‚Äúmore‚Äù trauma than me. The shame came after we shared some stories and from the thoughts ‚ÄúI knew I should have kept my mouth shut. My story is probably mocked now. Im a laughing stock. Im inferior. I should disappear. My story wasn‚Äôt worth attention because theirs was worth far more than mine.‚Äù I‚Äôve even gone into multiple severe suicidal crises because of this. 

Maybe this feeling that my trauma should have been worse to be real was enforced in me since I was a kid. I was made to look at dying starving or kidnapped kids so my parents could excuse their utterly horrible physical, emotional and verbal abuse and neglect towards me. I had to in fact go through more abuse that also involved traumatic invalidation whenever I tried coming up with my stories of abuse. 

Perhaps that‚Äôs why I started labeling trauma as not enough or enough because that‚Äôs what I was taught to do and no matter what, my trauma could never be rough. 

Now whenever I do the trauma ranking, not only I invalidate other but I also traumatically invalidate myself causing a sudden emotional flashback and a suicidal crisis.

Hello, I currently live in Damascus and you have probably heard of the unfortunate earthquakes that hit both Syria and Turkey, thankfully I was unaffected and my heart goes out to the families of the lives we lost.

I commonly had sleep paralysis but when the first earthquake hit at midnight it was very different and a traumatizing experience to me.

I've had very little sleep for the past 20 days.
I always feel pulsing or feel my pulse whenever I lay in my bed, even when i first start falling asleep I get sleep paralysis and my body starts pulsing and shaking the very exact same way it did when the earthquake hit and when i eventually do get up everything's fine.

I am really sorry for posting this here but I don't know where else to do so and therapy here in Syria is socially unacceptable so I have no where to turn except for the internet.

Due to this, the severity of my PTSD went up before I was able to work through the trauma in my childhood.

Since the relationship especially, I have more things that have been triggering me and because of dissociation being my main response, I was out of it basically all the time. Whenever I was grounded it was hard to even function because I would have to deal with the emotions and triggers of the day, week, or month. I'm finally to the point where I am present at least 50% of the time, and everything's calming down in my brain but I still am struggling being able to notice when I start dissociating. 

I noticed it today and was able to ground myself pretty quickly before it got bad. So like I have the tools and ability, but cause I've been dissociated so long, I often don't notice something triggering me. So I don't even know the triggers or if I may even be accidentally triggering myself. When I am dissociated for a longer time it takes longer for me to ground, so I want to be able to notice and help myself in the moment instead of being incapacitated for hours later.

I[M20] had an ""interesting"" childhood. Early on everything seemed normal for a small 1 child family. we weren't rich by any stretch of the imagination but we where content where we stood.... well me and my mom. 




by the time i was 10 my dad [M48] had came out of the closet (this was circa the same sex marriage law) which deviated my mother [F51] who ended up attempting suicide 3 separate times. She was never the same. My dad explained to me the gravity of the situation but at the time i didn't know how to react other than confusion. hearing my mom and dad fight night after night didn't help. 



eventually my mom moved out of the house and my dad did too during this time in my life i resented my dad for his actions. and i made the biggest mistake of my short life at the time. i decided to move in with my mom. at 1st everything was ok outside of the fact she would degrade my dad at any chance she got. eventually that was put onto me for the mear fact i look like my dad. it began with mild names and stabs at my appearance which due to my extreme hatred of my dad at the time i didn't care just something to poke fun at because of him. but over time it became less and less about my dad and more and more about me it scaled all the way up to full on emotional, psychological, and yes sometimes physical abuse. i still loved my mom even after she became so unbareable i started to cover her ass. eventually i realized i needed to get out of my moms house because after the death of my grandma she went off the rails. 



i did this by going to see my grandma on my dads side (F69) who has always been my safe haven (love you mawmaw even tho i know you'll never see this) i half heartedly expected my dad to still be living in my grandmas house but he wasn't he had moved back into my childhood home with his new boyfriend. i can still vividly remember the day i laid eyes on my dad again for the first time in 2 years. and for the first time that i can remember i saw my dad cry. he took me back into my old room still set up the exact way i'd have it. for the first time in 2+ years at that point i slept soundly.



after i visited my dad more frequently i decided to spend the summer with him. he then saw my living conditions.... these memories still haunt me. and the words my dad said will stay with me forever. ""son you can't keep living this way. is this what you wanted?"" and i just walked away. i packed what little i owned into my backpack and moved back in with my dad. 


from here nothing was truly bad bad (in comparison to what i already had been through) we moved around a bit before settling back into my hometown. from there my dad met his current and longest standing relationship. he proceeded to move out of state to live with his new boyfriend but my grandma (the saint she is) demanded i stay in my hometown to finish school. so there i was living with my grandma after my dad yet again disappeared to chase his sexuality. throughout highschool i was your stereotypical neck beard. but once i got out of my home state of Georgia and moved to texas i started to wonder why i couldn't work for a female manager, how even tho i myself accepted that i am pansexual not straight, my inability to talk to people all of these things weight on my brain everyday and i'm slowly falling apart. 


i know this was a long one but i really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read the ramblings of a mildly interesting stoner. the main focus of sharing my story is to learn i don't know exactly what's wrong i think it's PTSD but i've also been told by friends it could be CPTSD. i don't know so if anyone can help me it would be greatly appreciated.

I am between the ages of 13-15 and I haven't been diagnosed with PTSD or anything like that(I have never been to a psychologist even if I had PTSD I would't know). My parents have been abusive to me my whole life and I still live with them.

So for about a year now I've became very aware that my parents are abusive. That's when this obsession started, I started researching everything I could about abuse and trauma trying to find something similar to my childhood. This started in the summer when I was on vacation and I would literally stay up till 5 am researching. I even found some childhood pictures and I tried to remember stuff about my childhood by looking at them. I would cry every night because I forced myself to remember all the things that happened to me and I think I made myself emotionally numb because I can't cry anymore and it's worse like this because I fell nothing and I want to try and trigger myself even more in order to have some emotion. When school started I couldn't focus properly on the lessons because I would always have these thoughts consume me and I would just zone out constantly. I'm still a good student but it's clear that my performance is starting to be affected. I also constantly try to bring up trauma in conversations and when talking to people I still can't stop these thoughts they are always in the back of my mind. I am ashamed to admit this but it's like I want to fell sad and have flashbacks(I don't think I've ever had them) and I keep thinking that if I was really traumatised I wouldn't want to be reminded of the trauma. Also I can't even shower or brush my teeth everyday there are times I don't shower for a week( I'd probably do it even mor than that if I wasn't worried about my parents and friends noticing) because I have no motivation what so ever.

Haven't gotten a chance to see a professional yet, but I just came out of a 2 year window where my dad literally went insane, became extremely violent and did a lot of crazy stuff I don't even know how to describe but that ruined my life, meanwhile I watched my grandpa and dog both die, lost the girlfriend I was going to marry to our immigration system, and then was the only one who could care for and watch as my dad died a really slow and ugly death. I get flashbacks, especially auditory and quick image flashes, have been experiencing cognitive impairment, and am easy to put in panic mode, but what's the worst is that I don't seem to be who I used to remember myself as. My behavior has changed in ways that I often find myself really ashamed and embarrassed of after the fact, and it's completely ruining my ability to try to make friends and rebuild my life. Recently I tried dating a girl I'd met after my dad passed, and at that point I was abusing alcohol and weed to drown things out. I acted like a manic asshole in ways I never used to so she left. I sobered up afterward, but then later at an event she was also at with a circle of friends I've also been trying to build a relationship with I guess I kept shutting down and staring into the distance with a glare, which made everyone uncomfortable. She felt like I was staring at her which made them even more uncomfortable. I think I've lost awareness of myself in social settings. Now the whole group thinks I'm a huge creep and the only one to advocate for me is a buddy who's known me since well before all this. I was hoping to at least try to salvage the friendship with her but now I make her uncomfortable when I'm not even trying, and I'm scared to show my face around the other friends anymore.

My (almost 30f) older brother has a history of sexually abusing me, from the time I was 8 to 14 years old. I'm now almost 30 and have been putting a lot of time, effort, and therapy into processing a traumatic childhood, in part due to him. Up until last spring, the only people who knew about what he'd done were him, me, my therapist, and my husband. But, last June, I finally found the courage to open up to my mom and admitted to her what he'd done. And she brushed it under the rug, dismissed it, and ignored it.

I was disheartened, and was going to leave it at that, and just let it be and continue on my own healing, but then my younger sister got pregnant and is expecting a baby girl. And I've decided I'm going to be telling her, and the rest of my immediate family, about my brother's sexual abuse of me, because I'm afraid of him perpetuating the same harm onto his future niece.

But, when I told my mom that I was going to be telling other family members about it, she started acting as though I was being dramatic, and heavily implied I was ruining my brother's life over nothing, etc. I've expressly said I don't want that. It's not that I want contact cut off between him and his future niece, just that he maybe not be allowed to be alone with her, and definitely don't let him babysit her as she gets older. Because he can't be trusted. But, mom's words are getting into my head and making me feel as though warning other family members about his past behavior, out of fear my my future niece's safety, is the wrong move. And that I'm being vindictive and only doing this out of spite. I keep having the feeling that that what he did to me wasn't even ""that bad""  and, since I don't know with certainty that he'd do anything to the baby, that I'm just going out of my way to wreck his life. It's starting to confuse me a lot and is making me second guess telling my other family members.

So, WITBA for warning them about his past abuse?",1677348314.0
670,Bumpy roads still trigger my fight-or-flight response...it's been almost a decade. (TW car accident),2,11c369c,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11c369c/bumpy_roads_still_trigger_my_fightorflight/,0,"This turned into a vent about the accident as well so probably big TW

When I was 11 I was in a crash that very nearly resulted in death - the last noise I heard before it happened was the ear-splitting rattle of one of the tires coming apart. I was in the seat closest to it, and it felt like it made the entire car shake. We careened into the barrier wall, the right half of the car made it over the edge of the highway, and logically, this shouldn't have happened, but by some miracle it heaved back over at the last second. No one was maimed or killed. It affected me pretty severely at first, but by now I have the good fortune of being able to forget about it...unless something triggers the memory again. A lot of the roads in my town have rough patches that create just about the same shaking and rattling that the tire did. When I'm in the car, and it goes over one of those patches, I freeze up, and then if it goes on longer than a second or two it's like my brain switches off. I'll cling to my seat for dear life and I can feel myself hyperventilating. The longer or louder the shaking is, the worse it gets. All I can think is ""I'm about to die"", and then when it's over I might feel uneasy for hours. Even if I *know* it's coming I still can't stay calm. Today stood out to me because I got so lightheaded I thought I was going to pass out.

I've been noticing it a lot more in the last couple years. I might be getting worse again, or our roads are just falling apart. I don't know. On top of that, I'm tired of not being able to drive. I just want to be independent and it's honestly embarrassing since most people my age already have a license. But I doubt I'd be a safe driver when a bumpy road can shut my mind down like that. My muscles could lock up and then I might end up in another wreck. I could never forgive myself if I decided to get behind a wheel anyway, froze up, and got someone else hurt.

And? As much as it terrifies me when my brain thinks it's happening again, it doesn't usually bother me outside of that anymore. That makes it feel weirder for me. I think I struggle more with the repeated trauma I've experienced than one-off incidents like this, and I don't feel like the accident alone has given me more issues than I can consciously identify...but it also causes the most knee-jerk, lizard-brain reactions I can ever remember having. I don't know if words can convey how helpless it makes you feel to be stuck in a speeding metal box, bracing in an instant for it to send you falling off an overpass, even when you're right in your neighborhood and safe on the ground.",1677379024.0

Of course I care, but I just feel like I can't handle seeing it.

I did hear from a Turkish friend that the workers managed to rescue a lot of people from the rubble at least, so it's good to hear that so many were saved. From what I was told anyway. But still, I'm avoiding news about it anyway.

Honestly, I've never even looked at any actual footage of the earthquake aftermath. Just reading/hearing about was more than enough. Something about situations like that which are so vast in scope and are so full of unspeakable tragedy, really get to me. Especially because it makes you feel powerless.

And even worse, we live in an age where technology/social media has given us the horrors of world events in real time. So now instead of it being restricted to the evening news, we see everything as it unfolds and learn about every single gruesome and horrific detail. It's just too much for one human being to process.

In a way, ""avoiding"" the news almost feels like some kind of trigger response when tragic world events like this happen. And plus, I nearly drove myself insane last year when the Ukraine war was on social media everyday. So I know what doom-scrolling and staying constantly plugged into tragic news can do to you. Or at the very least, what it did to me anyway.

I know this is a situation has no affect on my own personal life since I'm so far away from it, but I'm still human.

I had to ask strangers for help since I didn't know anyone else in the area and my phone didn't work so I'm also worried traveling alone will be a trigger. 

Since I was planning to have that trip I took the week off work/lab. So now I will be alone in the house with nothing to do for a whole week. I know like this would be a good time to catch up on chores or catch up on classes but I'm so drained I need to like recharge and I don't think I can get that from sleeping in.

688,"As part of your PTSD, have you had months-long episodes of cognitive and memory issues? As if thinking requires extra energy - like the mental equivalent of squinting. Mixing up words that sound similar (but thcatching yourself... usually), randomly forgetting things that used to be 2nd nature, etc.",70,11aklzf,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11aklzf/as_part_of_your_ptsd_have_you_had_monthslong/,23,"I have had post-traumatic stress for most of my life due to violence in my family throughout my youth. I was diagnosed in my teens, before the phrase 'complex trauma' was really used as its own diagnosis; there's definitely a complex-trauma component, but it was a pretty explosive home environment and I also understand I have symptoms more similar to 'regular' PTSD. So I guess this question is for people who have both PTSD, CPTSD, or both.Over the last three years, I've had these months-long episodes where I feel like my brain isn't really 'on' or I'm having trouble... navigating my way through my thoughts and memories. I've seen a few neurologists about it, gotten an MRI (which was normal), and I'll have months where I feel normal and 'recovered' and then it comes back. I'm having another episode right now, and it's freaking me out.I was pretty articulate before now, and still generally feel I can speak thoughtfully/intelligently, but randomly I have been saying or doing completely bizarre things I sometimes catch myself doing, and sometimes don't. It's like something is mis-firing in the ways that I make connections, or DON'T make connections. Mixing up similar-sounding words and names I \*NEVER\* would have mixed up in the past - Tanzania/Tasmania, Tom Cruise/Tom Hanks. Many MANY other examples of this. Having this weird thing where I can't quite remember how words are pronounced or where the emphasis is - I have to kind of reason it out and keep doubting myself. I recently used the word 'nauseous' and truly could not remember how it was pronounced, whether it was a hard 'sh' or more of a 'zh.' English is my first language, the language I've been speaking since age 1, and I have been a professional editor for 10 years.

I have strong negative feelings about the power celebrities get in our society, but recently I brought up my generally anti-celebrity feelings to a portrait photographer I generally like... in his own studio full of celebrity portraits... without even realizing until days later that this was inappropriate. I mean, his portraits are mostly public figures I respect, like Madonna and Nelson Mandelia; they're not the type of celebrities I typically rant against, but HE didn't know that - and it literally didn't even occur to me to differentiate to him during my rant, or that he might be offended or confused thinking I was railing against all public figures. It's just like there are connections and obvious things that would occur to other people that have just been going over my head. This particularly points to my PTSD as the cause for my symptoms because I had severe hypervigilance tendencies for most of my life... I wonder if this is my brain being like, 'fuck this, fuck feeling overwhelmed, fuck trying to think of everything to avoid humiliation / shame / danger, we're not even going to think of obvious stuff.' But I'm still not sure if it's just PTSD.

Am having trouble retrieving information when my memory/recall used to be absolutely fantastic and I recalled names, faces, details of people instantaneously - having soaked information up like a sponge. I have hard times reasoning through math problems, or reading even a somewhat mindless book without having to concentrate, like the mental version of squinting. It's almost like my brain used to be a home in which I could wander freely from room to room, looking for the thing I was remembering or whatever, but now I get 'trapped' in a room and don't know how to get to the next room. Or perhaps it's just the \*feeling\* of being trapped when the info is right in front of me - because there are also episodes where I feel vaguely delusional, and things just seem strangely \*off\* even when they aren't and I'm pretty sure I'm pronouncing words right but it sounds like I'm not.  
Again, I first experienced several months of this three years ago, in my late 20s, and it came and went for quite a few years - with many months of normalcy. Now started again. I'm in my 30s and really starting to wonder what is going on, and whether this is PTSD (some but not all of my episodes followed very triggering events), a neuro symptom of an endocrine issue I have, long-term complications of a few concussions I had over the years, or dementia or something. Worth mentioning that I experienced a number of events in the last few years that echoed my childhood traumas and likely retraumatized me - was also living in a somewhat formless fashion that confused my brain, as a digital nomad - and often a very solitary fashion without much long-term connection. Perhaps the lack of social contact is also related to this.

I would appreciate hearing from others who have PTSD or CPTSD - is this something you've experienced?",1677220306.0

My dad also abused me mentally and emotionally and technically physically by forcing me to work past my limits and wouldn't let me have a break till i was to the point of crying from pain. 

I thought it wasn't bad because i wasnt having issues as bad as others. Id have anxiety attacks because of my moms friend and mental breakdowns because my brother and dad but i thought it was normal.

695,Russia and PTSD: war in the distance.,17,11alg7h,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11alg7h/russia_and_ptsd_war_in_the_distance/,3,"TW: war, mentions of rape and overall violence 

!!! This post is by no means trying to diminish the pain of ppl who are ACTUALLY in the war zone or telling that what I'm experiencing is so freaking bad and important and stuff, I honestly recommend that no one from Ukraine read this, it's meant for people who do not have bombs flying over their heads and loved ones dying, ect. And it is obviously a very different type of trauma. But it's what I'm talking about, the different aspect not everyone thinks about when talking about PTSD from war. It is about my own trauma, but also about how traumatic events can affect society as a whole !!!

I am from russia, I'm against the war and I'm pretty vocal about it. Luckily, I don't really have much of an audience on my platform and nobody has told on me yet. So I have been really fortunate in that department. Not so much in life in general though.

I've been raped three years ago. And the two don't seem connected, but my brain doesn't care. I know witnessing other people go through trauma can traumatize you and mb it can be retraumatizing if you have prior trauma? I don't exactly know what to call it, there is certainly a name for this. What I know is, I am a traumatized person living in a now more than ever traumatized society. My symptoms of PTSD have gotten worse when the war started. My nightmares are now all over the place, it's like the war indeed retraumatized me, although I am not directly involved and feel like I have no right to suffer from this, but I still do¬ø I'm scared of loud sounds, I'm scared of my own reckless honesty, I'm scared of all these ppl who've done horrible things coming back, I'm scared of the violence level rising, I'm scared every time I see the police‚Ä¶ I'm scared that this will not end, I didn't expect for the war to last a fucking year, I didn't expect for it to start in the first place, but can my bloody country pls loose already? 

I'm well aware of the effects that acceptance of violence has on a society. I know that the crime level in russia will rise. And I know that the soldiers are going to come back and they are going to have weapons and PTSD, I know they won't receive help, I know they might go on to do whatever. I know that the possibility of me being raped again if I don't get out of here will be higher. And my symptoms are indeed affected by this. I also feel guilty for even complaining about it, for thinking about myself, for being triggered. 

But there are more subtle effects of higher tolerance for violence. People get used to it, everyone, it's just a defense mechanism. It's designed to protect you. People adapt to the most horrific of circumstances. A year ago an event with one human victim would be a tragedy, now a hundred is an everyday occurrence. And there's so much more hate everywhere! Everyone is more scared and more defensive, everyone expects something bad to happen. People learn to never be direct and to talk with a great amount of hints, people are used to talking in riddles now. If you are against the war you can get in real legal trouble, but where I hang out people who are for this shit learn to talk in riddles too, because it is not acceptable everywhere. You know, not everyone likes when people are pro-genocide. But only if you are against it you can get jail time, so‚Ä¶ Yeah, you can literally be persecuted for writing the word ""peace"" and stating that ""killing people is bad"" can be perceived as a controversial take, it's so ridiculous and surreal. And also scary. 

I feel like so many ppl are going to have PTSD from it, there are so many not obvious types of trauma related to the war. This whole thing is really messy, I don't know if I did a good job explaining what I meant, it is still raw and going to be until either I move from russia or this whole thing finally ends. I realise most of you won't get what I'm talking about, some of you won't believe me (I'm choosing to take anyone not believing me as a compliment to my English, by the way))0) or think that I am a terrible person. The truth is, this kind of trauma indeed makes you worse as a person, as any trauma can. You know this thing, trauma doesn't make you a better person, you become a better person only despite it? Now imagine that nearly everyone is in some way traumatized, I mean, the whole country is going through different shit, because the war affects EVERYBODY in one way or another. And ppl like me, who have been traumatized before, for some reason become retraumatized by something terrible happening to someone else. And not everyone will become better despite it, most ppl won't get help with this, some will lack self awareness to realise they need it, some won't be able to afford it, some will succumb to effects of the stigma, some will choose alcohol instead‚Ä¶ 

Sorry, it's been kinda nonsensical and unstructured, maybe I'll rewrite it some day. I just thought mb it would be interesting. I used to have a bit of a special interest in nazi Germany and I have read about stuff some of which I see happening in my country right now, it is so surreal. And you kinda get tired of feeling, of being sad, shocked, mad and after a while you can only laugh or dissociate. You live in this chronic state of stress. Well, I was in it for a long time before, but right now nearly everyone I know is. Luckily, almost all ppl I know are against the war. 
Thanks for making it till the end if anyone did. I'm really sorry for the actions of my country and can't wait for it to end.",1677223461.0

I've already posted this but nobody answered, but I'm so thankful in advance if someone does this time.

I'm (F25) sleepy, tired, and exhausted. This time of year is particularly triggering since more than one trauma has happened by the end of February and at the beginning of March. The one that caused me to seek help for PTSD happened the night between the last day of February and the first day of March. This year, I feel quite good since my symptoms have gotten better even though I've recently faced some fresh trauma and a pretty nasty breakup. However, something very different is going on. I tried to switch up my sleep patterns, eat more healthily, meditate a lot, etc. but I still feel sleepy and tired all the time. Not just mentally, but also physically. I could sleep for days. I'm highly functional, and work and study don't suffer (yet). Maybe I try and shy away from potential flashes, or I try to face the trauma in dreams - my dreams are crazily vivid and life-like. Sometimes, I'm even sleepwalking and yelling, and you guessed it - I wake up tired after 10 hours of dreaming and processing information. I don't feel like I've been sleeping at all. However, I generally don't feel too anxious nor this messes up with my life - except for the social side, that segment is mostly non-existent for the previous 3 years, ever since the most triggering one happened (I simply don't trust people and I enjoy my own company, but that's the story of another time). I'm aware this could be a sign of depression, but I'm very familiar with it, and this is not depression, it's something new. Am I reliving the cocoon stage of healing?

Tw: violence/ some in-depth discussion of trauma

Hey, I go to Michigan State University, and about a week and a half ago, I experienced a mass shooting. I wasn‚Äôt at the shooting scene, but I was about two buildings away (meaning that I heard everything, including the shots and sirens). Obviously, I‚Äôve been dealing with some pretty intense trauma symptoms/ flashbacks. Right now, my biggest symptom is brain fog. I‚Äôm not actively dissociating in the sense that I know where I am and feel like I am connected to my body, but I feel like anything I have to think about is automatically 10x harder to do (aka having trouble processing higher order thoughts). It kinda feels like trying to write a research project while having the flu or trying to sludge through a bog just to get a sentence out. This means that I haven‚Äôt been able to do schoolwork/ my job for the past couple of days, which is bad for obvious reasons. Has anyone had any experience alleviating this type of thing?

I‚Äôve also been experiencing other symptoms like emotional numbness, sudden outbursts of sadness, shaking intensely whenever I hear sirens or helicopters, and avoiding places that could be triggering as much as possible. I took a couple ptsd quizzes and i think it‚Äôs safe to say I‚Äôm at pretty high risk (I also have some comorbid disorders). Is there anything I can do to mitigate the chances of developing ptsd from this? I see a therapist but idk i still feel terrible.

I have come to realize that my mother is a narcissist. I‚Äôm so angry at myself how much I catered to her. I‚Äôm angry at myself. I was so blind for so long, putting my parents on such a pedestal. I‚Äôm angry that they had the means to be better and they didn‚Äôt. How much everything revolves around her emotions and needs even when she was addicted to painkillers in my teens my memories of her being on her bed for days and weeks at a time. But my father made good money and worked long hours. My sister became my mother, but when she turned 18 she left for college she had to save herself. Her therapist even told her it was like I lost a parent when she left, which is true sadly. At that time, my mom said to come out of the drugs, realizing that I was going to be leaving soon. When I turned 18 my parents forced me to pay them back $15,000 from a trust fund that was left for me when brother died. Blaming me for not going further with my ballet career and stopping at 17. But because of all of my outward trauma and guilt of not being a good daughter, I didn‚Äôt see the psychological damage of narcissistic mother. Until now at 32. Even last week, my mother said that I need to come home to take care of my father (her other child as she said) after my recent break up. Even last year I tried to kill myself. I went through a lot of therapy to try and tell them about my attempt. I felt so much shame and guilt that I had failed them. I was supposed to be the good and perfect one. I finally told them, and my mother waited for my father to leave and verbally attacked me.. she asked why I thought she was a bitch that day and treated her like a child. Which I was having to treat her like a child because she doesn‚Äôt act like an adult I even had to apologize to the owners of the place we were staying at because of her behavior. I left to go to the bathroom after my father came back . I came back, my father told me I had to apologize to my mother give her a hug and let her know that I still love her after how I treated her that day. It is absolutely so painful to me, realizing how narcissistic my mother is and how much of an enabler my father is I‚Äôve gone so much of my life catering to their emotions and I excused my mother for so many horrible psychological damages. All in the sake of keeping an image. I‚Äôm in double therapy twice a week again. Pouring myself into work. And I lost one person who actually cared about me because I was so unhealed. I feel so I absolutely alone and all this pain and anger at myself and them. It wasn‚Äôt until this year that I finally told people that I used to sleep on my mothers floor next to her bed until I was 16. My therapist says it‚Äôs because I wanted her love and I didn‚Äôt know any other way to get it. All I wanted was love and I have tried so long and hard. It‚Äôs crushing to realize the choices I‚Äôve made because of the way I was raised. I feel like I was raised to be a monster. I will be a narcissist, like my mother. And I will never be capable of being loved.

TLDR: coming out of the fog at 32 after a lifetime of trauma to realize that my mother is a narcissist, and my father is an enabler. On top of a lot of trauma that I struggled with PTSD with.",1677222631.0
705,I was raped in a fucking hospital.,125,119ui9v,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/119ui9v/i_was_raped_in_a_fucking_hospital/,23,"I only ever tell this story in two different halves.

The first half is about how I ended up in the hospital. I almost died. I experienced what it's like to know that you're about to die, and there is nothing anyone can do about it. 

0/10. Would not recommend.

The second half is about what I woke up to a day later. In the dim night, when everyone else was gone. Having to limp out of the hospital in pain. Remembering hands, and the other person, and the giddy-with-insanity-as-it-broke-my-brain realization that nobody was going to come and save me. That this was just going to happen. Trying to sit up. Being pushed back down. Passing back out.

I was 18.

Some completely pulverized piece of me will never accept that this actually happened. What goes hand in hand with that is the irrational, unshakeable certainty that nobody will ever believe me. Despite that already not being true.

At first, I told myself it was because hospitals had to have cameras in those rooms. This couldn't have happened. Then I told myself that my parents would've been there overnight.

Neither of that's true.

And the risk of false memory syndrome doesn't explain the pain.

Or the fact that a serial rapist who worked around that hospital went on trial less than 2 years later, and he looked like every shard of memory that I have.

It's many years later, now. 

Things are usually better than this.

But it's a month from the time this happened, and I'm drinking tonight. A lot. And I just want to say it. The truth. To someone besides my wife.

*This happened.*

Even though the chances of it happening were infinitesimal. 

Statistically, false memory syndrome is infinitely more likely.

But false memories don't leave you checking for blood because you're in so much fucking goddamn pain that you're shaking at having to use the fucking bathroom.

I don't know what anyone can say back to this. I don't know what there is to say. 

*I* don't know what to say about it.

How could you?

The next time I woke up, it was the most beautiful day you've ever seen in your life. There was a huge window in the room, and a phenomenal view of the city and the rolling hills.

Now I have to put up blackout curtains on beautiful springtime days. Because the sunlight is radioactive. It makes me start throwing up before I realize why I'm sick. Every tired fucking year. Despite meds that do help, and therapists who've never been worth a damn.

I stood at that window, just staring out of it. Pathologically docile. I said yes to everyone. I told them everything they wanted to hear. I was human putty, spineless and soft.

Because all I could think was ""I want to go home.""

*Please, let me go home. Please, I need a shower. I feel disgusting. Everything feels disgusting. Please don't force me to stay here.*

When I finally finished jumping through hoops, and went home? 

They guilted me for the cost of the ambulance they'd called to save my life.

I went upstairs. I finally got to take a shower. 

And as soon as I got into it, all I could do was cry.

No, I'm not stable right now. Yes, I'm weird and broken and pathetic.

But you know what? If anyone else had to live through this shit, along with everything that came before it, and everything that came after it? They would be too.

I'm tired of being ashamed and embarrassed about the completely unwanted, uninvited effects of having had to survive more in two days than some people survive in their entire fucking lives.",1677148175.0

From late Oct - Jan, I was in survival mode, triggered by a poorly thought out situation. It brought up a very unhealed part of me. It sucked because I was actually doing really well mentally for the 3 months before hand, and I felt like I was going backward. Dec was the worst.

I felt forced by the universe to do some more goddamn healing work. I've dealt with PTSD for the past 13 years and actively learning about trauma for the past 5 years. Had many relapses, triggers, depressive episodes in between.

Now, I would say that my baseline is even better than my baseline before October. 

I used Internal Family Systems on myself and Byron Katie's ""The Work"" to help me (as well videos from various spiritual teachers), which were new concepts to apply for me. I addressed a ton of my trauma from the past. I am aware that I was a victim, but I FEEL less like a victim. I feel more in aware of my inner child's experiences than ever before, I feel more peace than ever.

709,The person I live with unintentionally triggers me every day and I'm not sure how to talk to them about it.,18,11a3iy2,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11a3iy2/the_person_i_live_with_unintentionally_triggers/,33,"Hello all. I have a very strange situation that I'm not sure how to deal with. Trigger Warning: I talk about panic attacks & flashbacks.

Throughout my therapy journey, my psychiatrist and therapist both agree that I also have very intense CPTSD, though I'm not sure its a ""formal"" diagnosis. But it checks out to me. I get triggered and my body immediately reacts as if I'm living in the past.

Here's the problem at hand: My landlady triggers me every morning.

I live in New York City and I managed to luck out on a spot to rent. Its an older lady's entire basement. I have my own bathroom, lots of space.. the works. My rent is insanely low for NYC, which is why I moved there. The lady who owns the house is so nice. I do everything in my power to try and seem like I'm invisible so I don't disturb her and I let her know my gratitude on a consistent basis. The only issue is, I haven't been able to wake up normally in months. 

One of my biggest triggers are footsteps approaching. The sound of footsteps makes my heart race, I get nauseous, I feel like I'm in immediate danger. Every morning for the past few months I have woken up to intense flashbacks of traumatic events associated with footsteps (unfortunately its a lot of bad memories associated with footsteps lmaoooo). My land lady is a small woman, but her footsteps sound like thunder. It wakes me up in a complete panic everytime.

I feel like it is unreasonable for me to ask her to stop walking so heavy down the stairs. This house was built in the 1920's so it probably sounds worse in the basement (where I live) than what it actually is. On top of this, this will not be my first time someone lives above me while living in New York City. To try and counteract this, I started setting my alarm for 5:30 AM. At first it was good, but then she started waking up at 5:30. So I set it for 5:00 AM. Then she started waking up at 5:00 AM. Now I'm waking up at 4:30 AM to avoid the footsteps despite my job starting at 9:00AM. Last night I almost went crazy because I was awoken to footsteps at midnight and at 4:00 AM. I couldn't go back to sleep. 

I take my sleep very seriously and I credit good sleep hygiene with my ability to heal and recover. I do not want to seem like people have to live their life to avoid triggering me. However, at the same time, I feel like this *could* be an easy fix? I don't want to tell a grown woman who owns a 3 bedroom home by herself in new york city what to do in her own house, ya know? Plus, footsteps are always going to be around.

Any advice? I really don't want to intrude on her or anything. She is not noisy at all besides those footsteps, I swear. And the fact she keeps waking right before my alarm just in time to make me feel like I'm for real a scared kid again is starting to have an impact on my daily life. And it sucks because I know for a fact she isn't waking up like ""yeah lets ruin bingbong8382's day!"". But suffering from flashbacks and panic attacks first thing in the morning is exhausting. My work is being effected by this lol. Idk what to do.

I appreciate you help <3

EDIT: thank you everybody for your kind words and suggestions! I‚Äôm glad I asked for advice because I really felt uncomfortable asking my land lady to walk lighter. So I‚Äôm glad y‚Äôall validated me that my hunch was right. I‚Äôm actively looking for the products you guys suggested and saving up for some Bose headphones immediately. Thank you guys so so so much.",1677173722.0

It's known that the more you work the higher chance of developing an allergy. Usually people start off with hives or burning eyes before getting asthma or worse. My lucky ass don't have hives but straight to asthma if I go more than 10 min without my mask.

I had to tell my boss and coworkers that I had to report my allergy increase and talk to the people in charge of reducing my risk at work. Out of the people I've told it only seems like 1 coworker and my boss taking it seriously. 

Someone was like look, I have allergies too and showed a few red spots on their arm. Internally I was like ""technically yeah but it's not the same"". I have ezcema I wish I just got hives I'm used to that kind of reaction. I never had asthma. And it triggered my ptsd tbh. Sitting there gasping for air scared the shit out of me.

Only one coworker was like ""are you okay? I bet that was really scary, be careful "" everyone else is just like ""okay and? We all get allergies."" But from what I know of they only get hives when they are touched by the rats (they shouldnt be touching you in the first place so they should rarely be touched) or just a simple OTC allergy pills gets rid of their reactions. 

I feel like I'm being dramatic now. Everyone comparing it to minor hives and I can tell the person who showed me their arm thinks I'm overreacting by getting evaluated by the on-site doctors about my level of risk. 

Part of me is worried that I over reacted cause it triggered my PTSD and possibly making the lives of the people on my project harder.",1677206508.0

I take my iPad to many places I go and draw during most of my freetime. I don't always draw vent art when I draw, but it helps a lot when I need to. Drawing helps me process everything. The sense of relief I feel after I've drawn what I'm feeling and thinking is huge. Drawing has helped me understand these symptoms and actually helps me handle them better in the future at times.

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like many of my family members get it. The greatest example is recently, I drew a somewhat abstract piece about my appetite, which I've noticed is negatively affected when my other PTSD symptoms are on the rise. The process of drawing it helped me process specific elements about the symptom; how I struggle to identify hunger at times and that I need to at least try eating even when I don't feel it, because I need to eat aha. But what my family sees and says is *PANIC* ""DO YOU HAVE ANOREXIA???"" ""ARE YOU SUICIDAL???"" ""ARE YOU OKAY???"" ""DON'T DRAW THAT!!!"" It seems like no matter how much I explain, they don't get it. It's frustrating. I don't want to hide my art. I also hate continously having to explain this. 

Regardless, I won't stop drawing, because it helps far more than anything.",1677202378.0
712,How To Address An Accidental Trigger,3,11aav92,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11aav92/how_to_address_an_accidental_trigger/,2,"Posting from a throwaway account because my discord and main reddit account have the same username.

I've been in a small discord server (<10 people) with friends for a few months and was under the impression we were all in the 18-23 age range based on our conversations and the rules of the server we initially met in. However, I learned today that one of my friends in the server who is another friend(21)'s younger sister is in fact much younger than I thought (14 or 15 years old, I don't know her exact birthday). I am currently 22 turning 23 very soon, so of course learning that the person I have a matching icon with is extremely young is shocking.

The triggering part comes from my own experiences when I was 13-15 years old. I was groomed & abused online via various social media & messaging services by primarily men in their early to mid 20s. Learning our exact age gap after months of friendship (we all talk in our private server almost daily for at least ""hi, hru, etc"" type of stuff) has triggered me and makes me wildly uncomfortable.

I think it's important to say that I have no intentions towards this girl that are inappropriate or harmful; we have only been talking in the server where other people can see the conversations. 

Is there even a good way to address any of this? Or is this just a me problem and it shouldn't be brought up? I'm incredibly lost on what to do right now because I don't want to leave the server and potentially cut off my other friends who are of a more appropriate age nor do I want to upset the young friend since it's not her fault that she's that age and that I'm traumatized.",1677191587.0

My family was in a bad car accident when I was 1, and while I was too young to remember it , I‚Äôve heard a lot about it, and how it took my dad. I‚Äôm 22 now, and I have been in a few accidents since then.. 

Not to be mean but , my mom is not the best driver, since I was a kid her driving has scared me on some level, she‚Äôd drive when she was sick, cut people off , look at her phone that kind of stuff and whenever were in car accidents it‚Äôs with her. 

And since the last accident a few years ago I‚Äôve been suffering from ptsd, it was pretty bad at first, I started to have panic attacks in the car and would grip the seat till my fingers hurt, I would be terrified whenever we‚Äôd pull onto the road or pass a car pulling onto the lane next to us ‚Ä¶ I think I was most terrified whenever we‚Äôd drive on bridges or next to see hills or ditches , winter driving terrified me even more and every time I was on the road my head would scare me with thoughts of the accidents that could happen at any moment‚Ä¶

I started having terrible nightmares, that started the night we got back from the trip that had the last accident , they would mostly consist of my mom driving us off a cliff I would yell at her to stop but she wouldn‚Äôt listen and I could feel us in the air and would wake up the moment we hit the ground.. needless to say the nightmares themselves were traumatizing and I would wake up crying and scared , and I stopped driving for a while because of it

So I jumped the gun a bit, I don‚Äôt actually have a formal diagnosis. My doctor thinks I might have high functioning PTSD. I have a few friends who says I do as well, but I don‚Äôt know. People can be quick to label someone. My GP shouldn‚Äôt do that though. I often question the validity of what happened and I‚Äôm finally coming to terms with it at least having been traumatic.

So what happened? When I was 6 years old, might have been 7, a much larger mentally retarded boy asked me if I wanted to be together. Me being denser than a loaf of bread thought he wanted to play together and said yes. To my confusion he started cheering and ran off. The next day as I walked to school, he came running at full speed towards me. In the middle of the school grounds he captures me. He picks me up by my upper arms, and kisses me. His drool suffocating me. I couldn‚Äôt breathe. He didn‚Äôt use the toungue the first time. I kick him in the knee and fall to the ground and I run off. I got bruised on my arms where he was holding me. He chased me.
He would chase me roughly every day for the next 3 years. When he captured me, he would kiss me and hug me. He would roar out my name and make noises, so I would usually hear him coming a long way away.
I have several memories of events with this guy. I remember jumping out of the second floor window when he cornered me in the classroom, and I got in trouble for that. I remember hiding in the bathroom stall and him just barging in unlocking the stall with such ease. I remember my fear the first time he did that. How I froze. I remember him coming to my home, knocking on the door, naked. Shouting my name. Knocking so hard I thought he would knock down the door. He never got in trouble for anything. People saying this was just harmless ‚Äúboys will be boys‚Äù stuff. He was sent away suddenly, and I thought it was over.

As a teenager I spot him in the newspaper. My family had relocated to another city. Coincidentally this is where he had ended up. I started having flashbacks. Feeling like he was running after me again, and I could smell him, like he was actually there. Somehow kids in school found out about -this- and started bullying me about it, calling me a coward for overreacting to this, and a whore for being with a retarded boy. I stop having flashbacks a 18-19, and maybe coincidentally start having migraines. As time goes on i think less about the events, but every now and again I got intrusive memories, but eventually those faded too.

Today I‚Äôm in my late 30s, the intrusive memories are coming back. A few weeks ago I encountered someone who reminded me of the the guy and I responded by spending every ounce of my energy to not fall apart. I almost felt I could smell him again. I had to turn my back to the people there as I couldn‚Äôt focus on everyone. But I couldn‚Äôt leave, because my boyfriend didn‚Äôt understand and I would fall apart if I had tried to explain it. I haven‚Äôt been able to explain -this- to him before.
So far rain seems to trigger memories, running occasionally does too, and, I‚Äôm sorry to say, mentally handicapped people shouting out noises will also trigger memories.. but they‚Äôre just memories‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve lived a privileged life. My parents worked hard to provide, never leaving any request I had unfulfilled, and in turn I studied hard to get into medical school, reaching my dream to qualify as a doctor some years ago. 

But during my residency training, and less than a year after I got married, on one quiet Saturday afternoon, I had a sudden inability to speak, and my speech became slurred for 30s, before my symptoms disappeared as quickly as it started. My heart raced as I was driven to the ER, and was diagnosed with a cryptogenic stroke. Cryptogenic being the key - ‚Äúcause uncertain‚Äù.

My entire life turned upside down since then. From feeling like a superstar doctor, saving lives, I suddenly found myself diagnosed with an illness for which the cause was uncertain. Why did this happen to me? I was upset and angry. But Thankfully, my symptoms had resolved. I was started on chronic medication. I took time off work to reflect if this is a path I wanted to continue on, and chose to do so as I knew I could help many many patients, which I did and have done since. I resumed residency and passed out a few years later as a specialist. However, my mind has never been settled. I‚Äôve struggled a lot mentally.

During my residency, I was focussed on getting through it - with the plan to get to the end and reassess these health issues only then. I started to develop neck pain 2 years ago when I fell whilst carrying my kid, which thankfully my kid herself survived relatively unscathed. I have often ignored my symptoms on the rare occasion it came on, and it was initially manageable. However, recently the symptoms have progressed to cause immense pain : a constant ache down my arm for almost 2-3 months now.. it‚Äôs making me miserable! And I know I need to get a MRI scan of my neck done to get a diagnosis of what‚Äôs wrong, but I can‚Äôt just bring myself to do it.. with common things being common, it could be a tiny slipped disc. But I now also always think that even the worst case scenario like a tumour is possible! And I don‚Äôt want to deal with it. I don‚Äôt want to know. I don‚Äôt want another terrible diagnosis!

As I live this lie of ‚Äúignorance is bliss‚Äù, I suffer almost daily from the pain - maybe on average 3-4 days a week.. and have some days pain free. The pain comes and goes. I know carrying my kid worsens it, so I‚Äôve stopped doing so which makes me sad. Especially when she looks at me like I‚Äôm a half man for not being able to lift her, and I‚Äôm only in my mid30s!

My problem is this - my whole life changed when I was diagnosed with the stroke. I was put on medications ever since, and the fact that I‚Äôm no longer a super star human being really affected me. It made me realise how vulnerable I am, how fragile life is. And now I feel ‚Äúsick‚Äù - as a mid 30s young man with this history of a stroke. And I have children now - all the more I find myself not wanting to deal with this new neck pain issue that has now converted into an arm pain. Because I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôs a tumour and I just don‚Äôt want to deal with it. Today I can‚Äôt sleep - because of this, but I can‚Äôt bring myself to get a MRI to acknowledge this and seek help. What do I do? 

Is this PTSD? I‚Äôm so afraid of the consequences that came with my previous diagnosis of stroke, that I don‚Äôt want to have to deal with another illness whatever that may be. 

Please help me. I can tell it‚Äôs also affecting my wife when she keeps telling me to seek medical attention but I refuse. I want to live without any additional illnesses for as long as possible. I pray that my symptoms will just disappear. 

Is this PTSD? Do I need help? Have I not gotten over what happened to me ? I feel so blessed to have survived a stroke, but I don‚Äôt want to be labelled with anything else. I feel so young. I‚Äôm a doctor - I‚Äôm the person who‚Äôs meant to be helping the sick. I don‚Äôt want to be sick. 

Please lend some advice. 
Thank you.",1677180270.0

So, I‚Äôve been diagnosed with CPTSD along with a slew of other stuff. I was finally beginning to feel better on a new medication cocktail, and I was turning my life around. I was going to the gym, eating better, sleeping better, and being more productive. However, this weekend is a major trauma anniversary- the 2nd anniversary of my rape. I‚Äôm currently pursuing a university case against my rapist, which has helped but is also stirring up old feelings. Plus, I‚Äôm extra on-edge because I got rejected from my dream grad school the day before what would have been my ex and I‚Äôs anniversary.

As a result of all these compiling things, I‚Äôve had nightmares for like a week, and they are causing me to have debilitating panic attacks and agoraphobic episodes during the day. I‚Äôm becoming afraid to sleep because of how horrific these dreams are, which is making the daytime episodes worse. I am at my wit‚Äôs end.

I‚Äôm so frustrated because I was finally doing better after years of bs. I was finally feeling back on track and ready to handle life again. Instead, I have to fight against my subconscious to even cook myself a meal instead of order-in because of my agoraphobia. My PTSD is actively becoming expensive, especially since it might be triggering an auto-immune response.

I am tired of always feeling so abnormal. I want to build a life for myself, and I can‚Äôt do that if i‚Äôm constantly hiding and experiencing fight-or-flight. Words of support would be welcomed, but honestly thanks for taking the time to read.",1677152799.0

A lot of my recent trauma stems from Betrayal. I got pretty brutally cheated on in my last relationship, and it really fucked me up. 

My ex cheated with my best friend while I present in the house and sleeping on the other side of the wall. Lied about for 6 months. 

I also was in a 3 year long relationship with a serial cheater before that. 

My relationship now is so healthy and so happy. I turn 25 this year and I feel like a mix of existential crisis + PTSD is flaring up. 

Things are getting serious in my relationship, and I got scared. But I‚Äôm not really scared, my body is scared. My body is is fight or flight and it‚Äôs trying to pick flight. 

I‚Äôm excited and happy, but my body is terrified of being hurt again. And the more I fall in love and the more serious my relationship gets the more I know it could hurt if things go wrong. 

But I don‚Äôt want to run. I don‚Äôt want to lose this angel of a person. I refuse to let my trauma make me ruin a good thing because of my past.",1677151874.0

But it doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. A normal person wouldn‚Äôt have gotten ptsd from that. It wasn‚Äôt even that big of a deal. I feel like I‚Äôm overreacting. 


Tw: sex, rape, choking 

Our sex wasn‚Äôt very vanilla. He used to choke me during it. Except it wasn‚Äôt choking it was more like strangling. He only used one hand but it would happen so quickly. The color would start draining from everything and it would become fuzzy. My whole body would tingle and then become numb. But he always let go right before I passed out. It took me a minute to function properly again. And even though I told him he probably shouldn‚Äôt do it that hard that‚Äôs what would always happen. But then it started to happen outside of sex. I think whenever HE was horny. One time we were just eating ramen and watching tv and he turned to me, smirked, and the next thing I knew everything was in black and white. I was a bit scared knowing it could happen at any moment. 

He and I had a rape play kink. Probably from the trauma of me being groomed as a kid. But one time he told me, ‚ÄúI want to rape your unconscious body in a field.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know why but that particular idea made me feel scared. Maybe it was the fact I‚Äôd be unconscious and unconsenting. Or maybe it was the fact I‚Äôd be raped in a field and no one could see or hear me. 

To me he‚Äôs not a bad person. I thought I was the bad person for a long while after he dumped me. He never told me why. But he did say, ‚Äúyou make me feel like something I‚Äôm not. You make me feel like a bad person.‚Äù I was confused. I think it was because I cried about everything even if it didn‚Äôt matter. 

Afterwards I couldn‚Äôt be intimate with anyone for a year. I‚Äôd start shaking uncontrollably and not being able to hold myself up. Ofc guys don‚Äôt find that attractive. I got a lot of remarks like, ‚Äúwow you‚Äôre really bad at this.‚Äù ‚ÄúDoes a hand job make you shake.‚Äù ‚ÄúCome on please I was so close.‚Äù They didn‚Äôt care about me. Of course they didn‚Äôt. But I still felt like the problem. And those were always the last times I‚Äôd ever be intimate with those people. 

I had to switch schools because seeing him in the hallway made my stomach churn. It made me self harm every time I saw him. As in I‚Äôd push my skin into the wall as I walked until I bled. No one noticed except my dad. I had horrible paranoia. I was so scared of catching a glimpse of him my flight or fight mode never turned off. I spent my lunches in the bathroom. I didn‚Äôt eat. I just sat there. So the only meal I‚Äôd have was dinner during the weekdays. I ended up switching to a new school. A virtual one. Because I also had a problem with hyperventilating in the hallways. I still do, but at least it‚Äôs one day a week for half the time.",1677158158.0

728,can bad experience with an edible give you ptsd/trauma or is this something else ? help,1,11a22lr,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11a22lr/can_bad_experience_with_an_edible_give_you/,2,"i don‚Äôt know if this was a good place to post and i feel like using the word ptsd or trauma is a bit too strong but i just feel so crazy, scared, and confused about this. 

About 2-3 weeks ago i ate an edible for the first time. It wasn‚Äôt laced or anything, i got it from a friend (who is absolutely trustworthy) who got it from a dispensary. She had the same gummy before, just saved one for me. I‚Äôve smoked weed before and gotten a little buzzed but never actually high high. The edible was 15mg. I was with my friend in her car and we were either driving around or at parking lots. I didn‚Äôt eat beforehand because i wanted it to hit quicker (dumb i know) and i also just kept worrying about what if i freak, what if hours pass and i‚Äôm still high, what if my parents find out, etc. before and during my high.

It hit me hard and it felt super super overwhelming that i had to constantly lay back, close my eyes, and breathe. but over all i was handling it surprisingly well. It was a mixture being on the verge of fear and then being completely giddy about it. we had food and we decided to eat but looking at my food.. it didn‚Äôt look right. long story short i freaked myself out threw up twice and started panicking really badly. when the high wore off i was still very much shaken up and ever since then i‚Äôve just been having constant anxiety. 

honestly for the first week and a half after, it came it went and i was scared of being sick or anxious again but i was able to manage. Some days were good and i didn‚Äôt think bad or confuse my bodily sensations as me being sick again. but other days im shaking because i randomly feel extremely anxious to a point where i get sick.. and then i get more anxious because now im feeling sick and the last time i was this way was with the edible. 

I feel like it‚Äôs gotten worse very recently. I think i felt sick or made myself feel sick one night and had a panic. Ever since then i haven‚Äôt been able to move on or to calm down. i don‚Äôt know if personal issues recently have also amplified it too and i feel like not only do i get anxiety about.. anxiety lol (or being sick) but also about my situation and surroundings. It‚Äôs affected my eating habits and i‚Äôve either been eating very little or not at all. My stomach currently hurts and i feel sick because i barely have anything in me. i had a little bit of oatmeal, smoothie, and currently trying to snack on some crackers but i can‚Äôt finish or continue on without feeling bad. Both hunger or eating makes my stomach hurt, and then it makes me panic. it‚Äôs a vicious cycle.

i go back and forth between the roots, either the stress i had with the edible gave/worsen my anxiety or it was so traumatizing that it‚Äôs still basically stuck on me and anything can set it off (esp feeling sick or being around weed). or i thought maybe emetophobia but i never had a problem with vomit before in my life ever. like yeah i hated it, never wanted to do it and i haven‚Äôt done it in forever until then, i never wanna be in a room w it.. but never anything like a phobia i mean i‚Äôve been super sick before and never had a panic. Yesterday my stomach hurt and i took medicine but i threw up and i felt fine after. i was shaken up because of yk aftermath of throwing up like i felt regular sickness but then later on i randomly started feeling anxious. was i anxious about throwing up or something else, or a combo of things i don‚Äôt know. maybe there‚Äôs another option where there‚Äôs deeper meaning instead.. like maybe this anxiety is just about losing control and being vulnerable like that 

Sometimes i wonder if i should just make myself throw up to convince you brain to shut up but most times what i‚Äôm feeling is literally anxiety nausea not actual nausea. I‚Äôm going to see a doctor today to speak about this because it‚Äôs ruining my life and to ask see if i‚Äôve damaged myself medically and physically due to the poor habits i‚Äôve developed. i can‚Äôt do things that i used to do before and it‚Äôs like i‚Äôm no longer my old self. I also started seeing a therapist and had my first session a couple of days ago to help out.

It feels stupid and dramatic to feel like this after one bad experience with an edible. And a lot of it is my fault because i keep overthinking or dwelling on negative thoughts or about every sensation because i keep thinking about how i felt when i panicked and i get so scared of feeling like that again. i try to be within the anxiety, like accept it, and to be less hard on myself but this is so exhausting and terrifying i want it to be over.",1677170250.0

I'm (F25) sleepy, tired, and exhausted. This time of year is particularly triggering since more than one trauma has happened by the end of February and at the beginning of March. The one that caused me to seek help for PTSD happened the night between the last day of February and the first day of March. This year, I feel quite good since my symptoms have gotten better even though I've recently faced some fresh trauma and a pretty nasty breakup. However, something very different is going on. I tried to switch up my sleep patterns, eat more healthily, meditate a lot, etc. but I still feel sleepy and tired all the time. Not just mentally, but also physically. I could sleep for days. I'm highly functional, and work and study don't suffer (yet). Maybe I try and shy away from potential flashes, or I try to face the trauma in dreams - my dreams are crazily vivid and life-like. Sometimes, I'm even sleepwalking and yelling, and you guessed it - I wake up tired after 10 hours of dreaming and processing information. I don't feel like I've been sleeping at all. However, I generally don't feel too anxious nor this messes up with my life - except for the social side, that segment is mostly non-existent for the previous 3 years, ever since the most triggering one happened (I simply don't trust people and I enjoy my own company, but that's the story of another time).

i usually don't dream at night, but for the past week i've been dreaming twice every night.


the first dream of night one was really extreme. my dad was somehow in our house with a new wife and i just erupted. i grabbed a hammer and started hitting my dad over the head with it and screaming about everything that he had done to me. then i woke up sweating, went back to bed and dreamt of skipping school with my friends.


night two was slightly better. my dad drove a bulldozer into my current home, jumped out and started shooting at me and my mom. i grabbed my mom's gun and shot him in the chest, woke up, then dreamt again of ozzy osbourne being my school's principal.


night three i dreamt that my stepdad was just yelling at me for something stupid, so i swung at him. apparently i put all my force into it because i woke up throwing the punch and i fell on the ground.

is stuff like this normal or is it something that i should seek help for?",1677090305.0

750,Hi I have a question,1,119img2,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/119img2/hi_i_have_a_question/,1,"So I had a high school friend who gave my phone number away after my mom accidentally called her a problem child and my mom didn't mean it she was just jk'ing around but the girl took it serious saying she trusted me. But, before she always makes excuses to her promises like us hanging out but then she makes an excuse the last minute, I always text first, and sometimes well most of the time she never responds to any of them, also the time she lied to her then best friend saying that I lied about something she said when she did said it and her best friend believed her and told me please not to lie and I took it in like it was my fault, also asked why when I told her the next time I stay with her when she was down after something but said it coldly, and also when I told her I was banned from the art room she said okay and just left me at the spot to talk to her friends and stuff (also she never came to my lunch table as she promised). So anyway, I told her sorry about my mom calling her a problem child and told her she didn't mean it, and she didn't respond I kept saying sorry on text after two days of her not responding. But then, she got the nerve to basically let her best friend now that she was upset and so her best friend gave my phone number away to a stranger and I never forgot what that stranger told me that it was my fault, that that girl has every right to not be friends with me anymore, and that I'm a coward. And it just went on and on and so I got to her best friend and her best friend told me well we could've still been friends if you hadn't done what you done and I told her all I wanted to do was be your friend and I found the true meaning of friendship thanks to them (or so I thought) and her best friend replied by saying well I don't care leave us alone and if you want to know what the girl did she did absolutely nothing but just let this stranger and her best friend did the talking for her. And so after that, I still kept saying sorry on email like 5 times but she didn't respond in fact while at school she seemed happier with all these new friends and her and her best friend seem to have not been friends anymore. Anyway, some time later, I encountered her again and I asked her did she care how much of a broken person she made me she said she cared but she was just hurt by what I said and I hated when she said that cause I was like at that moment when did you prove it, and also she awkwardly nodes when I ask her do you care for me like she's saying but yet again it's not their, and then I told her I will never forgive her she said okay coldly, and then me feeling like an idiot and traumatized, I asked her why didn't she say anything she just looked at me with a cold look and didn't respond to the question she just went by on her class. After that, I felt mad, angry, and depressed, heck I felt this for a long time and I still am depressed. Oh and for those of you wondering, she still after that moment, is laughing with boys and enjoying her life and playing innocent to people, in fact her excuse before we're things like I gotta hang out with my friends or my mom said I can't hang out with boys till I'm 16.

I'm gonna describe some of the thing that happen to me, so caution Trigger Warning here.


I used to live in a Big happy family of five kids, and my older brother, the older one was rebellious, he didn't want to work, he didn't want to be a slave for the the system he says, and when he was 18, he go try his chance on the road, living with some gypsie people (hope that not offensive, I don't know other words) 
He come back to the house 1 year later, I was 5 years old.
He explain in front of me to my father that he was addicted to heroin, and he prostitute himself to pay the drugs. Even if I was 5, I fully understand what he mean. That night, he was on crisis because he don't have his drug, so he go total freakout. He do things to me, he forced me, then he beat his gilrfriend nearly to death, then take a gun in his backpack and he say that he gonna kill everybody in this fucking house and kill himself. I was crying of course, i was only 5 years old. And as he saw me cry, he stop. He say to his gilrfriend to get on her knees and thank me, because of she was still alive that night it was because of me. Having an adult, maybe 19/20 years old thanking you, crying, ect, that fucked up m'y mind.
Next day my father tell him to leave. 

He come back 2/3 years later, swearing he was not addicted anymore. A lie. 
That night new crisis, beat up his new girlfriend, and he kill his dog, slitting his troat in front of me. 
He go, Come back years later and cycle continue.
Last time I saw him I was 12 i think. 
Even with all of this, I was a very happy kids, the funny one ! 
The one who was smart, happy, Always on a journey, going to different country with great friends ! 
No ptsd, some nightmare sometime, but I was okay, living a good life.

And One day, I was 21, preparing myself to a day of work, a very normal day, my heart start hurting, feeling sweaty, vision blurring, it got worse and worse, go to hospital, complete check of my body and ... Nothing wrong ! 
It was strange but okay, few days later same thing.
Going to hospital, check, nothing wrong.
The third they say to me, that maybe it was not physical, but more psychological.
That's how my ptsd was diagnostic. 

It's been 3 years now, with good and bad times. And since few weeks I was asking to myself, did one day I will become the same person that I was before, that good happy daring kid ?

766,Sleep medication possibly having a negative interaction with my PTSD?,1,118lrxv,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/118lrxv/sleep_medication_possibly_having_a_negative/,3,"Hey, everyone. To start, I was diagnosed with PTSD about a year and a half ago after suffering instances of SA. Last September, I began to notice an improvement. My flashbacks and nightmares notably reduced, and I was ruminating on the events themselves a lot less. I have always had sleep issues, which were semi-manageable because I've grown so accustomed to only sleeping a few hours a day. Eventually, though, I wanted to confront these problems and so I brought them up to my neurologist. She firstly prescribed me with Ambien. It worked like a charm (no surprise) but I was stressing myself out way too much about the possibility of becoming addicted to it. I'm also diagnosed with bipolar, so I have to be extremely careful about the meds I'm taking. (Disclaimer: my neurologist knows this and prescribed me with the Ambien anyway). Moving on, I stopped taking the Ambien myself and at our next appointment, I told her that I wanted to try something else. She prescribed me with Dayvigo. I was pretty excited about this, seeing as it wasn't an addictive medication and it was something that I could take long-term. 

Once I started taking it, I noticed that it would do its job of putting me to sleep, but I cannot stay asleep. When I am sleeping, I keep having incredibly graphic nightmares about SA. I'll force myself to go back to bed, then have another nightmare, then wake up the next hour. Rinse and repeat until I have to get up and get ready for the day. I cope by suppressing things and so I just ignore it and try to tell myself that they're just dreams, and it must just be me getting used to the medication, or that I'm already stressed so that's why I'm having nightmares. I will come up with anything possible to make myself ""feel better"" so that I can just get on with my day, but it's getting increasingly really difficult and translating into my daily life. I find myself becoming a lot more avoidant, self-isolating because social interaction is too exhausting/anxiety-inducing, re-engaging with trauma-related compulsions, overly jumpy at any sort of loud noise/sudden movement, feeling like I'm going to have a panic attack when I'm out in public (especially so if a man is near me, even walking past me in a store or something), and overall just super paranoid/irritable/mistrustful of others. I also find myself disassociating again in public and wearing hats so that I don't have to see anyone's faces around me. It feels awful because I've made so much progress and I feel like I'm slowly returning to square 1. I want to bring this up to my neurologist, so that she keeps my PTSD in mind when prescribing a different medication, but my mom sees her too and I really fear the chance that she'll find anything out. I'm 22 so that's probably not viable, but it still freaks me out.

Has anyone else had a similar experience on Dayvigo/other sleep meds? I'm not sure if I should just stop taking it, but at this point my anxiety is so high that I feel like I won't be able to sleep at all.",1677030903.0

A while back I applied to a scientific study where people who have experienced life crises (including things that led to PTSD) will get individually tweaked internet based treatment + weekly support from a therapist over 8 weeks.

Two weeks ago I found out that I'm going to be in the wait list control group, which basically means that I'll get the full treatment but after the first group is done with theirs.

There's a several years long wait list at my local psychiatry services for similar forms of treatment so this feels like a big win even though I think the treatment will only have limited effects on me (bad experiences with past treatment/therapy so I find it hard to be optimistic).

But above all else, the therapist I got allotted is just so nice to talk to. He listens, he actually seems empathetic (whereas other therapist have seemed to fake it) and in just an hour long phone call with him he accomplished more than other therapists have done over the course of months!

Just feeling seen and understood has helped a lot with my self-esteem so far. Hopefully there will be more moments like this throughout the treatment.

Idk how to explain this. I‚Äôm not so much addicted to the nicotine or having trouble with the withdrawaling from it bc of the actual substance.  I quit cigarettes several times in the past but always fall back to it.

i rarely dream about actual events that happened to me, just kind of similar things or things that would fall under that scope with a wide variety of characters, sometimes people that actually abused me, sometimes other people i know, sometimes strangers or dream people that i don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶

sometimes these dreams end in me shaking my head back and forth while crying irl, and recently developed to me punching my partner while still asleep O_o i‚Äôm often afraid to go back to sleep because i don‚Äôt want more nightmares.

I was 18 when my dad booked a trip back east (he was from Boston but moved to California where he met my mom) and we were going to go to my cousin's wedding. The flight he scheduled back was united flight 93 Newark to San Francisco, the one that was hijacked on 9/11/01. Although the wedding was in Boston my dad was a money saver and this flight was a better deal. 

Anyhow at the last minute my dad decided to cancel the trip. I was very upset as I was looking forward to going and expressed my discontent about it to him. His reason was he just didn't feel we should go and he wanted to save money.

Well that morning 9/11/01 my dad called my mom from work to turn on the TV and also wake me up.

About several months later I joined a Christian fundamentalist church that told me I was given a second chance. I left it two years later coming to my senses.

However I still think about that flight sometimes the people on it. Why did we get to escape and they didn't. What if my dad didn't cancel. My dad died in 2013 of natural causes. 

The youngest passenger was 20 from San Diego. Had I gone I would have been the youngest. That sends chills down my spine. My older brother would have been left with no parents or sister. 

For awhile I continued to fly. Money constraints have made it difficult to take flying trips but I've been doing a tad better financially and now I'm thinking of going to NYC w my daughter. Yet sometimes I get panic attacks thinking what if it happens this time like final destination. I have nightmares of being in a plane crash every few years. Each year during 9/11 anniversary I begin to feel very weak and this bad impending feeling of doom. 

My daughter has taken an interest in the 9/11 events and it's hard to answer her questions. I can't even look at a book about flight 93 without a sick feeling.

I got out of an abusive relationship about two months ago. She is an alcoholic, gaslit me, manipulated me, SA'd me, so on and so forth... and ended the relationship by trying to kill herself in front of me.

Is this just good ol' fashioned burnout?

790,Fear of driving,8,117d9qz,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/117d9qz/fear_of_driving/,2,"Hi. Just want to say first off that I‚Äôm very grateful this subreddit exists. I‚Äôm not a big poster but I am a big reader and your vulnerability, bravery, and insight have been a huge source of comfort and information to me. I‚Äôm one of those people who have such a bad case of PTSD that I have gotten shuffled from doctor to doctor because I‚Äôm ‚Äúbeyond their level of expertise.‚Äù Luckily, I finally have a psychiatrist who has taken me off medications (some that I‚Äôve been on since I was 17 and I‚Äôm currently 41) that were actually making my flashbacks worse. I also have the great fortune to be able to see a trauma psychologist once a week. She‚Äôs not cheap and I‚Äôm struggling to pay for her but she‚Äôs a constant source of validation and safety. 

Anyways, I was thrust into this not-so-lovely disorder because of a variety of particular incidents, but the one I really need to focus on right now is my fear of driving. In 2019 was a passenger in a head-on collision less than a mile from my house with my 2 year old in the car. She‚Äôs fine now but we both sustained traumatic brain injuries and I was left with severe PTSD, migraines, occipital neuralgia, what appear to be non-epileptic seizures from the accident (I take low dose Benzos as needed for them). I spent 5 months in occupational therapy learning to drive again but I‚Äôve never felt comfortable and avoid driving as much as possible. I live in Atlanta which is a nightmare of a place to drive for anyone but it‚Äôs particularly terrifying for me. I am a very good and very defensive driver but it leaves me feeling incredibly drained and usually with a headache if I drive any more than down the street. Also, being the super safety-minded, PTSD-fueled person I am, I‚Äôm kind of afraid that driving with this fear combined with coming off a bunch of medications could lead to a seizure or migraine that could cause me to hurt someone else while behind the wheel. My neurologist and psychiatrist have never told specifically told me not to drive but are very encouraging of me not doing something like driving that makes me feel worse (at least for now).

I was able to push through the fear by taking Uber/Lyft rides with absolute angels who drove gently and carefully, let me listen to Lizzo for strength, and allowed me to play my baritone ukulele in the back seat to distract myself. Kinda funny in retrospect. 

Anyhoo, it was amazing for me to take Ubers/Lyfts then and it continues to be the only way I can travel around this city without being triggered to the point where I have a migraine or am just absolutely DONE for the rest of the day. The big problem is that these rides add up and are an extreme cost that I can‚Äôt afford right now. 

I live in a neighborhood where I can walk my kid to school, I use Instacart, and I have a super safe car (that sits in my driveway most of the time) but it‚Äôs nearly impossible to live and work in ATL without getting into a car. I‚Äôm a single mom and I don‚Äôt have family in town and I‚Äôm not one to ask people for rides because I don‚Äôt like putting people out and when I ask it makes me feel worse. Also the public transit buses stopped coming to my part of town (Tucker) when the pandemic hit. 

My question is‚Ä¶does anyone know if there is some kind of help that exists for people with debilitating PTSD who are afraid of driving? Like a Netflix for car service that you pay once a month and can use for unlimited rides? Or a non-profit that assists single moms with PTSD? I‚Äôve asked my doctors and done quite a bit of googling but nobody knows of anything (at least for civilians). 

If this tells you anything about how bad my fear is, I have an invitation to get out of town without my child for the first time in years to go to Mardi Gras in NOLA where I was born and I‚Äôm sitting here hyperventilating and crying about the drive down. I trust the person driving but his car is too low/too old/too blah blah blah for me to feel safe driving down there in it. He even bought me a plane ticket back so it‚Äôs just this one trip I have to make it through. I do plan on bringing an instrument to play and I hope he likes Lizzo.

I helped my grandmother through hospice late last year. She passed right before Thanksgiving.

My father passed extremely suddenly on the 12th. Like, went out with a friend on Saturday night and had plans with me on Sunday night.

The grief I feel is too overwhelming to describe. And it feels too much to bear.....

My biological mother was married to him for over 16 years. She was my first bully. My entire family's most vicious abuser. Her ability to manipulate feels unparalleled.

I have a teenage sister who I'm extremely close with. We are the same person about 15 years apart and I would move mountains for her.

My dad's funeral is Saturday and my sister wants her mother there. Apparently my birth mother is over a year sober and has been ""a better mother"" to my sister than she has been to me.

I don't know how I'm going to do this. I don't know if I can do this. This just feels.... Surreal. How can any of this be real?? I don't know how I can live in a world without my Dad",1676922890.0

Wanted to share my feelings with people who might understand. Today I had my second EMDR session. I was raped last summer. Two weeks ago we started with an image from that moment, which triggered an intense panic attack. The week following was a living hell, the image was stuck in my head and my body was stuck in that moment. I didn't sleep for more than 2 hours in a row. Last week I told my therapist I was not ready to revisit the memory during the session, because I could already notice myself falling back to suicidal thoughts, due to the lack of sleep and the stress. 
Today I felt quite stable so I wanted to try the EMDR again. I was very nervous, since last time was so hard. This time I didn't really feel that stressed, but as soon as we started to revisit I felt this extreme sadness. For the first time since it happened I cried over the fact that I got raped. I just couldn't stop. After the session my therapist made some small talk to make sure I would get home safe, which helped, but as soon as I got home I broke down again. Tears after tears after tears. I feel this overwhelming sadness that I had not felt about this yet and I also can't remember ever feeling this intensely sad. 
I feel like it's important for the healing process, but jeez, it is a hard time. The image is stuck in my head again and my body feels like it's not mine, and all I can do is cry. My dear friend is coming over to stay the night at mine so I don't have to be alone.

On July 13th 2022, my dog was in a car accident with his dog walker. She had a head on collision with another car and he was sitting in the front of the van with her. He was secured with a dog seat belt to his collar but it snapped in the force of the accident. The dog walker phoned me straight away and I rushed to the scene. I waited so long for all the people to get taken out of the vehicles, the passenger of the other car was in a really bad way and they were slumped forward in their seat. They required several paramedics to remove them from the car. Once everyone was clear, my Dad checked over my dog and lifted him out of the van. His injuries were catastrophic and the emergency vet was over 30mins away. He passed away at the side of the road within minutes but they were not peaceful. He was one month shy of his 3rd birthday and he was the first dog that I raised all by myself. More than 7 months on and I'm not coping, most days have passed in a daze and I've just tried to keep hanging on and keep things normal. Over the months, my mood has been low and I've been irritable at times. I've had trouble concentrating at work and some days, intense memories of the accident come back and I'm immediately crying and feeling panicked. My sleep has been disturbed, I've tossed and turned every night and recently I've started remembering dreams I've had that become deeply disturbing. I'm so exhausted, I slept 18 hours straight one day last week due to the pressure I'm feeling. In December I started on antidepressants and two weeks ago, after speaking to the doctor again and explaining how I was struggling, she diagnosed me with PTSD and I've been referred for trauma counselling.

Over the two weeks, I've become more aware of my symptoms and I've had several flashbacks and panic attacks. My biggest issue now is that I keep waking up in the middle of the night with shortness of breath, chest tightness and a racing heart. I can't get back to sleep after this and it happened again last night, I've taken the morning off work and spoken to the doctor again. They're prescribing propranolol for the anxiety and stressed the benefit of therapy again but I'm still waiting for a call from the trauma counselling team. I hate that this is happening, I hate feeling this way and I feel so horrendous. I feel so weak, I feel like a burden and I'm stressed about the time I've taken off work so far. My manager isn't the most empathetic and she isn't the best at reassurance and I'm struggling to feel supported in the workplace.

This doesn't feel like bad enough trauma to have PTSD, it was really horrible watching what my boy went through but I feel like people around me think I should be over it because he was ""just a dog"". He was my everything though and he got me through the pandemic and was my only companion most days. He looked out for me as much as I looked after him. There's no justice in his death either as dogs are just seen as property under the law. I'm not even privvy to any updates regarding the case because I'm ""not a victim or witness"". I believe my dog walker is being charged and I've heard some updates through the grapevine that the passenger had pretty bad injuries and needed to spend an extended period of time in hospital. I just don't know how to begin working through this and it just feels like it's getting harder and harder. I don't want to be a burden to those I love. I just want the old me back again. I just wish the accident never happened.

Things recently have been kind of hard, which made me relapse hard into my dissociation. At the same time I have been discussing much with my therapist about the cause of my PTSD, which we were never really able to understand.
This until yesterday night; after a night out with my friends I went back home and had a proper realization moment. I was pretty stoned, which is okay I have been smoking for years now and it has helped my anxiety a lot, but in my ""trip"" i guess i was able to figure out the main reason of my traumas.
It's not like a suddenly remembered a specific episode or anything, it's as if the fog around my childhood got off and everything started to be clear and not blurry anymore.
I've had a dysfunctional family and abusive father, but only now I was able to see his actions as abusive.
Now that I've acknowledged the reality tho I do not feel much, apart from sadness and kind of a numb feeling. I really don't know what the next steps should be : what I should do today or who I should be with, what kind of environment I should put myself into in order not to have a strong relapse or panic attacks.

I've said to myself for so many years that it's ""weird that I don't have PTSD"" but just shrugged it off as an ""eh, not everyone gets PTSD"". Just chalked everything up to anxiety and depression.

Very recently, I was able to admit and realize that my mom verbally and physically abused me as a child, and continued to verbally abuse me as an adult. I won't  bore you with the details although if you want you can read about it [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/10h8ohb/i_finally_realize_i_was_physically_abused/) She threatened to kill me many times in my childhood, and on a couple occasions almost went through with it. 

I feel...I feel pissed off at my therapist. She keeps cancelling appointments on me. She has cancelled every other appointment with me for the past three months now. Yes, I am going to get a new therapist - but it won't be for at least another month, because I'm in kind of an important spot with her right now (what with recently ""discovering"" the physical abuse).

My therapist said she's been suspecting I have PTSD for years, but never brought it up to me because she ""didn't want to overwhelm me"" or for me to ""feel worse from knowing"". Totally bullshit, btw. I think people have a right to know these things.

Rant over - I'm currently in need of help for what to do when I'm having an episode. The reason the PTSD was hard to recognize is because my PTSD rarely comes with memory flashbacks. It's usually me briefly (for 1 second) remembering something unpleasant, and then I feel ""antsy"".

My ""antsy"" feeling is something I hate - I have on several occasions driven to another state impulsively to try to escape the feeling. I did this most recently in January, even. I binge eat to try to escape. I'm trying to form better  habits, so recently my avoidance takes the form of exercise. 

I don't know how to ""sit through"" an episode. I don't know what to do. I'll do anything to make this stop. Is guided mindful meditation a way to ""sit through"" an episode? Doing that helps, but I'm not thinking about the things that upset me, so it feels like that's just another form of avoidance. I try to take hot showers to calm myself down, but I tell myself that's my time to ""relax"" and again I just continue to avoid and feel bad and avoid and feel bad.

I was diagnosed with PTSD almost 10 years ago. I learned some coping strategies based on mindfulness and went back to work.

Since then I have continued to practice mindfulness, meditation and studied a heap of philosophy to give myself as many tools as I can to deal with situations as they arise.

Lately I‚Äôve had a return of some of the issues. On reflection I realised that many memories still trigger extreme emotional reactions. Ordinarily if they come up I bring myself back to the present and focus on sensory inputs. Again this is coping. After using coping and/or avoidance for many years I‚Äôm curious if there is a more thorough way to treat ptsd.

I‚Äôm wondering if there are any strategies to deal directly with the trauma and work through it. Reframe it and live a full and happy life without concern for situations I may need to avoid or the risk of extreme reactions.

I‚Äôve been reading a lot about psylocibin and MDMA being used for this. But these treatment options aren‚Äôt currently available in my country. 

Does anyone have any recommendations for other methods that might work? Perhaps EMDR?

824,Is it normal for anxiety symptoms to come and go in waves?,17,116h3mz,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/116h3mz/is_it_normal_for_anxiety_symptoms_to_come_and_go/,4,"I‚Äôm 20 years old and started having anxiety about a year ago. Before that I never really had bad anxiety, but all of a sudden I started having panic attacks, derealisation and weird physical sensations. I first thought there was something physically wrong with my body, but after going to the hospital several times without finding anything out of the ordinary, the conclusion is that I have anxiety.

I had a messed up childhood and I‚Äôve experienced a lot of traumatic events. I have a lot of racing thoughts that I try to run away from. But my panic attacks usually don‚Äôt appear in correlation to these thoughts, in fact they most often appear out of the blue when I‚Äôm focused on something else. That‚Äôs why for a long time I thought there was something medically wrong with me. 

I‚Äôm a sensitive person, but I always try to distract myself from my feelings. Often, for example when I get flashbacks from traumatic events, it‚Äôs like I have feelings but I don‚Äôt really feel them if that makes sense. It‚Äôs like I didn‚Äôt experience the trauma and I feel sad and emphatic for someone else who experienced it, although it in fact happened to me.

During my panic attacks it‚Äôs different. I instead feel very scared and emotionally vulnerable. Usually I‚Äôll just stare blankly and try not to think about anything, because everything from noice to memories of traumatic events cause a lot of distress. I recently discovered that during my panic attacks, if I try to process my feelings or reflect over a traumatic event despite the extreme emotional stress and discomfort, I actually start feeling better after a few minutes. The anxiety symptoms ease and I become calmer.

Sry for mentioning stuff unrelated to the title. I‚Äôm currently feeling a bit anxious and thought sharing my experience would calm me down.

My question is - is it normal for anxiety symptoms to come and go? Weeks can go where I hardly feel any anxiety at all. Then there can be periods where I have several panick attacks a day. Is this normal? Can anyone relate to this, or anything else I‚Äôve written?",1676824269.0

My PTSD got so bad after being scammed by a person who took $10K pretending to be a licensed contractor, did demolition to my home and then ran off with the money when he was caught lying about his credentials, that I wasn't able to preform my job anymore.

&#x200B;

It was a tipping point to PTSD that has been stringing back for many years. I would just go to work and I couldn't think straight, or I would cry secretly or just hold it in and let the pain and tension run through my body. My Fitbit was even going in the yellow and red while I was sitting at my desk because of panic attacks.

&#x200B;

The police and state wont help me, I don't think they are taking me seriously because I'm in a state of panic, crying or screaming when I try to talk to them, they wont even allow my mother to be used as a mental health translator.

&#x200B;

I got a free attorney and he looked over the evidence and said this was without a doubt a crime and no judge would state otherwise. Even showing me the law that impersonating a contractor is a misdemeanor on the first offences.

&#x200B;

I'm to afraid to go to civil court because if the person was willing to lie and take so much money, and the cops and state wont help me, why would I feel safe going into a room with a person that works for the state and the person who lied to take money from me?

&#x200B;

I was told I can't get therapy by 4 different therapists, all turning me away saying I need intensive outpatient care because I'm in a PTSD episode, that my insurance can't seem to figure out how to cover, even if they did I wouldn't be able to afford to leave work 3 days a week for half days to get the treatment. Another reason I quit my job, to try to get on Medicaid so I can get treatment, since I can't balance work and mental health anymore anyways I might as well choose mental health now so I can help others later, instead of trying to balance something that I'm not able to.

&#x200B;

Without the police to help protect me, a therapist to help me process, I wake up every night with nightmares, I'm afraid to go grocery shopping, paranoid I will run into the person who took so much money from me, on the weekends and evenings, I try to repair the damages to my home. Normally I would meditate, and I try to, but I don't feel safe anywhere enough to shut my eyes and try to let go and get into these deep feelings.

&#x200B;

Ultimately I am stuck in a loop. I believe I should be protected. I believe I should be safe, I believe the cops should help me and doctors should be available, but these things aren't true. So then I feel attacked three or more times instead of just once. Once by the scam, again by the police, again by the state investigator, again by the insurance company.

&#x200B;

How does one let go of the idea that people should be here to protect us, so I can find the strength to let go of all of this?

&#x200B;

I'm trying to move to a monastery, to meditate for the next year and learn to let go of this fear and expectation, to hopefully find strength in my mind and compassion for those who lie and scam so I wont be afraid anymore.

&#x200B;

Does anyone have any advice? I know I can't be the only one with PTSD that feels abandoned and unsafe and has to learn to live with that.

It‚Äôs because im projecting on them, and seeing them as victims and me as their unknowing and negligent abuser, and so how could I enjoy my dominant side while actively feeling like I‚Äôm sexually assaulting someone even if  intellectually I know im not. 

I‚Äôm a switch and naturally flow into a submissive space, dominant space, and neutral. I knew that I was prone to reliving trauma when I was behaving and feeling more submissive. But until I had these discoveries, I enjoyed that. The best sex was sex in which I could re-engage with sexual dynamics from childhood. Trauma sex also felt the most like emotional bonding. The second most being sex in which my partner is making themselves so vulnerable to me that it‚Äôs surreal and I‚Äôm observing myself physically overpower, control, and please my partner on *my* terms and loving it. 

But I did not understand that when I am the dominant person or when I‚Äôm in that dominant head space, I‚Äôm prone to project my experience as a SA victim onto the person I‚Äôm with. It‚Äôs extremely hard to play a dominant role when I am deep down petrified that I just sexually assaulted my partner and that‚Äîlike me‚Äîthey aren‚Äôt strong enough to speak up for themselves and tell me how they feel. Knowing only intellectually that it‚Äôs probably not the case, I proceed with veiled caution and extreme discomfort.

I also discovered that when I sense I am being asked/told to ‚Äúperform‚Äù during sex, I get triggered and immediately feel like I don‚Äôt want to be doing this. But then I do it anyway, which in turn makes me feel like I‚Äôm reliving the sexual abuse from when I was asked or encouraged to perform by saying sexual things or doing sexual things in a way that contradicted how I feel about the situation. But in reality my sexual partner is just requesting that I smack their ass or telling me to get on all fours or asking me to tell them what I want to do to them.. but for me, I am suddenly no longer present and then when I go along with it, I feel like a total outsider to the pleasure of the sexual experience just like I felt when I was being molested. 

TLDR; The question is: While I work on it in therapy, what has worked for yall to help you ground yourself when you‚Äôre triggered during sex?

I (27F) am pretty f‚Äôd up about this right now. I knew it was bad but I didn‚Äôt know it was ‚Äúchild abuse‚Äù bad. 

My mother and I have had a rocky relationship my whole life. She had me at 18, had me live with my grandparents for the first 4 years of my life and then came back and I lived with her. She has a lot of trauma from her childhood, and she always kind of took that out on me. I also feel as though she resented me for ‚Äúruining‚Äù her life. 

I had a very strict household growing up, I was made to babysit, cook, clean and follow all rules all the time. I was an A student, no drugs alcohol or sex. Or any other behavioral problems (besides lying, I would lie to not get in trouble). 

I would get grounded constantly and locked in my room, not allowed to speak to my family because I was in trouble. For things like taking longer than a 5-10 minute shower, not closing my blinds at 8pm, eating things without asking, moving my speakers without asking (got grounded for nine months for that one). I got spanked with a wooden paddle until age 16. When I went to college, my mom cut my contact with my siblings and my stepdad, would check the phone records to see if they called or texted me.
 
I was rarely allowed to hang out with friends, only my neighbors if I wasn‚Äôt grounded. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to do extra curriculars because they were too expensive, they couldn‚Äôt give me rides to and from school, and I needed to babysit after school. I was very isolated all the time. Especially during adolescence. My parents had a separate pantry and fridge drawers for their food and we weren‚Äôt allowed to touch it. I can only remember my mother hugging me 4 times my whole childhood. She said ‚Äúphysical touch‚Äù made her uncomfortable. She told me she loved me maybe like twice I think. After my suicide attempts in front of a therapist. 

I was screamed at all the time when getting in trouble, once she slapped me across the face and made my nose bleed because I didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúyes ma‚Äôam‚Äù to her when she was screaming at me. Normally my stepdad would spank me when I got in trouble but she did it once because she was so mad and broke the wooden paddle on me. She was hitting me so hard I put my hands on my butt and she hit those too. I was blamed for my parents marital issues, I was told I was a bad kid. My mom had really terrible anger issues and I‚Äôm the only girl and the oldest, so I got most of the heat. She never asked me how I was doing or apologized or anything or comforted or supported me. I was able to do a play for school one time and she didn‚Äôt come because it made her uncomfortable ‚Äúwatching people try to act‚Äù.  I would get yelled at for asking for school supplies or to use the computer for assignments, she would tell me I need to ask for alternate assignments from my teachers that don‚Äôt require those things because ‚Äúwhat if we didn‚Äôt have a computer or money for a poster?‚Äù. 

The shit was horrible. I hated myself I hated her I hated my life I wanted to die 24/7. No one would miss me, they would all be happy without me. But I forgave her. I got older and I forgave her. And we have a good relationship now, we‚Äôre friends. I moved on and turned over a new leaf.

840,Need advice on dealing with triggers and holding grudges,8,115xgl6,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/115xgl6/need_advice_on_dealing_with_triggers_and_holding/,1,"I experienced a lot of abuse as a child as well as a lot of bullying, but in my early adult years I started healing and finding a real zest and joy for life, the ‚Äúgrudges‚Äù I had against my abusers were no longer there, I felt indifferent and I felt free. I loved exploring and socializing with new people. I was doing really well. Then the pandemic hit and all sorts of awful things happened. I gained 2 stalkers that year, one a man who threatened my friends with a gun, and the other a woman who was a former friend who was angry I told her she was acting like a bitch when she kept pushing at me. She spent over a year terrorizing me, making posts online about me with false accusations to garner sympathy and paint me as the villain, it was horrible, I‚Äôm young but I got shingles from the stress it caused me, no matter how many times I blocked her too, she would find my social media and go as far as to mock my dead relatives and health problems I have. 

That year as well I was in a bad relationship that involved heavy gaslighting and intense abuse of me. 

After all those things and more, I find myself no longer enjoying life. I stick to myself and dont let anyone close. A few times I‚Äôve been invited to work parties, and where I use to be the life of the party, I now sit in the corner and avoid talking. 

And worst of all I have a very hard time letting go. It consumes my thoughts every other moment. I‚Äôm so angry and hurt that I‚Äôve had my life ruined by liars and abusers and that people have believed them. That now I‚Äôm scared to get back into things I use to love doing because I don‚Äôt wanna bring any attention to myself. I use to do singing and acting. Now I just want to live in a hole and never come out. And it brings back the memories from childhood of the abuse at home and the bullying at school. 

I can handle a negative comment here or there but the fear of going through another smear campaign or ending up in another abusive situation terrifies me. 

I want to be me again. I want to go out fearlessly without these concerns. I want to let go of past hurts and not engage with people who are bent on misunderstanding me

My partner has had ptsd for all of her adult life, and has struggled with daily flashbacks/dissociation/ convulsions for even longer. Since we‚Äôve been together, she‚Äôs come out of denial and started processing her trauma, albeit slowly. 

Usually flashbacks/convulsions are the end of it, and she is able to gain consciousness, but sometimes (4 or 5 times in the last year) she‚Äôll come out of convulsions into a state of amnesia, where she thinks she is the age she was at the time of the assault. When this happens she doesn‚Äôt recognize me (except for having seen me in school) or any of her stuff (new clothing/ stuffed animals)

If I ask her what year it is or who the president is she gives answers corresponding to the year the assault happened. As far as she knows, the assault just happened and nobody else knows, it‚Äôs honestly a very surreal experience and I know it‚Äôs quite scary for her. 

I‚Äôm making this post to ask if anyone else has gone though something similar, if there is a way to explain this better to her therapist/psychiatrist, as they had no clue what I was talking about and didn‚Äôt provide any insight or resources, or even seem concerned.

This state always ends with her dissociating, convulsing for a few seconds, and then snapping awake into a panic.

Everyone on this reddit was very helpful last time I posted and I appreciate it immensely.

So, I began to open up with some people about what I assumed must've been some kind of amnesia or memory issue- something I'm pretty terrified about developing. 

I described it to my therapist and he said it must've been some kind of dissassociation and asked what I'd do to ground myself back down, but... I ground myself pretty fine. I feel like it's not a sense of feeling like things aren't real and more that I just don't remember my days at work anymore. 

For context, I had been SA'd when I was younger, in a 5 year toxic relationship, then just last October I had been struck by a vehicle. 
I've had a lot of wonderful change in my life since then- all good things! I've got great people and dreams and ambitions. 

But when I'm at work these days, I've begun to forget my day. I'll do my entire routine and then look up from my phone, like, ""oh I should start on my tasks"" only to realize it's been done without much memory of it. Sometimes I'm starting to ask myself if something happened or if maybe I'm remembering doing that thing yesterday, not today. As if I can't tell if im going through an old memory or recalling what happened just today. 

I'll have customers come in who know me, can recollect a whole thing I did with them, and I have barely a clue. Its... unsettling. 

I told a close best friend to me about it (I'm trying to not talk too much about it because I know it's not a fun subject to discuss with people) and they too said it sounded like disassociation but I'm not sure what kind. It's almost similar to the brain fog I had when I had covid two years ago.

I (M) requested a female therapist due to historical issues regarding men (which is the cause of my PTSD) and not wanting to be alone with a male, especially not touched. It was difficult (and embarrassing) enough to request a female¬†therapist at the Physio dept (NHS), as well as the time its taken for me to gain the confidence and ability to attend. I have particularly struggled the last few months with my psychiatrist introducing and altering medication. Its been hard work and very challenging, to say the least!¬†

Anyway, the therapist initially appeared nice enough. During the last session, I began by appoligising if I seemed 'out of sorts' and explained that I was being titrated on a new psych med and struggling to adjust.¬† Also, the lack of sleep etc wasn't helping. She seemed quite empathetic and understanding. Well, towards the end of the session she directed me into a posture, which I had to hold. After several seconds I started to tremble/shake. While i was holding the posture, I heared her laughing. The laughing lasted about 3-5 seconds. I asked her what she was laughing at and she said "" you, shaking"". When I asked, I noticed her eyes move from the door, just behind me, then resuming eye contact with me. I quickly glanced behind me to see what she was looking at, I believe I seen one of her colleagues walking away from the door. I said to her, in a jovial/joking manner that its ""not very professional"" of her to laugh at a client. To which she replied lightheartedly that she has a ""tendency to be unprofessional at times"". I replied, in a joking way that I'll have to ""report her unprofessional behavior"". I then left the session and walked to my car in a bit of a daze. It wasn't untill a few hours later, I thought about our interaction and I got quite upset and angry.

It has taken much for me to have the courage to attend such an appointment, where the likelihood of being touched by a stranger is very high. Putting myself in a vulnerable position, having explained briefly why I requested a female therapist and telling her I was struggling with a new medication regime and having sideffects (one of which is getting the shakes!)¬†

The last few days Ive been ruminating upon our interaction and I feel a number of different emotions, ranging from anger to guilt. Im not sure if it was just some 'banter' she was trying to have. Whatever it was, Ive come to the conclusion that it was highly inappropriate, even if it was not intended to offend.

I will not be going back to see her. It has put me off seeing another therapist if im honest. Im not sure if she was just having a joke or if she actually is that insensitive. However, it feels like I have been knocked back and the little confidence I had mustered up to go into such a situation has been thoughtlessly crushed.

Im not sure how to proceed as I don't want to get anyone in trouble, but I think she needs to be made aware. Do I contact her or her boss? I dunno, for some reason I feel like Im being dramatic and possibly making something out of nothing. I fluctuate from wanting to inform her boss to thinking 'fuck it', draw a line and just move on.

Thanks all, any advice would be appreciated:)",1676662017.0

Can side effects develop a year into treatment if I‚Äôm doing better with my trigger due to exposure therapy?,2,114tsgm,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/114tsgm/is_it_time_to_decrease_my_wellbutrin_dose_can/,2,"Wellbutrin for PTSD and exposure therapy.

TL;DR: 
   Is it time to decrease my Wellbutrin dose now that I have been exposed to my trigger a lot and am doing better in that setting?

Stats:
  43M, 205lbs, 5‚Äô6‚Äù, clean diet, CrossFit 3-4x week, occasionally drink (2-3 beers once a week; every couple of months I may go out and have an all nighter). No cigarettes. Occasional marijuana use when not working the next few days.

Rx: 
   100mg losartan SID pm, 20mg Famotidine BID (GERD), 450mg Buproprion SID am. Xyzol and multivitamin.

Long back story:    
    I worked as a nurse in a Pedi ICU. It is a level 1 center (Suicide, gun shots, motor vehicle, etc). I started my nursing career in this field and it was overwhelming and I developed anxiety issues due to it. I switched units 4 months into my career. The unit I went to was less critical. I was able to grow comfortably. The unit I was in was the only unit that could ‚Äúfloat‚Äù (substitute nurse for when the icu was short on nurses) to the icu. I was given much less critical patients and all was well. Once covid hit, everyone started floating to the icu much more often and we‚Äôre given much more critical patients; in some cases, a legitimate icu patient (intubated, sedation management, having to ambu bag ventilate when the patient crashes, etc.) I began floating once a week or twice. It flared up the anxiety I was having to the point of feeling the adrenaline dump the night before going to work. I spoke with a psychologist who recommended l-tyrosine and Wellbutrin. My PCP wrote the script for Wellbutrin. I tapered up from 150mg to 300mg in 2 weeks. Then a month later went to 450mg. 450mg worked well for the past 18 months. I eventually decided to transfer back to the icu officially. I had 2 months of training and have been on my own for 3 months. Now I am starting to notice odd feelings. Most often nausea and disinterest in food (not daily, 1-2 times a week), a heightened sense of awareness but oddly coupled with a disconnect from my surroundings. I will feel pressure behind my eyes as if my BP is elevated, but I am commonly within my accepted parameters after checking my BP. *edit: also, I am experiencing blurry vision after waking. 

The question is: 
   Is it possible that now that I have been exposed to my trigger so much, and am doing much better in that setting, that my body no longer needs the added dopamine and norepi that Wellbutrin has been keeping elevated? Perhaps I should cut back to 300mg and reassess in 1-2 months. 

Thank you-
Edit: additional side effects.",1676658291.0

I was recently officially diagnosed with PTSD after an incident that happened in July 2022 where my best friend attempted suicide using my firearm in my home. I was the only one home and heard it but didn‚Äôt want to believe it was a gunshot (I was in the military and am very familiar with the sound of gunfire because of it). I managed to convince myself it wasn‚Äôt that but still needed to check on him. He and I were the only ones at my house and I opened my bedroom door to find him standing there trying to get the door open by some miracle after a gsw to the head. I caught him and dragged him outside my house to perform triage and call EMS. He‚Äôs alive and doing a lot better now, really I think we all (he and I + our wives) are doing better but we still have moments where we struggle. Now that you have the context, on to the point: I‚Äôve been seeking help and been seeing a psychiatrist since the start of the year and he officially diagnosed me with ptsd and two days ago prescribed me Zoloft in a pretty low dose to get me started on it. I‚Äôve never taken an SSRI before and am honestly nervous, I know it‚Äôs supposed to help with the panic attacks, anxiety, etc‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs either my pride or nerves talking but I wonder if I truly need it. Most days I feel very neutral, neither happy or sad, or am just not vibing where I feeling anxious all day, remembering the way my house looked that day and being on edge. I still experience happiness but on the days where I feel neutral I kind of gaslight myself into thinking it‚Äôs not that bad. Logically on those days I still know I struggle and know I‚Äôm not in the clear and frankly might not ever be fully. But when that happens I question if I should take it and get nervous of side effects, if it‚Äôll cause neurological damage etc‚Ä¶ has anyone else here ever had similar feelings/worries their first time going on SSRIs? Is there anything I should be looking out for? 

TLDR: I was recently diagnosed with PTSD after friend attempted suicide in my home and I was the one who found him and called Ems. I was prescribed Zoloft two days ago and am nervous about taking it.

I‚Äôm also a military veteran, but as I didn‚Äôt see combat, my EMS trauma is far worse than any traumatic experience I had in the Army. I‚Äôve also got the trauma of being a DV survivor and the trauma of working in a prison (which I don‚Äôt do anymore).

So, I invite you all to explore the catch-22 with me. Imagine my brain is the bed of a pickup truck. I have a truck load of manure in the bed of it, representing my trauma from various sources, and I just haul it around. Every so often I go see my therapist and, in addition to working on my other issues, we climb up in the bed of the pickup truck and use a garden spade to shovel some of the manure out of the bed of the truck, thereby making it easier to drive through life. Sometimes we get more out than other times, but that‚Äôs okay; we know we won‚Äôt get it all out but as time goes on it‚Äôll be more like dirt than manure. Sounds great, but one problem: as I go about my day at work, we make these pit stops and some manure gets loaded into the bed of the pickup truck on some of the stops. 

Sometimes it‚Äôs a small amount, like the old dude‚Äôs 10 fingertips when he froze them in the blizzard around Christmas. That was maybe like a soda can worth of manure. The memory is there, but I remember the cold more than I remember the case.

Sometimes it‚Äôs as though a front end loader just came up and dumped a whole bunch of manure in the bed of the truck. Such as yesterday, when someone hit a semi and then died in front of us after we loaded him onto the ambulance but before we had the chance to take off for the hospital, and we took him anyway because it was a witnessed cardiac arrest. The lack of detail given should give you an idea‚Äîit‚Äôs bad enough that I won‚Äôt elaborate in a public setting, even with that fucked up sense of humor we medics are known for. Use your imagination; your mental image is probably not far off from the reality.

It eventually culminated in a nervous breakdown that I don't remember a lot about. What I *do* remember is I couldn't sleep, no matter how hard I tried, for almost a week. I was mind-numbingly, miserably exhausted but anxiety and maybe alcohol withdrawal kept me awake. I was trying to sleep on trains, on train station benches, in the university chapel lounge, anywhere, all to no avail. 

In the end, I had to go home, and after an emergency doctor appointment, was prescribed diazepam, which eventually did put me to sleep, and citalopram. I was on diazepam thrice a day for two weeks until the citalopram started to work. I don't remember much of it. Slowly I got my life back together.

Except, ever since then, I've had a debilitating, overwhelming terror of not being able to sleep. The slightest hint of a rough night and I have a total meltdown. I punch walls, destroy things, scream and cry, and I panic until I can get some good sleep. Even if I *do* sleep, the barest sensation of tiredness and I panic entirely. I'm right back there in 2008, feeling like death.

This terror has held me back for years, stopped me travelling, stopped me working, and worst of all, ruined a relationship. She didn't understand even though I explained in detail, and would deliberately wake me up early 'for cuddles' or to look at sunrises, and then when I would get upset and cry, be angry at me and say she just wanted 'someone normal.' In the end, my sleep fear lead to depression and the relationship failed because, quote 'she just felt like a carer.'

Recently, I got a private therapist, and she explained I have PTSD from the sleep deprivation experience/breakdown. And I feel like an idiot and a fraud. Soldiers are out here with PTSD from seriously messed up experiences, victims of severe and terrible crimes and accidents, and I have PTSD from... being tired?

a bit after i get back into town, they text me saying hello and call me and i feel my blood run cold. i didn't respond, so they call my mom, who spoke to my friend from time to time. they asked if they could move in for the time being, as they (legally) could not go back to their residence, nor could they contact their partner. i was barely stable after a summer of switching medications, my mom was working, and the other members of my family were uncomfortable with the idea. it was at this time we got more background on my friend's arrest, them telling my mom about why they did it (as self defense after being victimised the entire time they were together) and that they had been admitted to the hospital.  they ended up staying with someone else.

since then, whenever they've texted me, i feel my stomach drop. i almost always anticipate something bad. we don't talk much anymore, and i feel almost... grateful. a year ago, they were one of my closest friends. and now the thought of seeing them is enough to make my stomach feel off and my skin feel itchy. 

since this happened, they moved back home. about a month later, i find out from the aforementioned mutual friend that they got back together with their boyfriend. the one they weren't supposed to contact. i remember spending hours seething about this. i'm not supposed to know they're back together. they still have not told me and it's been around four months. whenever they are asked about this, they lie and beat around the bush. that one friend is the only one who gets a straight answer.

hearing from them sends me into panic. it's the one reason i'm happy we rarely speak these days.

they weren't a saint either. they were messy. they had impulse control problems and anger issues and probably had a drinking problem. but they were my friend who listened to me and dealt with my bullshit. i get why they didn't tell me after i didn't respond to them when they were in the hospital. it still sucks.

i'm not sure why it rubs me the wrong way that they got back together with their abusive ex so much. it's statistically likely that they were going to. maybe it's a logical fallacy, one there's probably a word for. maybe it reminds me of my own bad decisions too much.

i would write a better tldr than the one i put for the title but even that doesn't do it justice in my opinion. hearing from them today put me on edge for hours and i needed to just let it out.",1676616545.0

I feel lost. I live in a regional city & I just can‚Äôt help but feel that there‚Äôs nothing here for me. I have a friendship group, I‚Äôm on good money, I live a five minute drive to the water. But still, I feel miserable. 

I went back to Sydney for a week and ended up really missing the place. The anonymity. The fact you can meet people in a heart beat. The liveliness of it all. It‚Äôs overwhelming , but my town is underwhelming.  


I‚Äôm seriously debating moving but I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm just caught in a trauma induced depression and that making a decision like this could be not worth my while. So I‚Äôm waiting before I go ahead and put job applications in‚Ä¶ I mean I‚Äôm gonna start working on the applications anyway in the meantime because it makes me feel something but I‚Äôm still trying to see if this feeling passes. 

I don‚Äôt know if things will change because I‚Äôve truthfully felt mostly lonely anywhere I go.  Hell I went to Phuket for two weeks and travelled by myself. That was my choice though (escaped a Contiki). 

Two weeks ago I had to flee my town because my ex was harassing me and the month before that I was SA by a date. 

So . It‚Äôs really hard to separate the two experiences.  

I feel I would get a lot more career experience in Sydney but I understand saving can be harder and I‚Äôve been trying to buy a house for a while now but slowly giving up because interest rates just keep rising it‚Äôs almost like what‚Äôs the point ? 

I guess‚Ä¶. I don‚Äôt know wtf I‚Äôm really looking for here. Just a space to talk and if someone resonates with traumatic experiences = shake up of identity and environment feelings",1676613757.0

It doesn't. Having PTSD is soul-crushing and debilitating in so many ways. For a lot of people it can completely ruin their life and relationships.

I keep seeing people say they have ""flashbacks"" to their childhood or other times in their life and they're just talking about normal memories, like just remembering something casually.
I don't know when using mental illness as a joke took off either. ""Lmao it's giving me PTSD"" said over something trivial. If I'm managing to have a somewhat normal day it instantly reminds me of everything and I feel like I fall through the floor.

""Haha that's schizo behaviour."" What the fuck. Since when was it okay to use a serious mental illness as a derogatory term?? I don't have schizophrenia but knowing the effects of one mental illness and the effect of using PTSD in the same joking way, I can imagine how that feels for people who do. It's so weird. And I keep seeing people use it who are meant to be ""understanding and accepting"", and people like streamers with huge audiences using it, letting their followers know it's okay to do that. I don't understand where using ""schizo"" has come from but I wish it would stop already.

I hate too the fact that ""triggered"" has become a joke. It got overused to hell and back for jokes and now if I ever work up the courage to tell someone I'm acting the way I am because I got triggered by something, I feel like I can't even say it without sounding like a complete moron.

I don't understand why mental illness is used as a joke. I hate going about my life and for once having a day where I've been awake a few hours and managed not to think about it, and then some asshole makes a joke about PTSD or getting triggered or flashbacks and I'm reminded that it all happened. I'm so sick of it.

TW: Inc_st

While I'm on here, why the fuck is that such a ""funny"", commonly used joke. I hadn't thought about it until memories started unrepressing and then I realised how often that shit is used as a haha funny joke. I genuinely struggle to think of a day or week that's passed by when someone hasn't brought it up or made a joke, nevermind how much it's used in media as some sort of shock factor or way to make a character seem more villainous and dastardly. Instantly takes me back and I want to throw up, starts off a panic attack. Why can't people just be normal. Like genuinely it is so easy to just be a normal human being and not make jokes about fucked up shit that is real and effects people. Sorry for the rant but yeah it's been really getting to me recently. It goes from feeling fucked up by it to just feeling angry about it, like can we please go one day without someone bringing up traumatic shit because they've never experienced it and somehow find it funny. Think before you say things. It's really not hard.",1676520573.0
895,"Some people will just be angry at you for your trauma, not angry for you.",2,11410rd,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11410rd/some_people_will_just_be_angry_at_you_for_your/,6,"I‚Äôve been having such a hard time with always needing to search for people to be angry with me and for me, over what happened to me. The assault itself, and the way I was really abhorrently treated by the police and medical staff following the assault when I reported, gaslighting me, laughing at me, manipulating my victim statement about the assault (to say i consented to the s-x) just so the officer didn‚Äôt have to do any extra work. It‚Äôs been 1.5 years and still, I feel so much need to see people being angry with me and for me (against the people that hurt me during the traumatic event and immediately after that). It seems like I just need the external validation, a large group of people telling me ‚Äúyes, you **should** be angry, what they did was incredibly fucked up and not right, you deserved better‚Äù, because I can internally validate the same for myself. 

Yet many times I‚Äôve shared my story online, particularly in local online communities, and I get a huge majority of extremely vile and cruel comments. People that know my story and yet are getting angry with me for sharing, for experiencing it, for being angry with it happening, for making up stories about it because to them, it can‚Äôt be true and I must be lying, for seeking sympathy and attention, for being ‚Äúfucking weak‚Äù and not doing enough with my case now to help other people in the future, for being a wh-re, for being upset even when I ‚Äúdeserved‚Äù to be r-ped, for being the kind of woman that people should hate, for somehow being a victim that to them, deserves not one bit of sympathy. Even for supposedly having mental disorders (that I do not have, but they insist I do) that is causing me to make up stories for sympathy to feed my fractured psyche.

It‚Äôs fucking hard to see those comments, and to know that they are being angry and cruel to me, the victim, rather than the people who they should help me be angry and say cruel things at.

I‚Äôve been struggling with the comments these past few days because they were the worst I ever experienced. 90% of the comments were like this towards me, 6% was me defending myself, and 4% were the nice and empathetic ones that felt my pain. I kept thinking what was wrong with me, why I deserved it, what did I do wrong, why am i public enemy number 1 here, and why the fuck was I being so affected by it. 

It literally only just dawned on me that as much as I want everyone to be angry for me and with me, and for and with people like me / us, there are just some cruel people out there that will just be angry at us for no imaginable reason. And I should stop letting these people invalidate the validity of my anger, dictate the person that I am, or infect the way that I feel, and I should focus on the people that DO feel angry with me and for me. They are the ones that matter. I am the one that matters too, because I am the one who lived through that trauma.

I am still learning, and it‚Äôs going to take a fuckton of time, but at least knowing this now is better than letting the people that are unreasonably angry at me over being victimised, consume all of me and cast opaque shadows over the tiny bits of light I have in my life.",1676581392.0
896,Friendships are hard,4,113wgzf,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/113wgzf/friendships_are_hard/,1,"While I was going through my abuse many people that wanted to be my friends couldn't.... either because my parents didn't like them or their parents didn't want them around a family like mine. I'll admit I made some bad choices becoming friends with some... unsavory characters because they were the ones that stuck around, their parents didn't care who they hung out with, or later on they stuck around because they could use me (junkies). I just didn't want to be alone. As a young adult I felt I wasn't worth anyone's time and practically tried to buy friends. It was sad and pathetic. I'll admit I did have some good friends but we either grew apart, or they died....

One good friend who did try to help me over the years would pop in and out of my life depending on what she was going through. Recently she told me that I was a bad friend and that it's always been about me. I pointed out to her that I tried to help her when she was in an abusive relationship and she just pushed me away until she dealt with it herself. I admitted to not being the best and most attentive friends throughout couch surfing and dealing with my own issues and apologized. She told me I always chose the bad friends over her which wasn't true. She chose not to stick around. 
She didn't even come to our friend's funeral....
We knew him since 6yrs old. 

I've grown a lot over the years and while I don't like feeling alone I'd rather be alone than surrounded by bad friends or fair-weather friends. I don't want to be anti-social but I'm still struggling with my trauma, I'm trying to raise my son, and I'm dealing with current issues. I don't want to be anyone's burden. I don't want to make people feel like it's their responsibility to help me with my trauma, but I also don't want a friend who is unsupportive. 
Maybe I'm just tired of ppl saying ""I'm here for you"" out of just being nice but they don't really mean it.
Bad enough cps, social services, cops, family, and others failed me growing up.

I think I'm lucky to be doing half as well as I am considering what I've been through!
I didn't even become a drug addict after living in multiple drug-dens!

I just wanted to ask if anyone else here has had a tough time verbalizing what they are thinking or feeling? If so, how do you overcome or compensate for that in therapy? 

I usually know the issues/things I need to address in my head but I‚Äôm having a really tough time saying it to anyone without rambling, completely going off topic, or forgetting what I wanted to say. Even now typing this, I thought I had a fully formed paragraph already in my head but nothing is coming out the way I want/thought it would. My therapist suggested to text them when thoughts come up but I don‚Äôt know how to type it out cause it just keeps disappearing or becoming blurry. 

This applies to feelings too. I am better at communicating the facts of the situation (even though I forget about what happened all the time too), but every time my T asked about how I felt or what emotions came up during the discussion my mind just turns blank. T would suggest some examples of how people would feel during those times and that does help me verbalize mine as they usually resonate with mine, but I am worried that I‚Äôm not expressing myself accurately or even minimizing the effect these issues have on me. 

I heard that it could be dissociation but the world doesn‚Äôt look fake to me; it doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm watching from a third perspective; it also doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm watching a movie when the troubles with expressions happen.

They don't listen and buy me what they want anyway. (That's its own issue with boundaries.) I know they are going to do big things for the day, and that is not what I want!

If I say to them that I don't want to celebrate because it's a bad day for me, they will pester me to find out why, and I'm not ready to share with them what happened. I worry I am either going to blow up or burst into tears, and then they will want to know what's wrong.

My partner is doing his best to field birthday stuff for me, but people are going to want to celebrate, and that just feels so disrespectful of my wishes. I don't know how to get through to people that I do NOT WANT TO CELEBRATE. Plus I'm going to get all those stupid emails from like Spotify and Facebook and all that crap. UGH.

I also am just really sad that this is how I feel about my birthday. I would like to celebrate my birthday, but I am not ready. This has also just been a really stressful week, and I do not need to end it with big birthday nonsense that I don't want and have specifically asked to not happen. Even writing this makes me want to cry and jump out the window. Any advice? Help? Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è",1676473385.0

I relapsed again wt (marijuana) ive only managed to stay clean for about 3 weeks in the last few months. ive smoked for around 7 years off and on. It makes me feel a variety of negative emotions. 

 I smoke to fill the emptiness or absense of emotion. because I feel emotionally withdrawn from myself.. the more I smoke.

I just want to get better.  But I dont know where to start, or where to look for ... 

And Im always judging my thoughts. sometimes to the point where I would become an observer of my own body, words, and actions. I smoke because I wanted to feel emotions again.

 but it started to become more and more compelling. And it gets harder everytime I pick it back up.  My mom treats it like its not a serious addiction, or pretends like Its not possible to get addicted to marijuana..

 and it really makes me question wether my emotions are really valid and sometimes I think to myself ""does she even want to hear what I have to say.""

Im lost, I dont really know what I want wt my life, and I feel like its killing my self-esteem. it makes me feel vulnerable. sometimes I think ""Maybe its to late for me.""

So I had to adjust to these heightened emotions by building a wall (defense mechanism) now I struggle with inner conflicts between my ego and myself. Questioning my every antic/ bizare thought. 

sometimes I feel like ive lost my sense of belonging in this world. I just feel like theres no point in trying in something that wont matter a few years from now.

my thoughts are very convincing sometimes like ""I am my father"", or I think about all the possible ways people could be judging me, and im also pretty convinced I dont feel emotions. I know its not the case but thoughts can be pretty convincing its like repeated affirmation just the bad kind. I use to think of it as manifesting the wrong message.

I always think entirely less of myself when I smoke I refer to this as being the opposite of kind to myself. I let fear run my life, I blame my faults and insecurities, And sometimes I feel like theres no help for me, or I lose control of my thoughts as there happening.

Im just looking for any reasources, help of any kind, advice, ext. Im ussually in a somehwat stable state of mind since yk I had to adjust, And I would go back and correct any errors or points taken to far, ext, but I lack an emotional filter.

But I'm practically scared to move out because I don't want to offend my landlord (we've grown really close over the months that I've been living here). I left a (very) toxic environment that my parents created. I rent a room from a woman that I recently met and we hit it off great. We both have bipolar disorder and it's helped us to understand each other in some ways. She tells me that I'm welcome to leave at any time but she's glad that I'm living here because she gets lonely pretty easily. And that we have a special bond. Knowing this makes me feel guilty and like I should stay.

 I have a lot of sympathy for her since she's a single mother that's stuck in an ""on again, off again "" toxic relationship. Sometimes I wake up to her and her partner fighting or I'll hear shouting and slamming and it gives me so much anxiety. It makes me feel like I'm living with my parents again. Last night, I applied for my own apartment (it helps with vouchers and stuff as well) and I felt really bad and actually scared that she'd find out. Despite her being a kind person, she yells a lot when angry, and yelling triggers my PTSD and dissociation to kick in..It sucks because I was so happy when I moved in and a part of me wants things to work out. But I'm way too anxious in my new environment.

 I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells and that's a feeling that I grew up with. Everyday I worry that she may not be in the best mood and I have to pick and choose when to talk to her (in fear of being fussed at). When she's happy, things are great! When she's stressed I steer clear. 
She lets too much stress build up and then she lashes out. She was having issues with her family and her relationship and she lashed out at me. I left home for two weeks (I visited my family) and then she apologized and talked me out of moving out..I feel stuck because I feel like I only have two options. Stay here or go back to my toxic family.

This is not what I have PTSD from, I just felt more comfortable posting in this community because that‚Äôs where I generally do (and its related to trauma responses). But anyways, so I struggled with bulimia for like 6 years. Thankfully, I‚Äôve been in recovery for a year now (my longest stretch yet!) so that‚Äôs good. But I remember when I was actively purging, my heart would beat irregularly, at one point my hair was falling out and I‚Äôd feel lightheaded. 

The last time I relapsed I had intentionally purged in the morning. Later that day, I threw up again but not out of a desire to get rid of excess calories, but just because I felt nauseous. In the evening, I started to look pale and feel sick. My mom told me to lay down, and as I was turning the corner I fainted and hit my head on the doorframe on the way down. I‚Äôd never fainted before so I hadn‚Äôt been expecting it at all. I came to a few seconds later and I literally never felt so close to dying. I literally thought I was because bulimia (coupled with whatever sickness I had) was finally doing me in.

Obviously, I‚Äôm fine now.

I also always feel so dead after work. I think it's the like hypervigilance and having a mentally demanding job. I just, idk since my latest truama feel like it doesn't take much to drain me.

When I got home I actually felt like I had the energy to either cook a full fancy meal or play some video games. Lately I feel so drained after work even video games sounds like a chore. 

So I texted my friend if I should play video games and microwave some food or cook a fancy meal and watch TV. He said ""cook some food cause you have been bad lately"". I know logically he didn't mean it like this but the way it made me feel was that I havnt been putting in effort in making sure I eat and that I havnt been trying enough to be better.

I had 1hr of feeling like I had my shit together. For once I felt like I could do something to enjoy it and not feel like a chore. I just broke down. My appetite was gone. I started to dissociate. Eventually I got myself to be like ""fuck him imma play video games""

When it first happened, the street was lined back to back with reporters every day when I walked out of school and some of them even legitimately chased my friend when she was crying and ran away because she didn‚Äôt want to be recorded. I had a fear anytime I saw a news crew anywhere (and often even if there wasn‚Äôt one) that they‚Äôd find me somehow, find out what I‚Äôd been through and start harassing me. I know they have more than enough footage after the years and thousands of cameras, so I don‚Äôt get why they need to harass us. The one place I can pay my respects, and it‚Äôs not even safe or private. The whole world has to see me when I CLEARLY don‚Äôt want them to. I was going to ask the guy scooting to get a better angle to delete it, but I know so many others were recording me, and will probably use it, on top of the being immediately asked to comment after I was literally turning from the cameras, and I was just too defeated. I couldn‚Äôt even tell them no I just shook my head over and over for what felt like several full seconds. The crossing guard who was there every day of every year told them ‚Äúsome people don‚Äôt want to share‚Äù and I feel so thankful for her always being there for me, even after I‚Äôve graduated from the school. 

Now that we aren‚Äôt in the blurb everyone can see without clicking on the post I‚Äôll share the event was a shooting. So on top of what I just described, today I find out that a survivor of a shooting was just involved in a second one. Let me tell you when I survived the Douglas shooting, my only solace that kept me going was that it was so rare it‚Äôd never happen to me again. I couldn‚Äôt change politics so it‚Äôd never happen to anyone again, but at least it‚Äôs never happen to me or any of the people I had been through it with again. Even though I logically knew that, it didn‚Äôt stop the nightmares. Every single time I had a nightmare about being in another shooting, the only thought in my mind every time was ‚Äúhow could this happen again‚Äù. This is literately my worst nightmare. I was able to rationalize before that it had never happened to anybody twice, but now‚Ä¶ now I don‚Äôt even have that. And of all days to find out, I had to find out on the anniversary. I feel so angry at the world at the same time so helpless, and now the little sense of safety I had gathered up over the years is now destroyed by both the reporters, and the fact it‚Äôs starting to happen a second time to others like me. I was already on mental health leave from my college for almost a year at this point, and now, I feel like any progress I made with relation to what happened to me has just been destroyed.",1676395558.0

I am proud to say I have the most patient and kind partner, but during our relationship I have started to be more and more hard on myself and isolated myself from the world. 


My childhood wasn't great. 
(trigger warning) 

I was verbally abused every day and psysically abused on some occations by my mother as my parents got a divorce. At 5 years old I was also sexually abused by another family member. As I turned 12 my mother developed addictions and I watched her go to jail to then have my bullying teacher tell my whole class about it. My mother was in jail for a short time and when she manipulated me into thinking the therapist I went to was a pedophile in fear she would recieve consequences. 

As time went by they found my mother beaten under a bridge, which made me terrified of not watching over her the coming years when she went out partying and my dad started to tell me i was ungrateful for not chosing to stay at his place during his time. I was terrified of something happening to my mom. My dad until this day compares my story to other people's pain and is distancing himself.

At 18 I could not take it anymore and I started to drink with my mother to cope. Her brother gave me something he said was allergy medicine to ""help with my hangover"" which later proved at hospital to be something else for severe back pain. I OD'd many times and finally went to rehab and have now been sober for 6 years after cutting contact with them. My grandma which was the only one I trusted fell on the floor and died in front of me and I had no one to visit as I finally got my own place.

In rehab I met kind young people my age that believed in me and motivated me to stay sober during a period of 9 months. They all died during my first year on my own.

Today I am very fatigued and I cry a lot.  My boyfriend is so caring and helped me move to another city. Some days I really question my own decitions and I'm terrified in this new city with no family or friends to lean on. I feel ungrateful for being sad when he does his best. Any advice?",1676425624.0

I normally dont really post stuff like this online but i feel like i need some assurance & advice from people who have been here before. 

In my country the demand for mental health help has been extremely high (lets be honest where isn't it at the moment) therefore i am in talking therapy with the clinics psychologist, this is someone who isn't a full psychologist but has the degree beneath that if that makes sense. It gets covered by my ensurance and has no waitlist so i figured id start there.

After what litterally felt like hitting a wall in my life i finally decided to seek help, i did once before but it was a terrible experience as the therapist didn't listen to me and forgot to cancel my appointment when she was on holidays. 

Ever since starting the talking therapy in November last year, i've noticed that after every session i feel overstimulated and relieved at the same time? I normally go lay in bed or on the couch and do nothing that day. But these few months i've noticed that i am so much more aware of all the things that happened to me, i feel sad, and for the first time in my life i'm actually allowing myself to feel like a victim of what other people did to me. This just gives me periods of depression, and feeling defeated. I tried to make this clear but he still thinks that talking therapy is the kind of therapy i need.. while i feel like i need something 'more' because of these reactions ive been having. 

Is he right? Or should i keep asking him to send me to a real therapist. The waitlist for EMDR is 12 months in my country he said, but i am more than willing to wait. I feels to me like he's trying to keep me here so the list doesn't get longer..",1676382833.0

One of these triggers lately is abnormal changes to my husbands sleeping habits, causing me to not be able to sleep for fear that I will miss warning signs and he will pass in his sleep. I have to stay awake to monitor breathing, body temp, changes in skin tone, etc. it is clearly unhealthy and I don‚Äôt want to live in fear all the time.

But of course google threw in a bit about early heart attack warning signs. Now here comes the ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù all night. I just want to sleep.


Edit: honestly googling symptoms is irrelevant to my anxieties, and in rare cases has calmed them, so please don‚Äôt suggest that.

I straight up told her I'm not looking for that in my life right now and to back off a little. She has continued to text me all the time. She has sent me uncomfortable messages. She offers to get me things all the time. She follows me around campus and is derailing my support system I have on campus because of everything she's doing. She seems oblivious to her own actions because she's blind by her crush and lust. I would've been friends with her but she's taken it too far and it's hurting my performance in class and I don't know what else to do. I said in clear terms that I wasn't interested. I've been ignoring her texts and friend request on Facebook. I am avoiding the place where you can go to get help from instructors on campus because she waits for me there now. She said she goes there all the time and she's surprised she has seen me there before. I've been there pretty much everyday since I started my college journey. She lied, I have never once seen her there, and it's not like it's some big room, it's a support center at a community college. Because I haven't been going there, I haven't seen my friends or talked to them much lately. I am a recovering addict and it took me a long time to get the courage to put myself out there socially again. My friends were kind of a testament to my recovery, not to mention I didn't feel that alone anymore. I would've been fine being friends with this girl but she's not doing what people do to become friends. She's forcing it too much and I can tell she is still trying to get us to become more than friends. I also have PTSD and part of that has been from being gaslighted (well more than that, she lived a literal double life) in previous relationships and being lied to. She has triggered so many stressful and terrifying feelings and I don't know how to deal with it anymore. I am in therapy working on it and I'm not I'ma place to confront her about anything. I can barely talk to my therapist about it. I was on track to getting all A's this semester and she's single handedly ruining my chances of that.

I get psychiatric help as a foster youth. When it started my psych already knew I was abused by my bio father and my sister died. Over time I admitted to some other things that were happening. My bio father would often let men pay to spend time with me and my sister, or even invite men over for parties where we were there to entertain the men. We were also used in CP.

My psych told me he's diagnosing me with HPD. He said he doesn't usually diagnose PDs so young but he thinks it's obvious with me. He says it's because I lie in every session. He thinks it's true that my bio father abused me but that I started to add on other stories because I was scared I would lose his attention if my trauma wasn't extreme.

But everything I told him is 100% true. The only reason I didn't say that stuff to start with is my bio father used to threaten things would happen if I told anyone, so I was scared and all I admitted to was what he already knew about. But then I got more comfortable and felt safer because I started to really realize my bio father can't get me anymore.

I even admitted to the crazy behavior which is also a symptom of HPD. So why would I admit to the crazy behavior which would be even worse than lying but then not admit if I was lying? I've always told the truth and been honest about even the bad parts of myself and he thinks I'm just hiding this one thing. And then he based a whole diagnosis on me being a liar, because crazy behavior isn't enough for a HPD diagnosis.

So then today I talked to my caseworker and asked for a different psych. She said I can't switch psychs just because I don't like the diagnosis he gave me. She fully believes I have HPD and I'm just a crazy attention seeking liar. And so I have to get treatment for a disorder I don't even have because no one believes me about how much abuse I actually went through, just because I didn't tell anyone about it right away.",1676335146.0

I posted more topics regarding this subject but I kinda need advice.   
So i saw my male therapist for the first time today.   
I wasn't looking forward because despite having asked for a female therapist i got a male therapist but i also see the upsides to it.  
The problem is that i'm having trouble being vulnerable with a male therapist because of SA as a child by a male. My head is telling me i'm not safe being vulnerable with a man. He is going to attack me and hurt me. I had lots of therapy but always by a female therapist and I know that maybe i'm at a point that it would be good to see the perspective of a male therapist but it scares the HECK out of me. 

So when I did my intake i got my advice on treatment and they said that i would get schematherapy and we would talk mostly about the here and now and dont' need to go back in my childhood. So that kinda gave my hope. But i also knew that in schematherapy you are going to talk about how schema's developed and so you have to go back into your childhood (in my case). And today was the first appointment and he said he struggled because he knew that having a male therapist is hard for me but especially when we have to talk about the past. But he also said that maybe it was important to do so. We let it go because i got close to dissociation thinking about having to open up to him. And it was only our first meeting. 

But today i thought about it a lot and i'm afraid it will stand in the way of having a good relationship with him and it will be the elephant in the room when we won't talk about it. Also, as I mentioned. I am very aware that it maybe would be a good idea to hear from a male about this. I acknowledge it can also be healing if done correctly. So tonight I was brave and send him an email that i decided to talk about my past with him and that I might be to afraid to say that in person next week so that's why i send him that email. And i am so so so scared. I don't even know how to deal with myself right now. 

I really would like to trust men. I hate that my ptsdbrain thinks it is logical to be afraid of men while talking about my history with SA. He is not my assaulter, he is a therapist and wants to help me. He is not a wrong person. But still i am freaking scared he is going to hurt me. Not only that but my assaulter told me that if I talked about my experience with anyone, that person would get hurt and die. And i am a grown up now. I know that is not going to happen (because of me telling them). But my god. My brain is giving me such a hard time right now.",1676318315.0

I self sabotaged yesterday. My mom had been constantly triggering my religious trauma. I was getting emotional flashbacks. I told her repeatedly that she is triggering me and she refused to step back and continued arguing with me. Something in me snapped and I physically attacked her by gripping onto her shoulders real tight with my nails. She pushed me off. We both fought each other. Left scratches and nail marks. It could have been a normal quiet weekend. But for some reason I enjoyed fighting her in that moment. I was even frustrated she didn‚Äôt hit back harder. I wanted her to hurt me more. I wanted her to give me a black eye or something. I was angrier she wasn‚Äôt fighting back as hard as I want her to. It broke my heart to see her cry afterwards. It broke my heart to hear her sob. 

I‚Äôve had other occasions where I created problems for myself for no reason. I was in a mental hospital and I fought with their transportation service driver and ended up getting blacklisted (fuck you Avalon, no one needs your rides anyway) and had to call someone else to pick me up in the middle of a blizzard. I was red zoned in that mental hospital then and ripped up whatever worksheets they gave me on impulse control and fought with the staff and never came back.

I got accepted into university in august, a natural science base year and had to move 2/3h away from friends, family and the city i grew up in. It was something i thought i could do, i was so excited for it to start and for me to learn (I really wanted this so i could apply to astronomy and astrophysics, my childhood dream). Even though I am bad at math I really really wanted this to work and i thought it would. I got my parents to spend money on education books and much more. 

Now I regret putting myself in this position. I wish I could drop out. I have missed several months of education, and I lie and pretend I am doing great to family that asks because I‚Äôd let them down. I have failed my exams and missed labs, I have given up on my education and honestly i don‚Äôt think i am fit to continue studying with my mental. If i don‚Äôt take action now, I will fail this year, I will have wasted this year. I am so ashamed about this, and it‚Äôs something I could never tell my family or friends about. I couldn‚Äôt decide exactly what I really wanted to do, nothing seemed to fit me and now i‚Äôm here. 

I am too depressed to get out of bed, i‚Äôve laid in bed awake since I woke up not moving or getting up. I do nothing in my days and i barely have friends in uni. i‚Äôve met 3 people since august, but they‚Äôre just people i say hi to. I lie about meeting them to my family when i‚Äôm just alone, so that they‚Äôre happy and not worried. I just want to live without working or studying. I just want to live, why can‚Äôt i do that? 

I have no idea what to do next. the guilt and depression is getting worse everyday and i i wish i could disappear. i truly believe no one‚Äôs life would change. I am so unfit to do anything, i can‚Äôt even take care of myself.",1676275171.0

This is gonna sound weird but please bear with me while i write this out.

I always think of this specific test/incident when i have to get similar tests. I have a PAP smear coming up soon and its gonna be difficult because i have vaginismus and have in the last year uncovered memories of CSA/R***. Which has lead to a diagnosis of PTSD once i was seen by the mental health team. 

When i was early 20s while admitted to hospital it was suggested that i needed a transvaginal ultrasound to see if there was issues causing severe abdo pain/sickness/temps. At this point in my life i hadn't had sex fully because one time i tried it failed to penatrate due to above issues that i didn't know at the time. So for all intents and purposes i was still a virgin to my knowledge. 

Now, i get into the ultrasound room to see a male doctor, there was a female nursing student in the room aswell to chaperone. I had no issues with this until he started to do the test and put the probe in, i stop him and explain how painful it is but he just huffs and explains that if i want answers then we need to do this test. (There was no answers btw). He attempts to do the test again and still the same pain and i try to breathe through tears and he doesn't stop the test. I couldn't say anything at this point and i feel sick and in tears. But its feels stupid because he said the test was needed and is huffy about needing time to relax before pushing further. I walk out with the student. I was shocked/crying and not really knowing what the hell just happened. Like i know now why it was so hard with my muscle issue but why continue with a test thats obviously hurting someone. 

A few years later i explained to a nurse what happened and she said he never should have done that test if i was still a virgin..... i was like so what the actual hell was the need to do that. I felt sick again over the whole thing and now when i have similar tests i can see this in my head. 

Then i feel stupid because it was a 'necessary' medical test and it can't be assault right?",1676234069.0

I am 18 years old and I underwent upper blepharoplasty about 6 months ago. I was first introduced to this procedure by my mother when I was in middle school. I had monolids that were puffy, but I liked them. However, my mother convinced me that I had to get them done. She convinced me that my eyes needed to go under the knives of surgeons so that I could appear normal. ever since then, I always thought my eyes were deformed.  So every time my mother was talking about how she plans to get me surgery when I turn 18 and how she got hers when she was 9, I‚Äôll get excited, but also impatient because I wanted surgery right away. I didn‚Äôt want to continue to live as a deformity.

So on that day, 6 months back, I agreed to fly out to NY to get the surgery. My parents were divorced at this point.  My mother, who is a gambling addict, was always at the casino . Looking back, I never thought of the surgery when I was in the house by myself. In fact , I started to love myself more and more without her antics. But she came back from the casino. Besides the mountains of debts that she owes, I knew she had won some money because she was not raging or hitting me and she seemed happy. And I was happy that she was happy. I guess that‚Äôs partly why I agreed that day when my mom asked, even though i was just so ready to move out and put all that shit behind me. I hadn‚Äôt seen her in weeks and I guess i just wanted to spend some time with her before I had to move to college.And stupidly, I felt like part of the deal of spending time with her was agreeing to the surgery.  And partly, her words came back to make me believe that I needed it, that it was some kind of magical process that‚Äôll give me a new sense of validation that will finally make me feel like I am enough of a person.

I was also at my lowest point. I was hyperventilating and having a panic attack the day we flew out to NY to get my surgery  because I found out my father got scammed by a girl that he was dating online. I couldn‚Äôt think. I didn‚Äôt want to think. I couldn‚Äôt muster up the strength or courage to deny my mother even if I wanted to. I was totally shut down by my dad‚Äôs foolishness.  

Now it‚Äôs 6 months after the surgery and I have just been miserable. Miserable beyond comprehension.  Even though other surgeons have said that my results are considered objectively good, I can‚Äôt help but feel like I have made like a Faustian bargain and lost some critical part of myself. I can‚Äôt focus at all on college without breaking down or having a panic attack. I am constantly romanticizing the past, making things prettier than before when I know that it was not any better before the surgery. I have lost all my sense of love and autonomy and appreciation for myself because all I have felt is being stolen and invalidated. I have been diagonsed with acute PTSD and have been dealing with, anxiety attacks, depression, suicidal ideatinons every single day. Only after the surgery did i realize what i had done. Only after the surgery did i realize that I have been manipulated and cheated. Only after the surgery did i realize that my mother had imposed her own childhood traumas onto me. Only after the surgery did i realize that i was totally fine before. That i was not a deformity. That I was ok. That I was beautiful. But I‚Äôm afraid these realizations are too late, the surgery lacerated and took out huge amount of fat and distorted the literal anatomy of eyes. The scars are always going to be there. I‚Äôve always had my father‚Äôs eyes, but now I am seeing more and more of my mother in myself. And it terrifies me. It fucking disgusts me. right now I am considering revision, but i don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs worth it at this point. Secondary  surgery to change it to how i would like would be really challenging and risky and reverting it seem anatomically impossible. I don‚Äôt know.

Years later I find out that how he got me ( I was the side chick) was a lie and that everything he said was a lie. We got together in our senior year of high school, him saying that he wanted me and not his GF who was (all sorts of made up stuff). We got together. I went away to school having decided on a college before we got together. I was miserable and wanted to be with him. I went home for one semester and then my parents realized community college wasn't up to what I was doing. So I went to his school sophomore year and it was basically stockholm syndrome. I venerated my captor and had to do what he wanted to get any affection.

We got married and then the sexual violence escalated, to ""playing rape"" when he would do what he wanted and not stop. At the time I didn't realize what was happening and wanted to fix it. He was cheating on me and moved on. It took me years to realize what he was doing to me, and when I realized it I shut down completely. Shit has happened since then that has made me as non-functional as I've ever been.

The problem is I have dreams of him, and in them I give in to what he wants. I seek him out and give him sex to  make him love me. I usually wake up without resolution and am seriously fucked up. I don't think about him when I'm awake, I know he abused me. But subconscious me still wants to make him happy this many years out.

I am a 22 y/o male. I have been in some abusive relationships in the past. It has been over 2 years since I got out of my last abusive relationship and I have dealt with some serious mental health problems since then. I struggled to accept that I was abused for a really long time even after being diagnosed with PTSD and I think I am starting to understand how serious it is and how severe the implications may be on my future if I don't make an effort to heal. I get triggered by basically anything relating to relationships or trusting people who seem to care about me. I have a substance abuse disorder in which I am a chronic user of opiates/weed to numb my emotions. I think I have also dissociated from the person I used to be quite a bit and have suppressed a lot of memories in the process. I also self harm(ed) after being with my last partner which has significantly impacted how I perceive myself and how I believe others perceive me. I am very insecure about my scars and honestly I'm not even comfortable meeting new people because I'm so worried about what they will think about me if they know pretty much anything about me. I have not worn short sleeves since and it causes me to avoid meeting new people unless I really meed to,

When I was originally diagnosed I was kinda in denial, probably because I have been using drugs for a while to cope and I still had/have feelings for my most recent abuser so I convinced myself that they did not abuse me and that people simply misunderstood the situation. Recently some memories I had lost for a long time resurfaced and they're very scary to me. I am starting to come around to the reality of the situation.

I don't know how to go about getting help because I display the symptoms of PTSD but it's all related to an event that didn't occur in reality. 

At the age of 21 I was attending a university, and spent most of my time using various drugs or drinking a ton of alcohol. One drug I stupidly decided to experiment with was Datura. A pretty, white-flowered plant that turns your life into a living hell for the duration of time you are on it. It is not a psychedelic like LSD or mushrooms, it's an extremely potent deliriant and the time I took it has me honestly traumatized to this day and I am now 29.

The experience of it I would describe as; earth literally turning into a hell for a night, then going back to normal in the morning. The things you see and do are completely indistinguishable from reality. In my case, the hallucinations were far too real and far too gory, involving a disgusting murder.

For many months after the event I believed that it really did happen. Everyone called me crazy and I got diagnosed as schizophrenic. I begged doctors and therapists to help but all they said was ""it wasn't real, get over it.""

Years later I finally accept that the murder was a drug induced fantasy but it still doesn't feel that way and there are still nights where I am up late with this sick/numb feeling and can't get the memories out of my head and all I want to do is cry but I'm not able to.

About 8 years ago, before we met, my husband was deployed in Guantanamo Bay. On his 24th birthday, he was date raped by a woman in his unit. For this reason, his birthday is very triggering to him and he dreads it. We have been together for 5 years and I found this out last summer. 

I always knew he didn't like his birthdays (or anybody's birthdays including my own and our 3 y/o daughter's), but I didn't know the extent or what exactly happened until last year when he had a vivid flashback and a severe mental breakdown that he is still recovering from and in intensive therapy for.

Since I hadn't known all of this until recently, I still would try my best to make his birthdays nice for him so he'd grow to enjoy them in the previous years. I'd never throw him a party because he's very socially anxious, but I'd make him dinner, make or get him gifts, a few intimstand other little things like that. He seemed generally pleased and appreciative. But again, that was pre-flashback. 

He's turning 32 next weekend and he specifically told me he does not want to celebrate his birthday because his birthday ""is and will always be a day of disgust and grief"" to him. I want to respect his boundaries, but I also wouldn't feel right just letting him sulk in misery the whole day. He deserves to enjoy his birthday just as much as anyone else and it would be great to break the cycle of that day being a negative day for him rather than reinforce it.  Our daughter loves celebrating birthdays and figure that maybe her excitement would help him reframe the experience for him. But again, I don't want to push it too far.

989,CBD Oil for sleep?,2,110s4jz,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/110s4jz/cbd_oil_for_sleep/,0,"Hi!

For a variety of reasons I am currently unable to get on an actual prescription medicine to help consistently get me through the night (shooting for later this year), and a histamine disorder means over the counter sleeping aids don't work very well on me. I have to take semi-regular drug tests for a workmans comp claim, so marijuana is also off the table

I was wondering how many people take CBD Oil at night? How much do you take? Are there any side effects you see people not talking about often? What prices are considered fair? 

Thank You!",1676240767.0
