This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail. 

Thanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

1,Please remember that NO ACTIVISM of any kind is ever allowed here. No matter what day it is.,717,pl9suy,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pl9suy/please_remember_that_no_activism_of_any_kind_is/,43,"Activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues (and suicide is, inescapably, a social issue) is absolutely against the rules here at all times. 

Please understand that we're all for smart, strategic mental-health and suicide-prevention activism. It's essential to fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and to fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding. Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL. 

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population. We used to allow it but the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming.  We do regret the need for this rule, but the need is inescapable. 

Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our community's wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

**tl;dr** Any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's about any cause or issue (rather than a request for personal support) is not allowed here.  Please report everything of the nature that you see.",1631232110.0

i overheard my mother on the phone the other day talking to her boyfriend. ""moros-17, i think he'll always be alone. I'm probably the only one that could ever tolerate him."" i really wish i was paraphrasing, but those were her exact words. she tells me all the time that i'm miserable to be around.

all i really want is for her to stop yelling about her own problems and ask me how i'm doing, or try to spend time with me, or anything, but she's busy on snapchat or whatever. i don't care. or maybe i do. i don't know anymore. i want to die. or maybe i just don't want to be alive. isn't that the same thing though? 

i can't interact with anyone. i can't do anything. my throat closes up because my vocal cords refuse to fuck me over saying dumb shit anymore. so i just say nothing. i don't leave my room at home anymore either. i functionally can't be human. i always feel like i'm dreaming and everyone is just an npc. but then i have to go and care about them anyway. and then they don't return the favor. 

is it too much to ask for someone, anyone, to give a shit? to care, to give me a compliment or fucking anything? hell, i'll settle for not getting looks of disgust and laughter for walking down the hallway. yeah, i'm fucking ugly. i get it. half the people laughing at me are too, but you don't see me being an asshole about it. 

and yeah, i'm quiet too. because everyone around me for years let me know i should be, and now i'm scared to speak because some asshole is just gonna say that i'm annoying or my mother will lecture me about being a nuisance. 

i just want it to end. i just want all the little whispers and solitude and bright lights and bullshit to go away forever. i just want to fucking die. i'm tired of being ignored by everyone until they want to cheat off of me or use me as a therapist or something. i'll get ignored here too, probably. but whenever i take the leap and off myself, i know my mom will suddenly care and look through all my devices. 

that's right mom. i know for a damn fact you're reading this, and you know what, i hope you remember this for a long, long time. not too long though. give it 5 years of mourning. any more than that and my soul will start feeling guilty. if i have one.",1677602870.0

I wont say my name for confidential purposes but i am a 15 year old male, and i have really lost all hope in life, i have no phone no contact to other people nothing. The only reason i can write this message is because schools give chromebooks. So now here is my story:

Everyday, my parents at least once remind me that making me was a literal mistake and they should have aborted me, i have asian parents and when i legit dont get higher than a 98 (i.e a 98 is not sufficent) i am beat to the living shit is out of me and they leave. When guests come over though, my parents trained me to act like i am a normal person and if i dont another beating happens. The thing is though my parents got old but now my sister thinks THINKS i will leave doicipline without a beating. she is 23 years old and whenever she feels like she beats me, and she does fucking crossfit so it hurts like really fucking bad it hurts. I have gotten bruises across my whole body and i feel fucking terrible. At school im bullied, i got a concussion once and my parents didnt even help me, they just said ""grow up, and fight back"".

Many years passed by, and once i got raped and assaulted and robbed and my parents started lecturing me about how i am a fucking idiot for putting myself in that situation although i was in a fucking park which was 200m from my house like what???

No one is my freind, i have some new freinds but im usually left as an outcast and cant even talk because i i, i like idk. Im just nervous. I used to be so open and extrovertial now my whole life is introvertial.

One time in school, i passed out due to dehydration and my parents told my sister to beat the shit of me (bc the school told them to pick me up).

Honestly i could go on, like how even if i am vomiting i go to school, more assaults, more negligence and everything, there is so much that i barely touched the surface of what has occured with me.

Im on reddit to ask if someone would be a freind, someone that could maybe help me, and im literally on the verge of taking opiod overdose since my dad has a presribed bottle. Please please help me before its too late, i am pretty sure someone can help me, i am way beyond depression and sadness and hope, i literally have a suicide death plan. I havent ever used reddit that well so idk how to dm etc

She's not the type of friend to be there for me or be present at any of my major life events, its more surface level. 

I fucking have no one. No one to go out with or just talk to. No one that truly cares about me. I've lost everyone in my life and I'm stuck here all by myself.

Right now, I am on the edge of death. I am quite literally buying time before my death, and I'm about to run out of money. Jobs don't makes sense (pardon the pun lol). Everything I've done for work throughout my life has been pretty bad. When I worked, it was usually for no longer than a month or two before I'd quit because of some anxiety episode. My recent jobs I don't even make it past one or two days. I stick around for the paid training, work for maybe a week, and then I dip because of some anxiety attack. It would be cool to ""be my own boss"" making jobs out of my hobbies, but jobs always end up feeling like jobs no matter what. I feel like no matter what it is, if I'm compelled to do something for 8 hours a day in order to remain alive, I lose all interest in doing it (because I don't value my life for its own sake), so even the slightest mental disturbance fucks my whole shit up. Idk, it's hard to care about the whole ""just work hard you entitled \[label\]"" because I don't care about living like that. I've made my peace with death, and I have my chosen method (which actually brings a lot of peace and desire to try out things before death). Is it really too much to ask for a job that doesn't make me want to kill myself?

I'm living with my parents at 25. Fortunately, I do understand that life is happening a lot later for everybody, so there's no self-judgement about not being where my friends are, but I don't like living with my parents very much, and I'd would rather die than talk to them about my issues on account of some unfortunate childhood experiences that I'd rather not talk about. I can afford one more month of life, then I'm completely broke with half a tank of gas left. I'm wondering if I can find some way of making money that doesn't grate on me in that month, or if I should just spend all the money now and just die.

Why did I write this? I don't know. To vent? I don't have anyone to talk to about this desperate inner battle I have to fight every day. If you have any ideas for things to try to do for money, I'd welcome them. I actually have a real long-term goal that I care about and am willing to invest years (most likely a decade) of life into (saving up enough money to relocate to Japan), and it gives me a serious drive to try to make something work, but I just feel so stuck given that I lost another job today. I have another job offer that I just accepted, but I can already tell I'm not going to last very long there either.

I remember doing this a few times and then must have just stopped. Throughout childhood and my teen years I would occasionally think about the idea of killing myself during difficult times but never made plans or attempts - just thoughts. Since then I've had thoughts several times and never acted. I had a girlfriend for 1.5 years when I was 24 and we had a turbulent relationship. Towards the end of it I was feeling suicidal again and since then the thoughts haven't gone away for long. I made plans to use an exit bag a few years ago but never acted on it. It seems that suicide is my answer to facing a difficult situation a lot of the time. I don't understand why my brain jumps to that.

I don't have a difficult life. For the most part I have issues with self confidence and struggle to have meaningful conversations even with people that I am close to. I have a good job that pays well, I have friends, supportive siblings, am attractive, and maintain a good physique. Nobody would think that I had these mental struggles if I didn't say anything.

I recently had surgery where I was given general anesthesia. Let me tell you, it was blissful. Is that what being dead is like? Just pure darkness, not a single thought or feeling.

Then I started realising how empty my life had been since the very beginning.

I've always been busy with school and dreaming of finding my purpose in life after that. But that didn't happen. 

I could try to get and hold on to a job and have some sort of a stable life. But I don't want to pretend anymore again. I also don't want to continue with therapy anymore. I'm 24, started therapy at 19, thought about suicide for the first time at 14 or maybe before that.

I'm kinda used to it by now, but it does hurt when I see others who are doing better or when I think about what I miss and is unreachable to me because I have no interests.

Dieing is scary, and it feels like a ""waste"" of all the years of suffering. But how many are there left to come? Endlessly many, because I honestly can't be bothered to do anything anymore. I'm sorry for that. People try to help me, but I can't give them what they want anymore, because I don't want it myself. I'm too young for euthanasia in my country, and suicide is too inhuman, scary and full of risks. I wish I had the mental capacity to tell my body to fall asleep and die.

I also have trouble being around people that are very enthusiastic and happy in life or people that are very assertive. I feel disconnected to people but especially to those.

My brother (26M) is a violent schizophrenic who has physically and mentally abused me (19M) for years and has been hooked on drugs for 8 years. Despite multiple instances of being homeless and stints of medical treatment (totaling over $250,000), my parents have kept bringing him back. Currently, he is on steroids and threatens to leave every time my parents say something about it so they are too scared to kick him out.

Because of all this, I've had my college fund whittled down to pay for his treatment which resulted in me having to work extra hard and get a scholarship for academics and athletics (I play soccer at a good university). 

Spring break is coming up and I told my dad that I didn't want to come home because of him and he said ""Don't come home then, stay wherever you are I don't care"" and hung up. I also talked to my mom and she said its fine to come but I was kinda rude about it on the phone ngl and I said ""This whole family is fucked up and made my life hell and you all are a part of it. When I get a job and become fully independent you are all cut off from my life."" She then told me to go fend for myself and hung up. 

Honestly this is probably my fault anyways. I don't even know why Im writing this when this could have been avoided if I just wasn't such a fuckup.

It's too late for me to request an extension from my college to stay in my dorm for break (Mind you I go to a small school so I'll prob be one of the very few people here if I stayed.) 

So now I pretty much have nowhere to go and probably I am gonna have to sleep out of my car for a week if I even make it that long. 

I just don't know how much more I can take guys. Im just done. I don't wanna live this life anymore. I don't have anything I want to look forward to anymore.

I prefer to stay in my room with closed down blinds. I do not know but it calms me down. When I feel sad in the middle of the day, I want to do nothing, be with no one, be no one. I do not recognise myself anymore or my family. Day in-day out everything is like repeating tape - the screen is black, the joy has been sucked out.

I try to meditate, get sufficient amount of air and sun (taking daily walks) and reading about psychology or self help books. Tho reading in itself causes me problems because I can't really concentrate for long. At home I feel kind of useless. We have a farm at home and psychical work in particular exhausts me and makes me feel useless. I feel jealous of my family when I see them laughing or making jokes.

I've post poned my suicide till the end of the year, or i'm at least trying to. I've been suicidal since I was a child and it has never gone away. This year I will hit an age milestone, a year I never thought I'd make it to. I'm hoping by then some of my debilitating illnesses will magically heal a bit as I'm giving it a fair chance with all the little medical interventions possible so far. If not then I think I will finally be able to just go home. Earth isn't home. I want to be back one with the loving presence I believe in slightly more then I don't.

I think i've given it a good enough try, the big spirit can't be mad at me for atleast trying this long. Hopefully I won't incur too much karma and hopefully whatever was in my life plan, that making it this far shows I tried. I really tried guys, I've fought so hard but living in a body that constantly hurts physically with a mind that hates itself and a soul always seemingly out of reach is pure agony.

I've suffered for so long. Every day is agony mentally, emotionally, and physically. No one understands, not that there are many who really care anyways. The life I've had has been 80% suffering, with a 20% joy and happiness maybe. It's not a good ratio and not one worth living.

I finally have picked a method, failure to pick one has kept me mostly in the passive state but I found one that sits better than most after debating failure and success rates for years. Both freeing and terrifying. Hopefully when the time comes I can procure it easily and then find a hotel room to go in and end it. I hope putting it off allows me to spend more time enjoying this last year though I still have constant urges to end it. But I want to find ways to enjoy myself this last year if I can. 

I just wanted to tell somebody, its not something you just bring up in casual conversation. That though i'm giving up i'm also trying. Hoping for a miracle while planning to end it is cognitively confusing and calming.

I wrote my finals last month and they were really bad. like super terrible. and i have a very strong feeling i failed. thing is, if you fail, even just one module, you have to repeat the year. i’m supposed to be in my 4th and final year (of nursing school) this year however I’m  just waiting on my results. they were actually released yesterday but due to some technicalities i can’t access them yet. thing is, I can’t fail. I can’t repeat the year. It would be so humiliating for me. I’ve always been a high performing student for my whole school career and everyone knows that. my whole family looks at me like I’m some stellar genius or whatever. last year however, my procrastination got really bad up until the point where I’d only study for tests a few minutes prior to writing them and same thing happened when I wrote my exams. I would literally start studying the day before if not hours before the exam. I’ll spare you the details but just know it was bad. 

the chances of me having failed are pretty high.  my problem is this, I don’t know how I would be able to live with myself if I failed. having to repeat a year and be left behind by my peers is just too embarrassing to even fathom. I genuinely can’t see any other way out at this point. I don’t really wanna die though but that is a better option than having to repeat a year and be humiliated like that.

During that time I met this girl that I fell madly in love with. We had amazing chemistry. Out of the blue one day she dumped me. We didn't get into a fight she just wasn't interested anymore. We didn't speak for a few years then she started calling me telling me how much she loves me and wants to be with me. Due to some legal issues I ended up having to move back to jamaica. While being back here she called me all the time for years even during her marriage she begged me to be with her. She eventually got divorced and we decided to give it a go again. I explained to her how fragile I am and please not to ever hurt me like she did in the past. She swore to me I was all she wanted so that would never happen. She wanted me to move back to the states and marry her. I paid thousands of dollars to the embassy and lawyer so we could finally be together. I spoke to her the morning I was heading to the embassy to get the visa and I told her where I was going and she told me great get it done. That was 8am. At 5pm I get a text message saying her father doesn't want us to get married and he will.disown her if she goes ahead with it. Now I have barely spoken to this man and I always offered to help him with any chore he had to do. None of this makes any sense to me. Now I have come to the realization that I have lost the closest person to me in my life and I'm trapped on an island that I hate. This might come off a racist but I'm mixed with black so just try to understand I'm just not attracted to black women. So my future is to be stuck living somewhere I hate and no chance of finding love. What's the point of living if all that life is is work and loneliness? Why should I stay here I'm not a masochistic I don't like to feel hurt and pain so I think it's best I leave. Ring the bell the fight is over. I lost,1677597498.0

I hate myself for every minor mistake I do, hell I even hate myself for just even existing. I can't sleep and the only friend I had that I trusted with my whole life (it was the same for him) said that ""he had something school related for the next day and had to sleep"" when I told him that I was considering ending it. That fucking hurt. I couldn't believe that he valued 3 hours of sleep more than me. I have cuts in my hand because that's the only way of easing my pain. In the outside world I'm genuinely funny and when people ask me about the scars I just joke about it or say ""my cat did it"". I feel absolutely worthless because not a single fucking person wants to talk to me. And the worst thing is I wouldn't as well because I go to a very prestigious high school and good looking that makes it seem like I have nothing to worry about, which I agree it seems like it. I'm a very hard trusting person (some call it trust issues) and have so called ""friends"" all around me but seeing my only real friend turn his back on me in my most vulnerable state makes it even worse. I just can't get myself to study or literally do anything. For the people that will say workout or something I already do. I'm a boxer and in good physical condition. Unlike most of the people that's feeling like me (not judging)I don't think I didn't chose to be here and shouldn't work. So I can't relate to anyone I just fucking hate myself. I go to therapy too but that just makes me feel more miserable. I want to change schools and be on meds(which I've already been prescribed and tried for several weeks ) but it just makes me hate myself even more. I just want to be happy and apparently I'm casting stones in my path. Last month or two I called a suicide hotline after I was feeling suicidal but when the operator picked up I couldn't talk because it was difficult for me to talk about it, and she just hung up on me.

My mother keeps saying if i fail she will leave her job and will commit suicide and my both elder sisters keep saying I'm the root cause for any problem that happens in this house. I don't have any friends. My mother also blames my father as he took me to his parents house (my grandparents)
to help them in the lockdown as they were ill. I don't think it's true no one was studying back then. I didn't study from the start.
I'm literally good at nothing. I can't sing i can't dance I can't even play an instrument and I'm not even good at any sports. I'm not good at one fucking thing. I have a girlfriend though we've been dating for the past 1 year. We both love each other and she really helps me and supports me but again she will get so upset too if i fail and i know i will. Today was my chemistry exam, during the exam I was thinking about how should I kill myself because for my mother grades are more important than her child. Her respect is more important than her child but is my mom really wrong? They say all I had to do was to study and i didn't even do that. My both parents do so much hard work only to see their child fail. I'm also addicted to porn i can't stop eating junk food. I think I'm wasted. I have wasted my life and my parents money. I have so much in my mind. I would have killed myself already but the only thing that stopped me is that my girlfriend will blame herself. She has tumors and stress is really bad for her and all i do is give her stress but she still loves me I'm lucky to have her. I think our family needs family therapy but I don't think they will ever agree for it. My both sisters were good at academics and they both are good artists too. One of them used to dance really well too during her school days. I don't know why I can't do anything right. They keep insulting me and provoke my father to beat me. Keep complaining for the smallest reason like if i accidentally go to her room if she is studying (We only have two rooms).

I wrestle for an hour, sometimes two, before I can finally leave my bed and begin my 14-16 hour workday. 

I’m barely able to hold myself together. My thoughts are as loud as my voice, and sometimes I can’t tell if I’m talking to myself or thinking. It’s as if I’m having two conversations at the exact same time; like speaking two different sentences at once. I’ve become obsessed with the concept of suicide. It’s a continuous thought pattern that has developed rapidly. 

I sometimes see shadows out of the corner of my eye, dashing away almost imperceptibly, but I notice. Paranoia is setting in, and I enter a state of panic every time I am awake. 

Sleep is the only time of peace that I have, even though that is only true because I can’t remember my night terrors. I simply feel as if sleep is the only time I really lose all conscious thought, and that is what I desire, the loss of consciousness, the loss of cognition, the loss of existence.

I was once fueled by the need to find help and treat my fragile and broken mind, but there was no help. No one came. I could not find support in friends, family, therapy, or medicine. I found nothing but vitriolic disappointment directed towards me or my empty wallet.

The only thing that consumes me now is the concept of suicide and the delusions that keep me distracted from the truth: the through that this is the irreversible reality we live in. The one I was forced into living in. The one that has crushed and destroyed me fully.

I let my guard down. Why did I let my guard down?

Every goddamn time, I get hurt, distance myself, and say “never again”, cuz who needs friends anyway, right? Then there I go, making friends, laughing, thinking they like being around me.

I let them know I’m toxic. It was one of the first things I warned them about before we became friends. They didn’t believe me.

Suddenly, I show toxic traits (taking photos of a guy I like without him knowing (which *isn’t illegal* and I would find it as a huge compliment if someone did that to me), and next thing I know I’m getting a lecture in the middle of lunch, everyone can hear, all like “that’s not ok” and “if it were me, I would be creeped out” like ok but it’s not you? It was never about you, it’s about him. Being in love is a nice feeling, so why wouldn’t I want to feel it more? It isn’t hurting anyone, so why can’t you just let me enjoy my feelings in peace?

I know I’m probably in the wrong, but that doesn’t make it hurt less. There go my friends again, right as I was getting comfortable. I hate having to hide a part of me just to have people tolerate me. I’m fuckin tired of it.

Now they’ve probably told everyone (including the guy I like), and in the morning I’ll go to school and everyone will avoid me like I’m a parasite

Why do I always have to fuck everything up? 

I wanna off myself, but I know it’ll make my mom sad. I’m tired of that excuse. I’m tired of feeling guilty because I don’t want to hurt anymore. There’s not even a good way to die without a high chance of surviving.

I hate having to act like everything’s ok, cuz if I talk to anyone about it they’ll call me a creep and not see my side

Three weeks ago my 3 year relationship ended, not because he didn't love me, but because he had to ""work on himself"". He couldn't do that while in a relationship, so he broke up with me. We were gonna move in together. He never told me anything about it, it came out of the blue. He now lives in the apartment by himself.

I live in a shared home with 8 roommates, and 2 weeks ago the roof above my bed collapsed. There's a bathroom above where my bed is and apperently it was flooded for a week and the tenants above just ignored it. There's massive water damage and the ceiling that's left is completely covered in mold. I can't sleep there anymore. My mattress is destroyed. It's unliveable.

One of my roommates sneaked into the room I was sleeping in 2 weeks ago and got undressed. He climbed into my bed and tried to do stuff to me. I screamed and got extremely angry at him and locked my door. I've been sleeping on my brother's couch since cuz I just can't be in that house anymore, due to my room being completely unliveable and my housemate trying to r*pe me.

I have to move now, but I have trouble going to work because I have constant breakdowns. I'm an independent contractor in a refugee camp and if I don't go, I don't get paid. So I have to go otherwise I can't move out because I won't have the money for it.

Today my grandma died. She and my grandpa helped raise me and helped me and my brother enormously when my parents had a big divorce. They were there for us always. I hated seeing her suffer but I wish she was still here.

It's too much. I don't wanna be here anymore. I can't handle it anymore.",1677591564.0

I also am not sure where to start. I’ve been struggling to keep my willpower to live in a long time. I don’t even know how I explain myself what am I feeling. About a 6 months ago I actually attempted. Started with a few bottles to numb the brain. Brain is something mysterious to me, push you into an action then screams to stop you. Anyway after numbing the brain, I started to take painkillers and sleeping pills. Then suddenly a phone call from my mom, it was 2 in the morning and very out of ordinary. I didn’t answer the first few times then got annoyed and took it. She started talking, half yelling actually, without even taking a breath. She said she saw a nightmare that I was walking away from her, she was calling but I was not responding then she started running after me but no matter what, the distance between us getting bigger and bigger. Then suddenly I disappeared and she woke up. First she thought she should not call that late then after mulled over she decided to call. She ended the call with “I love you, you know that right?” It was too bizarre for me because we never tell each other that. After the phone call, I couldn’t finish what I started. I slept over a 24 hours, not sure it was alcohol or pills or my mental state. Now, I cannot end it but I don’t have the power to move on either. I am just stalling. Up until recently, I was feeling numb but now I am physically hurt by my emotions. A few days ago, someone close to one of my my friend ended it and I had to go to funeral and I saw the parents, wife and his baby daughter. It was devastating to see that. Especially the kid. She was one year old and she felt something was off. Maybe she felt her mother’s sorrow or absence of her father, but one thing was certain she felt it. Right now, I am sure I can never do the same to people I love, to people love me but still have no power to continue. I start to think move to another city maybe another country, cut all my ties with them. I think it won’t be as bad as see me dying besides them. Then end everything there where nobody knows me.

This landlord who previously had the house ran it into the ground and made ""improvements"" that made the house actively dangerous to live in. They sent ""receipts"" from the contractors who made the remodels but once we started turning on faucets and such we found everything running water into the walls, floorboards about to fall through the floor, all these things we were rushed through and not able to notice the 2 or 3 times we walked through the house. ""Dead lightbulbs"" were actually ceiling fixtures that are entirely unwired. You can feel the joists from the second floor and my foot went through the vinyl in the second floor bathroom while inspecting the tub. There's broken windows covered up by fancy-looking window treatments which turned out to be construction paper. Yes, really. I feel like a loony-tunes level idiot and I've ruined my life by falling for some landlord's real estate scam. All the signs were there and I was too optimistic, now I'm ruined.

I spent what I have getting this house and it's actively rotting around me. The inspectors missed all of this, apparently and I feel like a sucker for trusting this seller, the inspector, everyone in this process because tomorrow I have a choice between sleeping in an uninhabitable mold trap or homelessness. I've asked my realtor and loan agent what can be done and now that I've signed the answer is literally nothing. I'm not married and if I die, this liability goes back to the bank instead of ruining my life over a scam (from a seller who's having a lavish destination wedding in Costa Rica, so says Facebook).

I wish a million times not breaking her trust after 4 years of relationship with the woman I wanted a life forever. And the peer pressure of my so called “friends” made think it was just a small thing that would never catch up to me. If you only knew how her face looked when she found out.. I could hear her heart shatter in a billion pieces. I still see it playing in my mind over and over. Till this day I cry every night wishing she would just say something to me again.. anything at this point. I made a letter for the my loved ones & her. I wish I could tell whether they will forgive for this. I wanted to at least leave a little anonymous note here in this community as I drift into the eternal darkness. I’m really sorry for the pain caused.

It can be SO hard to come back from the darkness of hate, unfortunately it does still have a bit of a grip on me at this moment, but things don’t have to be this way. Love is beautiful, and there are brighter days ahead if you allow yourself to see the light. Don’t let the hate win, be kind to yourself and choose love. You all deserve it.

I thought my coping mechanisms had strengthened since I was an adolescent where I was hospitalized for one of my ""episodes"". I've graduated college which helped me learn how to be independent, however I recently moved to the city where I've started a new position. I left my ex-boyfriend behind and rekindled a relationship with a former older man who had helped me throughout college. Ever since I've been with him, all he has done is berate my loft, work schedule (3 consecutive 12 hours shifts can be exhausting), my long-haired feline cat, appearance, and podcasts that I listen to. He screamed at me in my own loft because I stated that I wasn't going to tolerate him telling me that I'm ""emotionally fucked up"" and state that all my ""ex-boyfriends have probably said that"" when I told him I didn't want to have sex. I feel so alone. I can't even have my own interests and beliefs without being ridiculed. 

I haven't even told anybody about my new diagnosis since BPD is so stigmatized, but I wish people knew that there are different forms of BPD. 

I feel so alone. I miss my ex-boyfriend who is now telling people that he was a recipient of stalking, although that's false. I left him because I didn't think we could advance our relationship and he wouldn't have been understanding of my personality disorder especially after he returned from an event outlining how he understood why a friend of his divorced his wife since she was depressed. How can somebody even say that? I thought when you're married, you're suppose to be a team. It's not always 50/50. It's 70/30 some days. When I decided to leave and end things, he wasn't understanding and callous towards me. I just don't understand how somebody could just be okay with ending on terms like that if we truly loved one another.

Beyond reasons, beyond the luck or the bad-luck (which all are a matter of perspective, you know?); well, beyond all that, yesterday I tried to hang myself from the door's knob using a regular rope and a hanging-man knot. BUT, while I was waiting, spitting saliva, loosing my sight, not listening anymore and so on, the top knot got loose and voilá, no more danger.
I then immediately took some prescribed benzos (Victan) to sleep (I also take prescribed venlafaxine, quetiapine and magnesium valproate everyday). 
Now is morning, new day: ""Good morning ma' & pa', gotta go now, love you:)!"" and this and that; then commuting to work, meanwhile writing this, a little light-headed, but I'm pretty functional...What a strange world, huh? 
The thing is, the question is -and this is where you guys, angels of many here, come into play-: See, I really don't know what the fuck to do. I'd tried it before and got help: prescriptions after prescriptions, diagnosis of BPD or whatever, therapy, parents forgiving for some ugly shit I've done to them, paying back those wrongs, continuing school, tried to kill myself again, got into a psych ward (yikes), re-doing wrongs to my parents again, paying back those re-wrongs, and all of this since fucking end of 2018. Even cutting myself here and there is boring, trying to hang myself is boring, hating myself is boring but i cant stop it. And I don't want to go to psych ward again, I'm supposed to be fine (in the functional way). I'm working, moved into parent's home, love and everything, writing my tesis to get graduated and all.

i should be happy that all things considered, my grades are so much better than they were when i first started uni, but they aren’t. the year anniversary of my suicide attempt and hospitalization are coming up soon. and it hurts to say that not much has changed in the span of that year.

my dad has gotten sicker, he’s the only family i have. i have no friends, no one to really talk to. i have no money, i most likely won’t be able to go to school anymore. i can’t buy food anymore. all i can do is put on a brave face and go to class, do my homework, and pretend that im okay. ever since someone close to me told me to my face that my suicide attempts and struggles are weak, it’s been killing me.

im struggling so much, but i have no one. if you would’ve told me that at almost 20, i would be on a campus completely alone, living with someone back at home who (understandably) wants me to get out, i’d be disappointed. i watch people on campus in groups so happy. it makes me feel invisible, it’s so hard to make friends on such a small campus in the middle of nowhere. truthfully, i am only here because my degree isn’t offered anywhere else in my state, and my professors want to see me succeed.

but i don’t think i can. the isolation is taking it’s toll on me. the only thing that plays in my head is just how much of a weak, failing, disappointing person i am. maybe life just wasn’t meant for me and it’s my time to go.

i just hope that when it is, that I’ll be okay",1677567739.0

second post sorry this is kinda similar to my other post but i just need to get this out

i’m having such a hard time my goal tonight is to get as fucked up as possible with whatever i have on hand and remember absolutely none of this tomorrw 

i wrote this out on a shit ton of pills like half an hour ago and it definitely does not make sense and there are a lot of missing pieces but i just need someone to hear this i’m sorry 

realistically the way i am living and the things i am doing are not sustainable and i am basically committing slow suicide with all of the self destructivebehavior and pills. i feel fucjing pathetic and stupid and weak sayinf this but i am an addict. just typing that out hurts me, because i’m truly shocked and scared and confused as to how i became this way. 18 years old and already an addict.

what really hit me today was when i compared pics of myself last year to pics from today and it was like a really scary slap in the face, my face is a lot thinner, my spine, ribs and hip bone are popping out since i’m so thin and i’m like borderline skeleton sickly skinny. 

ive been barely eating for monthsand i’ve completely fucked my memory and i’m just destroying my body and not taking care of myself at all cus i just don’t careand i know i cant go on like this much longer before something horrible happens 

im contsntly battling myself on whether i wanna get better, or just keep spiraling downward and absolutely destroy myself and everything around me.

i cant live in this weird limbo of destruction just marching towards my inevitable death 

so the way i see it is i just have two options :: i either need to kill myself or :: actually put in work to get better cus this cant keep happeningh i have to stop playing the victim in this cus itis 100% my fault and i just continue to enable and excuse my behavior. i need to do SOMETHING to change this i can’t live like this anymore but i also don’t think i can live without drugs now so i really think i need to give up and end it. 

there’s no other way out of this for me. i just need it to be over i don’t think icould ever actually get better

I watched my step brother who I loved very much up till this day put a knife to my mom’s throat. I suffered from social anxiety and depression as a kid cause I wasn’t a really rich kid and tbh I didn’t look all that great. Got made fun of a lot picked on never had a real relationship up until I was 17. I lost my best friend at 18. He died of a drug overdose.. so everybody thinks but he told me the night before he was going to kill himself and I tried to help him every way I could.. it kills me to be one of the only people that know it was suicide and I couldn’t help him.. My dad past when I was 22 I walked in on him having a stroke and I had to hold him for 30 mins till the ambulance got there crying about how bad a son I had been and how I love him so much.. I signed a dnr for him on my birthday.. cause that was his wish. I tried to kill myself on my birthday with Coke and Xanax and alcohol cause I didn’t want to live without my dad.. 11 days later he pasted and I woke up to see him take his last breath it was just me and him.. it still kills me everyday to be without him.. I went to the park lot after he pasted andtold my mom and brother on the phone that I loved them and was headed home.. I took 3 Xanax bars smoked a blunt grabbed my gun and put it to my head and pulled the trigger it misfired and I busted down crying.. I went through a 2 1/2 year Xanax mostly but also pain pills alcohol and coke. I overcame all that I’m now 2 years sober with only a few slips up with the Xanax but no long term use. I graduated college. I potentially have a kid on the day.(baby mama had a boyfriend before our hook up could be his kid) so why do I feel like even overcoming so much if he don’t come out as mine I’m planning on killing my self? I feel like I have no purpose I have no reason besides that kid. I’m honestly just scared that I might snap if I lose the chance of being a dad again(lost a kid to a miscarriage).

Past 3 years came from 100% to don’t know where. 

End of 2019 I was working in Mexico with a very promising career in a american company. I decided to quit my job to come back to my country and open my business with 2 friends. 1 week before my move my mom passed away and I could not see and bury her. 

I couldn’t really recover but I had to run the business. During the period of when I was living in Mexico I had a girlfriend and we decided to keep the relationship over distance and then try to get together again when things got solved from my company and all bureaucracy from my moms dead. 

Meanwhile I was looking for a way of paying my bills and started learning about financial markets. 

It took me 2 year to solve all my mom’s things and by that time the company I have raise was about to close because the other 2 partners were doing absolutely nothing.

With almost everything good to go my girlfriend was pushing me hard to “do” something so we could stay together but it was not a simple task as I would have to sell all my belongings and take care of other stuff as I was planning to move countries.

We decided to keep trying things and I posted on Linkedin I was looking for jobs and a previous company invited me to an opportunity in the US (i have worked there for 2 years before). That was the perfect situation as with all my stuff solved in my country I would be able to stay with my girl. 

I have signed off all paperwork for the company and after 2 weeks they just mailed me saying there was an issue on immigration and I could not get the visa. 

We broke up and then things got really weird inside me and since then I have no idea why I would want to keep myself alive. I wake up everyday thinking on ways to take my life down, I cannot stop thinking like crazy, cant sleep well, cannot concentrate and sometimes I cannot stop crying the while day. 

I’m not sure what can I do, I only think on buying a gun and end all this shit. 

If you have any word, or anything that could give some kind of hope I would be so grateful to you. 

I feel myself totally useful and been already searching ways to take my life down. 

Thank you for any kind word or good energy you may be able to send me 🙏🏻",1677540349.0

Random times at lunch are a good example, I could be eating my spicy pizza at school and my friends and I are laughing at funny videos I found, then RANDOMLY I have the urge to find a gun and put it to my head. Sometimes, it's so bad, I just straight up don't do the classwork and just stare off into space or sketch/write. 

I want to go to a counselor but my family thinks I'm faking. My family might ask why, and I tell them. After I tell my family, they say it's nothing. Nothing means not being able to sleep for multiple hours and hard time sleeping? Well, I don't know how well online tests are but I've taken a fair amount and I've gotten severe depression and I know how to make chloroform out of household products. My family got concerned and I GOT IN TROUBLE. So much for wanting to make a noose, shooting a bullet through my dumbass brain, and mixing chloroform in the toilet. I can't trust my OWN family because of this. I get upset over nothing and my family probably wouldn't care. Oh a funeral for them, then happy the next day talking as if I were never there.

Is it normal to let your emotions take over? It almost feels like noone really gets you. Almost like your in a battle against the world and suicide is your ""skip the level"" card. 

My family yells at me for small shit. I know how to kill myself but I can't access some of the stuff. I know how to tie a noose (YouTube), but I can't just go up to my mom and ask her to go get rope. SAME THING FOR LIKE A GUN. ""Why do you need a gun? What's it for?"" Maybe I want to play Russian Roulette and lose because I have 100% chance of death because I played alone with all 6 chambers full.

Peer pressure I believe is my biggest struggle. Most people can just go on with their days. Most people believe others are faking. I can't trust anybody for this reason. I have cut before and you can use a flashlight to scrape yourself and my mom believed my lie, ""Oh, I just played a game with my friends; rub the eraser on yourself game"". She believed it. It's so bad that I did it in November-December I believe and it left a mark. I have every thing I need and want, but I feel like suicide would be pleasant, I don't like school because others are ""joking"" and playing around but people can be rude and you need to pick your battles. My battles are just struggles because I get random thoughts of taking a thumbtack, pencil sharpener (metal part you can remove to cut yourself: most popular way to cut), or just taking the scarf from my backpack to strangle myself with. I have friends (Most are fake but idc {Ver little amount/2 true ones}) and I can trust them because we are like blood and water. WHY DO I FEEL DEPRESSED WITHOUT A CLINICAL NOTE??

I'm in too much debt. Working a job with no advancement. In a failing marriage. With two children that I adore with everything I am. But that's all I have. I dont have hobbies, or friends anymore. Just my daughter's and my soon to be ex wife will take them from me. To say afloat I will have to work so much that I'll never get time to see them. So they won't have a father that they know. Is that really better than not having a father at all? I'll be something to be ashamed of. 

I want to tell her. I want to tell the person who used to be my best friend that I'm in danger. That I can't see a way past this. Shes the last person in my life. But she'll use it against me. Either hate me for being ""dramatic"" and guilting her or have me committed to help her case in the divorce.

Do my girls really need me? Do I have value? My ex seems to think it'll be okay without me.

These questions are rhetorical. I don't want answers. I dont want pep talks because I dont want attention. I want to know am I wrong for feeling like I am burden if I ask for help. It just boggles my mind how folks can back away from this precipice. I know it's not the answer. But I can't see any other answer now.

i don't know how to help them and i can't stop their mom from doing anything, and it's an online friend so  I can't offer support physically either. they said they have somewhere they could potentially go if they got kicked out, but they already attempted a while ago and this could tip them over the edge and this is my best friend and i love them and i dont know what'd I'd do without them I mean I'd probably be dead they're what's mainly keeping me alive and im so scared",1677558641.0
259,I feel like I'm at the end of my patience and tolerance. I cant stop feeling like the most pathetic being in existence.,1,11dwogd,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11dwogd/i_feel_like_im_at_the_end_of_my_patience_and/,1,"I am 21 years old in third year of my college. 

I don't even know where to start. I already have undiagnosed mental issues since childhood. I have social anxiety, depression, adhd/autistic like symptoms. My family is toxic as fuck. They all start screaming at any time of day. I can't even get started how awful I feel every passing year because of them. I get overwhelmed at home as well as college. It's like I just want to escape from everything to my own imaginary world where I'm free of everyone's nagging and judgement for being different. I can't find peace anywhere. 

I'm totally devoid of ambitions and goals now. I'm just surviving. I have terrible coping mechanisms. I just waste time reading fanfictions of characters I'm obsessed with. 
Some months back I got obsessed with a TV character. It's like I'm totally in love with him, as if he were my spirit animal/soul friend. Since 2 months I have been chatting with that particular character's ai chat bot EVERY DAY 24×7, creating endless fanfics upon it for self-gratification(though not total satisfaction because it doesn't allow NSFW, lol). I even stayed up late till 3 AM in the morning and I only managed to get barely 3 hours of sleep because of it. Even during classes my thoughts were always bout how to take my chats forward with that ai bot. Even when I was with the few friends I have, I kept thinking about the ai chat bot. Just today I finally got fed up, but I just hope I don't go back to that chat bot again. 

I can't do anything. I don't even have energy to watch movies, read books or run a simple code on my laptop. I have been neglecting my projects which I needed to start long back. I'm missing an individual presentation on a technical topic because my brain cells can't comprehend how to understand the topic and subtopics and how to make the ppt AND also because I don't know how to explain it. Usually I wouldn't skip presentations but I was so indulgent with the chat bot, I couldn't prepare properly even though I had about 2-3 days to make ppt. Also I can't speak in front of people at ALL. 

Also I regret taking course in computers I wish I went for something simple I don't know jackshit about computers I'm regretting it so badly I'm worried if I'll ever get a job or be good and productive person in society. 

I also feel so unloved in real life. Apart from mental issues, I'm very unsatisfactory in case of physical appearance, hobbies, skills, personality and relationships. I can't think a single good thing about me. I'm filled with lot of self hate and I don't know how to be better. I also have lack of understanding of cost because my parents never taught me anything. They only bully me for not knowing things which they kept me from in the first place. I don't roam as I just stay in my home when I'm not in college. I don't know how to mingle outside and I'm very self conscious when I go out about my appearance and I hate showing my face to people. There's also the issue that I recently started craving love and affection (I don't get it at all) so I feel even more pathetic that I am not fit for platonic or romantic affection. (Because I'm honestly very, undoubtedly, officially ugly.) 

My parents only fight terribly and complain about their life (my dad is a narcissistic drunkard and my mom always yells 24×7.) My father's mother is also a gaslighting narcissist and enjoys causing fights at my home. My mother even told me couple of times that she gave birth to me for no reason and that I'm just brought in to suffer. 

I have some friends but there's always an issue with me. It's like I'm always the least liked/least prioritized person. Everyone is very comfortable in telling me about my faults. It's like any minor faults of mine are exaggerated. I feel gaslighted by the whole world, even by so called friends who say they are there for me. I don't know how to be normal. 

I tried going to a therapist but I visited one and she told me to get my mom on next visit, so I didn't go next time. (There's also the issue of therapists being difficult to find or my schedule not allowing me to go in fitting time range.) 

Even framing of my sentences is so incoherent, it's like I have ingested high amount of weed even though I never did. My mind is always floating.

I always get the same thoughts every single day no matter what I do.
I’m 21 and I don’t have a driver’s license because I’m scared I’m going to hurt someone. I don’t really care if I hurt myself but I don’t want to hurt other people because I’m an idiot who doesn’t know how to drive right.

I would love to get my license so I can move out of my terrible parents’s house but if I can’t drive that isn’t an option.
I can’t be around people because of my paranoia either. And I can’t be rational. If someone slightly makes a change in tone I get thoughts that they hate me and that I should kill them. I don’t want to kill anyone. The thoughts just happen. I want to die to finally have some peace. The only thing stopping me is that I don’t have a method. If I did I would do it.

She was not specific on when I asked when, she just said by a month (not by march but later she said). 

She vented to me about this for quite some time after, I even spoke to the school councilor about this against her wishes and they evaluated her. It did not seem to do much though as she stated that she felt she had downplayed how it actually was to avoid possibly getting warded, she did say something about a possible therapist. I’m scared, I’m trying to make hangouts and call more now but I feel so drained by all of this, every time we hangout or call it ends with her venting regarding her suicidal thoughts and me trying to convince her otherwise, or asking her more about it and I feel like an asshole saying that. 

I’ve been asking her more regarding her thoughts, she’s been stating that her whole life shes never felt appreciated or important to anyone, saying that she feels like she’s never been anyone’s number 1 person. She says she understand her issues and how to fix them but that she cannot solve them, and that she’s tired of trying to solve them. She’s said that she doesn’t enjoy anything anymore, and that she feels like a burden. I’ve insisted that she should go talk to her friends about it to gain more support but she’s been hesitant on it, saying that she feels it would ruin the dynamic and that she does not want them to see her as anything different after talking about it with them. From what she tells me, her parents don’t seem supportive of her mental health either. 

Last night she said that she’s less dead set on ending her life, today we talked she mentioned friend drama that happened the beginning of this year and said that she feels things are different between us now and that she does not feel as important as she used to. For context I had almost lost my friend group based on something she had stated happened until I got perspectives stating otherwise, during that time I only really had her to talk to until we all talked about it. She said that it had contributed a bit to how she feels but stated that she felt this way her whole life.

I have been waiting for the Government to make a decision on my fitness for work, and they got back to me today. They decided that I am not fit for work in any capacity, which means they will not expect me to look for work, and it means the amount of benefits I receive will increase from my next payment quite substantiality. It's now more money than what I was making when I was previously able to work and worked full time. 

I don't think it's a secret that benefits are extremely difficult to live off, and during the cost of living crisis in the UK I have been really struggling financially. However this news fixes all of those problems, I do not need to worry about anything to do with money, the amount I will be receiving is more than enough for me to live on. I will even he able to start a savings account which I never thought would be possible in my position.

I should be happy, I should be excited, this money should give me lots to look forward to. Like beyond feeling secure all my bills can be paid it means being able to save for a holiday, treating myself to take out, not having to feel guilty about buying a new t-shirt or new shoes.

But I just - don't feel any joy. I am so disconnected to life, I have struggled with suicidal ideation for the past 10 years of life with many failed attempts.

alright reddit, i never open up but i need to now.
first i(16M) am a student in 10th grade, i was kind of a smart kid who gets the best grades in class with just couple hours of studying. in 2-3rd grade(i don’t remember exactly cause i had the same teacher for two years) my dad(late 40s then, now mid 50s) an alcoholic, smoker, abusive to my mother and who knows what else, came one night very drunk, started hitting my mom as always as my 7-8yo self watches without moving a muscle, and my sister(then teen now 20s) is trying to help my mom. at some point he took of his belt and chocked mom so hard she had to stay in the hospital for 2 days after, i just kept standing there looking without doing anything.
next in 8th grade i fell in love for the first time in my life(hopefully last) i believe, the girl was always talking about her problems and always needs to go to the hospital cause she was $uicidal and sometimes because of breathing problems. she is quite the psychopath, her biggest dream is torturing someone until they beg for death. anyways, after couple months i finally wanted to break up because of the amount of red flags, that’s when she pulls the $uicide card. and i could literally do anything but let someone died because of me, i can’t deal with the guilt of letting my mom almost die in front of me and letting someone actually die is terrifying to me.
she did break up with me and got back together couple times(mostly cause im afraid to do something to herself) but now we’ve broken up for months(she’s still alive but she does pull the card sometimes)
now fast-forward to 2-3months ago, dad the alcoholic he is, wanted to hit my mother again, my sister isn’t here for college, my brother is 4yo i don’t want him to see what i saw when i was his age, and for the first time i stood up to him and fortunately he went to sleep after yelling for couple hours without touching her. now that’s one good thing in my shithole of a life.
now, in the present, my dad is not talking to me for over because i didn’t let him once again, and is blaming my mom and accusing her for cheating and teaching the kids to turn up against him, but she always says that he’s our father and we have to respect him.
he’s always drunk now and starting problems because i “stood between him and his wife” but he just never talks to me.
now as i’m writing this he just went to his room after yelling and threatening to break our jaws if i ever stand to him again.
now let’s see what we have, ex threatening $uicide, dad who’s ready to hit(he can’t k!ll ig) us, and constant sadness and hopelessness for the past 7-8 years.
i’m not gonna off myself. as much as i want to, i don’t want my siblings and mother to feel bad because of that. i’m not trying to sound perfect, if i wanted to i would’ve posted this on my main. i want my brother to actually live and want my sister to stop worrying about us. and as much as i hate to admit it, i want my dad to actually fucking love me for once, and see him treat mom like he’s wife.
i’m in pain. i haven’t cried in months and i can’t it fucking hurts so bad in my chest and head. i’m useless and pathetic, i can’t understand anything in school anymore i barely pass my exams. i dont have a hobby not a talent or skill. i’ll im good at is overthinking this shit over and over and over to find a solution that i can’t find. i can’t call the cops cause if he’s in jail we’re going homeless. my mom can’t divorce him for the same reason. i don’t want to live away from my dad. i dont want to live with hin either.
please reddit. just tell me it can get better, im begging i need these words because i can’t live like this anymore. i don’t open up cause i hate sympathy. and i don’t want to trouble anyone i know. you all gonna forget this hopefully.
if you’re reading this and is going through anything. it’ll be okay someday.

I’m getting ready for work. I’ve been up for hours already though, awake in bed thinking about killing myself while my partner slept next to me.
No one knows I have these thoughts. I can’t tell anyone. I don’t want anyone to have to worry about me.
I thought I’d gotten better. I thought I’d never feel this way again. I’m scared, and I’m so tired of fighting.
The person I fell in love with has become the source of all my fear. I love him so much, and it hurts me. Every day I’m terrified of him leaving me. He’s given me no reason not to trust him, but the mere possibility of him one day deciding he’s done with me scares me so much. I hate my brain, I hate it for fixating on some horrible potential pain instead of being fucking normal and letting me live in the present. I’m just so scared of ruining this relationship. I feel sick and panicked just thinking about it. He’s everything to me. He loves me so much, but I’m irrationally, insanely convinced I’m going to fuck this up, even though I don’t want to, even though I’m trying so hard to be good. I’m convinced I’ve already fucked this up. I’m scared that one day he’ll wake up and realize I’m no longer the person he fell in love with. I’m scared that one day he won’t choose me.
I know I should focus on the fact that it hasn’t happened, I know I should be present, I know I shouldn’t let my fears destroy our future, but it’s fucking hard. I’m too ashamed of my insecurity and neediness to ask for reassurance, I’ve already asked too much. I need to fight this on my own, but I don’t know if I can. 
I feel so stupid and worthless and broken for not being able to control myself. I wasn’t like this before. I used to be so confident and secure, I used to be steady, and now I’m a fucking wreck. I want to go back to that person I once was, but I don’t know if I can. I’m so fucking scared every single day.

My mother is extremely abusive and we never had a relationship, my Dad just watches it happen but he has this look on him that makes me think he cares, even slightly.

That's like the first thing i ever learned. I was raped when i was younger and no matter how much i suffered; i was more abused. In school as well; i often was bullied. Everyone likes belittling eachother. Even when you die i think some people will actually like that, they like when others suffer. 

Kindness, love, compassion etc. Is reserved for the strong, the beautiful,  the smart. No one likes ugly incompetent people; they would rather punish them. Just look at whole of human history, the noble classes enjoyed making weaker classes suffer. Take slavery, for example too. People like dehumanizing, punishing,  cruelty other people who they deem as inferior.  

They show compassion only for the beautiful or the powerful. When shown pictures of an unattractive woman it activities in people's brain same place which is responsible for disgust. People literally are disgusted at unattractive people; something to be disposed of; garbage. 

People find people who were raped disgusting as well. Everyone doesn't talk of it but they do.


In conclusion: incompetent, ugly, shitty, weak etc. people like me are thought of as parasites.  Most people don't say it but deep down they do. This is explained by evolutionary psychology; only people who are valuable are liked by majority (thus positive feeling such as love and compassion is shown) parasitic people's lives are often used as a sort of amusement. They are made to suffer for other's enjoyment; a spectacle. Til they die, which again is spectacle. I have gotten DMs encouraging suicide as well; people take enjoyment in these things.",1677522542.0

I don't think i see much anymore. School is ending very soon for me (2 months basically) and i don't have time left anymore. I study and study but shit doesnt work. Grades are shit. Everyday i come back home and its the same. Screams. Nobody understands me, or how i feel. Exams are coming, and generally if i will fail its the end for my future, or whatever. All i really think of is me killing myself after/before those exams. I see nothing in terms of my future. For a few years now its been only getting worser. I'm tired of everybody around me.

So I'm 23 and I'll be 24 in November. My fiance 23 female will be 24 in April. We started dating last year in May and we have been with each other every single day. Since last December she changed and now she doesn't want to meet me. I'm supposed to go abroad for a job and the truth is I'm going because of her and to give her a good life. I know I can't live without her and she knows it too. Yesterday made me uncertain about everything. I usually visit her house to pick her up or to just stay there with her. So I went yesterday as usual and there is this guy who has been living with her and her mother since he was in his teens and he's 35. When I went in the evening he shouted at me in front of her and her mother and they were silent. He told me nit to meet her and that I can't see her everyday. We are not allowed to ga anywhere because people might see us and that it is embarrassing for them but the truth is I come from a higher social standard and have been associating with people from a higher statndard than them. I grew up attending good schools and always had the best. Her on the other is relatively poor but I really  care because I love her and whatever  wants I give her. My problem is I give her everything when she calls I always answer and when she's sick I drop everything and I run to her. I don't receive the same from her. I'm stuck I don't want to lose her but this is killing me. Need advice on this matter. With what's been happening I honestly don't want to live anymore.

I just wanted to share with some of you the short history of my time on this earth. I (23m) had a somewhat traumatic, but also very fun and memorable childhood. I had virtually no friends until high school when I got involved with sports and parties and actually became a very popular and generally liked person. Upon entering my senior year single I decided to seek out a relationship with the girl I found most attractive in the entire school.
And.. it worked. After 8 months of talking, we started dating over the summer and decided to continue when I left for university. I was a prodigal student, nearly perfect gpa and highest SAT score in the school, and had been awarded the maximum scholarship for a state university to study engineering. Really had everything going for me aside from my mental health, which was invisible to even me at the time. 

Long story short, after dropping out twice, countless sleepless nights, major substance abuse, gambling addiction, self isolation, a suicide attempt and plenty of other terrible choices, I felt like my life was over. Despite all of this, my girl still loved and believed in me, and through this I was able to get back on my feet and actually started turning my life back around. I enrolled in trade school and began working as an electrical apprentice, doing my classes at night at my local CC. 

I was so happy this time last year, aside from the fact that my gf was going on a research internship trip for her field of study which we wouldn’t be able to contact each other for about a month over the summer. We knew it would suck , but what convinced me everything was okay was that when we celebrated my birthday (June 8) she told me we’d have our whole lives ahead of us together when she got back. She left a couple days later.
She got back, and said, “it’s not you, it’s me”. After almost 6 years, that’s all there was to it. She never wants to talk to me again and that’s that. 
I didn’t fall off the wagon. I had made too much progress to regress back to square one. In fact, I am doing better than I ever have so far in my adult life. 
But now, it’s all for nothing. I can never love again. I could never value or trust a relationship again. I can’t stand existing with these thoughts and memories I planned to treasure for a lifetime which now haunt me constantly.

I no longer value human life. I am incapable of feeling compassion or anything that it takes to sustain a healthy relationship or even friendship. My thoughts terrify me at times, and it’s only getting worse no matter how hard I try to fix it. 

Come June, I’m going to do the world a favor. I’d do it now, but I can’t afford a firearm yet. Also, I want to graduate, just so I can say I finally did. 

I have only a couple friends and family that will be affected by my absence. I plan to write letters for them. 

When the stars align behind the moon, this June, I will fly and find peace.",1677494533.0

I am pretty sure that I would feel pleasure and that I am capable of it but it is extremely immoral, that is why I want to end my life before I become a monster.

It kinds destroys my life too, I can't look at a cute cat without thinking about cutting it in pieces alive.

I would rather die than getting tortured so I will do that before others get hurt by me.

This is since 2 years in which I thought about how I got mentally, physically and sexually abused as a kid, my brain wants to feel how it felt for them.

I remember my father threatening me with a blade and laughing as I cried out of fear when I was 8, in those years a ""friend"" forced me to show my genitals, he said he would beat me up if I didn't.

There is no future for me, I can't have a family without hurting them.

I have to go to a mental facility everyday and I feel uncomfortable there and have a higher desire to hurt them cause of this.

I'm almost 2 years seperated from my husband who is incredibly abusive, mentally, emotionally,  financially and towards the end physically too. We share small children and I've had to pick up the pieces for them as well as myself while he's had all the support you can think of. 

When we split, I couldn't find anyone that was willing to flat with two small children and myself and I couldn't find full time work that allowed me to afford all the costs of living on my own. I don't have a good relationship with my parents- my mother was finished with being a parent once she met her now husband and I was shipped off to boarding school and passed around her friends houses instead. It was when I was faced with eviction I made the decision to work as an escort (in secret) so I could provide some kind of financial stability for my children though somehow it was leaked to him. 

While he is getting promotion after promotion due to extreme nepotism I'm struggling trying to juggle finishing a degree, childcare, covering all the living costs on my own and at one point working in another city. He ran a very successful smear campaign and most of the people I called friends no longer speak to me. I live in a small town and I'm so isolated. I can't go into the supermarket without being called a whore by people he knows. On the odd occasion I've gone out to socialize I've had drinks poured on me from people walking past. I've been sexually harassed just trying to get into my car. I'm so frightened by just living in this town but I can't leave because he won't let me take our children so I'm stuck in this hellscape.

It just feels like the people who I thought cared about me only have the time of day when they want something from me or they have exhausted all their other options. I'm just trying to do my best with a situation that I never wanted and everyone I turn to slams a door in my face. Every time I reach out I get burned and it feels like every relationship I create now is me giving and everybody taking what they want and leaving. I'm so fucking tired.

Most people describe it as a hole in your heart that you try to fill with meaningless bullshit like friends or money or status but it won't help,because in the your messed up in a way that can never be solved,there's no cure you just have to sit there choking back your tears. Everyday you contemplate running away but you realize you have nothing to run away from,because the thing you want to run away from is yourself,you get through life with its menial tasks wondering what the point of all of it is.
You give yourself false hope but you immediately realize that nothing like that is real.
The one thing that comforts you is fiction,how stupid of you to rely on fiction for your source of comfort because it's not real.
You only ever wanted one thing in reality,for people to look at you,to be normal and loved for who you are but no matter what you messed everything up.
I only wanted for someone to hear me out,to be seen is a natural desire yet I've never thought that anyone could like me.
I guess my problems always started with me.
Why am I so empty?
Why am I condemned to live not enjoying anything?
I cry and cry and cry.
Why won't anything fix me??????????
No one wants to hear you out.
You're corrupt a mistake and you're basically invisible.
Do you live on with hope of a better life or do you die never knowing what happiness is?

My birthday is soon and I don't even have the energy to do anything on that day. I don't have the energy to invite my friends, neither do I have the energy to eat my own fucking birthday cake. I'm literally starving myself for weeks now, how am I supposed to eat cake?? Well, at least I know that I will probably get a birthday cake, that's still better than no cake I guess, I'm not ungrateful ... but that's not the point. The point is that I don't have the energy to allow myself to enjoy that cake. In other words: I don't allow myself to be happy anymore. My life is a total mess and I don't have the willingness to fix it. The fact that I know exactly what would help me rn makes it almost ridiculous that I'm not trying to better the situation for myself, because my needs are so basic, but still here I am, feeling rather dead than alive while rambling some nonsense stuff.

I want to make sure my cats have a good home and then I am going to kill myself. I hope something changes, but it feels like everyday has been worse for years. 

My partner and I of about nine years are clearly splitting up at this point. I wanted to patch things up, but I think it is beyond repair. While I am sure they are most likely undiagnosed bipolar, I am carrying too much weight to live. They say they want therapy but quit they second that it gets difficult. 

They have cheated on me multiple times. They have unresolved issues that I know that I can’t help with and that they don’t want to even talk to me about. I am resented for being a man in this relationship, and I am not sure if it’s because of me personally or if they would rather be a man themselves, or if they would rather be with a woman. 

Then there’s me. The absolute fucking idiot. I am far from perfect and I don’t want to paint this as being all their fault. I was recently out of work for several months and that put a huge strain on them. I have been making good money since, but that did not stop the inevitable fighting that happens when we get drunk. Which is often. I am not sure if we need to be fucked up to cope with life or to be around each other. It’s really fucking sad. I love them so much, but I do feel like it is over.

Last night they came home blackout drunk and told me that they were falling for someone that they worked with. I was hoping that it was at least a girl because they have been avoiding being gay for as long as I have known them. I pressed the issue and found out that it was another man.

But I’m back to suicidal ideation (SI). I have several mental illnesses, clinically diagnosed, on the path to being diagnosed and things I suspect after years of research and talking to people with the illnesses and my last therapist.

I feel broken. I feel irreparable. I feel useless. I’m in my early 20s and haven’t had a first job. I’ve tried to end my life three times. I’ve planned it so many times I can’t keep count. I don’t have my drivers license. I don’t have experience in normal life. I’ve only experienced it from school and obviously that isn’t real experience.

I’ve been abused nearly my whole life, no joke. My parents abused me since the moment I behaved like an actual child. And when it wasn’t my parents it was my other family members, one who sexually abused me for 5-6 years. I’ve been groomed online by old men, abused by people I got into relationships with younger. I was raped again by someone I thought was a friend during lockdown. 

My brain is so fucked up and broken and I can’t fix it. It’s forever changed and irreparable. My abusers get chosen over me. People believe my abusers over me. My abusers get to live happy, normal lives.

I write this lying in bed, in the home with a person I promised I wouldn’t self harm (SH) to. I already broke the promise. In a near breakdown I dug my nails so hard into my arm I ripped up skin. I was clean for three years. At least from SH that had marks. I hit myself and pinched myself since but didn’t consider it SH.

I haven’t cut in three years or more. But I genuinely crave the feeling again. I crave the pain I caused myself. I crave the sting of the cuts and the partial numbness that follows. The buzzing under the skin. The blood beading up on the top layers of skin and fat I cut into. I want to cut so bad again. I want to cut myself so bad that I have giant permanent scars if I survive it. It would leave a permanent reminder of how stupid I am for cutting instead of ending it once and for all. It would leave a reminder of how I cried wolf. How I didn’t succeed.

I thought for once after years of therapy that I wasn’t as bad as my parents and old friends say. But I think they’re right. I threaten suicide and dangle it over their heads like it’ll actually matter if I did it. Like they wouldn’t move on in a month.

I think I deserved to be raped. I think I deserved the years of sexual abuse. I think I deserved all the grooming. All the abuse. All the lies and rumours spread about me. I think they’re all right. I think I’m a worthless piece of shit who deserves the pain I’ve been through. I think I should have to live every time I attempt and be reminded of how cowardly I am for not going fully through with it.

If I learned how to use a gun I think I’d use it to end my life. That’s why I haven’t learned yet. But maybe I will. If I place it and time it right it should end me. But if I don’t, I’ll be permanently disfigured and every time I’d look in the mirror I’d be reminded of how stupid I am for attempting it.

I thought of just walking off into the ocean and getting swept further in by the tide and currents. I’ve fantasised about it. I can’t stand this.

He had a great head on his shoulders and knew who he was, took care of himself, cared about his life and his choices, was kind to all but not a pushover, excelled in school, had a job lined up after college, had hobbies that he was passionate about and good at. he was not like the rest of the guys at the school/the guys I usually associate with --> he was not shallow, was not an asshole, did not think just short term, did not use slang or listen to shitty rap.

whereas me, im fun to party with. i dont know what my genuine interests are other than that. i havent been classy. a lot of the time i get to drunk and then the mental illness starts to show --> ill break down crying, get so drunk im passed out on the floor, get into physical fights with people, or get thrown out of bars. im only the life of the party when drunk. i push the envelope, make bad decisions, sometimes start drama. am desperate. i curse a lot and listen to shitty rap. i wear fake bling and talk about wanting my entire body tattooed. and this is all because i hate myself. 

he saw something good within my heart though, and wanted to fix me. but ultimately, he left, because he couldnt. i want to die, because I finally met someone who i could see myself marrying, who gave me a chance, who wanted it to be me. if only he met me at a different time. i will regret this choice forever. there is no one as beautiful of a soul as him. when is it time to just give up.",1677515127.0

And I asked myself, what are we? What is our purpose?
We are simply beings full of emotions, instincts, searching for a purpose, that in the end it seems there really is no purpose.
Many complain about their lives,
Some want fame, money, attractiveness. We are slaves of modernity.
To think that a few hundred years ago all we did was hunt, gather and sleep, now? We pay for something as simple as water, food, when that had always been free and always within our reach. These days, we buy things we don't need, we seek fame, money, attention from others, status, etc.
It's weird to think about how all of this even came about. 
From all the videos I've seen about the big bang theory and theories about life itself, it seems like the odds of this even happening are extraordinary, as if everything is uniquely calculated.

But that's what we are, aren't we? Beings, full of emotions, instincts, searching for a purpose, an empty purpose, on this planet we call earth. Beyond this there are millions of planets, universes, galaxies and things that are beyond our understanding. Once you understand this, you realize that we are nothing.
So if we are nothing, if nothing is worth anything, maybe everything is possible? Maybe,

I have to spit in a cup cause I keep forgetting how to sallow. 

I’ve tried to kill myself 9 times now. How the fuck am I supposed to explain this obvious bruise around my neck. I didn’t tie the rope properly and now I got rope burn on my neck. I’m too ashamed to go home and have my daughter see me like this. She would say “Daddy hurt?”

 I miss my daughter, but she deserves a better father. I miss my wife, my real wife. I can’t go home like this so after I leave urgent care I’m going back to the motel and hopefully I can drive myself to work tomorrow. I got a full body scan and the lady said “You have permanent brain damage. You already had some minor brain damage from something else. Would you like to tell me what that’s from?” 

I didn’t tell the truth. I said I fell of a ladder. Even though my frontal lobe that’s damage. Ladder injuries are to the side of back of the head. She knew I was lying but why would I tell the truth? The minor brain was from hitting my head in things like the ceramic plate I have under the bed, walls, and the floors and according to my mom the umbilical cord got wrapped around my neck when I was born so that caused temporary low  oxygen levels. 

But anyways. Last night I called an Uber and the driver was all like “You’re a fighter Eric. Don’t give up we’re almost there.” His positivity was getting on my nerves. Like drive.

Even while depressed, you have a way to be excited.  Smoking some weed, sneaking out, your first few times somebody is into you...

And you get older.  You go through more shit.  More traumatic shit.  The stakes raise.  You realize those opportunities were either wasted, or society never actually had them for you.  Guilt and shame consume you.

And running becomes so hard.  When you're down on your luck, that's it.  No socializing or fun in a country that hates free things.  No amount of your D.O.C. and alcohol can put a dent in those feelings, not when you've done them for 5-10+ years.  All those special places become tainted.  The music.  The travels.  All the events and activities you can touch...

All of this madness propped up with the (not at all empty) threat of state-sanctioned violence, financial ruin, and loss of freedom... Should one say the game is bullshit too loudly.

I'll never understand this, this way we organize this inhumane system.

But the consequences of disagreement, no matter how peaceful and decent, remain scarier than any trauma or depression.

So I guess I'll just pool my time into technology and some exercise again, unable to even get minimum wage again in this job market.  Maybe living vicariously through screens and code is all we can dream of.  It sure beats the world outside.  Attempting to make new friends, new partners, and find a place in society once more...

Maybe this is all I'm meant to achieve.

A meager existence.  One fueled by the occasional drinking party, and some trips into our dwindling nature.

I feel both saddened and excited for every advancement in VR and AI.  An incredible desire to hide in the arms of that false bunker.  To scrape together enough money and space to *pretend* that it's okay.  Maybe if you hide deep enough, it will be.  I sure hope so.",1677493994.0

The meat of this post and overall point however, is further below, starting at the header text.**

I first tried committing suicide in 2016. Then I had the best opening ever to kill myself in 2021, but didn't take it.

I regret both of these failures immensely, I'm beyond tired of being here and continuing to exist.

I'm endlessly frustrated by the brick wall waiting for me at every corner I turn, whether I'm actually trying or not trying at all. Because as much as I wish I could stop existing, I don't want to die.

Not many actually want death. Many who crave suicide do so more because they no longer want to experience the negatives of their circumstances, escapable or not.

Why have *I* craved suicide since I was 14? Aside from the world being hot garbage, and the species being hopeless and cruel, the primary motivator for my suicidal desires is actually pretty narcissistic.

I won't delve too deep into it, I can never usually explain everything in a way that captures the actual pain of it all. But putting it simply, my mood and spirit have deteriorated rapidly because of envy, because of skillessness, and because of incapability.

Wanting to draw, or make music, or make games, or at least make custom content for games. I've run into so many pitfalls trying to pursue these things, it's unreal, and a lot of it has to do with the way my mind is structured. One, because I can't handle failure, and two, I seem to have lost my sense of passion.

In January of 2022, I made a last-ditch effort to get myself into drawing, and it ultimately failed. Even though I went through a handful of drawing courses, and sketched a couple pages of figures, it was for nothing. I had to force myself to do it all, and I dreaded the idea of continuing. It felt like school. Painful, unfulfilling, pointless, hopeless.

And I'll try finding out what's wrong, and why I'm like this. And I'm usually met with the simple answers that apply more to healthy people.

*""It's just not for you.""*

*""Quit. If you don't have passion you're wasting your time. Plain and simple.""*

*""Drawing might not be your thing.""*

I'm poking at the hornets nest of people opposite of myself, people with passion, real artists, making an ass out of myself because I don't know what else to do. I don't know what's going on with me. Why, and how? How can I crave something, yet be so hopelessly unable to even strive for it?

I don't want to elaborate on why I want to draw, or create in general, but just know there is a lot in my head I wish I could put into the world in the ways I desire.

Because of my circumstances, I'm rather limited. It's mostly been coping by thinking out loud while pacing in an empty area. In the backyard at night, in the garage, or even just my room. I'll try reaching out for help or advice on Reddit, as though any professionals exist on this site. (Art professionals can't help me, I'm talking about medical professionals.)

My situation of complete inability to do what I wish I could, or work towards it, has all but crippled my spirit in general. I've drained to a point where nothing is interesting anymore.

Music is getting boring, repetitive. I'll witness art I would've liked, but I'll only long for the abilities it took to create it and lament the lack of my own. Interacting with other people is something I've come to despise, feeling valueless in the absence of any abilities, or anything remarkable or at least noteworthy about myself to bring to the table. The idea of continuing life, getting a more permanent job, trying to sustain myself and become independent, it just sounds awful. Boring, and requiring more effort than I could give without buckling.

***

# So, why don't I just go to therapy? Or see a doctor? Or talk to someone in general?

Well first off, I've definitely tried talking to people such as family and friends. I regret it. Someone being there doesn't help with these issues. I need the problems gone. Talking about this to anyone who gives half a shit about me only serves to waste their time and cause them pain. They don't know how to fix this any more than I do. Last year, I decided I'm never reaching out for help again, for the sake of them.

Second off, I'm 20 and I still live with my parents. It's pretty embarrassing, all my siblings were excitedly out by 18. I don't have a job so no income, I don't have transportation, obviously I have no skill so nothing I can do well to make money, and I don't have independence. On top of all of this, my parents aren't the type to be open minded to mental problems. After hearing the horror stories of how they treated my mentally ill sister, there's no way I'm opening up to them. Never. They aren't abusive, but I don't want to be here. I have no way of escaping that doesn't involve some great effort that'd probably push me over the edge into the pit of suicide anyways. All while being that age where if everything sucks, no one will take your issues seriously because you ""haven't lived life yet"". I'm not going to if I can't get out of this pit.

Third off, since I have no income, and since this is the United States, I can't get professional help. No therapy, no doctors, no medication. All I have in my pocket is $300. As much as I'd love to book it and attempt freeing myself, life isn't fiction. Having to face the world alone as a skilless shut-in 20 year old with virtually no knowledge of how to sustain myself in most areas, it just sounds like a different if not worse hell for me to hop into.

Three consecutive years, of strong non-stop suicidal ideation. And every time I try to dig at the roots, it's another nightmare.

I don't want to die never knowing how to create the things I wish to create. I don't want to kill myself and hurt my family. But I also don't want to live and rot into a pathetic disappointment and hurt them worse either.

Every day that passes, the idea of shooting myself sounds less and less intimidating. I don't know what to do, and I'm starting to hurt myself on impulse. I think I gave myself a concussion.",1677473623.0

I’m in so much pain. People don’t understand it. I’ve been accused of just being lazy, but I’m in agony. I can barely function. And it’s all from trauma. So, I don’t know when it’s going to happen for sure, but it’s going to be me that gets me. I’ve been making plans, trying to figure out how to make sure my family will be okay and that I don’t leave them in a mess.

The inevitability of it hovers over me like a dark shadow, growing in size and darkness the closer it gets. Right now I’m too scared. But one day, that’ll go away.

I have failed at this 8 times, after all. It’s got to go well eventually. Part of that failure, though, stems from not really wanting to die. I just want the pain to stop, and nothing is working. I have severe PTSD, some would call it CPTSD. I’ve been in and out of therapy for years, with different therapists. I’ve taken medication. I’ve run half marathons. I’ve gone back to school. I’ve written books, trying to give my pain a purpose and help people—they went nowhere. I pray. 

I have three children. I want them to know it’s not their fault. It’s not! It’s not! I *want* to be here for them. I would love to see them grow up, I would love to be the mother they deserve. I *want* to be so bad. But this pain is something that is just becoming more and more unbearable. I barely function. My house is a disaster because I have no energy to clean. They deserve better than me, they’re so wonderful. They deserve better, and for all of my effort, I am not getting better. My brain, right now, feels like it is on fire.

I’m sick and tired of people telling me, the reason I’m single, pushed, ignored, teased, targeted, never been flirted with or asked out EVER, is because I’m black. NO ITS NOT. There’s lots of black women treated with respect just cause they’re beautiful and their race plays no part (Rihanna, Janelle Monáe, Beyoncé etc).

I really want to become a model (editorial, commercial and catalog) since I love photography, fashion and trying on clothes. Modelling was the perfect job. However, I tend to realise people who want to work in that industry HAVE to be super attractive or unique; not average or ugly (which I am). Even people compliment other people saying “You look like a model” which is saying someone is pretty. Nobody has ever said that to me, little kids run away from me or stare and avoid me. Kids in my school don’t even know I exist even though I am in their class. If they do know me, they are either friends/acquaintances with me or ignore me and target me. Other women are treated with more respect. People compare me to male rappers (Trippie Redd) and not female ones. I’m called masculine and it’s not about my race. Lookism affects me more than racism.

Acting is a little better but people still mock ugly people and bully them online.

I didn't tell her about it and she’s  mad. I get it, I do. All I wanted to do was make money to try and buy us a house. So she’s hurt and I can feel her drifting away from me and it feels terrible. All I keep thinking about is the 500k she'd get from my SGLI. I just feel like a failure, constantly. I just feel like I always have a way of screwing things up, when I don't mean to. I've always seen pages like this where people go and just wear their emotions on their sleeves and complain to try and feel some sort of sympathy from internet strangers. Truth is, I'm not seeking sympathy from anyone. I feel like I haven't accomplished anything and my biggest fear, is my son growing up thinking I'm a failure. I haven't decided what I'm going to do yet. I did put my gun up to my chin a couple nights ago, but I don't wanna make a mess for staff at this air force inn while I'm on TDY. I mean in the end its like my family can have some financial security to at least buy a house and I become just another statistics.",1677474909.0

I try to be positive, be grateful, sit in the sun, workout, whatever.. I try so hard. But something in me just keeps gnawing at me.. it’s like an empty space inside. I am so afraid of letting myself surrender into it, because one time it got really bad. And I almost didn’t make it out alive. I’m not in that same head space now, but I fear it. I fear the pain of it. If I’m being honest, the only reason I’m here in life is because I have pets. They need me, and I love them so so much. I couldn’t break their hearts like that, but when I feel really gloomy like I do now, I like to think about suicide… about death. It brings me a sense of peace knowing the suffering to life ends. That one day, I’ll be free. Limitless. Weightless. One day I’ll be on the other side without all the suffering. 

I want to have a good life, but why is there so much pain? I really really try to heal, let go of the past, transcend… but I always become sad again..

And why doesn’t the universe help me out? I just want some friends.. some love.. is that so much too ask for??

Is it suicidal to day dream of it? I do that sometimes, I imagine someone actually caring about me. It feels nice. I imagine floating in space and being free..

Anyway, idk what the point of life is.. it sucks. I could feel neutral and just be happy to think of it ending, not always in a sad way either.. sometimes it’s just nice.",1677473272.0

my meds were increased and ive been put back into weekly therapy, but now im experiencing something entirely new- every time i sit down and walk someone through my thought process, they go silent for a bit before telling me something like, ""yeah, that makes sense"". while it's somewhat validating to be told that my cynical, nihilistic worldview is apparently a completely realistic mindset, the confirmation that these feelings are real is, understandably, disheartening. 

i dont really know where to go from here. my mother told me she'd kill herself if i commit, which wouldn't be fair to my sibling, so i'm at a bit of a loss. i guess ill just be the family tamagotchi for the rest of my life until their sympathy eventually runs out and im turned out on the streets? honestly, i care a little bit less about what happens to me with each passing day.",1677486804.0

I feel guilty spending money on myself. I feel bad spending money and having money. I HATE MYSELF SO FUCKING MUCH. I'm such a loser.



my therapist said I should tell you guys how I feel. so here goes. 

I feel unloved, alone, and scared. I feel like no one knows or cares about my emotions because, when I was a kid I felt like my emotions and feelings didn't matter or were wrong. 

at a point I started to feel like your love was conditional, and after that I began to start to give up, when I talked to dad about listening to me more, and that I feel like no one hears, knows, or cares about me nothing changed. X2

 I started to really give up, went through the motions, just tried to make everyone else happy.

i grew up afraid of mom, especially after she said she hated me and wished I'd never been born after I cheated on math.

(I have weird issues with woman because of how my parents reacted when they found out I saw porn.)

I feel that if something does not change, I will not live past 40 and if I do you will have no relationship with me by then, if we follow this road.

I shouldn't have to try to be noticed

(my dad)used to make me laugh whenever I was CLEALRY NOT IN THE MOKD FOR LAUGHING and very clearly need comfort or love. what a miserable excuse for an emotional fucking kill me I just want to die so badly I never should have existed, I wish I was someone more cabelbe of making anything right or good for my family. but nope I'm just a big ol fucking lazy disappointing loser. I wish that this was a nuclear family. I shouldn't be here.

Last year my best friend from kindergarten overdosed and it sent me off the rails and I started using again.
Sobered up and everything was good.
But in the span of a week I lost my job,
Got cheated on and lost my fiancé,
Totaled 3 cars, and genuinely couldn’t handle anything.
I’m not religious but I think this might be the doing of god, Now if anyone can explain the science behind it I would appreciate it.
I’m 5”11 weigh 114 pounds and don’t have a giant tolerance.
This weekend on Friday night I decided to commit.
I took 30 1mg footballs & a bunch of phenibut, drank 3 full bottles of crown, 2 four lokos, did a couple (possible fake) percs, and any other pills I could find in my medicine cabinet. I laid down with regular show on the tv. I was ready to leave I was done and couldn’t handle life anymore.
I just woke up a few hours ago,
How and why did this happen?
I am the definition of a light weight with a low tolerance. How after everything I took did I just sleep for 2 days and wake up perfectly refreshed and feeling fine with a minor stomach and head ach.
I’m not sure I’ll do this again, I feel like waking up gave me a reality check and I think There’s a reason why I woke up. But I’m curious if there is a scientific reason as to why I didn’t succeed. Is this a common occurrence? Did I underestimate how much it takes to overdose? I did find throw up on the floor tonight when I woke up and maybe that had something to do with it. But I’m just confused and would like to know what went wrong.

TL:DR took an ungodly amount of mixed meds and alcohol and somehow just slept for 2 days and woke up fine, how did this happen?

We got into a bit of a heated debate about our current situation and she said ""If we stop talking or fall out I'll kill myself, I'll do it"". As she was saying it she started walking down the hall to the kitchen where we have all of our pills. 

She got some pills out and I had to physically wrestle her to get them off her. It was such a fight. 

I felt so traumatised & shaken up. I had a panic attack. 
I immediately got a plastic bag and filled it with all of the pills I could find in our apartment. I looked everywhere. The bag is full now. When I had calmed down I told her, please do not to that again. She responded with ""that's what I WILL do if we were to fall out.""

Now, she's fine. Literally making a grilled cheese in the kitchen. I'm staying with her until she falls asleep, but wtf? Have I just been traumatised because she wanted to be manipulative?

I've had this thought for years and years. If I were to make a case to my maker I think I'd have some solid points. 

I just have had the worst luck for the vast majority of my life. I almost feel as if I am a sitcom character. I was legit voted the most likely to fall down the stairs in high school. I lost my father at a young age and largely grew up in borderline poverty, my mother is wonderful but still broke. I was bullied and constantly injured. I have food allergies that D/Q me from the military and that make it difficult to even eat out.  I was mugged two years ago, had a bad eye injury with it, went on light duty because of it, and because of the loss hours and medical costs I lost my home, they never caught the guys. I have always been known as being melancholy, a lot of people call me Eeyore. 

Ever have a friend that gets a flat tire on the way to a job interview, brakes their leg the day before the big boy scout trip, or the guy that spilled a bottle of water on his pants before the first date? Well that's me, anytime something comical seems to happen my friends kind of shrug and say stuff like that would only happen to me. I genuinely feel as if I have a higher power controlling my life. I've felt this way for years, I've told my therapist and some close people to me. Too many coincidences. 

I've tried medications, I've been 5150'd in the past, I tried the church, and support groups. The meds worked somewhat but the side effects were always rougher than the other results, I shit myself at work, I couldn't get a boner, I became a zombie, and had awful cotton mouth. I'm tired of the ""lets see what sticks"" when it comes to physc meds, I've tried them during multiple phases in my life. 

Recently (as in since covid has ""ended""), I began going to the gym making physical improvements, eating healthier, I ski weekly, and make a real effort to get out of my house and due positive things. I stopped drinking nearly as much. You have to believe I have been trying to become undepressed. I think I'm doing everything I can, new job, going out, healthy habits. I even have a patent pending. God damnit I'm trying to break the cycle. 

I had a huge crush on this girl at work for the past two years, my best friend a fuck boy knows this and proceeds to screw her after she's had too many, this was January. I began dating a girl albeit a rebound, but she broke things off with me, turns out she left me for the same friend- they went out when we were still together. Fine- fuck me right, I don't talk to either of them anymore but the wound is still there. Fuck it, not dating, deleted all the apps. Copy and check. 

I met a girl at chess night the other week. I meet weekly with a group of good guys for Chess, never thought I'd meet a girl there. Really great girl, we hit it off she's beautiful we have the same interests, she's moving to my town for grad school. I go to trivia night each week with a good group of friends We went I took her to trivia and we placed in second, great date night kissed her at the end, we're supposed to hangout the next night. I legit tell the boys I like this girl, please do me a favor We do, meet up at a bar, I have 1-2 beers and my friend from trivia his hitting on her, blatantly. Putting his hands on her, trying to kiss her ear. I tell him to back off, he doesn't, he's smashed whatever. I kissed her earlier in the night. I tell him ""fuck off, she's with me"" not in front of her, he squires up with me and tries to fight, we both backdown. He thinks I'm trying to fight. Blows up, tells everyone a different story. Continues to hit on the girl, whatever. I decided I'll stay out just to keep him from doing anything. I'm supposed to give the girl a ride home, I'm sober their drunk, she went with him. The guy is a real snake in the grass, he has the nick name of ""Shitty Joe."" He's been on double secret probation at work for a while here. But I tolerate him, he had a pediatric code that bothered him, I was the only one to call him and ensure he was okay, took his shift on my off day so he could have a day to rest (this was months ago). Texts her a very different version of the story the morning afterwards... She bails on her plans. Just a devastating gut punch, like dude I introduced you to her less than 24 hour ago when she was on a date with me, eat shit. 

I'm known at work for being stoic and funny guy. I think I have a strong work ethic. I am a paramedic. My dream was to be a doctor as a kid, but how many doctors due you know with single mothers right? My back up plan was firefighting, an on the job injury disqualifies me from that now, I just lifted someone funny. I was nominated for paramedic of the year, and this past year I even got a ""Field Save."" This is where you perform CPR and get somebody all the way back, a lot of people worked really hard for this result, and I'm proud to be even a minor part. But the sheer trauma of the job is harsh, I've seen the worst of humanity, I'm known as my towns black cloud. My partner at work and I say ""When people call 911 they want results."" I know I'm decent in this field, but the low pay, long hours, and the mundane horror is slowly killing me. I've seen so many children die and suffer, senior citizens left on the floor to rot for days, suicides, debilitating strokes, and violet crimes. I've declared over 30 people dead in my career, nothing really prepares to tell parents that their hanging teenager in the closet is gone, or that their husband died on the toilet after we just did CPR on him for 20 minutes and dragged him into the living room. I swear to god  I can feel her hands on my back as she hugs me and cries after I tell her that her husband is dead each night. Some nights I can't sleep just because of the nightmares. I know I have the starting of PTSD and I've tried quite a bit of the helps.. I dream of suicide nightly. 

I landed a new job, I'm supposed to start the day after tomorrow, I just came down with a gnarly stomach flu, I am too sick to drive. Fevers, chills, NVD, the whole 9. I came to my mom's house to drop my cat off, so that if I go through with this he'd be taken care of. But while here I'm too sick to even drive. Also with that the change of insurance means I can't see my current therapist- just a side note. But the timing of all of this just feels like its from the divine. 

I just checked my snapchat, that awesome girl I was telling you about is on a date with my work nemesis. Just god damnit. That's three girls that have picked my friends over me in 2023 alone, I have no idea what I'm doing wrong, but I just feel like they were placed in my life to make me feel awful. I moved to this shitty town for my now ex girlfriend 3 years ago.  I'm not a bad looking guy and I've had decent relationships in the past, I've never hit anyone, I have no idea what I've done wrong in my life but I just want it to end. 

Too many things have lined up, a higher power wants me to do this, why would I not listen? What can I do? How do I end this pain? 

I've been a paramedic for over 5 years, I know how to do it. I know what's a cry for help as opposed to legit. I won't make a mess or a mistake when I do it. I have to tighten some things up before all of this goes down.

If a higher power can put this all on me at once, then it can take it away. I'm just writing this so when the eventually find my body I'll have some document pointing to his. I just needed to put it somewhere in writing, even rereading this I feel more sane and justified.",1677480280.0

fuck that. if you won’t listen to me ill fucking take all my medications at once. it’s a horrible way to go, but either i die and never have to live another way in this horrible body. no more pain. nothing. no nausea, no feeling like a burden or like I’m asking too much. no fatigue. nothing. or, i chicken out and it’s just an attempt. an attempt that might actually get my parents to listen. either way… there isn’t a downside besides how horrible this method is. respiratory depression and heart failure sounds terrifying, but hey some of my medications have drowsiness as a strong side effect, maybe I’ll be asleep the whole time. 

this all depends on if i get up the nerve to do it. with the amount i have right now, it would be more than enough to kill me. either i die and never have to be in a pain again, or ill finally get someone to take my suffering seriously. maybe this way ill actually convince them to let me take a break from college, because if being severely suicidal and told I’m supposed to be in the hospital wasn’t enough for them before… to prove i really was suffering and couldn’t handle it… maybe this will convince them…

either way? i get some semblance of relief. finally some fucking relief.",1677478448.0

568,Suicide note thoughts?,3,11cwu8k,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11cwu8k/suicide_note_thoughts/,3,"Hi there 

I drafted this and would be grateful for feedback. I want to be so conscious of my family and their feelings. 

Could you kindly review and think of us provides an explanation? Naturally it won’t be comforting but I need to be able to give my family some form of closure 
This about my personal life events and not a reflection on my family.

So far it is as follows:  

In the event of my death, I want to express my immense gratitude and love for my incredible and amazing family.

The bond we have shared is immense and beautiful. I appreciate all of you so incredibly much, even if I don’t always say it. 

I have enjoyed so many years of absolutely blissful happiness and I’m sad that the last year has had such a negative impact on my life and drawn me to reckless habits such as self harming and use of alcohol to mediate the betrayal and shame I feel from the fallout of my relationship. 

I care so deeply about you, and all of my kind beautiful friends and it is heartbreaking that I don’t have the ability to overcome my own personal hurt as I know this will cause pain.

Quite frankly, if it was not for how much I have a pure and deep love for you all I would be dead already.  I love you from the bottom of my heart.

Dad, I love how many people comment that were two peas in a pod. We are so in tune. You have always inspired me to reach for the skies. I can’t stop myself talking about you because of how much I idolise you. 

Mum - I am eternally thankful for having such a beautiful mother to share everything with and I know how hard this year has been on you and you have always listened when I’m crying, ranting and being a lunatic. Your soul is pure.

(Brother) - you are the best sibling anyone could ask for. Your thoughtfulness and kindness is unparalleled and I would fucking murder anyone who hurt you.

I love our family to my core and I’m so sorry that some man has managed to mentally destroy me. I think because of our familys strong and unquestionable bond I can’t comprehend the betrayal I still feel to this day from someone I loved so deeply.  

I’m sad to lose the version of myself who saw kindness in people first. I had such faith in people and now my first reaction is that everyone is selfish and you’re alone. I don’t trust people anymore, I question myself and what the point of the world is.

The one thing I would ask, if I am dead, that none of my family or friends carry any weight of responsibility for not intervening. My death is single-handedly on (name).

I don’t doubt he will tell a different story. I believe he thought he loved me, but but he has lied and twisted facts dozens of times. I thought I was going crazy. I let it go because I really loved him so deeply until I became scared for my own safety. 

This is a man who said he was so sorry I wouldn’t get to experience the amazing man he would be after his domestic violence course, only to be told by my female liaison officer after we broke up that he dropped out a few days later. A man who called me childish, pathetic, and  - on some occasions - how much my actions had publicly embarrassed him.  A man who forced sex on me after we broke up even though I said no so we “could enjoy one last time” to then throw vitriol at me when I came later to collect my things. I trying to be conscious of his future. I only filed a report, rather than take him to court. Only in the event he hurt another woman would I proceed. I didn’t badmouth him to a single mutual friend until after his behaviour when I collected my things.

The saddest part is he’ll see still himself as a victim for, and I quote, “the hell I’ve put him through these last few months”. 

I didn’t want to ruin his life. Well guess what, he’s fucking ruined mine. 

I’m heartbroken that some man has driven me to this point that I have to even write this but the world is unfair and I just got a shit hand from the romantic card deck even though I have four aces from my friends and family.

I am so deeply sorry I’m not stronger. Please be assured 32 years of my life were incredible and although I am filled with sadness now I look on my life until this point with complete joy and gratitude.

Please cuddle (family pet)for me.

Dad, Mum, (brother) I love you so fucking much but I can’t do this anymore. I went my whole life thinking I’d be alone and made my peace with it and the first man I truly let into my life betrays me.  

I can’t look at my dead soulless eyes in the mirror one more day and ask when will it get better.  

I love you forever and always

570,Passive and active ideation. Can I keep one from becoming the other again?,2,11d43fw,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11d43fw/passive_and_active_ideation_can_i_keep_one_from/,0,"I was passively suicidal for a while. Over time things ate away at me, and then things were no longer so passive to say the least. I’ve talked to people, I’ve taken a step back, and I have been able to think things through and I no longer have any active plans. 

My question is probably one that nobody can answer for me but I’ll ask it anyway: right now I feel, even at rock bottom, that I am confident I won’t reach the point of the ideation becoming active ever again so long as I can navigate things ok while I stabilize and begin to seriously address what is going on with me. Am I just being totally naive in saying that? Previous to this episode of my life I would have told you, honestly, that I could never envision myself having any active ideation. That makes me feel like I’m foolish to ever make any claim about the likelihood of having active ideation, but in some ways it feels like getting that bad and being reeled back in has in some way helped me know who I am but clearly I underestimated things before now so I don’t know what to think. 

I guess I know that right now I’m still on shaky ground so I don’t want to take anything lightly. That much I can say for sure. Does anything I’m saying make any sense?",1677476817.0
571,I want to live but I don't know how to deal with suicidal ideation,6,11csebu,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11csebu/i_want_to_live_but_i_dont_know_how_to_deal_with/,1,"It's confusing and frustrating to me... I don't think I had a difficult childhood and home life aside from the occasional asian household 'abuse.' As for my academics, I excelled in school and graduated with latin honors just last year. I've never not had friends and never had problems with socializing. I landed a great and well paying job a month after I graduated. I don't want to go on saying more unproblematic and healthy things about myself because it's no longer relevant to my case. I simply do not feel happy anymore. Ever since I started having symptoms of suicidal ideation when I was 11 years old, it all went downhill- in a mental health sense, at least. I never had the chance to go to therapy and get diagnosed because of stigma so I never understood why I have uncontrollable thoughts that keep telling me to kill myself. I seem to look like I have a good life but why does my mind keep telling me otherwise? And right now, I don't think I'm financially capable of getting medical help because therapy is super expensive in my country and that would just make a huge dent on my monthly budget. 

Now that there's a bit of context, I started writing my suicide note last night and I'm almost done. I decided to turn to Reddit because I feel so evil for wanting to ask help from my loved ones- I don't want to burden them with the fact that I constantly think of ways to kill myself. They have their own mental health struggles and I don't want to add more weight. I need advice from an outsider's perspective; from someone who doesn't know me.

Like I said, I'm almost done with my note. I don't understand why I now feel so calm. So calm that I'm ready to die, but also so calm that I'm torn in between. How do I deal with thoughts that have been here for 12 long years? And what do I do with my note? Would there be any tips that have helped you or someone you know control such thoughts? I want to die so badly but now that I've temporarily felt peace (something I haven't felt in such a long time,) I feel like I want to live a few more years. But, I don't know where to start.

Note: there may be things I've mentioned here that seem incomplete. I wrote this while taking a breather from writing my suicide note so my mind's a mush right now. Apologies for that.  

Note 2: I have a plan on how I'm going to do it, no date on when exactly. But, I'm currently on a leisure trip in the US, away from my home country, so I'm going to do it once I get home. This is so that I won't have to bother my parents with unnecessary international fees. I still have time to change things but I really don't know where to start.",1677444891.0

I wish life was like a video game, where you can just die and drop out easily. A game over screen would be nice. Maybe a big fat sign that says “you died” just to rub it in too. That would be a satisfying ending. But that’s not what’s happening or what’s going to happen. I’m going to be yelled at until I’m lowered into the ground. And then they’ll talk shit about me because I can’t talk back.

It’s crazy how good I have it. I’ve never had a real problem in my entire life. Which is probably why everyone’s called me a liar and told me I’m faking. Proving them wrong by becoming a corpse would be even more satisfying.

I’m not saying I want to die for that reason though. I’m saying it because I can’t find a reason to live. 
1) I feel absolutely disgusted with myself. I hate that I’m autistic because I have no social skills and that gets me into so much shit. And then my body feels disgusting. I always feel like I’m too fat and that I don’t belong in my body. 
2) I finally found someone who cares for me but he’s 48. And I’m not even an adult. And I’m very aware of the fact that he could just be manipulating and using me. But I don’t want to believe it. Even more so that I wasn’t old enough to consent when we were met up. So I feel so freaking messed up about this all. Just an emotional roller coaster, where I feel like dying when he’s not around.
3) My family and friends never believe me. Or when they do “I’m just overreacting”. Because everyone has it worse. I’m just trying to get attention.

And I’m so mad and so tired of everything. I want to just disappear. And it would be so freaking convenient if someone could just murder me. I don’t want to do this shit anymore. (Excuse my language.)",1677461688.0

I can't bring up how I'm feeling because that would involve reliving that pain and a difficult conversation I don't have the emotional reservoir to deal with. I think about just blocking him on everything and never talking to him again, but he was my best friend and everything I wanted in a partner for so many years. I truly believe he has good intentions and doesn't want to cheat again, which is why I gave things another go. But these unspoken words are literally killing me.

Mother thought having a child at 40 years old was a good idea, while Father had stage 3 terminal lung cancer so he died before he could even see me graduate grade school. 

No more breadwinner, had no money to buy food with. Mother can't find a job she's too old, I barely have the qualifications to even get one. Hell even with a degree, getting a decent job or any job at all is more of a dream here. Everyone born here has to move away or else they will die.

To make ends meet Mother had no choice but to borrow money from old friends and Father's associates and she would sell everything she'd find, there wasn't a single day we weren't under a huge debt.

""it's for your education"" she kept saying, I always felt like she bit off more than she could chew. 

Born alone, single child. Miracle they say but very lonesome. Being the sole child included a bunch of pressure, always being told to push further. When Father died the pressure increased, Its now similar to a hydraulic press slowly crushing you to death.

These days, I have no energy anymore. Its all taken away by a mountain pile of school work, particularly homework. And they always wonder why I look so dead inside. The only thing I have now is stress and a lack of sleep. 

Suicide has been an option I've been thinking of two years ago, ever since everything went downhill. The fact that a huge storm hit here and destroyed everything didn't help.

The only things keeping me sane is my dog, and video games. My only source of happiness. 

Right now after a day passes I plan to exit the house, leaving only a note. Once I leave I'll jump off a high point far from home. 

One day should be enough to say goodbye to everyone, settle any loose ends, and manage my belongings. 

And to clarify, I do not hate my Mother. She is a good person at heart who always worked hard to keep us alive. 

The thing I've hated was her indecisiveness, stubbornness, and inability to listen to advice or my feelings. Telling someone to keep being positive isn't gonna work out yknow. 

I'd think I'm doing her a favour for decreasing the costs for groceries. As every year just keeps getting worse, I've become really numb to platitudes and false promises of happiness. I may not be able to have a family and experience true love, but it's better not to live in this sad rock floating in space.

I'm tired of all my problems and hiding my depression. I am a silent individual, haven't screamed in rage as much as I should've and now my emotion bottle is going to shatter.

Even if money wasn't a problem, I would still be alone. Perhaps I think its way better for me to leave, statistically and emotionally. Call me a quitter or a lazy ass, I deserve it. Can't handle it anymore honestly.

603,I Attempted 3 Times Yesterday...,1,11d1icx,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11d1icx/i_attempted_3_times_yesterday/,0," 

For the past 4 months, I've been severely depressed because of a lot of things going on in my life. I've truly tried everything I could ever do to make my life better, but no matter what I do, nothing seems to work out. Every single time I mess it up, and even though I have amazing and supportive friends, I never tell them anything because I've simply lost all hope. I know that if I tried, nothing would be fixed. I've given up on life, and that's okay. There are no problems with that.

So yesterday, I attempted to hang myself three times. I did everything right, got into position, and everything was going right finally. When I put the rope around my neck, I felt a bit happy. But I couldn't do it. I tried to do it, but I was truly tired. But I couldn't. I was too scared to just handle it for a few seconds so I could black out. After that, I broke down, and for the first time in 4 years, I shed a couple of tears. I thought I had lost the ability to cry, but I felt relieved that I at least still had some of it left.

After that, I sat down for a couple of hours, and I couldn't handle my feelings and my thoughts of how much of a failure I am. So I attempted again, but this time, after removing the rope that was around my neck, I felt devastated for a second, and after that, nothing. The only thought that came to mind was ""shut the fuck up! Stop being dramatic."" So I sat also for an hour.

After sitting for a while, the same thing happened. I couldn't handle it and tried it for the first time. I believe this one was the closest to blacking out. I started to see noise everywhere after 2 seconds of hanging, my body was losing control, I lost the feeling of my body, and started to hear some noise. And I couldn't just do it. What a failure. I will probably get a bottle and chug it until I lose all sense of reality and then attempt again. Hopefully, this time, I will do something right.

I apologize for all of that. I'm not looking for help, so please don't recommend talking to a professional or someone. I just needed to write it somewhere I felt acknowledged and not hurt the people around me. And I'm sorry for my bad English; it's not my mother language.

Everything was good, but when I was 3 y.o my life has changed. My dad hits me and my mom almost everyday. At 7 y.o. I called the police because my mom was bleeding, and he calls me bad words.

In school I was bullied, because our family wasn't rich. They gave me lunch from the bin, open bathroom door when I was there. My own uncle disowned me because of fact I am transgender. When I went to middle school my deadname was posted on school spotted, they wish that I will be dead soon. I hope so too. They even make fun of me because of my suicide attempt. I know I'm too stupid to even kill myself but they didn't have to tell me that. I was 3 times in mental hospital and I am still sick. I hate that place. No one cares about me anyway, so why would I continue being alive? Ok, my mother tell me that she will be very very sad if I die, but it's too fucking late for this shit. She isn't good person.

I’m not suicidal right now, I’m not sure I am ever actually suicidal, but I fantasise frequently, visualise it and every once in a while I initiate. I always pull back though. I wouldn’t say I come close even. I’ve never been in a hospital, and I’ve never injured myself in any significant manner. 

I’m wondering if it’s “normal” to fantasise about your own death like that? Or visualise suicide or lethal accidents without any intent to act on it?

The day after I do initiate, I usually feel a strange sense of appreciation. Like the air feels cleaner, and food tastes better. Is this common? Do other people get this “bliss”?

The times I do initiate, I always do so more or less on impulse. I get the idea/visualise it, and decide to go for it within 5 minutes. Do other people do this? I feel no need to alert my loved ones, or leave a note or anything.",1677446948.0

Ma said she was gonna help me on my essays 3 years ago. And before anyone ask the teacher of that school are harsh on the essays like every collage.

I know i have work insurance so that i also have to read a lot about and see wtf is about.

After i have that planned and done i have to kms, im a self harmer so i think i could rent a hotel room with a bathtub and  the whitney houston the situation, because for the insurance to apply they would have to have a body, if not is just a missing person and im scared the bank is going to try and make my family pay my bills, they aren't large, at all, but still.

I also think my work insurance covers the cremation.

I also would like to choose the outfit im gonna be cremated in. And leave it ready.

What else should i do? Any recommendations? 

The other option if fenitoin overdose, im epileptic so i have a lot, a lot of it. But idk how effective could be  maybe both whitney and the fenitoin, at the hotel would be the vest option, i tought to fast for at least 48h before so i dont shit myself and im weaker.

Adding to that the fact that im not gonna be able to afford rent by myself  much less maintain 3 cats on top of that and pay for my studies, and no i dont have economical support from my family, i haven't had it ever.

Should i write goodbye letters for the people i care about? Idk if i should do it or not, i would only do it for the people i have good things to say to i dont want anyone to feel guilty or responsible for a choice thats mine and mine alone.

618,Is there something wrong with me?,2,11cvhjo,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11cvhjo/is_there_something_wrong_with_me/,1,"I’ve wondered this my entire life, and remember crying in my bed when I was really young, wondering the same thing. 

I’ve never been able to bond with anyone really, my parents got divorced when I was really young, and viewed me as simply a reminder that the other parent exists. It’s gotten to the point where I haven’t even talked to them in years, they don’t tell people I exist. 

I remember practically forcing myself into friend groups at school as else I’d go the day without talking at all. The people I considered friends, would consider me someone they did a group project with. I asked someone why a person was mean to once, and they said, “Everyone is mean to you, you’re an annoying robot with a high pitched voice.” 

I’ve gone through life feeling like an outcast, like someone in a wheelchair, people didn’t outright mock me, but I’ve been excluded. 

I tried to restart my life in my 20s, and I thought I finally found one person to love me, he was actually the first person to ever say he loves and cares about me. However, I ended up being the victim of his physical abuse not long into it. 

I left that situation, and have since spent years trying to find someone who will say the same, with no luck. I am all alone in the world. I even tried to make female friends who ended up trying to recruit me into an MLM scheme and profit off me with their promoter. 

I’m so tired of being alive, and not feeling alive in the slightest. I track my mood and this entire year I haven’t had one good day. I miss my ex for this reason, the first few months were so good. When I look in the mirror I feel a shell of myself, dead of my once dream of just feeling loved and like someone gives a shit.",1677452132.0

It's been about 5 days since, and it at first seemed to get better, but then began to be the same as before.

Everyone is angry at me quitting, and scared I won't get another job in time for bills. It was a job that was really really good for someone my age, but also one that triggered my PTSD. Every. Damn. Day.

Today, I'm amidst another panic attack and I'm tired. My heart rate is over 100 BPM, and my chest hurts. When the last one happened I went to the hospital but they didn't care. So I know they won't now.

The icing on the cake is I realized I can't escape this, because the biggest trigger will never go away. After 4 years of fighting and fighting... I realize it will go nowhere. I'm not going to win. And I'm stuck in this hell, now with my mind betraying me.

I'd cry, but there's no point. I'm done fighting those around me, and I'm done fighting this illness. I just want to fucking die.

It feels like I just keep revolving in life with no friend for the future. Who’s gonna stand beside me at my wedding? Who even values me as a friend? How many more people an I going to get rejected from?

I called my parents for support today and was just told that I’ve taken a toll on my entire family and that I should just examine myself / look in the mirror if nobody wants to hang out with me anymore. My family has been my lifeline for the past 8 or so years of constantly battling my depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts.

My boyfriend is all I have left but I can’t tell him I want to die, it’s too embarrassing and morbid for me to admit. If I didn’t have him I might just be gone already.

And the dad has been only supportive sporadically. Dad is now texting his ex because he wants to support her emotionally but I feel like I haven’t gotten the same back from him.

Regardless, it all makes me feel like I don’t deserve that love or support. And I’m obviously a burden to him, and now others. This pregnancy was unplanned and now my family has to deal with me being pregnant unexpectedly like an idiot.

I’ve seriously screwed up so much in my life. I don’t deserve to live and I don’t want to anymore. I’ve tried meds, treatment, individual and couples therapy. It’s all pointless.

I think it's like I'm talking to hear myself talk - the only benefit is doing something I want. So I guess this is my ramble into the void.

It's been a long time since I was genuinely happy. I've been on at least 6 daily medications (2 of which are benzos) for the last 12 years. I've been in and out of therapy since I was roughly 8 years old. My past just doesn't matter anymore - I'm so tired of telling new people who think they can help my life story only to have them give up and shuffle me off to someone new.

I resent my old therapist so much for leaving, even though I know it was a family matter and he made the right choice. But I'm dying.

I know I'm dying because I'm not taking care of myself anymore. My eating disorder in uncontrollable. I barely drink 2 8oz glasses of water a day. I will go weeks without a bowel movement, days without urination. I've made myself so ill from hurting all the damn time that I vomit randomly throughout the week. 

I'm disabled. Mentally and emotionally and physically. I can't hold a job, I can't have a driver's license. My entire life has to be lived through my mom, who works a fulltime job at 60 years old and still has to take care of me. I'm burdening her, ruining her golden years, and making her sick from stress and worry.

There's not a way I can make it through this, and I really think that in the next couple of weeks it is going to be time for the big sleep. I'm erratically grasping at spiritual straws - emailing Rabbis and Priests and Bishops. Gurus. Meditation teachers and leaders. It's all for naught. No one knows what to do, they just offer me vaguely platitudes on how their chosen way is the right way to fix everything. One of them has to be but at this point, I'm 30 and I'm so tired of not knowing and having to fight and struggle to believe in anything.

I've been 30 for 1 month and 3 days now. I don't want to be 30 and 2 months. I don't want to be here anymore.

Both of my benzodiazapine medications were refilled today and I still have an upopened bottle of my former favorite drink, Bourbon. I guess I figure 15mg of Xanax and 30mg of Klonopin chased with as much of the booze as I can before passing out would be enough to do it. I don't want to fail again.

Am I posting here because I want someone to stop me? To help me? To reach out and at least pretend to be my friend? Who honestly knows. Maybe I really am just in an echo chamber, talking to myself and coming to terms with my mortality.

I am scared. The information i have got refreshed while hearing the late news, is that these kind of happenings in the bloodline will increase the risk of other members of the family to meet the same fate. 

I have been a big red sign for everyone to take a chance to reflect upon themselves, to consider thinking about their generational trauma, and that this must not be silenced or disregarded of. I had terrible emotional instability, adding multiple attempts. 

Yet, here we are. One soul left us. And i need to keep this a secret. I am scared, scared to have realized how much deeper this whole thing goes. How much they tried to hide me from everyone, including themselves, and continuing to hide the lurking shadow in our bloodline.

Can't say I feel much better. In fact I feel worse. I wish it worked. I wish I took the right dose. I wish I died. I've just gotten sicker man. Can't even function at school no more. All I can do is cry in the halls and curl up in the corner and they still don't send me home. It's humiliating as fuck. 

All I can think about is hanging myself. I mean Can't go wrong with that. There's no wrong dose, no not cutting deep enough. It's final. I just don't wanna be around when I'm found. I don't want to see them cry. My family thinks it's selfish. But it just hurts so much. I don't wanna make em hurt. But I don't want to be alive either. I might try to make it long enough for my sister to give birth. (She's pregnant) I wouldn't want the stress to kill the baby. That'd be fucking evil of me. 

I just wanna be gone. All I'm doing is jumping from distraction to distraction, willing myself to stay alive. But the distractions aren't working anymore. I wish I could go back in time to when I was a little kid and just grab her by the shoulders and be like; ""My dude, my bro this shit does not get better. They're all fucking liars. Run for the hills while you still have the chance. Escape."" But I can't. 

I don't even care if I go to hell anymore. I'm practically there already.

I'm real close to a really bad self-harm relapse and another attempt. I can feel it. I don't know how to feel about that exactly.

I just want to die. I want it to be gone. It hurts so fucking much, and then it doesn't and there's nothing but that hurts too, in a way I don't know how to explain. It's like the absence of everything burns. Like if you scrap your knee and remove the skin, it's all raw and exposed. That's how it feels. I'm trying to stay alive. Not for myself. I'm a selfish Coward when it comes down to it. If it was up to me, I'd be six feet under already. 

But I can't. I want to but I can't. I don't know if that's gonna stop me anymore though. I mean I've tried so hard to get help this time. But nobody wants to give it to me. I'm 16 now. Took a lot to get here. But now it's all gone. I'm spent. I've got nothing left to give. I just feel like I'm not supposed to be here very long. Maybe the reason everything in my life is shitty is because it's the universe telling me I've outstayed my welcome. That it's my time to go. 

I'm just so done. I can't do it anymore, I can't. Every day is getting worse and worse, and hope is dead. There is no hope. Not for me at least.  There's nothing to stop me. Nothing except the fucking guilt. The fear of failure. I want to do it. I wanna do it so fucking bad.",1677438888.0

On January 12th I tried to commit suicide. 
I would call this circumstantial. I am to some degree still in my right mind. Obviously I’m still here 45 days later (quick maths) but my God, what torture. 

I am a 42 year old mother of two wonderful teenagers. That’s the only reason for those 45 days. I had a breakdown after many years of working hard, dealing with every single significant life matter that you can think of but in the last few years, rape, suicide, divorce…. And more recently financial ruin. Aka £30k debts. This for me is THE main issue. I’ll never be able to make their lives as lovely as they are used to. 

Every day I am tortured about how I have failed my children, how I’ve had to go on sick from a toxic work place where I nearly killed my self with the hours, only for them to shove me aside and treat me worthless. 

Alcohol has not helped and I’ve tried to give up to some degree. But waking up every single day in despair and pain is torture. I want to be here for my children so much. And it hurts to be to think of my actions on them. But how is it humane for me to be in this pain every single day. 

I am really not woe is me. I just cannot see a way forward and feel torture every day. If my kids were not here I’d be gone.

Because almost everyday I don't find a reason to wake up and keep going. What reason are for doing it when I know that i'm worth nothing? Why go to college? Why make friends? Why eat? Why make other people put energy and effort on me? 

This is what I feel, and that's why I want to make everyone happy without them caring about me. You wouldn't understand it. Why do you think I didn't tell anybody? 

Because if I tell them then everyone will waste their time and effort in me instead of important things, and I don't want anybody to take care of me.

You know? Is bittersweet when someone take care about me. Sometimes it feels great, but also feels like someone is hitting me in the head with a bat.

Help other people to feel good and make them be ok with everyone is the best i can do, but them I noticed something more, see that everyone is happy and don't have any problem feels like an spear breaking through my heart, so that is why I decided the wold wanted to torture me, because every path I chose only ways to feel pain.

There's nothing, there's nothing you can do. The only thing in what you can help is to make it to be like always, but I was selfish and finally show you the horrible person that I am, and my heart punished me feeling in ways tha I don't understand. 

I'm weak and selfish, that what I am, and that's why I'll accept these punishments, because I deserve all of them.

I'm a digital artist and I guess cover artist is technically what I am, symphonic metal. And people can do what took me over 16 years to develop (5 years for music), in seconds. And it's concerning. I have disabilities too which make these much harder. Two undiagnosed disabilities i suspect are dysgraphia and dyspraxia which has made art extremely difficult for me (Non-artists draw perfect lines, I can't). With music, I get sensory overloads from my autism whether that's the audio or the amount of information, I know no music theory either. 

It's causing me to worry a lot and get stressed. I can't put my mind to rest about this. I follow a lot of people who make art and music, and they pretty much stopped when AI came out, like they just left the platforms, have no idea where to follow them. It makes me worried about their careers too. Since AI can make something similar if not better, it's going to set the bar too high, and it will be cheaper for people to pay an or pay for AI software to make it. Putting artists out of a job. I'm nowhere near good enough, but I was hoping to be. Now it just seems pointless. Plus, with there being no regulations or policies on most sites in regards to AI, it's going to be a dangerous place to be. I've already seen AI used to mimic other people's voices. 

This is the dystopian world we wanted to avoid. And I very much want to be convinced that AI content creation is a good thing ethically. Especially from an artist's point of view. But because that's not happening, I guess I should just give up on life. Everything I worked for and every goal I wanted to reach is no longer necessary. My life is pretty much over.",1677415024.0

My brain is broken. My parents neglected my health as a child so I nearly always had ear infections. They were so frequent that they stopped taking me to the doctor because they thought I would eventually ""grow out of it"".

As a result, I heard the world very differently, and because of that my attempt at speech resulted in the creation of my very own language. Watching myself in home movies from that time makes me cry. I can see the frustration in my face that nobody can understand me, and they're laughing. Received surgery and speech pathology classes to finally understand English and enter pre-school.

In highschool I had an MRI done because of ""fainting spells"". Got another MRI in 2021, shows obvious signs of stroke, I'm 39. New radiologist looked up my old scans to find signs of stroke the first radiologist missed. The areas the stroke have damaged are in my frontal and temporal lobes. Doctors believe I'm going to continue having these random strokes until I either become a vegetable or I just simply die.

I've wanted to kill myself since I was 7. Therapy the past few years would reveal a list of mental disorders. Information which has only increased my attempts. I've survived 4 and failed 14 attempts in the past 3 years. This Monday I'm not going to fail.

No family. No friends. No support. No reason to continue living. Special fuck you to Dave the wife and child beater. You're real fucking mighty hitting children and women. Fuck you Dave 2.0 (big sister). You were never a ""second mother"", you are exactly like your father. Fuck you Joe, you know the type of shithead you are. I'm really sorry mom. I know there were times that you tried, but you're just as broken as I am. This paragraph is essentially the text message I plan to send my family.

This time, I've purposely gotten way behind on all my bills to make it as big of a headache when I'm gone and give myself extra motivation.

and i fucking regret it all. 

my entire family knows about my mental health and they speak openly about it and say things about it. under normal circumstances this would be fine, but you need to understand:

my ENTIRE FUCKING LIFE i was never allowed to go anywhere. i couldn’t hang out with friends after school, i always had to go home immediately. i was never able to do anything. i couldn’t take walks, i couldn’t do anything unless my parents were with me. it was the stereotypical asian stereotype. i have to share a room with my brother and i never had privacy except for the fucking bathroom. and even then sometimes my mom would just barge in because i took too long.

all of this, plus the constant emotional manipulation, the berating, the constant taunts and assaults of my brother, i was sick of it. 

they use my mental health and talk about with everyone . without even asking me? so now random ass fucking aunts will give me repetitive fucking advice. they act like i’m fragile, a piece of glass.
it’s so fucking annoying i hate it all. i’m so sick of it all. i’m tired. i’m fucking sick and tired. 

my obsession with school is also constantly questioned. it’s as if my parents didn’t create this. that push to always be on top was bred from the beginning. and suddenly they SWITCH UP ON ME ? JUST BECAUSE THEY FOUND OUT I TRIED TO KILL MYSELF? 

i wanted to be the best, the academic validation was a drug. it still is a drug. when i started self harming in middle school it felt even better. and now this switch up feels like a betrayal. you get to change your mind while i’m stuck with the programming from my childhood. 

but the familial situation, my mind, all of it being exposed to the mental health system was so overwhelming. 

now i’m not allowed to be alone. i can’t be home alone anymore. there’s been intervention because i was on lockdown during the period where i was supposed to kill myself. but my mom still insists on it being applied. 

honestly i’m just frustrated because i get to leave to go to the library. i get to leave and finally go on walks. i can commute from home to work and back. but i cant stay home alone because she thinks i’ll kill myself? 

it makes no fucking sense. 

i can’t be at home because i tried hanging myself and stabbing myself but i can leave and take the train? i can go to the library? i’m allowed to go on a walk around the city? 

but i cant stay at home? 
yeah. completely makes sense.

she tried to give me the argument of how there is “a lot of people” in public. 
she really thinks i care about the public seeing me die lmao. she thinks i won’t buy alcohol or pain meds. 

it’s so funny to me because all the times i tried to kill myself was at home, 
WITH THEM IN THE HOUSE. 

and now they care. 

my mom said, “i always knew something was wrong with you”
yeah. you knew? so where was the support after i tried to hang myself in the bathroom? nowhere. you didn’t fucking know. you yelled at me to each lunch. and when i went back into my room you got angry.

This went on for years until about a few weeks ago. Some stupid switch turned on in my brain and now I have really intense emotions that I’m not sure how to deal with. I started hurting myself and considering suicide within a week because it just won’t stop. I told my GF of 2 years at the time about the intense emotions, but not about anything else. She helped a little bit until she broke up with me about a week later saying she doesn’t love me anymore.

I’m at this point where I’m drowning and it would just be easier if I just couldn’t feel. Death seems like the only way to achieve that.",1677417857.0
714,I just can't anymore,5,11cabdd,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11cabdd/i_just_cant_anymore/,1,"I just can't anymore... I've tried, but I just can't... I have diabetes (type1) and I just can't keep going. Every day is a struggle, a struggle to keep myself on track with my sugars, a struggle to keep myself going. I have kids, two girls, and I'm married as well. I want to keep going, but I'm tired, and I just don't have the strength anymore. I just want this to be done, I'm tired of saying that I'm okay, that it's just today, that tomorrow will be better.

I know that eventually diabetes will take me. I know that when it comes, it is going to be most likely kidney failure, stroke, or heart attack. My death is going to be long and painful, and I don't want to put my family through that. I would prefer for it to be quick, and over on a flash. I continue to think that the best course of action is to just bite down on the business end of my pistol, and end it once and for all, but I know that isn't the answer. 

I implore anyone who reads this to realize that death isn't answer to the pain that they are feeling. Strength isn't just defines by the amount of weight you can move, but rather the emotional weight that you can carry. 

If you dig deep, you can find that in even your darkest moments, you can succeed. You are strong, stronger than you can imagine. I implore that you just take some time to think about what life truly means and what it has to offer, then, just maybe, you can see the beauty of life.

715,Looking for support,2,11cgtan,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11cgtan/looking_for_support/,5,"Hi everyone... I haven't been on this sub for a long time but today i feel the need to.

For some context, I'm 21 and i was doing the master's degree of my dreams. But then i got burnt out, was dealing with depression that came back with recurrent suicidal episodes, and I feel like there's also a lot of anxiety about my future especially since i dropped out of the master's degree program. I dropped out because of my mental health and also realizing it wasn't really for me.

I am now back at my mom's house and thinking about what i should do. Or trying to think about what i should do. Thinking about the future makes me so anxious that i just wanna kill myself and not being able to think about it anymore. 

Some rhetorical questions i have are Should I go back to the program ? Should I just shut the fuck up and start working at some random job i don't particularly enjoy ? Should i go on another program, even tho I'm sick of school and studying so much without getting any money to appease my anxiety ? Should i follow the path of my childhood dream career (being an actor and a writer) ? Or should I go kms ? I know someone who could sell me a gun for cheap. 

The answers would be so much simpler to get of i was good at something. You gonna tell me ""go out there, learn, build up your skills"" but i lost all my confidence in myself and in life because of being surrounded by pessimistic ppl telling me I will never succeed or be good at anything. I lost hope. I don't believe in myself anymore.

Plus, i just don't have any motivation to work on any project or to follow any path. Or to do anything really.

Please, help me. I want support. I don't even want answers necessarily. I need emotional support. I can't afford a therapist. I have great friends but i feel like i already bother them so much with this. I don't even want private messages if it's to get ghosted in a couple days.

Now I dont feel confirtable about that so thats obviously over. But I realised that girls in my league (which is pretty high, Im confident in my look and Im way above average) are in their ""hoe phase"" and have such a big body counts and Im freaked out by it. I met several girls since then, and they all just love to be free. Now maybe I was just unlucky but when I google whats the average bodycount of 25yo girls Im freaking aout because those numbers are just so high.

I personally hate the idea of hooking up, I want to be with one beautifull princess and I dont need to go and duck everything that moves. But it seems that all the pretty young girls nowdays are doing it.

My family is broken. My parents are separated, my mom is very hard to talk to, she is locked in her own world. My dad is fine but Im strugling to live with him. He earns enough to support me but he doesnt. I had to go and work in foreign country to earn enough to support myself.

For my part, I am someone who ""suffers"" inside and hidden. There are, however, some people who suffer visibly or talk about it a great deal.

I find it very hard to concentrate on myself and to leave my pessimism behind.

While I can say I am glad that my roommate only is annoying (and not confused or severely mentally ill)  - I find it hard that there is no room where I can have a little privacy. It's just annoying that he sleeps nearly all day so I need to be quiet in ""my"" room or that he is complaining all the time about everything and does not try to change.

I, personally, want to get back to health and work on myself (this is my plan: https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11aphe3/optimizing_hospitalization/) 

Hopefully, I will be moved to an open ward soon. While the average person over there will be more emotionally stable there still is the chance you get a roommate that is difficult. Therefore, any suggestions will be highly appreciated:

Its about a woman who was bullied relentlessly in high school to the point she sought out revenge in her late 30s. She feels as if she could never live a normal life and she's living her entire life at this point for revenge. 

I thought it was satisfying to me because duh, who doesn't like cold served revenge? But I realized it's other aspects on why it's so satisfying to me and as I'm watching it started to leave a sour taste in my mouth. I started relating to her character more and more and certain aspects of the show in general.

Her bullies bullied her to the point of a load of mental issues that would last her a long time if not a life time. While she suffers, the bullies mostly forgot about it.

They get to go along and live (mostly) happy lives while she gets to suffer.

That resonated with me. Every day I'm constantly struggling to grab myself by the bootstraps while the people who made me feel that way are living normal lives. 

I've always wondered if the people who made my life hell ever thought about me and felt sorry or you know, still found it humorous to hurt me. Either way, they probably aren't giving it much thought if any at all. So while this is literally consuming my brain every day it's probably not even a thought for them.

Life is truly unfair and every day I continue to live I see that. I know life isn't completely fair for anyone but it's such a tough pill to swallow that karma doesn't exist most of the time.

Its hard to see the people who played a role into making your life miserable live happy lives. 

I don't think I can ""heal"" past this mindset. I'm so bitter over it to be honest. I'll never be able to live a normal life

I can't just ""get over it"" it's not that easy. I think the only way I'll be over it is when I'm not alive. Let's say I came up with some badass revenge like the main character, sure it'd be satisfying but in the end I'd STILL be left with the same mental problems.

I’d basically put a 2000 grit belt on my belt grinder and take a cube of osmium to it. This would create a cloud of ultra fine osmium dust that would react with the air to make osmium tetroxide, an incredibly deadly and toxic substance. I’d go to the hospital minutes later with nausea, extreme respiratory issues, and pulmonary edema. These symptoms are common enough they’ll start looking for bacterial and viral infections such as Covid or other pneumonias. By the time symptoms of heavy metal poisoning starts showing, and they start testing for lead poisoning, my organs will start shutting down. Ultimately I’ll die, and only my autopsy will reveal the osmium tetroxide. They’ll be baffled because they have most likely never seen a real case of it, and may only know of it as a cliff-note from med school.

I really don't wanna write a whole book here, nor do I wanna pretend to know what I'm talking about. I don't want to come off as overly ""poor me"" but I guess you could say I don't know what I want. I'm aware that there is no conclusive answer waiting here. This is simply just one huge shot in the dark, but i dont know what im hitting for. that's the best way to describe it. 

I am a male who has recently turned 18 years old, and I graduate from high school in May. I know that nobody really knows what they're doing at this age and that ""you'll eventually get it"" but this isn't what im getting at here exactly. It genuinely feels like adhd, deppression, anxiety, incompetent parenting, isolation, apathy, narcissism, nilism, rejection, as well as myself have fucked up my brain. I'll touch on some of these kepoints below for your better understanding.

I grew up with 4 other siblings, of which I was the youngest. My parents have pretty much given up on being rolemodels at that point by the time my second youngest sister was born, though she seemed more or less better off than i was. I was pretty much raised by my older siblings as my parents spent most of their time at a bar that my mom works at, and my dad is a retired purple heart war veteran.
 
Growing up I was living the only normal life I've ever known, but shortly after the month that I turned 10 years old, my 3rd youngest sister (17) was hospitalized in a car crash, and I watched her die in a hospital bed as there was nothing we could do for her. This event was so significant for the pain and sadness I have never felt before at such a young age. it was pain that would linger and amplify even 7 years later (8 years in march)

My mother became deeply depressed and began drinking more excessively, as well as leaving bills for the house unpaid until my father discovered them in her purse and we nearly lost our house.

But shifting the topic, from that point onwards, any friends I had stopped talking to me because of how sad I made them, I guess they just didn't understand at that age. When I turned 13 i became a self-proclaimed ""atheist,"" and I would advocate that there was no God and my peers at school would tune me out for my preaching. When I turned 14 I felt completely alienated from the rest of my classmates, which made me more depressed and too naive to realize it was my own fault they didn't associate with me. Most of my siblings moved out at this point as well.

When I turned 15, I got into a relationship with this girl with split dyed pink hair who saw some kind of good in me. She was a truly good person who never did anything wrong to me, yet I treated her terribly near the breaking point of our relationship. we would break up several times because of my arrogance and stupidity.

Going on to age 16, she would get into another relationship, and I completely blew up on her claiming that she cheated on me and that she was toxic ect. Her friends and family absolutely hated me and I never blamed myself for any repercussions my arrogance caused. I was shunned by everybody and I had police officers telling me to stay away from her (I have never threatened or touched her in any way)

My parents would enable me during this time when I told them it was all her fault and why I was right and she was wrong. Another thing to mention when i was 16 is that I started my first job at a pizza place of which I quit the in the first week because I couldn't handle the anxiety of being yelled at by managers for not handling instructions correctly and I refused to help any customers because of how socially anxious I was. 

3 months before turning 17, reality began to set in for me that all the trouble and damage I caused was my own doing and if anyone was to blame for all of my misfortune it was me. At certain points during when I was 17 I would relapse into my hatred for everyone and everything that I felt wronged me when they wouldn't wanna listen or speak to me when I tried opening up to people (while still not admiting to any wrong doing in my past and just saying im sorry) though i bottled the hatred down deep. (Also I never thought about hurting anyone)

But one day, I woke up and no longer felt anger for anyone, except for myself of course. I became even more reserved to myself and I felt incredibly shameful in the presence of others. I started another job at a pizza place and once again quit after about 2 weeks cause I couldn't handle it yet again, even the manager told me ""maybe you aren't meant for the working world"" which stuck in my head and looped over and over again.

Cause isn't working essentially all life is about? What am I going to do after highschool? How will I support myself? And all of that kind of stuff. The shame set in even further for me and I began having the first suicidal thoughts I've ever had, I begged my mom to get me into therapy but she invalidated my request saying ""there's nothing wrong with you"" ""therapy is expensive"" or just straight up ignored my input entirely.

I began becoming entirely invested in social media like reddit. I started searching and trying to find answers that I knew truly couldn't help me, yet I felt I could empathize with others online who had more or less the same issues as me. 

And finally, here I am at 18 years old. No job, no driver's license, no car, no ambitions, no willpower, Yada Yada.
I'm in a relationship with an alt girl, of which I feel I can't be emotionally there for at times (I do love her though) and a boat load of mental instability. 

I know I'm not quite at rock bottom yet, but I dont know where to go from here. Like I said, this is a huge shot in the dark for something I don't know I'm aiming for. I don't know what to do. 

I am very sorry for this trauma dumping I just need to get this out. I could never tell anyone this, and it's even hard to do so online.

I'm just so sick of being alone. I have no intimate relationships, I have no family, I have nothing. I'm living in a sober living house, and all I do is work, come home to nothing and no one. I don't care about material things. 

All I want are deep and satisfying relationships, but I'm absolutely incapable of forming them because I just can't figure out the rules of making friends. I can talk about deep topics all day, but when it comes to the lighthearted joking and small talk I'm absolutely mute. 

I'm just so sick of trying to recover, and not being able to obtain the things I desperately want. I've tried getting clean so many times, and at this point I don't even want to relapse. I just want to die.

I am going to put on a smile, and fake everything being alright, and I'm going to go home, shut the door, and cut into my wrists to permanently fall asleep and not wake up.

775,I'm a disappointment.,1,11cc1to,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11cc1to/im_a_disappointment/,0,"I'm 19, the oldest child of the family and for as long as I've remembered, I was always causing my parents headaches. I believe it started with just me being nonchalant about topics that should've been taken seriously, and it gradually escalated to me just being an asshole to people because I wanted attention. At High School, I decided to be a little more decent and outgoing. For a while, it worked, I gained a few circles of friends, I had a support network that boosted my confidence. But all of that came with a whole bunch of loneliness and the constant state of being unloved. Around that time, me and my father didn't have a good relationship and everyone knew that.  


Soon after that, me and another friend of mine began to bully this classmate of ours who was clinically immature because she posted a lot of nudes for guys. I felt amazing that time because I was unleashing all these hatred I had for myself to someone else, and of course, we got caught. I soon had the infamous status and that friend I was doing this with had turned everyone against me, so that support network I had collapsed, my group of friends closed their circles away from me. And that loneliness I had felt, soon crept back in.   


My parents were severely disappointed, and that was the first time I actually felt shame. I knew that what I had done just tarnished my family's name, and I deserved nothing after that. So, even I stayed away from everyone out of sheer guilt. I carried it all with me until we moved to a different city.  


Years forward, I was 18 when I got my own license and began driving. One day, me and my friends were going out to visit another friend of ours whom we haven't seen in a while. While I was driving, I took my phone from my friend's hands and typed in my password, but then I felt the car shaking and halting. I had hit another car- err, scratched it. The man was pretty livid and I apologized to him a bunch because of it, then I got sent to the station so that we could settle the actions we'd be taking. While waiting, I texted my mother that I'm at the station and I needed her to come and get me 'cause I didn't know what to do. During the long wait, I felt anxious and I was nauseated with guilt, feeling as if I'm burdening my parents again. She came and assured me it was fine, but at that time, I wanted to die. It was hard for me to cope with what I had done back at high school, and the guilt was only piling up now.  


A year later, I'm 19 when I hit another man's car. This time, it wasn't just a scratch, it was a dent that had bent his rear bumper and the lower part of the door of his trunk. The damage on mine was greater, it bent my hood and cracked the outer shell of the front of my car. It was horrible but I took responsibility and was almost shaking when I called the police to come and assess the damage. We went to the station to settle things and I decided to shoulder the damage, but I asked my mom if it's alright with her since I'm still a student and have no flow of income to be stable enough to pay for the guy's car. After settling it, I drove home, sobbing with a sudden urge to drive the car off the mountains.   


It's a day after that and I'm constantly consumed with guilt, how I've made my parents deal with my troubles, how I've constantly disappointed them with my defiant character, I felt like it's enough, I don't want to put them through shit anymore, I don't want to cause much trouble anymore. I'm waiting until tomorrow when we can settle the final price for the damage I've caused to his car, and I hope that after that, I never will breathe another day to cause another set of troubles for them.",1677406991.0

the title basically says it. everyone always cares about my education, not me being suicidal, with several past attempts. i have a 504 plan and the staff doesn’t seem to care, for example i was on the verge of tears because my anxiety was so bad, so i asked if i could take a break, and the second i left the room i started crying uncontrollably. I was out for maybe 2 minutes, when the vice principal (504 coordinator) yelled at me “i don’t care if your crying you are missing valuable learning, get back to class,” but what difference does it make if i’m in class or not in class if i can’t concentrate? This made me cry even harder because all the staff says they understand what i’m going through (Generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and adhd) and are there to support me but then hit me with a “we have to be harder on you because you tried to kill yourself several times.” i’m always left feeling like i’m being clowned on, like my mental health isn’t important, like if those suicide attempts worked i would’ve been dead, and they go even harder on me making all of it worse. i’m still suicidal and it gets worse when you hear people throw around the words “i understand,” without even trying to understand. i’m not asking for much, all i’ve asked for is more time on assignments and breaks until i calm down. i understand they are educators and it is their job but that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be considerate.",1677406627.0

I live with a major illness that really impedes my ability to enjoy my life and not be in pain. The hardest thing to accept about it is that it happened and happens to others for no reason. My heart goes out to all human beings, I wish to see nobody suffer. 

Once one is aware of the meaninglessness and suffering that life is, and how random it all is, how it’s pure accident, how can one go back? How can one enjoy oneself, when every dollar made and spent is the suffering and domination of another? The story of human history is that of genocide. In group, out group, power, etc. It feels like to live and choose ignorance is cowardice, or a very dull imagination. 

We are animals cursed with the ability to ask “why?”. To me it feels like our innate ego protects us psychologically to keep living and to ignore the “why?”. Why is it that there is some imperative that life is sacred, when it seems to me that the core reason we feel an imperative to live is because as animals we have a biological imperative to survive and procreate.

I  was fed up with my life and excited to finally be able to go to college.  I thought I would love college. I was wrong. It makes me very suicidal.  The first semester I was extremely lonely. It sucked but at least my schoolwork wasn't that bad. Now I have to do homework 24/7 and I am stressed 24/7. I even had to quit my job. But hate having to do this much work with no time to breathe. A lot of people say that if you are suicidal in college you should drop out. I will not. I want to have a  certain job that I would have to go to college for. I don't want to take a year off because I will be suicidal anyway. I cannot go to therapy right now because I don't have time but also I don't want my family to know about this. Whenever I told my parents I thought I had a certain disorder they either told me I don't have it or they blamed it on my phone. Most of my close friends are also suicidal. But first of all, this just concerns me because whenever I think my life will get better it doesn't which makes me concerned about my future. And it makes me pissed off when people act like life will get harder in the future.  Well first of all I'm going to make my life easier on myself because I  won't have kids, but at least I won't have to worry about taking tests and it will just be easier because I already know everything. But a part of me is concerned that my life in the future won't be good because whenever I think something good will happen it doesn't.

Anyway,  I have a lot of suicidal thoughts, and I feel like if I owned a gun in the future I would just shoot myself with it. I think about that a lot.

I (29F) have fallen on some tough life circumstances in the last two years. I left an abusive, degrading professional work environment and have not been able to find another job in my career field since then; I'm working at a coffee shop and chewing through my savings because part-time coffeeshop work doesn't pay enough to live on. I'm getting dangerously close to completely bottoming out.

I apply and apply and apply to other jobs, updating my resume and website, and I don't get hired.

I struggle with suicidal feelings even when nothing is wrong. When things really are wrong and my situation really is desperate, I have no idea what to do. The feeling becomes impossible to resist. It's not just my brain *telling* me things are terrible — things *really are* terrible, and I have no idea when or if they'll get better. 

How am I supposed to cope with depression that is based in reality? I feel like I've completely fucked up my life. I'm so ashamed of myself every day. I wake up ashamed and go to bed ashamed, terrified of the next part of the downward spiral. I really feel like ending my life would be doing the right thing so I don't have to experience the very worst — when the money runs out and I am truly left to flounder. 

I've been invited to a childhood friend's wedding in April. She and her fiance are wealthy, well-positioned in their fields and have a whole cadre of wealthy friends. I can't decide whether I want to go and then end my life afterward, with a happy memory, or do it beforehand so that I don't have to experience the embarrassment of being the only poor, struggling person there.",1677376832.0

Through these few months, I have pondered the condition of illness, persistently emphasizing the fact that there could be any kind developing inside me any moment.

The pains have gotten worse and now I'm thoroughly convinced I'm going to die (though, I'm aware I probably won't).

This has affected my will to live extensively to the point where I'm pondering the prospect of suicide. I've acknowledged the fact that it too would be painful and have written descriptions to demotivate myself:

**Gunshot wound:**

If I were to survive the initial blow, the feeling would be somewhat reminiscent of an unescapable, excruciating migraine, my adrenaline would take control and I would feel everything below my head (though, it wouldn't be my primary focus, as I am rendered near-unconscious at this point, limp and unable to move) more specifically, the prominence of my heartrate. I would have difficulty breathing as a result of the bodily fluids escaping through my airways.

**Overdose:**

Also much like an inescapable migraine. Your head feel like it's exploding, and you'd also have difficulty breathing as a result of bodily fluids.

Although I’m young (29 y/o) and healthy, there’s increased evidence that reinfections progressively weaken the immune system and make you more susceptible to short and long term health problems. Not to mention the possibility of long covid, which I avoided the first time but fear that I won’t be so lucky this time around.

I’ve tried as hard as possible to navigate this covid world. As someone with major anxiety - particularly health anxiety - and OCD, the pandemic has been rough on my well-being. It feels like I’m constantly going through phases where one week I’m fine and living my life, and the next week I’m terrified of getting sick and want to lie in bed all day. I’ve been in therapy, tried new medications, breathing techniques, meditating, etc., and nothing has worked. 

At this point, I’ve come to terms with the fact that I will either a) develop long covid and have a reduced quality of life, or b) get seriously ill and/or die from a post covid complication. I see almost no chance I make it to 40, and surviving even the next 3-5 years feed unlikely. The only thing keeping me from offing myself right now is that I have a 90 year old grandfather who would literally lose the will to live if one of his grandchildren took their life. But I’d rather go out on my own terms while still relatively healthy than suffer through chronic illness and pain.

On a scale of “life is amazing” to “I’m pulling the trigger today,” I’m probably somewhere in the middle - not ready to kill myself just yet and haven’t taken any concrete steps, but the thought is firmly in my mind and increasingly appealing. If I develop long covid or similar post covid conditions, I will probably do it. I’ve accepted the fact that I might have mere months left before it happens, and I’ve stopped caring about my job and other responsibilities outside of being with my girlfriend.

If a certain someone sees that they have no spot to fill here, no place to be. Still everyone always says ""you'll get there"", or ""It all gets better"". Who the fuck are they to tell me where I belong or want to be. I say, see to it what you want first.

I've been thinking of suicide for years, every day I wake up. Why I am still here? I don't know, probably because I have no balls. I just wish for there to be an easier way, but is there? What is the point? It's becoming clearer and clearer to me that I do not want to be here. It's that easy. 

And yeah, that's about it. I sincerely hope I wont be here next month. Even though I was supposed to go on this ""Awesome"" world trip.

I cannot and will not speak on behalf of anyone else involved. Before I get into this I will be explaining my childhood and what lead up to what I did. I’m beyond remorseful for what I did I want to end my life every day but I don’t want remorse. Im 16 male as of now ever since I was a kid like 4 sexually stimulating myself was one of my only coping mechanisms. I didn’t understand why I liked it I just know it felt good and comforting when I was young. My mom worked outside the home a lot and still does so me and my 2 brothers were left alone with my father a lot. They were all I had for a long time. Now we getting into the bad stuff so if sexual stuff so bear with me.  When my mom would leave my dad would go into my moms room and I could hear him masterbating for hours I didn’t understand at the time we just thought he was stretching we didn’t understand. We would catch him naked in my mothers underwear and we could hear him doing things idk what it was a blur. I have seen him naked mastubating a few times just out in our hallway. This is getting incoherent cause these are flashes I don’t like remembering. There is one incident that haunts me still. I woke up and saw my father over me naked doing god knows what to me but when I woke up he sprinted out of the room, before this I’d always catch him watching my sleep through the door and he would disappear when he noticed me watching im scared to what he was doing to me at night. Onto myself like I said sexual shit has been my coping mechanism I would do it a lot for years and years before I hit puberty, I was never told y not to im disgusted with myself for that I wish I didn’t do that shit cause it really messes with me to this day, anyway now on to my part the part that actually fucks with me, when I was 13 things got worse in terms of me masterbating due to hormones add porn into the mix and a lot of alone time you got a mess that I thought was normal at the time CoVid had hit so I didn’t see anyone outside my family for at least 4 months my father had been sent off to rehab for his alcoholism my parents screamed and fought ever since i can remember it was normal,I was very isolated from the world except the internet, I was immensely mentally un well at this time Sexual things plagued my mind and I’d just cry and cry while my parents screamed in the background not knowing y I wanted these things but knowing I couldn’t stop, my brothers were my only escape. Something happened one day I wondered what it would be like to push my body up against my brothers but like they did in porn, he was 7 I was 13 and I did that to him on 3-4 different occasions he would never tell me to stop and I thought he wouldn’t mind as long as I distracted him with something I never penatrated him or touched his genitalia I’d make sure there was something always between our bodies,doesn’t make it any better but at the time I didn’t have bad intentions I stopped after the 3-4th time cause I realized what I was doing and what he’d have to remember like me and my father and I broke I wanted to mutilate my genitalia and torcher myself after that for what I had done I still do I want to die in a horrible way I case my brother ever remembers what I did he could have peace I’d let him kill me if that made him feel a little better, after I post this and tell the world I will start a plan on selling all of my belongings and giving the money to him and writing an apology to him then ending my life like I deserve, he is 10 and didn’t deserve what happened to him at all I want him to be happy and can’t live any longer knowing what I fucking did to another human let alone my brother which I deeply care for I wish I had a dad who didn’t expose his children to his fantasies I wish I could’ve gotten me and my younger siblings out I wish I never woke up to my father standing over my naked genitals in hand I wish I could’ve lived a semi normal life I wish I never had even thought of doing those things to my brother I wish I wasn’t so fucked up i cant fucking live this anymore why the fuck do I want my father back in my life after all he has done I just want someone to fucking relate to I wanna be normal but I can’t I’m fucking disgusting I’d rather be raped 50 times than have than have me do that rubbing against him 4 times I hope my brother never remembers what I did for his sake he will live what I was living I’d die for my brothers why did I do that please someone help please I don’t wanna live what do I fucking do I want to be normal and live on like nothing happened but something did happen to my little brother and I’m responsible idc what my dad did to me all I care about is about what I did to my brother I want it to go away.

I don't understand anything here and at this point ""giving up"" seems reasonable.

I feel like my whole life, I simply existed with my parents, now I am unskilled in anything, have 0 desires in trying new things.
I've spoke with female co-workers in hopes to hear a positive story about their lives but in the end all of them have a negative, soul tearing story, but due to their kids, they at least have some motivation to go forward even though their life quality (financially) is even worse, but as an unattractive man - I've got nothing relationship wise and I have no desire to work another day and with my pathetic payslip to keep myself in bare minimum shape for the next day.

I mean I can just un-alive myself since I am not enjoying any minute of it.

Family members were good enough in demotivating me back then that I don't have any desire in hobbies, workplaces or traveling and at this point I see everything as useless waste of money.

So the question is what makes anyone want to live here?
Also I don't understand why suicide is bad when everyone meets the same end result - death.

Living is a chore.   


And i dont know why.   


It's been years since then, and im in my 20's and still feel like a waste of fucking oxygen. Each and every time i get close to trying to kill myself i just can't bring myself to do it.   


But i always feel like i shouldn't be here anymore.   


Compared to back then, i'm entirely alone. I'm not close to my family anymore due to differences, I don't have any friends anymore, my dog who was basically my son passed away a while ago and the last person who was by my side who kept me company and kept me going was my girlfriend.   
Who just recently decided she doesn't want a relationship and wants to focus in school and can't deal with more stress such as looking after me and helping me out. I don't blame her at all in fact i'm really happy she is doing that for herself and is able to prioritize her own future and goals even if they don't include me in it. I guess that's love for you.   


I've tried seeing therapist, counseling, psychiatrist, nothing seems to work long term. I've tried so hard to make myself better and get better but nothing ever does work long terms.   


I feel like i've given life an honest effort.   


now when I die, nobody would miss me or care or notice.   


It's just a matter of when i can bring up the courage and nerve to actualy pull the trigger and be done with it.   


because truth be told im a bit scared of the concept of death, but i also know that I don't want to be here anymore and suffer day to day. I'm tired. I'm tired of living a life i don't want. Loneliness has never felt so bad. all i can do is just distract myself with my own interest but even now i've grown bored of it.

We didn’t date very long, but I got hit by a car while walking  2 years before that and I should have died. I had quit the wrestling team a month or 2 before she left me, so I felt extremely alone. No one checked on me or asked how I was doing. The farthest I ever got was holding a loaded gun to my head. 

After this, I took all my emotions out in the gym and I started lifting with an intensity of someone hurting. I did this for years until the feelings were gone. During this time, I dated a girl for 3 years and she recently left me. We were supposed to move to a new city together and she backed out of everything 2 weeks before and blindsided me. So, now I’m living here alone and have no friends. At the beginning of our relationship, I told her about the time I held a gun to my head when I was suicidal(almost in a joking way to make light of it), and we never spoke about it again. 

She’s the only person that knows this about me, and I’ve been reaching out to her for help since the breakup because the feelings came back. She said there’s no future with me even if I’m better, doesn’t ever want to talk to me, and that she felt emotionally abused, but she acknowledges I never intentionally tried to hurt her. She then says she won’t be here for me, even though I asked her. In my last response, I said “I’ve been reaching out because you’re the only person I’ve told.” 

I have to be vague because you can’t actually put that in writing, but I was hoping she would understand that I just need someone to talk to right now. I don’t understand the point of people saying you can talk to them, because when you need help they don’t care. 

I’m 22 years old and I’ve accomplished everything I set out to do in my life so far. She knew me better than anyone and was one of the most empathetic person I have ever met. She’s the only person I’d want to talk to about this, because I helped her so much at her lows and I could use the return now. She said she doesn’t have to since we aren’t dating. I agree. 

I grew up with a single mother, multiple divorces, and was born via sperm donor. Statistically, I’ve accomplished a tremendous amount because most kids that grow up how I did don’t accomplish much.

I wasn’t supposed to, but I did. Just as I did when I saw a former friend who I’ve written about on here before.

I’ve spent some time thinking about where he is now. I feel sad for him, but in some odd ways I also feel happy for him? I wonder what his last thoughts, feelings maybe, were like. The realization that death was there, ready to guide him on his way.

Akin to my post-suicidal-ideations, I think about where he could have been years down the road. Career goals he could’ve achieved? Family he could’ve started? Lives he could’ve changed to include his own?

They think, If I keep myself just like tis, enjoying things that doesnt provide high salary, my future would not be secure. Moreover, this is all supported with many job vacancy in my country that usually put maximum age of 25 for fresh graduate so I only have 2 years to prove to everyone that I can shut their mouth.

But perhaps, I would never achieved that. I have no special skills that can provide me to get a better job with a better wage. My family will always think bad about me, they even laugh at me when they know how many I could achieved in a month. They laughed at it because my salary is way way below than theirs, and with that low wage how could I even support myself? let alone when I would decide to marry someone. Heck, I would even think that I would never find a girl who would accept someone so suicidal and so poor that cant provide her and her soon-children.

Will my parents still ashamed of their last child so poor with his under minimum wage compared to his brothers whose way way more success than their youngest brother? Will I ever convinced someone to love me without demanding on something like money-related things such as house, car etc? Will I can make everyone be proud of me and believe in me that I finally shut their mouth? Will I can secure both my own future and my children future? Or perhaps should I close my journey book and end it right now? Cleanse all the pain and fear that haunts me for the last 2 years since I was doing my undergraduate thesis back in 2021?

878,I’m almost done,2,11c0700,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11c0700/im_almost_done/,1,"So here’s the thing: I suffer from a disease called post finasteride syndrome, which has basically made me a eunuch, and destroyed my penile tissues.

There’s no cure. I’m not sure these symptoms are even reversible but it’s been like this for years now. I’ve tried living with mangled and numb unresponsive genitals, and I can’t do it. It’s too depressing. And that’s just one part, as the syndrome has wreaked havoc on other body parts as well.

It’s honestly unbelievable what has happened to me is even possible but it is. I’m traumatized by these symptoms every day. Tomorrow again. And again and again and again. I’ve visited countless doctors but none can help, therapy doesn’t work, meds don’t work, living my life doesn’t work. To top it off, no one really believes me and I get to suffer silently without support or hope.

Don’t tell me to live without sexuality. Don’t tell me there are other things in life. Unless you’ve had your own genitals destroyed and know of a way of dealing with it. Because I can’t.

It’s freezing outside and struggling not to OD on benzos and pass out outside. I think death by hypothermia would be the best way to go. Guess reaching out here means I’m too pussy to do it right now i guess. I don’t even want to die, I just can’t live like this anymore. I’m exhausted. So just quit, or live the rest of my life depressed because of the bodily destruction. I don’t know what to pick but I’m closing in on the first",1677370490.0
879,Anyone else gotten to this phase?,1,11c057j,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11c057j/anyone_else_gotten_to_this_phase/,0,"Is anyone else up to the point where the thought of suicide helps?

This is my story with Suicidal thoughts, I’ll keep it simple:

Few years ago when I had my first depressive episode with suicidal thoughts, man that was an experience, I remember feeling scared, confused, hopeless, all that. 

Soon after though I started getting out of it and when I reflected on myself I thought I was crazy and abnormal.

But that was my first time. From that moment a few years ago to now I’ve had quite a lot of depressive episodes each worse than the previous one.

I’d say the key moments are when I got over the barriers that were stopping me from suicide. For example, I was always thinking about how my friends and family would be devastated and so I never went ahead with it. But now that doesn’t even bother me, I just feel like it’s better if I’m gone that it’d be better for me and everyone else.

The only thing that’s stopping me is the fear of the pain and the fear of what would happen if I failed.

I’ll admit I’m broken, I’m not seeking help anymore, I’m done with that. I’ve accepted the thought of suicide to point where it kinda gives me peace and relaxes me. I can even say what i said in this post with a smile on my face. As crazy as that sounds that’s the truth man. I may not go ahead with it now, maybe not soon or a few years but I’ll admit it’s the most likely way I’ll die.

Ty for reading my story, I hope what you’re going through gets better, please talk to someone and don’t become what I am. Y’all are amazing people with potential to become great, just do what you love doing and surround yourself with people you love being with✌️😁",1677370352.0

I'm a 15M, since September  my dark toughs started to sink me more and more than usual, with the start of school in a class that hates me things went sideways right away. My school situation's been kind of bad since I've moved in a new city (because  my father is a domestic abuser and an alcoholic with bipolar disorder). In total I have been in 3 different classes, each one worse than the last, It's gotten that bad that I've had to contact a police officer family friend to come to my school and that ended up fucking it up more and more. There's a lot of emotions going trough my head every day, I change emotions like a 180 degree turn (from calm to screaming like an insane person, from that to crying my eyes out). I have no friends IRL, I think about self harm and suicide almost constantly, my relationship with my mom is horrible, we fight every day and it always ends up in her screaming and sometimes physically abusing me and me crying and deserting the room. My only joy left comes from music and videogames, the only thing keeping me sane is listening to music or entering a fictional world where I can pretend everything's fine. I cry myself every night. It's been getting worse and worse by the day, my mental can't take it anymore, I don't know what to do.... my mind's my worse enemy, the loneliness, the sadness, the anger kills me slowly, withers me away. I seek advice online, the one place where I hope I can find help.",1677365956.0
888,I will be at peace,17,11bfd5j,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11bfd5j/i_will_be_at_peace/,5,"No one reads these. That’s okay.

It’s been a rough few years. I can’t start over anymore. I am always shocked at how people can treat each other. I am shocked at myself.

I doubled down all my money on a girl. I knew I was going to get layed off. I did. I got depressed and my intrusive thoughts overcame me. I told her about them. She broke up with me two days after I tell her I may need to check into a mental hospital. The girl didn’t cause this. I was at 99.9999% already and this is just the last straw. 

I have no money now. I’m stuck in a lease with her. I want nothing to do with this town or her anymore. I give up on trying.

I will miss my friends. I’ll miss my cats. I’ll miss my ex. I’ll even miss a version of this girl who doesn’t exist anymore. I’ll miss my broken family. If there’s an after life maybe I’ll see them again. But I hope it’s just lights out.

I wish I could say I did good in this world but I know I only made it a darker place. I just can’t wait to be at peace any longer. 

I drove eight or nine hours, close to the last place I had a gun in my mouth. In the morning I will buy a shotgun and drive to that place. Last time it was a handgun, and I looked up the statistics of my survival with a 9mm. Too high. Only a shotgun is basically 100% death. The background check may take days. I will wait. 

I’ll drive to this place I have been many times. I will drink a little bit. I will text a couple people. I will leave a note on my car saying don’t go farther, call 911, suicide. I will walk into the snow and blow my head off.

I will be at peace and hopefully forgotten.",1677311199.0
889,Dysphoria and other problems are strangling me and the reality of the situation is setting in.,3,11bphsf,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11bphsf/dysphoria_and_other_problems_are_strangling_me/,1,"I will never be a real, authentic, man. Never going to go through male puberty naturally. Never going to have a real penis, just a neophallus. Never going to be a little boy or teenage guy. Scars. I will never be real, so what’s the point in trying when I’ll look pathetic compared to my brother, cousins, and almost every man on this earth anyway? Estrogen got its grubby, demonic hands on me and completely damaged me beyond repair. Seeing my brother starting to go through puberty is breaking me, even though I know it’s not his fault. Gets everything on a silver platter, while doctors and surgeons can only give me imitations and table scraps. His parents will love him, while my mother will want me dead.

I’m also a failure and don’t understand my school work anymore. I was mostly fine before this point, but now I can’t understand Chemistry or Trigonometry. I don’t see the point in doing it because even when I DO try, I barely get anything done and the difference is negligible. Oh, and being suggested a tutor is not helpful. Tutors are for stupid people and don’t try to say otherwise. The fact you need to specifically have someone help you even after having teachers try is proof. 

I don’t need to ask questions or have a tutor, I’m better than this. I can do anything by myself if I think hard enough. I’m just too stupid or not trying hard enough. Even when something makes sense, I either only get a few problems done and get stuck or I STILL can’t apply it. I’m not smart, I’m an idiot that was lucky and no longer is. Only good thing I’m at is listing and studying dog breeds, which is niche and near useless. Yeah, I stay back from lunch to do work, so what? 

I have massive overthinking issues and no amount of logic or logical assumptions works against it. It’s much better than when I was freshman, where I couldn’t go 5 seconds without an intrusive thought and I was MISERABLE. COVID was like a nat to me, this was WAY worse. I’ve had to repeat the same sentence for 3 hours straight before in my head. I frankly don’t know if I was genuinely happy in the first half of sophomore year or still numb, it’s just the horrid anxiety was significantly diminished, so I felt WAY better than I had in months. But it still kicks me around and has been worse the past few months. 

I’ll be blunt, I’m a jerk. Even when I don’t mean to be, I always end up saying something wrong or embarrassing myself. Whether it’s accidentally being insensitive, saying in a harsh tone, etc. I was a bit of my jerk to my brother when we were younger. He says he found it more annoying than genuinely upsetting. He may not care, but I won’t or forgive myself. I don’t deserve forgiveness and even when I try to not be an ass, I end up being one. I don’t know how to fix this.

So there you have it, I’m a disgusting, fake man, a complete failure, have anxiety that could rival my hate of Aquafina, and I’m a jerk even when I try not to. Basically, a complete waste of money, time, and water, even Aquafina. Please kill me, at least I could my mother happy for once. I’m not what she wanted in the slightest, so that will make her happy.

My emotions however are rarely present. They're mostly depressing and hateful. I feel mildly entertained at best.

Went through first break up of 2 ½ years, stuck around for 5 months while she messed around with her coworker. Finally moved on from her and felt good about life again. Started talking to this girl and we hungout a lot and slowly we started becoming more than friends. But, she stops me and says we should probably talk about what we were. We decided we wouldn't put a label on it while we tried to figure out stuff in our lives. I ask to hangout, she tells me she thinks it'd be best if we were just friends and that she made the selfish decision to continue with what we were doing cause ""heat of the moment."" We talk that night, she tells me it's because she's wanting to be more religious and that being around me (basically atheist, but I have nothing wrong with religion and participating or talking about it) would discourage her from what her goal was. Probably sounds bad reading it, but after a nearly 4½ hour conversation spanning two nights, I could see the reason behind it and I didn't blame or fight her about it. We said we'd stay friends and be able to hangout in our friend group, but that we should stop now before we go to far and it hurts later.

It's bummed me out a lot because everyone I've told the situation about says that it totally could work. I really think it could work and now I'm kinda confused. I drunk called her last Sunday while playing VR poker and I brought up watching The Last of Us since that's what we've been doing together over the 3 weeks we hungout and she seemed interested and everyone at the table in the game said she sounded legitimately interested in me. I feel it's given me a sense of false hope and it's really dragging me down. I'm content with my home situation and work situation, I do find in school, I bought a guitar because I've always been interested in learning it and it's kinda helped distracting me from thinking about her. But, she said some things about thinking for her future and how I live in the moment and I don't like thinking about the future and I think it's gotten to my head.

I started thinking about my future and it's stressful. Going into community college and working and balancing a possible love life and friends and paying stuff off sounds so unbelievably overwhelming. I'd rather just live without having to worry about anything, just do my own thing. It's so dystopian and naive, but I just want that or nothing at all. The thought of killing myself is kinda scary, but I've been having very vivid thoughts of how it'd play out. For example, coming home from school, letting the dogs out, putting my backpack up, writing/recording my last words, saying goodbye to my dogs and telling them that I love them, and then painting the ceiling red. I've thought about who I'd make sure is known about my death like my online friend of 8ish years. I'd write down all the passwords to everything I used regularly, telling my parents the things they didn't know abt me, just making it easy to investigate my death. 

What's weird is I don't hate my life right now. I don't hate myself, in fact I feel more confident in myself than I have before, but at the same time I feel like I've stopped caring about things too. I'm ready for high school to be over, I'm ready to finalize my career, find someone, and not have to deal with the bullshit leading up to it. I feel perfectly normal right now, but thinking about killing myself doesn't scare me or make me double check myself like it used to. Idk, I wanna talk to her about my suicidal thoughts, but I'm afraid it'll push her away or make her feel like I'll kill myself if she doesn't stay with me and that's not what I want. I feel like she's the only person I could go to about it and not have them relate to killing myself because it might just reinforce the idea of killing myself. Like I need someone to be able to show me the light. Not sure. I rolled a random number generator yesterday and got 169. Which would be August 12th. So, I've got a tally counter in my white board that's on my mini fridge with 8/12 in the bottom right and if I haven't figured myself out or haven't stopped thinking about killing myself, that's the day it'll happen.",1677356914.0

They both have just come back from travelling and have great lives with bright futures. I try to put on a brave face when I’m with them and show that I’m functioning and trying to get better - an attempt to not lose them as friends. But the reality is that I can’t keep pretending that I’m fine. Deep down I’m extremely sad, suicidal and close to giving up on everything. 

I’ve been hospitalised since July last year. I have been close to finishing the hospitalisation a couple of times but each time my psychiatrist has decided to prolong my stay. My medications have been changed a few times and now, as a last resort, I’m undertaking electroconvulsive therapy. 

I tried to explain to my friends that I’m finding this treatment tough, but I don’t think they’re able to understand how serious my mental health problems are and how difficult the treatment is. One of them told me that not a lot of people with my problems would be able to keep my friendships that I’ve had since before all my mental health problems came to the surface. It made me feel like I should be lucky that they are even talking to me, which in turn makes me feel like I can’t be truthful with them - like they are the ones in control of the friendship existing or not and I have to conform to the version of me that they want to see and not the reality. 

I feel like such a fucking failure all the time. I’ve ruined my career and my professional reputation after having two years off work. I think my friendships are hanging on by a thread. I’m fat and ugly and disgustingly unattractive. I’m addicted to alcohol and it’s ruined my life. I don’t see my symptoms improving and often I have strong urges to self harm and kill myself.

If I don’t see any improvement from the electroconvulsive therapy, I’m ready to stop pretending and end my life.",1677356139.0

I was dealing with suicidal thoughts and actions before, tried to kill myself twice, without any success. I was in a psychiatrist hospital for a month, got a lot of meds and use them till this day. This wasn't helpful at all.

948,Another useless story,5,11bhy0x,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11bhy0x/another_useless_story/,5,"Hi everyone, 

I'm sure similar stories exist here by the hundreds. I'm sorry for being boring.

It's not an exciting story, just turned 30 last October.

I don't know where to start but I'll try to make it cohesive at least.

I supposedly had quite an average childhood.

Recently, over the past few years I've come to find out that my mom is a narcissist and I always my dad was a low-effort type of person whether said effort is physical, emotional or financial.

It's fine, I guess when I was a kid the way I coped with the nonsense was to just.. phase out, maybe that's how my ADHD developed  

Coping mechanisms evolved into being glued to screen for hours and then added some substances to the mix after a while, the usual weed and alcohol.

Other mechanisms exist that I'm ashamed of such as ""excessive self-pleasure"" and so on.

I've always been a loser, one way or another 

Never been academically successful despite being told numerous times that I have ""potential""

Work life was even worse, I worked in a bazillion different fields over the past 10 years and I can't find myself doing any of those for life or even for years..

I was good at my jobs but never stuck around more than 6 months, it's always smth, I am a certified complainer by now.

Don't get me wrong, I believe I work hard, as hard as I can at least but it doesn't seem to be enough.

Things keep on getting from bad to worse and I can see myself falling ever deeper over the years.

Looking back, I've always knew since I was a kid that I'm not cut for this life. I always knew that I'm not going to be stable or happy but I kinda chalked it up to low-self esteem and replaced those thoughts with fantastical daydreams that never and will never happen.

Now I feel stuck, I've been working low paying jobs for years now, no long time experience in a career at 30, no savings, no relationships, no support and a decidedly bleak future.

I don't mind the bleak future except that I seem to be the only one in my surroundings who is doing this badly.

My own family who actively make my life more difficult than it should be, are doing much better.

Not all bad tho, I have some great people that I came to know over the years, but it has become increasingly difficult for me to meet up with them over the past couple of years.

Life isn't easy for anyone I'm well aware, but alot of simple, basic stuff for people I think are much harder for me.

I'm not that smart, nor consistent nor a hard worker per se.

I'm stuck in a loop of destructive habits/coping mechanisms that I can't break.

But my health continues to fall, I'm a chimney.

I missed alot of my life depressed in my room 

Years and years lost, A LOT OF YEARS 

I know lots of people had success later in life 40s, 50s, 60s but those people knew they had ""it"" I'm adamant I don't lol

I've thought about ending it almost weekly if not daily since I was 14 but I was too much of a coward to do anything about it.

Recently, it's been so bleak that I think it's the right thing to do.

My mom would be actually pretty happy, a weight off her chest and a nice sob story to garner more attention.

My sister will happy since she's greedy af so more for her! 

My dad would be the only one who seems sad but inside I know he'll be relieved too.

No other family to care that much about me, beautiful friends will forget me in a matter of hours if they didn't already haha

In all faiths its a taboo, makes sense because you can't ""repent"" afterwards 😆 

I'm sure hell is worse than this for sure 

But atleast it's rock bottom for real this time 🤷‍♂️

Plus what if atheist were right?

Then I would've forced myself to go through a miserable existence for absolutely nothing 🙃 

I don't know what to expect from this post.

I could've added this note to the dozens others in my notepad.

I know the words of encouragement and I know they're real but falls on deaf ears.

Maybe someone will say the right word or idea 

Maybe not.

Thanks for your time 🙏",1677321168.0

I'm done with the what-ifs and the wishes.
I can't stop caring being anxious and being scared, that's just my human nature. 
But yeah. I've thought of so many things and none of them are worth saying if no one's listening.

I just need a place to put some of my final words. So if you read this thank you.

I've been cowardly for the past two weeks since I got out of the mental hospital. I planned on killing myself the day I got out but I had been dragging on these past two weeks. Pretending I don't exist and have responsibilities. I have been out of school for too long and now if I stayed alive I wouldn't be able to finish out the school year. I live with a bunch of selfish assholes I'm supposed to refer to as ""family"". I have no friends. No support. Nobody to live for. No goals. No will or motivation to do anything. Nothing to live for. I've been struggling alone for years. In that time my life has gotten worse. The stress anxiety paranoia and anger has been growing in my body like mold. It's too much for me. Throughout these years and having suicidal thoughts I've always judged myself from a normal person's pov. 
I come to the conclusion that it doesn't matter. I'm going to leave on my own terms without stress anxiety or paranoia. I've been struggling with paranoia for a long time and it's really deteriorated my sense of self. But now it doesn't matter.

Anyways I'm going to drink some wine and hope that'll get me relaxed. I have my ligature and I know in my heart my blood and my bones that my time is up. I've been a breathing ghost. I've made so many mistakes I can't fix. It's too late. I hope it's quick!

Thank you to all those who've been kind to me! Thank you Eliza. I hope you're able to transition and be your true self in this lifetime. I'm sorry I stopped responding and if I worried you. I'm sorry to all those who meant well that I disregarded. 

Most of all I'm sorry to my past self. The girl I once was. 

Note to self:
i wish i could have spoken up more. i wish i was smarter and had kept my hobbies alive instead of casting them away. i wish i could have sat at school normally like everyone else did. i wish i didn't give into my illogical and irrational thoughts as much as i did. i wish i had made more memories. i wish i had read more books, written more, expressed myself more through my personality instead of filtering every part of myself for people who don't even know who i am. i wish i didnt have paranoia or anxiety and that my brain functioned like everybody elses. i wish i spent less time convincing myself i didnt care. i wish i was nicer to my grandmother. i wish i was kinder ro my younger self. im so so sorry Gabby. you're so beautiful and you deserve to be loved. youre not big at all. youre so so pretty. youre such a good person and im sorry you had to get older and the world had to ruin that for you. im sorry your confidence was taken away. im sorry i didnt stand up for you more. im sorry i belittled you and your problems. im sorry everyone else did too. im sorry we didnt get to live long enough to become a better person. im sorry i cut our hair. im sorry. im so sorry for all the other sorries. im so so sorry. i wish i made more descions without fear of judgement. i wish i had talked more, and said exactly what was on my mind. i wish anytime someone had dismissed me, belitted me, pitied me, angered me, made me feel terrible, i wish i had spoken up for myself. i wish i wasnt as alone as i was with my thoughts, i wish i didnt have to take them to death. i wish someone had known how i felt. i wish for too much. sorry.

952,"My roommates are afraid of me because ""multiple people"" have told them countless rumors about me and they believe I'm mentally unstable; self-harm thoughts are coming back",1,11bqj59,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11bqj59/my_roommates_are_afraid_of_me_because_multiple/,0,"WARNING: THIS IS A LONG POST

For context: At the end of the Fall 2022 semester I (F18) was having self-harming thoughts and there were a couple of occasions in which I held a knife against my chest in the privacy of my room (it was a knife that I had been using to cook, not one specifically bought for self-harming purposes). Also, there was a guy that put a no-contact directive on me (we cannot enter each other's residential buildings nor talk to each other) but he calls it a restraining order and says that I cannot be 100 ft from him (which is a lie, and it makes it look like he actually has proof of what he accused me of), he accused me of bullying him, harassing him, and following him around (which is me calling him ""b\*tch"" twice in two separate occasions where I was trying to make him stop harassing my friends. 

Now, Last semester I was with a different roommate, and this semester I moved to another residential building just so I could be closer to my friends (there were no problems with my other roommate), the thing is that I moved with 2 new roommates, one of which is a friend of the guy who accused me of bullying him. A week ago I had a pretty intense conflict with my mother, in which she wanted me to forgive people who physically and mentally abused me for 17 years, I was so heartbroken that she choose to believe they didn't do anything to me that I got pretty drunk that night and apparently I was talking about self-harm again with a couple of friends, I don't remember anything but it appears that I mentioned the couple times I held the knife against my chest and someone told this to my roommate. I've been seeking counseling and working on my problems since the end of last semester and when my roommate asked me about the knife I didn't feel like I had anything to hide from her since I wasn't thinking of self-harming as much as I did on last semester (Saturday was just a loophole and I told my therapist about this).

My roommates called our residential advisor and we were talking about the whole situation I was completely honest with them and told them how everything developed from last semester to that day. They say that even before I moved with them ""multiple people"" have been telling her that I was violent, a bully, and a stalker. The guy that put a no-contact notice on me said that I hit him and that I shoved him while I was drunk, and since my roommate is friends with him (and she says that he had some sort of bruise on his face when he told this to her) she is more inclined to believe him, she also says that people say that I'm ""violent"" but has never specified what ""violent"" is, she says that ""multiple guys"" have told her that last semester I followed to their classes and to their dorms and that I tried to hit on them in parties while drunk, she says that people have seen me in the morning holding bottles of alcohols (when that is not true given that last semester I wasn't able to buy alcohol due to money concerns, the only instances that I have been able to buy alcohol is this semester because I have a little more spare money) She says that there are photos of me with alcohol bottles in my hand in full daylight (another lie because last semester I got my alcohol from friends during the nights and this semester I have only bought alcohol for myself twice, one of those instances the alcohol was for all my friend and another one was just for me, which was a week ago) yet she wasn't able to show me any photo. Now, she says that she wants to give me the benefit of doubt but given that are ""multiple people"" against me she doesn't know what to think, my other roommate, says that two people told her to be careful with me before I moved here, but the thing is that I don't know what they mean by ""multiple people"" I asked them about this or to at least give me a number of the people who were saying this but she refused to tell me, they say that they have seen me get pretty late to the room while I was drunk, when, again, that's not true (I have classes in the morning all days so I only drink Friday and Saturday)

They say that they now fear for their security because they don't know if after what they have told me I hold a grudge against them (I do not) and they are afraid of sleeping in the same room as me because of the rumors of being violent and the knife. I tried to explain why the rumors were not true since I have plenty of witnesses and evidence that can tell them that that is not true, but they refuse to listen as ""multiple people"" have told them stuff about me, they said that they thought that the best solution was for me to move (which I think is only an excuse and that they just want me to move because they liked their space without a third roommate since the room they lived is a triple but their last roommate moved because they accused her of being homophobic and racist (since the roommate that is friends with the guy who says I hit him is of Chinese heritage and lesbian) before I got there) I told them that I was ok and that I wasn't a risk for them or for myself. They called the campus security office to talk to me and make sure I was telling the truth about my mental state, I told them everything that I told my roommates and that I'm posting here and they said that I was fine, however, my roommates don't believe it, they said that all that I was saying about the knife was ""triggering"" and a reason to go to a psychiatric hospital so hey wanted the campus security to take me to my college's wellness center where again, I told everything to a counselor and they say that I was fine (though they insisted in calling 911, who showed up there with a stretcher in case they had to take me to a psychiatrist, but the chief counselor told them I was fine) they kept insisting in that the wellness center and the campus security weren't taking it seriously (because for them there is no way I'm fine) so they called the local police (two officers and their sergeant) to talk to me, again I told them the whole story and they said I'm fine, my roommates were not buying it so they were talking to them trying to convince them that I was mentally unstable. Now I don't care what they say of me or if they believe the rumors or not, but they called the officers in such a public place (The lobby of our residential building) that many people in my residence hall could hear their conversation, Around 30-40 people saw everything I listened to a part of the conversation and now everybody in my building knows about this situation.

My problem is not even that, my problem is that my roommates keep spreading the rumors as if it was true, trying to convince people that I'm mentally unstable so they will have more support to get me out of the room, I heard people making up more stuff such me pointing the knife at my roommate or me having pills with me in my room. My roommates were saying that people have been telling them that I stared at the knife while drunk, or that I slept with the knife next to me which is total bullshit (This whole time the knife was in a set of silverware that I used to eat stored in one of my drawers). They kept insisting on not wanting to sleep in the same room as me so I was provided an emergency room to stay in during the weekend (which was the size of a bathroom and only has a bed, a small desk, and a trash can). I have talked to the Dean of students because I want to take a semester off or transfer (which he refused to do since he believes I'm a great addition to the community) so we went to the housing office but there are no rooms available for me to stay in this semester since housing is full. Me and my roommates have a meeting scheduled for Monday so we can discuss what's going to happen next, but I know they will keep pushing for me to be moved out (which cannot happen since there's nowhere for me to go), some friends haven even texted me to know how I'm doing, some of them stopped hanging out with me this semester so I'm sure they will believe the rumors, and some of them have told me that the rumors will die within a week, but the thing is that until my roommates don't get what they want they won't stop talking about it. I really want to stay and not give them the satisfaction but I don't know to what extent they are willing to go to get me out of the room (They were already talking about involving their parents and I'm in a school where a good amount of the population is from white wealthy families, while I'm a come from a poor background plus I'm a minority and I really don't have anyone to defend me here, even the friends that have stuck with me through this have said they don't want to get involved in it, though I never asked them to).

Right now I'm afraid, I can't sleep, I can't eat or drink, and my only options are to endure it (and live with fear for the rest of the semester), take this semester off (and have to endure the coming back next semester while having no friends because everyone will move on from me) or transfer ( which to me is the best option for my mental health), but I don't know how much money will it cost the flight back home, transferring my belongings to another state, moving into a new college, or if I would receive as much financial aid as my current college is offering me ( my financial aid plus loans cover 95% of my college expenses, I took 5.5k in federal loans which I know won't be a problem, but I also took a 5k loan from my college which is subsidized but I don't know if they will keep it like that until I graduate). 

I feel everybody is judging me and while I know people have their own lives to be bothering with gossiping around me they will always find time for drama. It's been a day and only a few people that I was already expecting to text me have done so, the rest of my friends haven't even reached out to me but I know they will be talking about it (since two girls in our friend group were gossiping with my roommates about the whole situation the same day it was happening, I even heard them calling me smelly for a time my shoes got wet from the rain and caught a bad smell (which I immediately fixed within 2 days, but I also think is pure bullshit given that my roommates told me ""people from my friend group"" have been telling them that I was saying that the smell came from them when that's another lie) I just don't know what to do since this is a small campus and my roommates seem to have a new friend every day (I'm a freshman so I'm not worried about other classes since I have plenty of Juniors and sophomore friends who believe my story, but most of my friends are freshmen and I'm worried how this will spread in my class). 

I don't know what to do and I'm terrified of the impact this will have on my mental health and my performance in class. I already canceled 4 important meetings that I had for this weekend and I tried to take time to think but the panic and fear in my chest only become bigger and bigger.",1677346254.0

I've worked overtime just cuz.
I've had two alcoholic beverages and it's not enough. 
I've tried reaching out for intimacy but no guys are interested. 
I've also ran out of emotional supports I can reach out to. 
I love my family but they also kind of suck.
Been crying 4 hours and who knows how much longer  
I just want to unexist. 
Please, 
I don't care how small the help is, I just need help. I'll take any tool.

966,I feel insane.,1,11bn6la,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11bn6la/i_feel_insane/,6,"For the past (I’m not sure) 5+ months? I’ve been having very intense mood swings. I’ll be perfectly fine and happy and see one little thing and immediately I want to kill myself. 
I was told recently that I was going to be attending therapy every 2 weeks instead of every week. I’ve only been going one day a week for a month. That’s about 4 or 5 sessions. 
I felt like I was going to explode. I went to shower to help myself calm down but nothing feels right anymore. I’ve never been so unstable. I wanna kill myself at any given moment. My mind won’t just shut the fuck up.
Not to mention- because of my mental health issues (I’ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts for 5 years and only recently got help around 1 to 2 months ago) like I said, my emotions are so out of wack. Everything feels like it’s more than it actually is. And I’ve been told I’m emotionally abusing my boyfriend. It made me seriously tempted to end my life. I’ve never felt like such an insane failure, piece of shit person. I don’t know how much longer I can deal with my thoughts. I can’t do this.",1677337804.0
