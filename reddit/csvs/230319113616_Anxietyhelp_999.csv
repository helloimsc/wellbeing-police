Had covid in December 2021. Experienced panic attacks after. In September 2022 I was out on SSRI’s .. I tried 3 lots over the period of 3 months. I experienced vertigo , vision cutting out and all other nasty things so stopped cold Turkey .

Since stopping I suffer from tinnitus , legs and feet tingle  24/7 to the point I feel like I’m moving and the worst one is my vision. My eyes are exactly like what they would be if I had drank a few alcoholic drinks.

I also can’t drink beer since I went on the SSRI’s. I go extremely spaced out, delirious  and lethargic.

We’re now in March 2023 and I’m not having panic attacks. Anxiety seems to be under control but I still experience these symptoms and it’s getting me down as there is no break from it.

The doctors say the vision issue is not related to SSRI usage. I haven’t been the same since I came off them.

I’m unsure whether my body has just been damaged from the chronic anxiety and I need to sit it out and wait for the physical symptoms to go or the SSRI’s have generally caused this.

I’m worried if it is the SSRI’s the symptoms are irreversible and I’m stuck like this. I can’t have fun anymore.

Can anyone relate to this as I feel like I’m going insane… doctors just don’t listen  they think SSRI’s are the answer to all and don’t realise how many people they have damaged.",1679194471.0

So my parents wanted us to get together in there room a little while ago to talk for a bit, and my sister mentioned a doctors appointment.

Anyway, when my sister mentioned the doctors appointment I wrote a note down in my phone notes app that reminded me to speak with my therapist about options regarding medicine and what she thought the best course of action would be.

It's made my brain melt into a confused stew of thoughts so that I can't even pay attention when someone is talking to me. I'll then repeat sentences that they *just said* back to them because I didn't hear them say it and they'll look at me like I'm the stupidest person on Earth. I'll do my best to summarise what I feel and have experienced so far - the main point of this is that I don't think I can ever be the same that I used to be before I realized what a problem this had become in day-to-day life.

(ok I got a bit deeper into this than anticipated - tw suicidal ideation.)

First things first, I have always had something to be very anxious about, so in all honesty, I'm surprised that this demon didn't come for me earlier. It started with nail-biting as a kid, and my first memory is peeling off dry skin. A regular anxious response/ bad habit to have. It got worse. Obviously some form of perfectionism, but also maybe something to distract myself from. I think I always subconsciously hated parts of myself and I would get completely immersed in inspecting every body part whilst ignoring that it made my appearance problems worse. My fantasy was always that one day I'd somehow reach that peak of perfection, but without ever doing anything to actually change. Then at maybe eight or so, disaster struck. Full-blown dermatillomania. If you don't know what that is, I'm not going to go into detail as that's a separate issue on its own. I hate to admit it, but for the past ten years, I have been looking at myself in the mirror for hours on end, scratching at every blemish until it bleeds. I won't be satisfied until I've ruined every part of myself. It started with my arms. Legs. Face. Chest. Back. Stomach. I just couldn't stop. And even if I did, the restraint would only work for several days, when I was forced to have no mirror and little time to look at my unclothed body in the bathroom. Very rare - in my house, there's a damn mirror in every room. You can't move them or fully cover them. With my chewed-up nails constantly scratching at infected skin, it was inevitable that I'd end up like this. I still bite my nails to this day, even though I know what I'm doing.

On top of this, around when covid started my brain had the brilliant idea to throw another problem into the mix. trichotillomania. (Again I won't detail too much about what it is.) I wish I was fucking joking. I have had multiple bald spots from pulling out hair all over my head, giving me severe headaches and having to go as far as to shave off all my hair a year ago because it was that uneven. I cannot even express how jealous I am of all the people around me who are normal, with long, thick hair that they can style however they want. They can wear whatever they want. People don't avoid them because of how they look. I am disgusting. Do you know how impossible it is to be happy with myself? I can't look in the mirror, because ... well, you know what that will do. I can't post pictures of myself on social media. I cannot even take selfies, not even with a mask on and fully covered. Yes, I still wear a mask because I'm terrified of people seeing my face constantly and watching how bad my condition gets. I wear hats and scarves when it's hot outside. It's genuinely ridiculous and I have to pretend that I'm doing it all because I like it. So how does this all link to anxiety? I'm getting to it in a bit.

What is quite interesting is how genuinely lucky I have been. *I have never been bullied for these things. How?* No fucking clue. I deserve it, and honestly maybe if I was bullied that would have motivated me to stop? Bullying is clearly horrible and I'm so glad I have never openly witnessed someone offending me for these deep insecurities. I'm pretty sure people have definitely said it behind my back though since I'm in an all girl grammar school, which is classically renowned for how girls frequently go behind each other's backs to gossip. And that's what freaks me out. The idea that there are massive group chats that laugh at me and they all think things like maybe I'm dirty and I don't even know how to look after myself. Even if I did have the most stable skincare routine, that would do nothing against my horrible compulsions. I noticed a pattern several years ago that I am also horrible at holding down friendships, with every single best friend somehow being lost after about a year. Now I currently have no friends, having drifted from my last one a couple of months ago. I have no support system and frankly am not comfortable with trusting any of the people around me with my issues anyway. I eat lunch in the bathrooms because I can't stand being around people. I'm socially anxious and can't go out without a mask, or if I'm being forced to not wear it, a shit ton of makeup. I think about my appearance even when doing things completely unrelated, like when I practice speaking for my A-level German (UK qualification). Two weeks ago my teacher asked me to take off the mask so she could hear me more clearly and I've never felt more destroyed. I stuttered clumsily through awfully constructed sentences for five minutes then after the torture was over, immediately left to cry in the bathrooms for an hour. it was pathetic.

I've been seeing the school counsellor since October, and I previously had regular sessions with them from January to April of 2022 as well but what prompted both attempts was depression. My lack of friends, bad appearance, and also worries over school grades had immensely troubled me and I constantly thought of suicide almost daily. I would've planned for it to go ahead on the 12th of August. the draft of my note is still in my inbox. I didn't do anything else though as I fear pain and chickened out. At least, back then I had my best friend still (who was clueless about all of this) so I clung to her constantly during this time. I decided to try antidepressants (Citalopram) in November. Counselling AND medicine literally couldn't save me. My life feels like a blur of uselessness and I can't stand even fathoming my own existence. I can't make connections with people, even online, when I tried making a Tumblr blog about my few hobbies I am debating deleting it because I feel isolated even among people who are supposed to understand me. I quit volunteering. I sleep as soon as I get home to escape reality. I don't exercise apart from walking to school. I can't motivate myself to revise or do my A-level work and Im scraping by - my exams are supposed to be in two months. I need to achieve AAA grades to get into medical school (yes I'm fucking stressed as shit because I don't think I can even survive the course if I keep going like this) and I'm so hopeless that I genuinely cannot think of any other alternative path if I end up failing my exams. I will not reapply. I don't have the mental strength to waste another summer hating myself and doing all that work to get into a course. God knows how I scraped two offers from universities and *I really* don't want it to go to waste. I had a panic attack during my Biology mock last year and I'm terrified that it'll happen again. Today I even had a mock for Grade 5 piano and although I practiced intensely, it all went to shambles in front of my teacher. I don't believe in myself at all at this point and every day I live in fear of how I'll fuck up my opportunities next.

I can barely drag myself out of bed because I'm terrified at the thought of school. I can't go out with my family because I don't want to risk seeing people that I know. I've become a total shut-in. All I ever wanted, really is to be the person who I am inside. I don't even remember how I used to look and behave before all of this started. How do you even change stuff like this? People say it's all 'one step at a time' but the second I mess up, I can't forget it and forgive myself. I want to change everything at once but I know it's impossible. I just wish I had the time to do it all. Anxiety and Depression have taken over my life to a point where all time is wasted. I'm never going to get my teen years back, but I just don't want this to dominate my life forever.

if you read all of this, honestly I'm so thankful that you took time out of your day to read all of this. I understand that sometimes I don't make sense with how I say things, so Im open to any further questions about this. It feels a little relieving to put my thoughts and feelings somewhere after bottling it this entire time. If you have any coping strategies please let me know as Im desperate to fix myself and prompt change for once in my life. I also may have tagged this improperly as I'm really new to Reddit so I really hope I didn't trigger someone with something that I said.",1679098422.0

56,Why do I feel upset when conflict/negative energy/arguments appear in general,2,11toji8,Anxietyhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/11toji8/why_do_i_feel_upset_when_conflictnegative/,0,"Hi, I'm relatively new to Reddit so please mind my post if you happen to stumble upon it\~

So most of my life I've always hated the idea of conflict appearing in my life, I know you can't avoid these types of things but I tend to hate when tragic or negative moments happen for example (people who are struggling in marriages or fight with their loved ones, financial issues with people or even just arguments in general. 



Whenever I go home in a good mood and my parents fight or one of them is moody (angry, annoyed or upset) I feel this sense of guilt beginning to rise up and I feel pity for them. It's like my brain chooses to become sentimental and I feel like I can connect to a person's emotions and feel sad for them but it's worse when I connect with these saddened emotions I genuinely begin to feel lost and afraid. I get scared to the point I want to leave and hide in a safe space and feel happy again. 



It's even worse when I visit relatives' homes and when they fight or talk about their issues I feel guilt again, And again, AND AGAIN. My friends too! I blame myself for mistakes I never did or I take the credit. 



I think the reason I blame myself for this is that when I was younger my father would yell or hit me and so I trained myself to be quiet, not cause trouble, apologise every time I made a mistake and own up for it. So it is completely ingrained in my brain.",1679052902.0

First of all, nothing is really wrong with my life. I just have a lot of recent changes. Moved across country to a new state where I don’t know anyone, starting a new job (in a couple weeks), new puppy. 

It isn’t much but for some reason I haven’t had this much depression and worry for more than 5yrs. It’s better than it was a couple months ago. I escaped to my parents house 11hr drive away with my puppy for a few weeks and am dreading going back to reality. I’m starting to have nightmares of the drive back (car crashing/bursting into flames/ all of us dying in the car). I just want to sleep. I also want to know it gets better. 


I can’t see a psychiatrist for another 2 weeks and am nervous about starting new job, leaving my almost 4 month (by the time I start work) alone with a 2x day dog walker. 

Will I ever find happiness again? Will the worry ever go away? I just want to be content with life. 

Any positive vibes would be greatly appreciated",1678986818.0

For background I have been diagnosed with PTSD, generalized anxiety, and bipolar, my wife left me after 11 years in late 2021 and I got way worse. Trying to hold my life together. 

Currently prescribed 200 mg zoloft, 300 mg seroquel, 150 mg lamictal all once daily;  .5 mg klonopin twice daily and .5 mg xanax once daily. I am receiving CBT as well as EMDR. I am a heavy Marijuana user, it greatly reduces my anxiety issues but I don't have a medical card in my state. 

My panic has started to become uncontrollable recently, escalating seemingly daily. I have a high stress, fast paced job that also happens to have a high rate of suicide due to the nature of our work. I struggle with suicidal ideation and daily suicidal thoughts which are also not under control at this time. 

I'm worried about tolerance with the benzos but through exploration of many drugs in the past several years they  emerged as the only class of drug that even touch my panic attacks and daily general feelings of panic. I know also how that makes me appear to other people but i don't abuse my meds because I fucking need them to survive. 

My question is just has anyone gone through this and if so what combo of meds or therapy or whatever, what helped you? I'm 36 I've struggled with mental health my whole life and I just feel like there's this bleak empty path ahead of me of just being this way forever.

At a certain point, I could sense some low level anxiety, which manifested as:

* **trouble sleeping through the night,** 
* **stomach pain, and** 
* **increased anxious thoughts, including anticipatory anxiety.**

After a few days of this I re-upped my dosage and almost immediately felt more relaxed.

So my question is:

**By treating my issues with drugs, am I teaching myself that the only way to deal with anxiety is to squelch it with pharmaceuticals?  Should I try harder to acclimatize myself to the unpleasant effects of anxiety rather than focus on teaching myself that I can succeed in reducing anxiety artificially?**

So first background Info: I’m mixed (Half Asian half European) and I speak 3 languages fluently. My mother tongue is an Asian language and it’s the language I speak the best. I live in a foreign country in Asia and it’s very international so there are many people around the world in this country and I’ve lived here for years so I could never really learn my languages well. The problem is, that I go to a school where we speak the European language which I’m really bad at so I have big communication issues in school which causes me to be silent all the time. I can never really describe what I want to say so my conversations end up really awkward. So that really made my social life really bad. What’s worse is that we somehow speak English all the time and I’m even worse in English!! I mean I can speak it but never in school and idk why. Every time I try to speak it my mind goes blank and I forget how to speak English. I stutter every time, get too nervous for a small conversation and I’m so sick of it. That created my anxiety too and now I’m just so stressed and everything. 

Now the problem: even though everyone probably knows I have bad anxiety, the teachers always pick on me. That’s bad but what’s worse is that I have a presentation I have to do by myself next week in English and I’m super stressed right now. I’ll have to stutter again, sweat sp much and I’m really scared that I’ll have to cry in front of class. I can’t control my nervousness and I know I’ll be unable to speak.

I play games without a headset because the headset reminds me too much of being in a call and freaks me out.

The last time I went on a big trip, it was traumatizing and although things are different I was still hesitant. I also have agoraphobia so even going out in familiar places can still be difficult for me. Within the second day of arriving, I felt horribly anxious and asked my family if I could leave earlier. I should be leaving in a week. I'm staying at a family's house so I don't have privacy and with the way I've been feeling it's been really hard to go out and do things that I want. Moreover, I still want to at least buy souvenirs for people when I get back. 

Thank GOD I brought some anti-anxiety meds so those are helping me through it. I'm totally fine staying inside my room and chilling on my laptop, but I also feel like I should push myself to do at least some things. I'm also worried that my extended family will get a bad impression if I just stay in my room all day. I've been getting panic attacks the past few days I've been here and feeling very detached. It's been overwhelming thinking I'm on the other side of the world with no easy way to leave. 

Trying to ride the next week and balance my anxiety but also trying to enjoy the trip. Tips appreciated.",1678946929.0

cant eat, appetite loss despite clearly being very hungry. trying to eat is repulsive and vomit inducing. barely slept, cant nap, genuinely thought ive been up for only 2 hours but realised its actually been 9. empty stomached but keep needing the washroom. feeling cold inside. feeling flushed out at moments. 

these arent new to me. in the past there was a phase where this +soms was an everyday thing. although im much better these days, i still have my bad days, and this isnt the worst but its enough to call it a bad day. i just wish to know how to feel at ease on days like this, especially when the situations around me cant put me to ease.

1) Think about a headache what do you think when it happens, you likely say oh I have headache, might be dehydrated, stressed, or hungry. Anxiety is a reaction like headache so acknowledging that you are having an anxiety attack and treat it that way helps you to calm down. 

2) Be aware your thoughts! If someone comes and asks you what did you think this week, today, your answer to yourself should be ready. Check yourself during day and see what are your thoughts, if they are negative say something good about that situation to yourself. I can't find a job> I have free time to improve myself. I have chest pain> but I know the reason is anxiety so I have control over it. I'm tired> I have things to do about my situation etc. 

3) Be mindful about your body, are you shaking your legs, grinding your teeth, are your muscles relaxed during the day? Check your body and fix it. 

4) Be fair to yourself, you are capable of many things beyond your imagination. If your body and mind is strong enough to create anxiety it is strong enough to deal with the dangers as well. 

5) Try to find a soothing hobby, puzzle, gardening, hiking. 

6) Most importantly if you are aware of the problem and looking for solutions it is the most important thing you can do already, it means you are insightful. That is the most important skill to get better. Research it. 

7) You are not alone! Millions of people going thru the same thing with you, telling themselves the same things you do.

Eat healthy, keep your body healthy. 

Hope it helps anyone seeking some solutions. Good luck to everybody!",1678847814.0

Without going into specifics, I just wanted to vent out. A lot of my friends recently appeared for an exam that wasn’t something I was preparing for. My boyfriend took that exam too. Our situation is sort of complicated because I’m eyeing a different route for my education/career. But we had decided to just focus on our respective exams till we’re done with them. 

Unfortunately, most of my friends and my boyfriend didn’t do really well in the exam. I can’t say a lot about the rest of my friends, but believe me when I say that my BF deserved better because he knew a lot. I’ve seen him improve slowly and steadily having begun from square 1. He’s always performed AMAZINGLY well in a lot of high pressure exams before. He was well prepared for ths exam too. But He has a lot of anxiety issues. And even though he was scoring well in the mock exams , he ended up scoring much less on the real deal. He’s distraught. However he knows his fault. He had over caffeinated, got jittery and then thought he would run out of time which is why he practically hurried throughthe exam. 

In the past he’s been among the top 100 in exams where over 6,00,000 students have participated. He definitely had and still has the caliber to do execeedingly well on this one. 

After the result, he is distraught. There’s another exam coming up in 8 weeks which has slimmer chances for everyone in general. It’s a more competitive exam. Sinc he has a good base he will be preparing for that. But right now he is in a dark pit. And because of that, I’m feeling terrible. He is not saying or doing anything to make me feel so. But I feel terrible. I don’t feel like studying for my exam which is also 8 weeks away and a really really important thing for me. 

I want to study and I want him to study. I know God has bigger plans for him if only he could move past this setback and get back to doing what he is good at.

Even some of my closest friends havent been able to do well
And all of this is crushing me
I’m empathazing to a point where I’m emotionally spent

During middle school and highschool my mom won't listen to anything that I'm saying. I can't sleepover at a friend's house and when I ask why she'll just say because I dont want to.

Over the last few years it’s gotten worse but I somehow always think everyone around me and in my life doesn’t like me or is lying to be about everything. Like, for example, I’m in cosmo school and my manager came in to be my first haircut ! Super sweet right ? I did her cut and I was nervous obviously, it came out cute but I had such intense anxiety that I felt like I messed up. She went home and sent me a picture of it styled and was telling me how much she loved it. I go into work the next day and I can’t help but think everyone is talking bad about me and the haircut. My manager was in her office on a phone call and i was thinking to myself “she probably went and got it cut by someone else to fix it and is hiding from me” but no she was just .. on a call. 

Long story short, my mind does this to me all the time. And it may sound like it’s not that serious but I literally struggle sooo much with it and it effects my life tremendously.

Hi! I’ve been feeling worse for anxiety this week. Normally I’m able to keep it to an ok level w medication, but this week it’s bad.

Ever since my first panic attack(Late October of 2022), I’ve been experiencing night sweats without any fever or fatigue. I was never like this through out my life. I haven’t really put much thought into since my other anxiety issues have been taking over my thoughts through out these past few months. I don’t take any meds yet & I’ve been improving slightly without them. However, a couple of days ago just when I was feeling much better, I woke up in the middle of the night with a sweaty shirt. I usually just brush it off and continue with my business. These events tend to happen even when I feel like I’m not really worried or anxious. Then again, I’ve recently developed anxiety so idk if it’s my subconscious mind. What threw me off this time was seen my forehead with sweat on it. The thing is, they don’t tend to happen if I’m wearing a jacket or sweater. Like it’s fucking weird. I immediately did my research at three in the morning and I haven’t been the same since. My anxiety has skyrocketed again. I’m already scheduled to talk with my doctor later this month but now I literally can’t wait much longer. I’ve gotten blood work done three times in the ER.

context is i'm a high school senior (f, 18) who broke up with a boyfriend 2 months ago that goes to the same school and keeps coming back to me. he's very angry at me behind my back (he rants about me w my friends) but asked me to be friends and basically begged me to be there for emotional support when he needs it. recently he said he's been having violent thoughts whenever he sees me, and has been telling my friends to block me. anyway that's a whole other story, but essentially i feel really stressed and on-edge near him. 

every time he dms me, basically confronting me abt the relationship that ended, i instantly feel a rise in heart rate and start to feel really really cold (esp hands). i also have full body tremors that go on for a solid while (15-30 mins or until i feel less stressed). i also feel really worried and anxious and i would love to ignore him but my mind can't focus on anything else.  i also have been having sleep paralysis and i've always suffered from insomnia tbh. when i try too hard to sleep my mind is racing and i see bursts of colors and i feel really active

it's not just his messages that trigger it but i also feel this stressful response before going on stage for performing or before exams, but to a lesser extent. i'm also wondering if it might be social anxiety, as i've always been a shy person but realized that recently it's been preventing me from doing normal things. i've been performing my instrument for most of my life but recently developed stage fright. i also physically cannot use my voice in certain situations like when i want to participate in class. idk i just find it impossible to raise my hand even tho i rly want to. i also find it extremely tiring to hang out with friends so i've been avoiding that. even the idea of going on vacation is not as fun as it should be. when i go on walks outside i feel stressed when a car drives by or if another person walks by. i'm scared for college because i feel like i won't be able to make friends and i'll hate it there. 

other potential symptoms that i've had for basically my entire life is picking at my lips until they bleed and also feeling like something bad will happen soon(esp when i'm happy).

1. Live today only. Cling to no animosity regarding yesterday. Holding a resentment is like drinking poison and waiting for the other person to die. Take three slow breaths.
2. Take a slow breath and say a short affirmation, prayer or mantra. Take two slow breaths. Continue breathing.
3. Carry with you something small that reminds you of peaceful times-a lucky charm, or a talisman. When agitated, pull your object out of your pocket or purse and hark back to a moment of tranquility.
4. Sit down, close your eyes and visualize yourself in your favorite place in nature. Use all of your sense memories.
5. Step outside. Feel the sun on your face. Say 'thank you' for the day.
6. Laugh out loud and decide to be happy. As Abraham Lincoln said, ""Most folks are as happy as they make up their minds to be."" Laughing makes us breathe deeper.

hi this is my first time posting here (22nb). I've been in an open relationship with my partner (22m) for two years and a half but lately ive been experiencing a lot of anxiety, insecurity, feeling of abandonment since Christmast. Im a person who always had a lot of anxiety issues and my partner help me a lot with that but I dont think Im doing right with the open relationship bc ive lied and hidden some things that ive done with other people (he knows everything now) bc i have fear of conflict.

So the main problem is that my partner confessed yesterday to our best friend (20f) that he had a crush on her. ive already know this bc he told me some weeks ago but i didnt expected that he was going to say that to her yesterday.  This caused me a lot of anxiety and insecurity, this is also affected by my lack of self-esteem. I really want to progress with this bc i hate having this monogamous thoughts sometimes and I know that they arent true bc i know that my partner loves me and cares about me but sometimes i think that he has more in common with our friend and ive been uncomfortable with them some days bc i feel like the third wheel (when its not true).  they talked yesterday alone and said both of them that they noticed that i was weird somedays.

I just want to take this normally and learn to manage my anxiety bc i dont wanna loose my partner/friend. i also think that i wasnt prepared for an open relationship at all bc i did things that my partner did deserve bc of my need of male validation (another big problem of mine). i just want to fix my anxiety and take this situations normally. I feel awful for all that i caused to our relationship and my anxiety also comes for knowing that im ruining everything. 

i would love to hear some advice/experiences to help me solve this problem and have a healthy relationship.

(M35yo)
My story goes as follows, almost 4 years ago exactly I went to the hospital from a severe panic attack that started from smoking weed, this was a pretty small amount as I’ve had anxiety from weed in the past. The panic started to intensify fast and I thought that I was losing my mind. My wife who was smoking with me drove me to the hospital and while there I was so convinced that I lost my mind that I started walking around asking people to kill me. I continued to walk around the hospital yelling until they would attend to me (they seemed to not be taking me seriously and that pissed me off). Eventually I was seen and was strapped down in order to not harm others or myself I assume. My blood tests were off but apparently nothing that mattered (I can provide if that helps) I believe I was given a b-52 cocktail injected throughout my body (Haldol/Ativan/Benadryl) according to my visit notes. After a few hours I was fully sedated and taken to a facility to sleep overnight due to suicidal ideation. I don’t remember the trip or falling asleep but when I woke the next morning I felt good enough to go home and was picked up. 

Since that day I have never been the same. It started with a few days of me waking up after a few hours of sleep with anxiety and this continued for about a week until I was able to sleep a full night. My symptoms are a combination of severe brain fog, cognitive dysfunction, feeling of losing my personality/going crazy, anxiety, fatigue, blurry vision, pain/pressure in head including ice pick headaches. Early on I was under the assumption that how I felt was all anxiety related and went on an SSRI (Lexapro) which has helped me in the past. It seemed to help a little bit sometimes but not much. I decided to try a neurologist who gave me an MRI and EEG which both came out normal other than a sphenoid sinus cyst. After that I felt there wasn’t much I could do so I just kept on and seemed to adjust a bit although everything that used to come easy took a ton of effort. 

For about 2 years after the hospital visit I was unemployed because I was physically unable to do so but eventually felt ok enough to work. I moved to another city and began to see a new doctor. A couple things started to show up in my blood tests which led her to believe I may have sleep apnea which I was tested for and was confirmed, I now use a cpap machine (helps very slightly). Another small note, my urine analysis did find small traces of blood and protein but I’m guessing that was from the catheter given to me in the hospital. Other things started popping up like high cholesterol and my liver was a bit fatty. I was tested multiple times for thyroid dysfunction over the years and it eventually showed that I have hypothyroidism and started levothyroxine which seemed to help for about a month or so. My vision started to get really bad over this time and I saw an optometrist who said it was bad enough that I needed glasses to drive. She also said my optic disc was a bit blurry.

Things started to get really bad about 2-3 months ago and I was forced to quit my job. Now I’m fully dedicated to my health and only that as I don’t have the mental energy for anything else. I demanded a cortisol test from my doctor and it came out very high. I also demanded a new MRI with and without contrast which showed 2 things:
1. Thick ethmoid air cell mucosal disease with mucosal disease within the sphenoid sinuses and left frontal sinus.
2. Pituitary gland is diminutive in size without evidence of mass or lesion.
#1 seems to be a continuation of my previous MRI but #2 is what really caught my eye. It seems to me there is something putting pressure on the pituitary and is affecting my hormones which according to the Internet can really fuck with your mind. This also makes a lot of sense to me considering the eye doc mentioned the blurry optic disc and the head pain/pressure. This all looks like either IIH or a CSF leak. It is rare for a male to have IIH but I can’t think of anything else that may be the issue here. My doc is weighing if I should have a lumbar puncture.

If anyone has any idea what’s going on or have any suggestions for tests that I should have done I would appreciate that more than you can imagine. You may literally save my life.

I’m willing to provide any and all test results if needed.",1678683597.0

I am a 19yo who was recently asked to house-sit/dog-sit for a nice friend-of-friend’s family. Majority of my friends including my sister works for the husband, and they are a very sweet couple with a very sweet (but obnoxiously needy) dog. I have autism and debilitating anxiety (AND AM A CAT PERSON!) and I have my quirks that have triggered some major anxiety attacks within the first couple of days in. I am overall stressed because I am juggling a week of 5+ hours of classes, watching five pets, midterms, being ALONE and without the one person who can successfully calm me down. Unfortunately, I am a major people-pleaser and was quite honestly guilted into doing all of these jobs. The neighborhood is very remote and majority of the neighbors are older people, however the house is the furthest from everyone else’s and is backed up to the woods. There is no outdoor lighting WHATSOEVER, and they warned me of bobcats, bears, coyotes etc because they’ve had scares before. When I had accepted this offer, my sister and two friends who work for them had also accepted and wanted to split the job and the money with me, as my spring break is over while theirs is starting. Unfortunately, they randomly booked a beach trip in which all three of them will be leaving me ALONE for about 5 days. This was not what I agreed to but I feel bad asking them to give up the beach for their spring break as they’ve all had a rough past couple of weeks. My parents live about 15 minutes away. What is bothering me is I am pet-sitting for three different people at once. The other two I am working for are my friends and I am familiar with their houses and their neighborhood, but I am not able to stay the night at their house because I committed to sleeping with the overly spoiled dog. On top of that, I am in the process of transferring universities and am stressed that my friend and potential roommate is not really trying her hardest to confirm we can actually live together. Apartments are quickly being sold and she is barely trying, even her mother has apologized to me for it. And on top of THAT my partner is away in Europe with a 5+ hour time difference.

221,"First time experiencing anxiety. Also first ever post to reddit, so sorry for the mess",1,11pulg8,Anxietyhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/11pulg8/first_time_experiencing_anxiety_also_first_ever/,2," A little background: 30m here, I had never experienced anxiety before until the last 3 weeks. A month and a half ago I had knee surgery and I've been sitting at home, alone, out of work. A week after my surgery, my cat dies. He'd been sick for around two months with some sort of bacterial skin infection, I'd taken him to the vet 4 or 5 times in that time and they couldn't figure out what was causing it or make it go away. He eventually stopped eating and had a fever of 104.
   
  I think my family felt bad for me and my dad decides to come out and help me out. My dad has been an alcoholic since i was a kid but has been  sober for about 8 months. I live 1500 miles away from my family and on the flight here my dad picked up again. Missed his layover flight and lost his carry-on with all his medications. He was very nasty to me when I called him out, but we smothed things over. The 5 days he was here was him recovering from his bender and looking like he was going to die from missing his heart medications. We were able to get the important ones at the pharmacy here and he was getting better before he left back home. Thankfully, he's jumped back on the horse of sobriety. 
  Throughout all that I was stressed out, but nothing like this anxiety. A week later, I had what I think was the first sign of anxiety when I was laying in bed. Just restless and uneasy thoughts. My cat bit me the day before he died and I couldn't stop thinking he might have given it to me. I sat in bed, looking up symptoms for rabies or trying to research if there's some brain eating bacteria that cats can pass to humans (probably ridiculous,  i know). I eventually just got up and watched TV till I fell asleep. 
  A day or two later I go to the doctor to get the stitches out of my knee. Everything goes well but when I get home I decided to take a thc edible instead of my vicodin that I was slowly taking less of. 
  So I've only tried weed a few times and this edible was only 20 mg. I'm a big guy, so I figured I'd be ok.... I was not.
  For the next 4 or 5 hours I felt like I was loosing my mind. Couldn't stop my racing thoughts and felt like I was blacking out. I finally came out of it and took a nap. Woke up at like 11pm and had what I think was an anxiety attack for 6 hours. My heart was racing and I felt like I couldn't breathe. I just had to stay up watching YouTube videos on how to calm down and focus on box breathing. Still focused on my breathing, around 5am I started to fall asleep. Every time I would start to dose off I would stop breathing and wake up gasping.
  I hoped I would be back to normal the next day, but no dice. The next week I couldnt sleep, felt no appetite what so ever. Even when my stomach was growling I could hardly eat anything at all. Felt cold and sweaty, jittery had hart palpations. And constant negative worries and feelings of dread. I was still freaked out that whatever killed my cat was going to get me too. So I went around urgent cares seeing if they had the vaccine. I guess it's hard to find because no one seems to have them. I eventually was told to get in touch with someone from the state health department and he talked me down. 
  A few days later my symptoms hadn't let up and I felt like my heart was constantly beating out of my chest for no reason. Thinking I now might have afib like my dad, I go to the ER. My blood pressure and pulse wasn't all that bad like i felt it was. They xray my chest and do a CT scan, just to be sure I don't have a blood clot from surgery. I was there for 6 hours or so and the majority of the time I was alone in a closed room. Wich I think being alone is definitely a trigger, but I'd just look at the ekg and I was fine, physically at least.
  The doc says he thinks it's anxiety and gives me 0.5mg of ativan. Being a big ass dude I don't think it did much for me.
  Talking to my family and knowing I have a few weeks off work still. They offered to fly me out to stay with them i desperately hoped it would get me out of this funk. The day before my flight I started to feel ok. I was ecstatic. I still had a hard time sleeping and flying out I didn't feel too bad, but when I landed and went to my grandma's house it all came back. 
  The next day I still felt terrible so I found a doctor that takes my insurance and made and appointment. He told me to follow up with a doc when I get home and prescribed me 50 mg of zoloft. I was told it might make me sleepy. It didn't, I still have insomnia. I was told it could take about a month for me to feel the effects.
   It was great seeing my family but I felt bad the whole time I was there.The flight home wasn't too bad and I felt ok till the night after I got home. I was alone most of the day and felt worse and worse throughout. This time it wasn't as much the physical symptoms but mental. I felt hopless. Like this is never going to go away and ill never be back to normal. Luckily my roommate is a supportive guy that deals with anxiety himself. So he helped me when he got home. 
 The next day I had my doctor's appointment and she also prescribed me 15 mg of buspirone to use as needed. But then the pharmacist told me that's weird because you're supposed to take it regularly before you get the effects and it's also a very high dose to be starting out on. I've only taken the buspirone 2 times since I've had it. I can't tell if it helped or not.
   Getting out and staying busy seems to help me the most. So I've been going to the gym for a few hours a day. It seemed like I was on the up n up. Hadn't felt tooo bad in a few days. Then when I was in the shower at the gym on Friday my heart starts beating out my chest for no reason again. I got dressed and sat down. My watch said my heart rate was at 100 for around an hour and peaked at 140. This didn't happen until after my workout too. Of course that got may anxiety going. 
  That pretty much leads to the present. I made an appointment with a therapist for Wednesday which will mark 3 weeks on zoloft. I feel like zoloft is making a constant pressure in the back of my head and waking up is always painful and i cant eat in the mornings. I still get heart palpations and wake up in cold sweats like 3 hours after i fall asleep. Ive lost 14 lbs. (Silver lining)
  

So I just have a few questions and would greatly appreciate any thoughts and opinions on this whole situation.

Thoughts on the medications?
Is it weird that I would suddenly get such bad anxiety when I've never had it in my life? 
Do you think there's hope that this will go away and and I'll be able to get off meds and feel like my normal self again? 
Any tips to help me get through this?

Looking for advice or if anyone has experienced something similar. Sorry for the long post, but if anyone can help or point me in the right direction, it will be extremely welcomed and I thank you.  

Last January I had covid. It was the second time I had it. I didn’t feel much pain or anything and had a smooth recovery with it. 

A couple weeks after my 2 week covid isolation, I went on a bachelor trip, drank a lot, had barely any sleep, and worked my way into my first panic attack ever. It was a very bad panic attack and I was extremely sick for weeks after, from all the above. (Yes, I know that was stupid:/) 

I wasn’t happy at my job, and ended up quitting in October of last year. The tech world is not great right now, so it has been hard to find another job. I am still unemployed at this point. 

I have had anxiety symptoms since that experience in January of last year, and it developed into two main symptoms, primarily Insomnia and trembling. 

I’ve come to terms with the insomnia most days, however, the trembling and shaking is what is driving me crazy. Every night, for over an entire year, my body without fail will tremble all night and when I wake up. Tremble, shake, pulsate, its hard to describe it with one word, but its all over my body. My breathing is fine. While I did have big heart palpitations from the overall anxiety, the majority of the palpitations have gone down as well. I’ve of course had days when I’m feeling very up, and some where I’m feeling very down, but without fail I will shake at night. 

I am extremely healthy. I very rarely drink. Exercise every day. Eat healthy. Have all my best friends and family around me. Social life is fine. I will admit I feel somewhat lost in life considering I’m 28, unemployed, never had anxiety prior to last year, and not sure where life is going. I’m content with feeling anxious and depressed and believe those feelings push you in the right direction, however, the consistent shaking that has not gone away in over 365 days is completely baffling. 

The insomnia pisses me off. The shaking obviously does as well. I don’t know if Covid has anything to do with this. I don’t know if this is only the work of anxiety. Im very hard on myself in general.

227,Relationship Anxiety/False Memory OCD *Please Help w/ This*,1,11ps0d3,Anxietyhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/11ps0d3/relationship_anxietyfalse_memory_ocd_please_help/,4,"*Long but detailed post*

Hi everyone,

I (19F) am in a wonderful 7 month relationship with a partner that I love so much. This is the second relationship I have been in (last one was when i was 14 and in HS), and I genuinely love my partner so much. Him (19M) and I are so deeply compatible, our relationship is filled with lots of healthy communication and laughter, and I adore the fact that we feel so comfortable being ourselves around each other. We're a Tinder match gone right. Being in a relationship is something I have always wanted, and though I acknowledge that being with a man is not what is going to complete my life, this kind of relationship we have is something I have always wanted.

Unfortunately, I really do struggle with anxiety and OCD. I was diagnosed with anxiety/depression when I was in 8th grade, and I have been on three different medications (Prozac, Zoloft, and now Cymbalta). Though I currently have a prescription, I haven't been taking it recently because I honestly don't support the idea of taking pharmaceuticals. I have found weed to help, it makes me really simmer in my emotions and opens new doors for my thought process. I have had a lot more ""I'm going to be okay"" thoughts when high than I have when popping a pill. As I got older, OCD symptoms really started to flourish in me around 17. I would have to do things in increments of three or I was convinced that something bad was going to be happen to me or a loved one. 17 is when I got my car and my license, and then false memory OCD started really come through. If I was driving my car and I heard a sound, I would automatically assume that I hit someone/something or killed someone/something...and didn't remember it. This was hell for me. There was one instance where I was driving home from work, it wasn't dark out, it was literally a three minute drive down the street, and I heard a noise while driving. I was so panicked that when I got home I sat by the window expecting the police to show up to arrest me for a hit and run. There have been times where I would drive around the same spot in loops to double check and make sure that whatever I heard was a noise and nothing more than that to prove to myself I didn't hit or kill anyone because my brain told me I did and didn't remember it. These are examples to really help you understand the situation I will now explain about my relationship.

I am not a disloyal person. Loyalty is a very important trait for me, and it is something I feel like I do a very good job of doing. I'm the type of friend where I will despise someone my friend doesn't like even if I don't know the person. It is a priority to me to show those I love and care for that I am there for them in my entirety. In the beginning of my relationship I went on a family trip without my partner outside the US and on that trip I was drinking. I don't drink frequently, and I prefer weed over alcohol any day. Alcohol for me is a special occasion thing, therefore I drank on this trip as celebration of my birthday. This trip had a lot of nothing to it, just lounging by the pool, walking the beach, and eating amazing food the resort had to offer. The first day of the trip (more like evening since we arrived around 3pm) was just sitting by the view with nice cocktails, dinner, and going to bed. Throughout that, as well as throughout the rest of the trip, I very frequently spoke with my boyfriend on the phone. The first night, after going to bed, I woke up in the middle of the night due to an earthquake and I had a thought ""What if I was so drunk last night that I did something with someone and I don't remember it"". And thats when I started spiraling. I was texting with my friends about it and they all assured me that there is no way that could have happened, and one of my friends even reminded me of the fact that if I was drunk to the point of memory loss, that means the situation would be sexual assault and not cheating. Then I was freaking out that I was sexually assaulted, didn't remember it, and that my boyfriend wouldn't believe me. This was a lot for me and I was losing my mind. I dwelled on this just about every day for 5 months. I spoke to my boyfriend about it, and he was so understanding and gentle and loving. He reassured me that he trusts me and that I'm okay, and that if it did happen it would be an assault and that I didn't purposefully be unfaithful. I've talked about this anxiety with my partner, my friends, and my therapist. My therapist helped break down my Attachment Style (Anxious Attachment) and I was able to feel a lot more at peace of the situation. I remember that trip and I didn't talk to any men or anything like that because things like that are not of interest to me when I have a boyfriend.

But then.. Now I'm having more anxiety about the same thing in different fonts. I don't have any social media. My contacts are just my friends and important numbers I need to have like family, my dogs groomers etc. I deleted numbers of past flings and the only men in my life other than my boyfriend are my gay besties and two other guys I met my first year of college who are like brothers to me (I even set one up with his now current girlfriend), and my boyfriend has met them and really likes them. I was on my phone the other day and all of a sudden I had this thought..""What if you just did something unfaithful"" and don't remember it. But its like..what could I have done? There's nothing I could have done or would have done that was disloyal because that is NOT like me.

So why do I keep having these thoughts??

I don't know if its because I'm finally in a relationship that is happy and healthy and its not something I'm used to so I keep having thoughts that could ruin it or what, but I'm so over it,

I'm really in love with him, he's my best friend. I would never intentionally hurt him. In the beginning of our relationship we were having a lot of problems, and I talked shit about him to my friends. But when things got better, I took the step to tell him about what I said about him to my friends and apologized for my behavior. So being a cheater is not something in my character. Like shit, I have a personal rule I established for myself that if I'm going to have sex with anyone, they need to prove negative STI results, like my current boyfriend and I did to one another when I lost my virginity to him. I don't even like touch or intimacy unless I first really get a feel for someone, so all of these thoughts of me being disloyal or unfaithful and not remembering it just doesn't make any sense, yet I continue to have them! I'll be doing nothing and then these thoughts will come into my head, or if he does something kind for me I'll think to myself that I don't deserve it because theres a chance I cheated but don't remember it.

If you read all of this, thank you so much for taking the time to do so and I would really appreciate your help with this. I love my boyfriend, I love my relationship, but I do not love these thoughts I am having.",1678660219.0
228,I don't know how to manage this and it's driving me nuts,1,11pre22,Anxietyhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/11pre22/i_dont_know_how_to_manage_this_and_its_driving_me/,5,"For context: 21M, never had a relationship, never even kissed a girl because I was a fat loser until now. Now, I am improving my life on all fronts (fitness, as I lost over 30 pounds and have put on muscle, career-wise I am looking at more job prospects now that I am about to finish my degree in computer science next year), so there's that! Also, because of this, I am thinking about starting to date... and that opened a whole other can of worms.

I have terrible anxiety regarding dating and relationships. It's weird, because I never had family drama in my immediate family. My parents are still together 30 years into their marriage, they don't fight, are loving and supportive to me and my brother, I have a great relationship with my extended family and there's no drama there either, my friends (who are great and supporting people too) are either single or in stable relationships, so it's not like I hear about relationship drama from them or anything, and I, as I said, never had a relationship so it's not like I am still traumatized from a bad past experience.

The problem, however, is probably social media. I have heard SO MANY horror stories about how people were either left or cheated on or just relationships going wrong in general, the reasons, the circumstances, and now I overthink A LOT about these things, putting myself in those people's shoes and basically causing myself anxiety over it because now I fear that it will happen to me as well.

It's only about relationships though. If I hear about a horrible car accident, I am not going to start to fear for my life whenever I get in a car. Or when I hear about diseases and such, I never feared that I'd get them. You get the gist.

However, whenever I think about getting into a relationship, my brain goes into overdrive mode: what if you do this, and she does that? What if she wants to do this, and you want that? What if this happens, what if that happens?! So on and so forth, and sometimes it even causes a physical response (shaking, rapid heartbeat, irregular breathing, insomnia) and an overall shitty mood. I had one of these times during Christmas, it literally ruined the whole holidays for me.

I feel pathetic. Here I am, never having even been in a relationship and getting stressed over one because of the horror stories I heard. Most of that shit might not even happen, I know that! The simple fact that I know that and the fears are irrational doesn't quench my anxiety though. I don't know what to do, and I don't have the funds to visit a therapist.",1678658779.0

So for context, I suffer from severe anxiety. I have been medicated, I go to routine therapy visits, I’ve tried holistic remedies. Everything. I’m currently taking 10 mg of hydroxyzine on an as needed basis, which is needed more often than not. This is a recent medication I have started and I’m liking it so far but haven’t been on it long enough to notice a huge difference. I have been on celexa, lexapro, and Zoloft. All of those had horrible side effects so I ended up getting off them and going for a more holistic approach. I currently see an edmr therapist. They have given me a bunch of helpful tools on how to overcome my feelings of anxiety when I start to feel them. However, my anxiety just seems to trample over those tools I’ve been taught. I take cold showers and use wim hof breathing techniques, I’m still anxious. I listen to bilateral stimulation music to help get me out of my head, still anxious. I try and reset my vagus nerve every time I feel anxious, still anxious. I use those tapping methods along with the script, still anxious. I use grounding techniques, still anxious. I have horrible heart palpitations when I get anxious and those just keep me anxious. 

Now let’s get onto daily tasks that are extremely hard for me to do. 

I cannot shower when I am alone in fear of passing out and having no one to help me or get me help. I struggle with eating daily as my heart rate increases when I am digesting and it causes me to freak out even tho I know it’s a natural bodily response to eating. I don’t like being alone at all bc it causes me to be anxious. I go out of my way to make sure I am not alone. I struggle with driving. I’m constantly skin picking or nervously pinching all parts of my body to try and ground myself while driving. 

I’m not entirely sure what I’m expecting to get when I post this. Maybe some tips on how you guys manage your own anxieties. Maybe some compassionate words. I am a Christian so that kind of help is appreciated too. Thank you in advance and sorry if this post is very much all over the place.",1678589804.0

I cant get one though, because no way I can talk to people, im not gonna be able to sustain it.
School is already hard enough.
They are corrupting my world, everything is falling in on itself, im in a house fire, and I cannot get out, the only way is death.

I dont want to be homeless, and im not living here, I cant live here, I cant stand it, three more years is already too much, I cant, i would rather be dead, on the side of the road.

So its get a job or die.
I cant talk to people.
And I dont even know if Ill be able to do the work, or be there most days.
Because i cant control my depression.
I am only getting worse, they are only getting worse, nothing is helping, im taking more doses, but that doesnt help, and I cant take it anymore, I just want to be free, Ihdhehdhdbdhghfgh

I doubt ill find a job, especially in the state the world is in.

And in short order, he gets a date with a gorgeous woman, lands a job at Yankee Stadium, and is (briefly) a lot happier than we've ever seen him? 

Well...I decided to try this approach because what the hell, my anxiety loves to make me do things I end up regretting. So why not try to do the opposite?

I'm starting small. Today I was having some health anxiety and usually I call my mom and complain about it to her. Then I thought ""Wait...no. Why not just do my laundry and let the urge pass? I never feel a whole lot better for mulling over this stuff, anyway."" So I did laundry instead and calmed down a lot faster. 

And just now, I caught myself about to start Googling stuff I KNEW would not give me any helpful information, and decided ""Nah, not gonna pick up my phone. But I WILL watch some funny YouTube videos!"" 

Needless to say, my anxiety isn't cured or anything, and I probably won't be able to curb every impulse I have to give into it. But knowing I DO have the ability to control what I do and why I do it is really reassuring. 

I'll keep you updated on how this approach works for me. SERENITY NOW! (JK, that really doesn't work.)",1678498661.0
244,14 years of dealing with severe anxiety has been exhausting,8,11oknqu,Anxietyhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/11oknqu/14_years_of_dealing_with_severe_anxiety_has_been/,11,"Before I start, I want to emphasize the significance of consulting your doctor before making any decisions related to your mental well-being or medication. 

I was always a shy kid. The kind of kid that avoided making eye contact and rarely spoke unless spoken to. As I grew older, my shyness turned into something much more debilitating. I evolved into someone who was consumed by darkness that robbed me of my ability to live a normal life.

During this period I didn't know much about mental health and it was tough for me to talk about my thoughts and feelings. I was scared that people would make fun of me or think I was weak. I didn't want anyone to judge me and think I was broken.

In 2006, at the age of 13, I was dealt a crushing blow when I was diagnosed with a cruel quartet of mental health struggles: severe anxiety, body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and depression. These debilitating conditions made each day an unbearable burden, every moment a suffocating struggle, every social interaction a source of terror, leaving me feeling helpless, alone, and desperate for a way out.

This is where the “Medication Trials” start.

Over the course of 14 years I was on and off many different medications such as Prozac, Zoloft, Trazodone, Celexa, Paxil, Effexor, Cymbalta, Remeron, Lorazepam, amongst approximately 10-15 more but these were the ones I remember at first thought. 

The meds seemed more like a band-aid fix rather than a real solution, as I was never able to fully shake off what I was feeling. Majority of them made me feel very high, sleepy, increased suicidal thoughts and many of them had the same side effect of giving me blurred vision, which was super annoying to deal with. I also tried Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) but didn’t notice much help after I would leave the sessions. 

At this time I was constantly searching for something that would make me feel normal again. While watching old bodybuilding documentaries on YouTube, I felt a spark of inspiration igniting within me. It was as if my engine was revving, eagerly waiting for me to push down on the gas pedal and take action.

In that moment I realized that what I was feeling inside stemmed from me not being happy with the way my body looked. I wasn’t able to pull back the curtain of my thoughts far enough to realize that this was the root of my problems. This is very different from a Doctor telling you a diagnosis, to you actually fully realizing this yourself, an “Ah-Hah moment”.

This is where things change.

I started doing 100 pushups - 4 sets of 20 each morning, along with doing bicep curls with some resistance bands I had purchased online before I showered and ate breakfast. I did this for the next 3 months, 5 days a week, while taking the weekends off to rest. I also started to be conscious of the foods I put in this machine of a body. Let's get real here, a big part of how our body looks like is from what we eat/drink. If you had your dream car, say a Lamborghini for example, would you fill it up with the worst type of gas? Or would you want to fill it up with the best gas to make sure it’s running at full capacity. Think of your body this way and you’ll be more aware of what you put into it.

After 3 months I started to get some compliments here and there from family members that I haven’t seen awhile. They noticed that my arms were leaner, my face was more slender, my double chin was now a single chin, and my beer belly gut was a lot smaller. This was the first time in a long time that I didn’t feel like I wanted to die anymore. Hope was growing inside of me.

After 6 months, I noticed an improvement in my mental and physical health. However, I still felt anxious about joining my local gym and started to feel like my usual workouts weren't as effective as they once were. Seeking a solution, I turned to Google for inspiration and stumbled upon a piece of fitness equipment that caught my attention. It was a water-filled bag with colored dye, promising a workout experience like no other. Intrigued by the Google ad, I ordered the fitness bag.

When the fitness bag arrived, I filled it with water, added dye, and pumped it up with air using the included pump. Eager to try it out, I attempted walking lunges with the bag positioned on the back of my shoulders - an exercise I had seen others do with this particular fitness bag.

The first set was a bit shaky due to the water moving back and forth in the bag, but I quickly adapted and completed four sets. The sensation was unique and left my legs feeling wobbly, which was a great feeling that I hadn't experienced with my usual workouts. The ever-shifting weight distribution in the bag made each step challenging and unpredictable, providing a stimulating workout experience.

After incorporating the bag and resistance bands into my workouts, I was able to do a full-body routine that included deadlifts, chest press, shoulder press, lunges, bicep curls, and tricep extensions. This piece of equipment not only helped me to sculpt my physique but also enabled me to perform exercises that I otherwise couldn't do at home.

At the 1-year mark, the mental health issues I was dealing with had dramatically decreased to the point where I could join my local gym, and I did. I continued working out there for the next year and became good friends with the manager there. He saw my progress over time and actually offered to get me certified as a personal trainer if I would work at his gym. I gladly accepted the offer and still work evenings there till this day.

After two years of exercising regularly, I felt great! So, with my doctor's approval, I started to taper down my medication. At first, I had trouble sleeping and my appetite was a bit off, but things got better after a few weeks. Being disciplined with my workout and eating regimen helped to keep me on track during those weeks.

Now, I've been into fitness for just over three years and it has truly saved and changed my life. I'm in control and don't let my thoughts and emotions hold me back from doing what I want, I push through them. It's been a year since I stopped taking medication and my doctor has noticed how much better I feel mentally and physically. She even asked me to start training her at my gym.

I used to have a lot of negative thoughts about how I looked, which made me feel anxious and depressed all the time. But now, I can look in the mirror and feel happy with what I see. I'm so much more confident than I used to be.

My body dysmorphic disorder made it hard for me to spend time with my loved ones and do things that most people find enjoyable. But now, I'm hardly ever at home because I love going out and doing things like taking walks in my neighborhood. It's the little things that bring me the most joy.

My Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) was related to my Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), and I used to feel the need to touch and check my stomach fat many times a day. But now, thanks to my body transformation, those obsessive thoughts and actions no longer exist within me.

I felt like the depression was the outcome of dealing with my other three mental health issues. I used to struggle with suicidal thoughts, getting out of bed in the morning, had low energy, constant fatigue, poor eating habits, and negative self-talk. But now, I can't wait to start my day with a fresh perspective. My energy levels are pretty high throughout the day, my eating habits have improved, and I no longer suffer from suicidal thoughts and negative self-talk.

After 14 years of dealing with severe anxiety, I was finally able to break free from the mentally suffocating chains that held me hostage. I no longer suffer from severe anxiety, body dysmorphic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression. I lost 63lbs and now have a body that I’m so happy and proud of.

If you're someone who is struggling with any kind of mental health issue, then getting into fitness may be a viable option for you. Please note that I am not suggesting that the method I used will necessarily cure your condition.

And for those looking to start working out at home, these 2 pieces of equipment genuinely helped me out and I hope they do the same for you: 

Fitness bag - [https://fitfanatics.co/products/the-fitness-aqua-bag](https://fitfanatics.co/products/the-fitness-aqua-bag)

Resistance bands - [https://fitfanatics.co/products/fitness-resistance-bands](https://fitfanatics.co/products/fitness-resistance-bands)

Just remember that however you are currently thinking and feeling at this moment can be changed if you’re not happy with it. Remember that the tough days prepare you for the good ones, and in the end the good days always outweigh the bad ones. Know that you ARE truly amazing, you ARE beautiful, and you CAN be anything or anyone you want to be. Visualize your end result and put in the work to make it come true.

It was my first time and it was measured out for me either. I ate about 500 - 750mg that night. It hit about 10 minutes later and within 20 to 30 minutes after I was panicking and hyperventalating I passed out. I felt strange and out of it the next day and didn't want to be alone. By the time the work week was starting I was shaking uncontrollably constantly riddled with fear. I went to the ER twice and was prescribed Vistaril for about a week, that let me eat and sleep and not have the constant strange and scary thoughts about reality. I was off of Vistaril for about 4 days and those were the roughest days. I wanted to be admitted so badly. I had within that time obtained a meeting with a psychiatrist but to this day I still have to wait til that day later on in the month. I also obtained a pcp and got hooked up with more Vistaril til the meeting with the psychiatrist. Vistaril kind of helps a little but just recently I experienced a panic attack while on it and have been trying to recover since. We thinking because it's my time of the month that that could be a contributing factor for my last panic attack. I also just went back to work last week and for the first few days it was alright, once the panic attack happened it's been a bit harder to manage my everyday life. I just keep trying to live, do things even when I don't want to, and try to remain hopefull that I'll get better. But I over obsess over the negative feelings and emotions and it's hard to snap out of it. Before I had the edible I had anxiety, but not to the extent of what I've been dealing with now. It used to be situational anxiety like going to the dentist and stuff like that but once it those things were over and dealt with it would go away. Now it's like my anxiety just lives with me everyday, I'm constantly on edge and it's hard for me to relax. I've tried breathing and distracting myself.

I had a few rough months with back injury last year and few problems in the family that made me very worried and anxious on top of my general anxiety. Due to that I started having heart palpitations and racing heart and it sometimes lasted for days. One night my blood pressure was 140/90 and I was shaking and my mom brought me to the emergency room and they said it was my first panic attack. It has been 6 months since that happened and I am okay, except I have a lot of anxiety everyday. I read somewhere today about hypertension and it being silent killer and I think my health anxiety kicked in. I've always had low blood pressure in general ,except that one time during panic attack, and I haven't checked my blood pressure since then because I was obsessively checking my heart rate anytime it was fast, and I read that it is a compulsion and have to stop. Now since I have constant high anxiety during the day and everything I am scared that I maybe have developed high blood pressure because of that. 
I don't want to check it because I am afraid of it being really high or something and I can't deal with that again. My single mother had a really rough year with my back injury and health problems and other things in family I can't do that to her. I am scared it would only be high momentarily because of anxiety and that I would panic a lot, so I am not sure should I really check my blood pressure or not?

My mom is going to be with me for a little bit before I start my new job but I am so scared for her to leave and to be alone. I am currently at her house for vacation and even couldn’t help thinking in 20yrs everyone I am in the room with will be dead (including the 2 dogs). I’m so freaked out. 

My husbands new job is also demanding like mine. I just have this sense of doom every day. I am a 34yo woman who has a professional job. I’ve been waking up at 4am worrying no matter what strategy I try.. (meditation, melatonin, etc ). What is wrong with me? 

I know worrying about the future just makes today miserable so why can’t I stop?

I hate being sick because I have a job I really like and my role is very important, plus I just hate being bored and having so much free time for my mind to wonder. My normal life consists of work, exercising (I train for half-marathons), seeing friends, and spending the rest of my time with my fiancé. I did not get to do any of that and felt awful! 

Idk if it just put me in a bad mood or what…I just started feeling my thoughts slide into old anxious thought patterns-which consist of insecurities, anxious attachment issues, and feeling victim because my fiancé didn’t sit with me while I was sit. I know…eye roll. I hate that I get that way but it comes out when I feel super anxious and panicky and I feel back into a corner by my own mind. I apologized and explained I need to cope with those feelings and thoughts better without targeting him.

Anyways I say that only because it adds to my anxiety that I don’t really know them that well.

I have a lot of anxiety and I’m super anxious about this trip. I think my main trigger is social events away from my house/comfort spaces, which causes a main symptom of mine to need to use the bathroom urgently. Knowing that that happens to me, I preemptively get anxious about not being able to find a bathroom to use quickly and accessibly when my anxiety poops symptoms hit, such as in a long car ride or on a small boat on the water.

It really feels so crippling and I really want to have as much fun as possible but I’m honestly already getting anxious. I’ve tried immodium before to plug me up but I still had to go to the bathroom weirdly enough, even though I timed the dose well for the event. And I still felt super anxious.

292,Help: My Social Anxiety is driving a wedge between my girlfriend and I. What should I do?,2,11mzh78,Anxietyhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/11mzh78/help_my_social_anxiety_is_driving_a_wedge_between/,1,"Hello reddit peeps. I’m making this post in hopes to gain some insight with how to manage this debilitating mental illness. I’m also wanting to figure out if I’m doing everything that I can to help improve my situation. 


MY BACKGROUND : 
I’ve been dealing with social anxiety and depression for most of my life. It seems like it has gotten worse as I’ve aged and sadly it’s putting a strain on my relationship with my gf and her family. Much like everyone on the planet, I have my good and bad days. Id say I have about 3 good day each week, followed by 4 bad ones where even making my bed is a challenge. My bad days oftentimes leave me feeling anxious, overwhelmed, weak, pathetic, sad, angry, and overall helpless. In general, it’s very hard to converse with others when you feel uncomfortable in your own skin.


SITUATION:
I’ve dated my girlfriend for almost 4 years. Her family is very religious and hosts lots of direct family get togethers. Most of those events are sports oriented, followed by the usual birthdays and holidays. I’m not much of a sports guy so I find it hard to attend those gatherings because it’s usually just me sitting on the couch pinching/picking at my skin because I think that everyone is judging me about how awkward I’m being. Most of the time I don’t know what to do with myself at their house so i just stand out of everyone’s way, speak when spoken to, and do my best not to fall over and die. You can probably imagine why I have issues attending get togethers. It’s like placing my hand on a hot stove top knowing damn well it’s going to burn my hand. Im not going to want to do it. 


ISSUE:
My girlfriend has jumped on my case about not attending her family’s gatherings. She says that she feels weird because everyone else has their SOs with them and she’s just by herself. 
Her family cracks jokes about me being a ghost because I never show up to things and they have this idea that I hate them. 
Recently my GF’s oldest sister had a birthday party, but I couldn’t attend because people in my house have covid. Because of this, her dad made a comment stating that they’ll never see her again if we end up getting married. Apparently, my GF’s middle sister was/is pissed at me for not showing up either. This may have been fueled by me missing my girlfriend’s birthday party a couple months ago because I had a stomach bug. I celebrated my gf’s birthday alone with her the day before I got sick, so it’s not like I forgot. 
I hardly ever speak about myself to anyone so they don’t know what kind of mental issues I deal with. 


MY THOUGHTS:
My girlfriend is valid for feeling the way she does. If the roles were reversed I would also want her at my family events too. However, I feel like her family gets together more than most. 
I think her dad was out of pocket when he made that comment. Even if we were married it’s not like I could/would force her not to show up to their family functions. 


QUESTION: 
What do I do in this situation? Do I need to disclose to her family that I’m just fucked in the head and would gladly be at their gatherings if it weren’t for that? Im at my wits end because I don’t think I can change quickly enough for them. Perhaps the expectation of me being there would be different if my gf and I were actually engaged/married. I just don’t know what to do. Perhaps I’m just not healthy enough to be in any kind of relationship. 



Tldr; My crippling anxiety is bleeding into my relationship with my gf and her family. They don’t know I have anxiety and think that I hate them because I don’t show up to a lot of their family functions. Do you have any advice?",1678386038.0

I (19F) am afraid that I'm exhibiting unhealthy self-obsession or symptoms of covert narcissism. Lately I haven't been able to stop ruminating. Mainly about my social relationships. I have this constant underlying anxiety in the back of my mind that all of my friends dislike me. I'm worried that one of my closest friends is replacing me with someone else, as they spend a lot more time together now and I can't help but feel envious at times. I know it's wrong. I love both of them, actually. I get along with both of them really well, but the two of them have so much more in common and spend so much more time together without me. I feel so insecure and lost. I don't know how this happened, I've tried to stay arms distance from my close friend, as I didn't want to repeat another really close friendship that I've had in the past. I hate that I get attached to people so easily, and then I feel so insecure about our relationship, and so threatened when someone else comes into their life. I need to change. I want to change. But I can't afford actual therapy, and all of the mindfulness meditations that I've been practicing don't seem to work well enough. I'm stuck. I don't know what to do. I get stuck in an endless cycle of ruminating over being ""left out,"" while at the same time I have the overwhelming urge to isolate myself from everyone. The worst part is, nothing is even actually wrong in my life. My family and I are in good health. I have a well-paying job for my age. My grades are good. My friendships and relationships are good, even though I convince myself that they aren't. I have so much to be thankful for, and yet I can only focus on the ""negative."" It's not even actually negative. I'm literally creating problems for myself to ruminate and agonize over, which fuels my self-loathing and insecurity. The worst part is? I'm self-aware of it. I know that these things are wrong of me, and that I'm acting irrationally and neurotically. Changing my behavior seems impossible. I'm working on it, I really, really am. I'm tired of living like this. But this is years, and I mean YEARS of irrational and neurotic thinking/habits here. It seems hopeless to try and actually change without professional help. It's like I love feeling miserable. I love worrying. And then I worry about worrying. I don't even know what subreddit I should post this to. Realizing all of these things about myself has been terrifying. I feel like I haven't been a good friend. Imagining myself in a romantic relationship seems impossible. How could I bear all of my insecurities? I could never inflict them on another person in that way, it would be so shameful and unfair to them. I genuinely don't know what's wrong with me.

I appreciate that you guys are caring for me and giving me your best suggestions. I love you all for that. 

I left off with me being super anxious after work. For the next hour after I leave work I am super anxious about having to go back tomorrow and I’m already thinking about how bad it will be tomorrow and the thought of me not being able to handle it. 

I calmed down after watching some TikTok’s and YouTube videos but the anxiety was coming in waves. Something I would see on my phone or my sub-conscience would trigger thinking about work then I would be stuck with the horrible feeling again for 10 minutes until it would go away. 

I went over my girlfriends house because I missed her and felt like she would help me. As soon as I got there I started crying for pretty much 3 hours until my body physically couldn’t cry anymore. After I became emotionless we watched some funny videos and I ate some food and left to go home. 

I went to sleep pretty normally and slept alright. I woke up 45 minutes before I had to get up and just kept checking my phone waiting to see how long I have while trying to go back to sleep. On my way to work and for the first 2 hours of my shift I felt fine. I think it’s because of how tired I was I wasn’t able to be nervous. 

Around 9-10:30 I was in a awful mindset where I felt like I couldn’t do anything. After 10:30 I felt great even till now I still feel pretty good with just slight nervous attacks here and there. I went to my doctors appointment and my mom explained to him what was going on cause I’m slightly embarrassed to tell him and she said she thinks I should be on medicine. We talked for a little and he decided to put me on something called paroxetine 20 mg tablets. 

I’m nervous about the pills not working/making it worse for me. He said they wouldn’t do that but they could take weeks to work. I feel like I can’t wait weeks for them to possibly work. I know I only have 2 days till the weekend but it feels like such a struggle. Again thanks to everyone that cares about me I appreciate you all 💛",1678316933.0

I used have a dog phobia as a kid, and I remember walking onto a private property by accident once only to suddenly hear a loud barking, causing me to flee away (luckily the dog was locked up but as I ran I assumed I was being chased). Since then I've gotten over my fear of dogs.

However the barking trigger has remained even today, which I'm embarrassed to admit. I recently moved with my girlfriend to a rural area where houses often have big front yards, closed in by gates. A lot of people here though leave their dogs outside and the dogs often bark relentlessly if you walk past.

I don't have a car and I love walking. This has caused me lots of anxiety however when walking and exploring this new town as I have an irrational fear that someone will forget to close a gate and that I'll be attacked and mauled by a dog. It's an anxiety strong enough to make me memorise roads and houses to avoid.

I've had enough of this phobia and want to overcome it. I force myself to walk past dog guarded houses but even then I do it on the other side of the road.

I had health problems a few weeks ago and let me tell u it wasn’t anything bad i had no bad symptoms but for some reason i made myself believe i had cancer and i couldn’t sleep and cried the whole night☠️☠️ i’ve heard that when you’re tested for anxiety they do a scan of ur brain and i’m TERRIFIED like there’s no way i’m doing that cause i’m definitely thinking i have brain cancer (my head hurts sometimes) Ik it’s like really dumb but somehow i’m still scared and i can’t control it and at school i don’t raise my hand cause when i do and i say something wrong i get so embarrassed and i feel like the biggest disappointment. I also get sweaty hands, i feel my heart racing, my face turns red and i feel like everyone is staring at me whenever i talk in front of people or just generally do anything💀💀 Yeah i think there’s a chance that i have anxiety but i’m just too scared to:
1. tell my mom (we don’t have a good relationship) 
2. What if i just made myself think this? 
what if i would actually go there and they would tell me that nothing is wrong with me i would be so embarrassed like my mom just wasted money for no reason and she will never trust me again. So what do u think ik y’all aren’t doctors but some advice would be deeply appreciated, i don’t want to sound like ik i have anxiety and that i’m self diagnosing it’s just that my symptoms are accurate even tho there’s still something telling me that it’s all in my head and i am just fine.",1678306971.0

I had upped my medication from 50 to 75 for a few weeks.. I noticed a lot when I was pregnant that my heart would always race after eating and I felt weak..

I always end up crying too.. I just feel helpless.. the doctor upped me to 100 MG & I’ve been super shaky and my heart races when I get nervous and I start to feel light headed.. & also the need to use the bathroom/nausea is this a side effect?

I would be sitting down and my family would be concerned about me asking if I’m cold or okay. My entire body would kinda shiver for 5-10 minutes except my head. I wasn’t cold. I still don’t know why it happened. 

When I was 12/13, my dad took me to the hospital around 9PM because my body heat felt very hot. I was very distressed. I was sharing a room with my younger sister at the time because we were kids. I was pacing the room. My whole family were in their rooms under covers and such because it was winter, but somehow I was felt uneasy and hot? It wasn’t a sickness like a fever or cold. It felt more like an anxiety panic or something. Everytime I go to my doctor she asks how I’m doing with anxiety because of that night but I didn’t know they diagnosed me. 

For more context, during my graduation in June 2022 from highschool, sitting up on a stage for an hour was hell for me. My hands were soaked. I had trouble making eye contact with the audience. There were many times where I would want to stand up and run to the back to find water or something. I’m emetophobic but there were many times where I wanted throw up even though I knew I couldn’t but I felt like it. Why am I like this? 

In elementary, during school assemblies I’ve always had this silent panic go on with me and thoughts of needing to escape to relieve myself from being in such a crowded area around people where I can’t get up. I sometimes have this feeling in the car.

On New Years eve I was with my friends drinking and they noticed me shaking. I uncontrollably shake sometimes when I know im anxious but like I want it to stop. 

Is this generalized anxiety disorder or social anxiety? How do I go about this?",1678288029.0

My doctor originally prescribed me serraline which I’ve been too anxious to take after researching side effects.

Well as I was walking away the cashier and mom were like, "" omg she doesnt have any patience why didnt she wait before walking."" 

I was super confused because I didnt bump into the kid or anything but maybe from their angle it looked like I was rushing through and didnt wait for the kid to fully move out of the way. 

It made me feel terrible like maybe I wasn't being considerate or something but then I dont know if I really did anything wrong lol. I just obsess over situaions like these because I hate being viewed as rude and always try to be polite. I feel like this is an anxiety thing though..

This is still true to some extent (mostly food) but now I’m constantly analyzing how my body feels and every new feeling has me freaked out. Like recently no matter how much I eat I can’t seem to be full the same way I’m used too. I always feel hungry and always feel empty.

Then for sleep I always get sleep paralysis. Every time I lay down there’s a chance I go into a episode and it makes me anxious for the rest of the day and that loops into my fears of not understanding my body.

These are the questions that would most help me understand different perspectives from those that have anxiety: 

1.)  Is there a colour (or colours) that you would associate with your anxiety? 

1a.)  If there isn't any colour (or colours) that you associate with it, are there any textures or patterns that come to mind? 

1b.)  If yes to either of these questions, would you be able to send me an image or drawing of what colours/textures you associate with your anxiety? 


2.)  Have you noticed how your perception changes when you're experiencing anxiety? And if so, how does your perception change? (Perception of your surroundings / yourself / others) 


3.)  Do you ever get burnt out due to anxiety? What does that look like for you? (I.e, not getting out of bed, being too anxious to start working on something which leads to burnout) 


4.)  Is there a specific moment/situation that you can remember where your anxiety was at an all time high? 


5.)  Are you able to think back to when you first started to experince symptoms of anxiety?  If so, what was that situation like? Was it a lot of little moments that added up over time that turned into anxiety? 


6.)  How does your anxiety effect your day to day life? 


7 .)  How does your anxiety effect your sleep? 


8.)  Do you find yourself speeding through the day? Do you feel like you're in fight/flight/freeze mode a lot of the time?

I sit in my house and obsess over the little cracks in the wall because i believe my house is going to fall on me ....and i know it sounds fucking stupid but i literally think of this every day and it makes me feel so scared. 

anytime i get in a car...and it speeds up ...i assume we are now going to crash and my hands start sweating badly...  i have to calm myself down all the time..same with trains or even busses. 

i feel sick all the time like physically nausea and then when i go to throw up because i dont fear vomit or even the feeling of nausea i just much prefer to vomit because after the feeling goes away...but nothing comes out. 

i feel like i am going mad....in the past i was diagnosed with bipolar and spent alot of my late teens on meds but ive learnt how to re condition and stretch the mind......but in all my moments of despair i never ever felt any fear.......this is the first time i feel truly frightened over anything. 

i notice im alot more irritable as well...the slightest inconvience reduces me to tears 

i should also state that i dont have friends .....i dont go out with people....i have no close relationships and am pretty introverted....over the last 4 years my social anxiety has just overriden my logical and rational side of my brain.

Its going to sound weird I think, but I have this fear that something bad happened to me and that Im imagining everything that is currently happening to me. That reality just isnt.

I know it sounds super irrational, Ive talked it out and all but I still have a remaining lingering feeling of uneasiness that wont go away and I dont know what to do anymore except maybe talk it here will make it seem less of a big deal

Ill summarize the incident that ignited this all to the best of my abilities, went to the a convenience shop with my mom, she waited outside in the car while I went in for stuff. Took lot of time in there but anyways went back to the car after buying my stuff and then my mom asked me why I took so long and that she was getting worried because I didnt come out fast. Somehow that sent me spiraling into a state of “oh god what if something happened to me and I was now just imagining that I was ok and all” and of thinking the worst scenarios, like kidnapping. 

Which if I think more rationally couldnt have happened, I remember all my actions inside the shop and even interacted with the people in there plus if something had happened I wouldve felt it or someone wouldve noticed, its not an empty place after all.

Im so uneasy, how can I deal with this? Ive tried distracting myself of thinking that, of tiring my body and making myself busy but it somehow worms its way back to. I know its irrational I just dont know how to snap out of it completly

I am a 20 year old male dealing with some type of issue I don’t even know what to call it. I will explain my issue but first you have to hear the background and how it leads to now. I graduated high school never having worked a job and was super scared to get one once I graduated. After I graduated I got a full time job. I was doing ok while working I was happy I would come home after work and play video games and hang out with family and friends during the weekends. After about a month of working this girl gets hired to work alongside me. After about 5 months of working together everyday we got told that we weren’t allowed to work together anymore and would have our positions switched. I didn’t get to spend as much time with her because we couldn’t be together but I was still very happy with everything in my life. Probably around 2 months later we started dating and my life became even more amazing and I was so happy with everything. Around another 3 months after this I was told that I was going to lose everything I like about this job (mon-fri mornings) and that I wouldn’t be compensated for it. Because I was high off of life and thought everything was perfect I decided that they aren’t gonna treat me fair so I’ll quit and go somewhere else because I’m worth more than what they are giving me. So I quit and she decides to quit as-well. We go on a vacation have some fun just nice happy stuff for like a week or 2. She finds another job quickly I didn’t because I was slacking because I had 10k dollars saved up so I felt like I didn’t need one super bad. About another month goes by and she moves in with me and my family because she has a bad home life and for probably the next 3 months I see her every day before she goes to work I would sometimes take her and pick her up from work. I would eat dinner with her every day and even go to bed together every night with her. It’s now been probably 3-4 months without me having a job. Eventually I find a job that I thought I would have enjoyed. It was good money and a good schedule that was close to home but after working 2 days I quit. I couldn’t take it. I felt like I was missing out on life and I missed her so much and just felt sad and I guess depressed because all of my day felt like it was working. During this period my brothers girlfriend broke up with him and my girlfriends family life was really affecting her mental health so I don’t know if it was affecting me or not. Anyways I quit and everything went back to the way it was and I was happy again. After another month or 2 she gets a new job that is much better and she moves out on her own. I was sad that she left but nothing abnormal after probably another month without a job and her being moved out I get another job. Before I started I was super happy with life me and my girlfriend were doing well. I got to play video games and hang out with friend and family for the past 6ish months (minus the 2 days I worked) and I felt ready to get a job and that I could handle it and it was what I had to do. Today (3-6-23) was my first day I was super nervous the night before so I didn’t sleep very well but was still prepared for today. I was nervous all the way until I got there and was still nervous while working. After like an hour or 2 I feel great nothing is wrong. Then I get hit with a wave of missing my girlfriend and that life is awful and I’m wasting my day working and that this is how life shouldn’t have to be. After a little pep talk with myself things get better and I work some more and then around an hour before I am done the same thing happens again. This time I couldn’t shake it and I am here in my bed crying trying to figure out what to do. I understand that I need money and I understand that everyone in the world has a job and that so many people have it way worse than I do but it’s not helping me feel any better. I get that I may sound like a spoiled guy and that I’m being a baby but I want help. I don’t know what to do and I feel like I can’t deal with/ handle what’s going on. My mom said if I quit this job that she’s gonna take me to the doctors and I don’t feel like that’s nessicary. If anyone can help any way possible I would appreciate it so much.,1678156673.0

It all started with chest pains, muscle stiffness and migraines. She began reading so much stuff online that she came up with the theory she had epilepsy when she never had any sort of epileptic episode, she started to believe stuff she read online and progressively got worse.

We have taken her to the ER 4 different times. They do everything from labs to CT Scans and everything is fine. We took her to a psychiatrist because he believed she had a chemical imbalance in her brain. He diagnosed her with depression and GAD, gave her Prozac but 3 weeks later changed it to Lexapro because she isn't getting better.

Right now she has chest pains, muscle stiffness, whole body tremors and can barely walk on her own. She feels ok sometimes and acts completely normal, but all of a sudden she gets the tremors episodes, starts crying and can't get up on her own.

Her whole body hurts because of the tremors so she spends her days in bed. My family and I don't know what to do anymore. My theory is that she's so stuck thinking something's wrong with her that she now truly believes it's not anxiety but something physiological like epilepsy, a tumor, or something worse she can't manage.

I'd like to know if GAD can truly cause these extreme symptoms, or if my sister needs to put in the effort to change her beliefs around what she's experiencing.",1678167777.0

Here's a little backstory. I'm a 20 y/o girl, I had a rough childhood that caused a lot of my current anxiety problems but things have turned around ever since. I have a loving boyfriend, an amazing relationship w my mom and siblings, and I finally know what I'd like to do with my life! I've been so into travelling for the past 2 years, I want to make it to every country in the world. I've driven by myself to over 40 US states, I just love to go on road trips. 

I've been excited for this trip for so long. I drove from my home in PA and I'm now in Lousiana, heading down to florida to spend my days tanning at the beach. I've been having a blast hiking, and I've been working on articles (I'm a newbie travel writer) to fund myself, but suddenly I'm just hit with this overwhelming anxiety.

It happens nearly every time I travel. I will panic and convince myself I need to go home and that it's the best thing for me. It's awful because it feels like my whole trip was wasted when I end it early. I don't go out and do everything i want to do, I beat myself up for weeks about wasting money on gas, ""why did I even drive out there just to cry and come back?"" I've done it in Ottawa, Vegas, Colorado, Washington, and now, Louisiana, I guess.

It makes me despise myself. I think part of it is my codependency with my bf. I just want to be with him. He makes me happy, while I'm otherwise emotionally unstable. Another part is I am so broke so traveling is exhausting. I sleep in my car at truck stops, I eat ramen from my propane stove, ect. I'm grateful I get to travel and I'm also thankful I dont have to life like that all the time, I have a home to go back to. I should be more positive. 

When I travel, part of me feels powerful and brave, but when something goes wrong, I feel like I've lost all control. It sends my anxiety spiraling. Yesterday at a truck stop a man was creeping on me and I left and drove to another. Ever since that I've felt unstable, out of control, everything's wrong. I cant fix it no matter how hard I try.

This is all I want to do with my life. I have plans to work hard, make enough money so my bf and I can both travel. But in the mean time, I have to travel to gain experience and write more articles. 

Basically, what I'm asking for is some motivation to keep me going. I really dont want to drive home. The florida sun is waiting for me, but I cant look past my stupid foggy emotions.

The thing that throws me off and gives me more anxiety is that the ekg read findings of inferior q waves & as possible LVH and considered HOCM. The cardiologists said there was still low suspicion of cardiac issues since the echo came back as grossly unremarkable & negative troponin. I also had many other ekgs and they all have given me the green light that I’m okay. I will get another Echo just to rule out anything once & for all again & for my piece of my mind.

I can’t even muster up the courage to go see a therapist or go to a doctor. I haven’t consistently been outside my house since 2020. Life just feels so hard. I also have a fear of passing away at a young age. Even when I get motivated to better myself it usually only last for a few days then I’m right back to my old self. Sorry for the rant but I just feel trapped with no way out. These days I can’t even eat without thinking I’ll get sick. I think I may have emetophobia.",1678071105.0

Ive been seeing a counselor and a behavior therapist for a few years now and I thought I had a good grip on things.

Around November of '22 I started having really bad OCD thought loops on my way to NYC. Since then it seems like everything I do I second guess or feel like its wrong.

My behavior therapist has me on SSRIs for anxiety and they do help to a degree, but there is always something that makes me loop.

Whether that is leaving the house in the morning and double, triple and quadruple checking my faucets and appliances to make sure they're off, to driving down the road hitting a clump of snow and thinking it was an animal or a person.

I was doing so well and for the last few months its intensified. I brought this to reddit to get different answers other than the ones my doctor is giving. I feel like they get it, but not fully the way im experiencing it. Im here to get some other perspectives and possible remedies / solutions.

I'm a 27 year old woman and suffer with really bad anxiety both socially and on a daily basis. I also suspect I've undiagnosed autism but have not gotten an official diagnosis.

Sometimes when I get very anxious I lash out and say things I don't mean.

Years ago there was a girl I used to have a small crush on. I suspect she knew and didn't feel the same but would kind of play on it knowing she made me nervous. We had matched on tinder and we had messaged a but but she'd ghosted me. I'd see her on nights out and she wouldn't say anything to me bar the odd look and that was fine it didn't bother me that much. But she'd like my Instagram stories or the odd photos.

One night after an event she came up behind me having never spoken to me in person really and rubbed my back and said 'I know the bones of you' and it kind of humiliated me and made me anxious. 

I told her to get away from me and called her a snake. I regret this so much. She had made me very uncomfortable by doing that though.

To this day her friends look at me weirdly on nights out, bear in mind this happened about 4 years ago. I manage to contriol my anxiety when drinking much better now.

I even sent the girl a message weeks ago apologising for how I'd reacted even though she has been the one to make me feel uncomfortable. She never opened it or responded. I just wish I could tell her friends that they probably know only one side of the story and that I am not a bad person just reacted badly to an uncomfortable situation. Seeing the way they look at me really upsets me to the point that I barely want to go out anymore.

So when that expectation isn’t met and people still criticize me, I get angry and resentful because it feels like there is nothing I can do to please them which makes me feel like there is no way to get away from my anxiety.

I also end up feeling like a victim which makes me feel weak and disempowered which I hate. This also makes me angry lol.

So my question is can I choose to not feel anxiety in situations like this, and how? If I can’t just choose not to feel it, how do I deal with it? What is the healthy end goal that I should have if ending the feeling of anxiety isn’t possible?

When I was young my sister deleted a birthday pic of me “because it didn’t get enough likes”


Years later in college I made friends and went to a small party (like 5 people) and they posted pics of everyone except me. We had a great night and were laughing the whole time, idk why I wasn’t good enough to post. 

This is a small example and may not seem like a big deal but alot of other stuff had happened and it’s just been the same pattern. This same type of hurtful shit always happens. I always get ignored at home. Friends always making plans right in front of me. Bullied all my life by family and classmates, even in college. Getting ghosted. People always just say nasty things to me. People are just crueler nowadays in our generation 

I was out drinking one night with friends and this random guy looks at me and says “this mf definitely never had a relationship!” People have also randomly laughed at me before, call me names. Idek why, im not even ugly. I guess I just don’t fit the ridiculously high standards of today’s generation. Just because I don’t look and act like a supermodel or celebrity then oh well I guess that makes me ugly.  

Idk what it is. I’ve always been cool and amicable, really friendly and funny. I don’t cause any issues. I’m just a cool guy as far as im concerned.

I relate alot to the Shrek quote “I don’t have a problem with people they seem to have a problem with me” people have been assholes to me for no reason

About 6-7 weeks ago (mid january) I after binge drinking for a week I started to have severy anxiety, stress and so on.. I was sure there was something wrong with me physically so I stopped drinking.. I went to the doctor, got my heart rate/pressure checked, lungs X rayed, and a bunch of blood tests, everything came out ok.. but I still had that severe anxiety that there was something wrong with (again physically) and I was overthinking and assuming the worst. The anxiety and stress were so bad that I was committed to hospital bed rest for a few days. Everything started to calm down so I went home, and a day or two later after I was released I had a massive panic attack.. So I decided to go to parents for a few days, everything started to feel better. Anxiety started to fade away and so on, then after a few weeks I thought that maybe I could have some drinks and play videogames, next day small hangover + small headache, but nothing too serious.. Hangover started to calm down except the headache so my anxiety started to come back and I started to overthink again, so I felt that maybe its time to go to parents place again. And everything started to feel fine, headache calmed down also. So it was friday again and decided to have some drinks and play. But this time, the next morning, I had quite a headache (drank little too much) I got scared and started to overthink again, and you can guess what happened, yes a small panic attack.. except now the headache didn't really go away, not at all atleast, It feels like a toothpick is being stuck in my head, mostly on the left side and on top of the head, it isnt seriously painful just pretty annoying, but cant stop thinking about it. And sometimes, not every day but sometimes I get these ""strikes"" I call them that, feels the same in the same area but more painful, the pain only lasts a couple of seconds and goes away almost instantly. The headaches caused my anxiety and stress to go to a whole new level, one day bedrest in the hospital and after that psychward (this is like level 1 psychward, so yes we can use our phones) I have talked to the doctors about the headaches when I first got them, and again now here at the psychward. Both times they did these neurological tests and everything is fine according to those tests or atleast nothing serious they say. The only symptoms I have including the headaches and ""strikes"" are pressure feeling in my head and sometimes it feels like my ears are clogged, some dizziness for a few seconds maybe once a day, but it doesnt affect my balance, also stronger painkillers help, but I dont like popping pills constantly. When the headaches first started, I began to overthink about tumors, anerysms etc. My girlfriend said that she thinks its most likely very bad tension/stress headache, because she also said that my shoulder muscles feel really hard and tense. Im being released tomorrow so I can go home, anxiety is pretty much mild most likely due to a new medication I started here. But the headaches are still present, not as bad as before but still. I'm committed to stop drinking until I feel good physically and mentally. So why I'm writing this, is because if there are anyone out there who has experienced something similar (would like to hear your stories) or if there are any professionals who could maybe help my out.

1. The caudate nucleus   
2. The specific brain cells in the basal ganglia   
3. The prefrontal orbital cortex   
4. The cingulate gyrus.   


The first, the caudate nucleus, is considered to be the main part of the brain that controls repetitive and regular behaviors. Medications to treat OCD helps diminish the activity in this part of the brain.   


The basal ganglia functions as a filter of thoughts getting in the center of the brain from other parts.   


The prefrontal orbital cortex, located in the front area of the brain, is believed to make reasonable decisions and affect social conduct. In the brain of. Person with OCD, there’s too much activity not having in this area. Usually, the case is that this region has been harmed just because of biological or psychological incidents and developments.   


A lack go guilt or responsibility is usually a symptom of somebody who is addicted and lacks activity in this part of the Brain. The balance is off. The people who have become addicted, either to pornography, compound eating or betting, have a smaller sized frontal cortex with insufficient activity. In the brain of an addict, the frontal cortex is too little. Nevertheless, in the brain of a person with OCD, there’s way too much activity in the frontal cortex.   


The cingulate gyrus, is situated in the center of the brain. The cingulate gyrus contributes emotional responses to obsessive idea.s The emotions linked to the compulsive behaviors are usually what makes an OCD-patient stuck in her/his patterns.

I used to safe medicate myself with Kratom, the things made anxiety completely disappear, but I've become less active and even lazy

Now in nearly off Kratom, I'm on 20% of my previous dose, to get rid off addiction.

I'm also medicated with sertraline 50mg, and Ritalin 20mg.

Self medicate myself with motherwort, passionflower, schizandra, rhodiola and other very mild anxiolitic substances.


The thing I noticed is that anxiety is very helpful to get things done and be productive, but a lot of anxiety makes you even less productive and make you feel very bad.


So the key to success is to balance somehow the anxiety and find a harmony, so you will be happy and productive. 

When I tapered my Kratom usage i finally felt anxiety and i was really happy at the moment, very mild anxiety makes me feel like human.

For example i have problem to get everywhere on time, if it's meeting, job or just chill with friends, and if im calm, my anxiety is on 0%, i will most likely come very late.

If my anxiety is high, i will also come late, i will have psychosomatics - nausea, diarrhea,body shake etc.

And if I find somehow balance of anxiety, i can come at time.

Also second example - going outside. If i have anxiety, i find it impossible to go outside, i have paranoia that someone will see me and all those obsessive thoughts.

427,Needing reassurance please,2,11iqo4e,Anxietyhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/11iqo4e/needing_reassurance_please/,1,"Today is a bad day. Lots at play so I will try to sum it up as best I can. 
- I have generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder and depressive disorder.
- Transitioned onto new meds (with my doctor's assistance) and am at the first stage of the new meds, a very low dose.
- My hours got cut at work and I am in deep financial fear and distress
- Had a big fight yesterday (and again today) with a friend/romantic connection who meant a lot to me. It is quite possible that the friendship is over, which devastates me because not only do I care about him, he is also a peer in my primary profession.

I have spent the day in tears, having panic attacks and depression sleeping. My body and my head hurt from oversleeping, I'm shaking from the anxiety (and low blood sugar - I have no appetite), and the fear is overwhelming.

I have had days like this before and I've always gotten through them, but this one feels different. Because of the argument with this friend, the loss of our potential romantic connection, and their proximity to my career success, the fear is at a new level...on top of the fear that I may lose my home.

What I need right now is the ""it gets better stories."" Someone please tell me my life is not over and that it will get better...because I can't live like this.

Hellluuu, 
my name is Maggie and I'm 20 years old. I have struggled  with mental illness a lot in my past and have been in treatment for 6 years. My issues were never really gone, they just became manageable and I was able to distract myself from them. I moved out of my parents house 2 months ago and my issues are taking over my life again. I get very anxious and overthink a lot. It's keeping me from focussing on reality and the 'here and now'. I often feel unsafe in the world. I think about my position as a human on this planet and realize that I dont matter and have absolutley no control over my life and what will happen in the future. These thoughts are intrusive. I've had these thoughts before about 2 years ago and somehow managed to get it under control again and just live my life somewhat peacefully. But it seems different now, I feel alot less safe in general and it's way more difficult, almost Impossible, to handle my anxiety. I guess I'm just stressing about things I cant control, but i can't stop. 

Have any of you experienced this? 
How did you deal with it? 
Can you give me some tips? 

Thanks in advance!

I can’t see or find my “redeemable qualities”, so if I am not reaching the ambitions I set at my 10 years of age, I am failing myself, my mom, and wasting my potential. On the same note, once my mom finds out that I am gay, she will hate me even more. Because I don’t feel like I have redeemable qualities and everyone eventually leaves, if the one person that is supposed to love me unconditionally (my mom) no longer does, I won’t see the point in living. So I feel like my anxiety is trying to keep me on my toes, trying to make me be hyper aware of every flaw, hoping that I fix them so that I can find some way to be lovable because then I wouldn’t feel like my life will be over if I don't achieve my goals and then I will be able to rest. It is paradoxical though because it is that same anxiety that prevents me from being able to succeed in the way I’d need to reach my ambition anyways. Idk its a whole mind fuck and I don’t know where to go next. I know I somehow need to find my redeemable qualities and learn to believe that I am lovable whether I reach my educational, financial, ambition goals or not, but I have no idea where to start.

Backstory for some context:

I’m 19 and have felt feelings of sadness before and maybe even to the extent you could label it as being “Depression” but I have always looked at it as something I could manage. 

Last week I got a significant raise at work and am now making extremely great money for my age, enough to afford a car and move out and have spending money up the wazoo still after that, i’m not saying this to be a snob, just to put into perspective that I thought i’d be pissing myself with excitement however it didn’t make me happy. I felt no excitement and from there on I just started to become more and more anxious, I then had an anxiety attack on Saturday night and was not able to sleep and had to resort to sleeping downstairs with my dad and just going downhill from there.

I’ve deleted all social media, changed my diet, started reading way more, quit drinking and am trying to quit vaping and am going to start working out as soon as i’ve gotten over this cold i’m dealing with atm. I’m also not obese, just a little underweight, if that means anything.

If anyone could help me pin down what’s causing this, could it be possible that I have anxiety?

On my last trip with my husband to California I was bawling before getting on the plane and was trying to call my mom to just leave him and not go at all. It consumes so much of thoughts when leading up to the trip. And then on the trips I am so disassociated that I can’t even enjoy it. I’m usually sick to my stomach for a few days and then run on auto pilot almost like I’m in flight mode until we’re home. I barely remember our time in hawaii because I felt this way the entire time. 

It has gotten a bit better recently where I am usually okay once I get on trips that are local drives or somewhere familiar like California. But I still have a lot of distress leading up to it. We have planned a trip to Italy which is my dream vacation. It’s a 10 day trip for our 1 year/honeymoon and my birthday. However I’m already having excessive intrusive thoughts that I need to get out of it and cancel. That we will die and we will be unsafe and idek what but it’s just extreme general flight mode kicks in when I think about leaving home. But I don’t want to! I want to want to be there. I want to not get sick from anxiety. I want to remember the trip and be able to be present and enjoy it. It’s not anxiety about planning because I LOVE planning. Organizing things is my favorite ever. I just think I am so anxious when my perceived control is gone and I go into protective mode. 

I would love any advice on how to cope with this. I have been seeing a therapist but I broke up with her today. I’m an open book. I’ll talk to anyone about everything and I’m extremely self aware. I told my therapist this and stated because of that I need someone who will tell me what they observe analytically in me, respond to me with meaningful commentary, and provide structured homework/assignments to treat my disorder. Aka I don’t need talk therapy. What’s she do? Listens and when I ask for responses gives the most dumb empty response. I explained this to her and all she said was “well the world will be a bad place whether or not you go so why not enjoy it” and I was like ik….. I literally just said that can you give me tangible things to practice to deal with this? And she said just keep reminding yourself you can’t control everything. 

Cool Susan thank you I definitely don’t already do that all the time. Not like I’ve said “I know it’s a control issue and that I can’t control things” 100x",1677811489.0

Maybe I say it more when I'm tired, or at home, or uncomfortable. I'm a uni student, and I live with my mum and my step dad, and even though I get along with them great, my step dad points out my ums a lot. Usually I'm just talking to my mum, and he's there too, and he just makes so many mean comments about it. He does it with a lot of my ""stupid"" speech things, but he's a lot meaner about the um, because he finds it super annoying. But I'm not deliberately saying it, I've always said it unconsciously, but he's just super mean about it and it always makes me uncomfortable and anxious and my mum never says anything about it - which usually means she agrees with him - and I don't know what to do. How do I set boundaries with them? I recently tried, he made a mean comment, I told him quietly that ""I'm just going to say um"" and he responded with ""then go say it somewhere else"". I don't know what to do about it, and it makes me anxious all the time now because I feel like I can't even talk without being judged. Any help or advice would be appreciated.",1677841237.0

Do you know what I mean? and after you finish the whole meal you feel like there is still a piece of food stuck in he throat somewhere and keep drinking water to make it go down but it still feels like it is there. it feels like there is something still there.

So years ago I had a pretty traumatic event and got an post trauma because of it. Since then I’m so self aware in social surroundings. With my panic attacks I started to close myself and not look at people at all. What’s the most difficult is to keep eye contact with people at the same age. Like saying high to elderly people or while buying something at the check out is no issue, but when it’s a random event like waiting for the train, sitting in the bus, walking by people I have really difficulties with it. Also I should mention that my normal face is like a resting bitch face, I think that’s a factor which makes it even more difficult for me. When I’m in a good mood it’s easier for me, but at an average day it makes my daily life really stressful. Do you have a similar issue and something which helped u getting rid of that overthinking and awkward behavior? 

My panic attacks are almost gone since I practiced daily to find methods to control it or not think about it, but they eye contact thing is really frustrating. At home, with friends or at work it isn’t an issue at all, just with strangers. Thanks for helping out!

I need some help, I have a 2-year-old dog and he is absolutely friendly and playful with everyone, I take him to dog parks and he socializes with people in our complex. However In December last year, he was very sick with  Acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome which is severe vomiting and blood in the stool, I took him to the vet and they completely handled him terribly and whereas trying to stretch him out to put on a muzzle, as a result, he bit her hand. She came out and shouted at me and called my dog a whole bunch of nasty things. Side note, he has never bitten anyone nor shown aggression. It took him 1 month to recover from this ordeal since he had become very fearful of people.

Now my issue is I suffer from server anxiety and he is my anchor basically but since that ordeal, I haven't been able to recover emotionally. So whenever people were to touch my dog I become anxious which makes him feel scared again and he started growling and barking aggressively. However when he is which my partner or my dad he is absolutely fine. So it's my anxiety that is affecting him.

Can someone give me some advice on how to get over this anxiety when people want to play with him?

477,"Behavioural, Dietary and Supplemental Anxiety Management Tools",15,11g57vy,Anxietyhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/11g57vy/behavioural_dietary_and_supplemental_anxiety/,4,"Hi all, I've been doing a lot of research over the last few years on anxiety managing strategies. These are some of the things that I've heard have worked for different people, all in one place. Let me know if there's something that's worked for you that I haven't included, I always like adding new things to my list :)

&#x200B;

**Behavioural:**

* *Plenty of sleep*, high quality, at least 7.5hrs, preferably 8, consistently.
* *Exercise* that **increases heart rate** to around 70-80% max, daily if possible, at least 15 minutes. Done outdoors if possible, but not necessary.
* *Cold exposure* 1 minute min. per day.
* *Sunlight expose* **early in the morning** \+ **forward movement**. Walk/run/bike at sunrise does the trick, keep eyes in front of you.
* *Breath-work* (Wim Hof style or any other), as much or as little as desired, at least once per day.
* *Mindfulness meditation*, guided or unguided (works well when done after breath-work)
* *Light stretching* of large muscle groups, dead-hangs for spine decompression, foam roller/massage machine. Muscle tension can cause anxiety and vice-versa.
* *Regular massage* if possible.
* *Sauna*, followed by cold exposure, with whatever frequency and duration that best suits.
* *Good posture* when sitting, regular breaks to lightly stretch.
* *Good quality breathing*. Always through the nose, and **smooth**, not stabby.

&#x200B;

**Dietary/Supplemental:**

*Generally diet depending on preference -* vegan, carnivore, paleo, keto etc.

**Use trial and error to find what works**, account for medical advice, and do good quality research.

Don’t take anyone's advice/opinion as gospel, make sure claims are backed up with good science.

Generally, however:

* *Hydration*. Recommendation is around 2x body weight in KG, in mL, every 30 minutes.
* *Eat food from quality sources* and try to avoid processed foods and refined sugar.
* *Maintaining insulin sensitivity* seems to be agreed upon as a positive from most (if not all) dietary camps.

&#x200B;

Supplementation to improve mental health seems largely anecdotal, however there is research to suggest that some substances may help.

As a baseline, it is widely advised to take a good quality multivitamin, probiotic, and cod liver oil (depending on your diet/lifestyle, you may benefit from none, some, or all of these).

Getting complete blood-work done to check for deficiencies can be very helpful.

&#x200B;

Some other supplements to experiment with are:

(Try **one at a time** for at least four weeks, recording how anxiety levels throughout the day, keeping your regular daily schedule as consistent as possible)

(Research them before-hand to check for any side effects, and if there are people who shouldn’t take them. Don’t just go in all guns blazing.)

&#x200B;

* L-Theanine.
* Magnesium (Some suggest Magnesium *Glycinate* is better).
* CBD.
* Ashwagandha.
* L-Tryptophan.
* GABA.
* Inositol.
* B-Complex (*Methylated* B-Complex is argued by some to be better).
* Vitamin D3.
* Chamomile.
* Valerian root.",1677770199.0

482,Breaking the Chains of Anxiety: A Tale of Two Paths and Two Outcomes.,1,11gpth0,Anxietyhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/11gpth0/breaking_the_chains_of_anxiety_a_tale_of_two/,4," 

Once upon a time, there were two boys named Alex and Ben. Both boys struggled with anxiety and were bullied in school, which made their teenage years a nightmare.

Alex decided to seek help and went to therapy. He also started taking antidepressants, which helped him cope with his anxiety. However, he still found it challenging to make friends and was often stuck in his negative thoughts.

On the other hand, Ben decided to take matters into his own hands and googled ""how to be happy?"" He came across a wealth of information on personal development, which opened up a whole new world for him. He began reading books, attending seminars, and networking with like-minded people who inspired him to pursue his dreams.

Fast forward nine years, and the two boys had taken vastly different paths in life. Alex was stuck in a dead-end job, smoking weed every day, and wasting his time away. He felt unfulfilled and didn't know what to do with his life.

Meanwhile, Ben had built a successful online business, allowing him to travel the world and live his dreams. He had developed a positive mindset, which allowed him to overcome his anxiety and achieve success in his personal and professional life.

One day, Alex bumped into Ben at a coffee shop. He was surprised to see how much Ben had achieved since they last met. Ben shared his story with Alex, explaining how personal development had changed his life and encouraged Alex to do the same.

Alex realized that he had been relying on medication and therapy to solve his problems, instead of taking action to improve his life. Inspired by Ben's story, Alex decided to take control of his life and embrace personal development.

In the following months, Alex started reading books, attending seminars, and networking with people who inspired him to pursue his passions. He slowly but surely began to change his mindset and started taking steps towards building a better life for himself.

Years went by, and both boys had taken different paths, but they both found happiness and success. Alex was no longer stuck in a dead-end job, but had started his own business, and was now traveling the world, living his dreams just like Ben.

The moral of the story is that no matter how tough life gets, we always have a choice. We can choose to be a victim of our circumstances, or we can choose to take control of our lives and create the life we want. Personal development can be a powerful tool for change, and we all have the ability to tap into it and achieve our dreams.

I would like to share this link for a free appearance anxiety self-help treatment. I'm a clinical psychology graduate student working on an IRB-approved study with Florida State University about a text-based treatment for women with appearance anxiety.

This treatment works by having women consciously reduce habits that we think may maintain concerns over one’s appearance. The idea is that by reducing these habits over 28 days, you can also reduce your anxiety around your physical appearance. It sounds simple, but we’ve seen it work in previous studies we’ve run. In addition to the treatment, we also offer a chance to receive monetary compensation (a 1 in 10 chance at receiving a $20 Amazon gift card) for time spent completing surveys where you will also be able to provide feedback on the study.

So I’m suspected Adhd and I’ve had a lot of crazy shit happen to me over this last decade. I struggled to sleep, I was not drinking, a workaholic, in therapy, trying to do everything right.

So I finally went to a doctor, for the sleep. 

He prescribed me Mirtazapine as an off label sleep medication, it happened to be an SSR/antidepressant and HOLY SHIT.

I did not realise how much my anxiety was holding me back.

I have had full nights sleep, cannot stop drawing, my confidence is immense.

Obviously every story is different and meds aren’t for everyone but if you’re anxious and you’re thinking of getting your butt down to the doctors, you might as well try. 

Please be safe with what you try, assess the label and side effects and make sure you’re lifestyle is changing for the better to keep you active and better but yeah.

I just never thought I would have the ability to think and draw and create again. I never even considered meds tbh because I never trusted the pharmacy and was scared of the horror stories.

The hypochondria can completely dominate my life at times and take away all joy from good moments. I have been able to manage it with myself lately with a combination of sertraline and an acceptance that I myself am doomed to die soon. My wife and I got pregnant this year and around the 3rd trimester I started to feel worries about the fetus creep up. Ever scan, check, heart beat, led me to jump to conclusions that our baby was going to be sick or disabled.

We just welcomed our baby boy into the world last week. So far he is healthy. I can barely even write that sentence without fear of jinxing it. I am once again fully convinced that every bump, weird sound, test that they run will confirm my deep down feeling that there is something wrong with him. It is sucking the joy out of this incredible time in my life. I just can never accept that me, my wife, and my baby are healthy. It feels wrong.

Of course my family has told me things like ""how does worrying help?"" ""Try to enjoy each moment one at a time."" And that being a parent there will always be another worry.

I didn’t think too much about it and thought I probably pulled a muscle at the gym. The pain got worse and worse overtime and started interfering with sleep. I was getting 3 hours of sleep due to the excruciating pain. So decided to go to the doctor.

He ordered several bloods tests and the results shook him and me. He told me he suspects blood cancer. That news put me in severe depression. As a 24 year old, I lost all the motivation I had for my dreams and aspirations overnight. was all alone during lockdown and decided not to give the news to my family just to avoid them from worrying about it. I thought let me first confirm if the diagnosis is accurate.

Over 4 months, the results came back normal and the possibility of blood cancer was dismissed. However by now, I developed chronic sleep problems. I could never sleep for longer than 3 hours. I spent my day with extreme headache, foggy brain and occasional fever. My cognitive levels went down to that of a 5 year old and my work at grad school was getting compromised. 

I decided to extend my graduation since I couldn’t handle it anymore. For the next 2 years, I tried several antidepressants, gabapentin, Hydroxyzine and nothing worked. By this time, my memory was nothing but mush, my motivation had died, and I could see all my friends getting jobs, getting married and having children. At the same time, I have lost my own self respect because I lost my scholarship and am once again dependent on my dad financially at 26. 

Even though he has never stopped supporting me, I can sense the worry he has for me. I hate making him feel this way. Deep down I know it’s really bothering him and given that he already has hypertension I really want to take the load away from him. I’m so glad my mother is there to take care of him. 

Anyway, I was finally prescribed clonazepam yesterday. I took 1 mg and oh god what can I say. I feel like a baby again. No more headaches or anxiety. My brain fog is still there but hopefully the exercises and meditation will solve that completely.

I am aware of all the risks benzos possess. However, I only wish some doctors weren’t this strict about it for the fear of destroying a person’s life. Well guess what, not prescribing sooner destroyed 3 years of my life. I hope more people understand the benefits of benzos and not suspect every patient to be someone who’s only  seeking drugs to abuse them.

Anyway, I only hope the worst is behind me and I can now focus on making up for my lost time.

Take care everyone.",1677633317.0

I have been miserable for weeks now. My RHR is on the 80s and i can feel it beating and i feel like I’m going to die. I’m not sure if this is an anxiety thing or not but is literally driving me crazy to the point that I’m here watching a show and all I’m thinking is how I can feel my heart beating and I’m literally counting every beat wth!! 

I see many posts from other people saying their hearts at rest are around 60-70bpm which is a good number. In my case is higher than that so does that mean I’m sick? Dying? Is my heart weak? I don’t want my heart to be overworking.  I have been drinking a lot of water so idk why my heart rate is like that. When I’m asleep it goes to low 70s occasionally mid 60s but shouldn’t it be lower since I’m asleep?

I am in high school and have a lot of trouble with math. Because of this, during PE I have to go to a small math class and learn how to do math. So because of my anxiety, it’s hard for me to ask for help. I always get comments saying, ""Why didn’t you ask for help?"" or ""Just ask for help!"" or something along those lines. If it were just that easy, I wouldn’t be in this situation. especially from teachers and my mom. So, like I said earlier, I go to a small math class. There are about six of us, including me. And everyone in there talks and asks for help when we’re solving problems, besides me. I don’t say a word or ask for help when I need it. So today, the teacher in there said she ""hates when students don’t ask for help or participate in class."" she was looking at me when she said that, and I’m the only person who doesn’t talk or participate in there, and everyone knows that. I was embarrassed and almost cried because of that. So once we got done, she walked us down to the gym. And this girl said she needed to talk to her. So they were talking, and I was close to them. And she said, ""That’s the thing that bothers me, it’s when students are shy in class and don't participate."" God, I’m sorry I ended up this way.

Not sure if its anxiety or something else.

I’ve been having numerous symptoms for over a year now (muscle aches, tender spots, tingling, numbness, stomach ache etc) and the longer they’ve been going on, the more I dwell on them. Numerous medical professionals have conducted tests which have been inconclusive.

The weirdest one though is a strange feeling in my chest/upper body that I find quite tricky to describe. It’s like a strange dropping, fluttering feeling of pressure in my chest where I feel like I might pass out, or as if my heart skips a beat. Sometimes it comes with palpitations and it radiates into my shoulders and upper back and comes in waves. The feeling itself is scary but not painful, although makes me a bit woozy/lightheaded. Sometimes it coincides with a tingling sensation in my legs. I also have sore tender spots which go around my chest wall/back and feel like a muscular issue and wonder if this is connected.

The bit I don’t understand is the seemingly random occurrence of it. I can go a couple of weeks with nothing and then out of nowhere, I get this feeling which will linger for a couple of days. Sometimes it’s so strong that I feel like I need to lie down. The first time it happened, I went to A&E where a chest X-ray, bloods and ECG were all fine, as was a 24hr holter monitor. It’s been going on now for almost a year but progressively more frequent. My GP doesn’t think its anxiety, but its now something that plays on my mind and I’m always worried that it’ll happen when I’m out in public, or fear that its some kind of chronic illness.

Can anyone relate? And if so, any tips on managing this?",1677683747.0

2rd week on Zoloft, first week I was mainly tired slightly anxiety boost, I started upping to 25 mg instead of 13.5 mg now and this insane lack of motivation or thought to do things, like I can maybe think about how I have to do school for my grade but it really doesn’t matter to me atleast I guess because I personally know that I might complete 1/10 things in the day and I’m “ok” with it enough to stay on the meds to see if it will change. What im wondering is even going to school, on one side im getting increased anxiety and can’t do anything but put the fault on Zoloft, so Zoloft is the “problem” should or is it reasonable not to go to school when I literally just can’t do anything. I very much WANT to do my school it’s not an avoidance of going it’s I just can’t do anything so what’s the point going? I just sit and be on my phone. I want to see some of my teachers to but when im doing nothing else in school because I just can’t man is the demotivating and then having the teachers talk to me like I’m just choosing not to do it I hate it.

533,Help with sleep,3,11ev2wg,Anxietyhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/11ev2wg/help_with_sleep/,2,"I posted this as a reply to a post in the Zoloft sub, but wanted a wider reach with some different experiences. 

Here we go.

It goes without saying to follow a doctor's instructions and I'm not a doctor, so my experience can only speak to my unique circumstance.

I took 25 mg for six weeks and felt some relief, but was still expediting a bit of an anxiety edge. I went to my doctor and he increased me to 50 mg, saying that usually the normal starting dose for Zoloft but because I've had so many SSRIs and SNRIs in the past, he wanted to start me slowly.

I've now been on 50 MG for about 6 weeks and I feel the difference. It's helped me level out and take most of the edge off.

Interestingly, the last week has been stressful (been on a new job for six weeks and planning for a conference in Toronto and some lobbying in Ottawa) and I'm starting to feel jittery and on edge. I've been a little crankier and anxious, tense, and feeling like I can't sit still.

I don't know if these are situational episodes or if perhaps I need to up my dose again, but I'm going to wait a bit. I've also noticed my heart palpitations have increased this week, so I think it's all actress related.

Incidentally, if anyone has tips on how to manage during a stressful time, I'd appreciate it (not thing to hijack, just feeling that I've written this out and hope folks won't mind). Meditation, ASMR, and distraction with music aren't helping (I also have tinnitus in my right ear from multiple tubes in my ears due to a cleft lip and palate and rocking out WAY too hard when I was a musician in my 20s). Sleep has always been tough but I'm restless this week.

Any tips appreciated. I'll try anything once, as long as it's safe.",1677647707.0
534,I'm told it's this...,3,11etngi,Anxietyhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/11etngi/im_told_its_this/,1,"Sorry if this ends up being a novel. Back in mid December my wife was going to have surgery. I woke up the morning of and noticed that one side of my face wasn't in sync with the other. Didn't think much of it cause I was sleeping on that side. A few hours later, I started Googling, which was probably a mistake. On the way to the surgery, I freaked out and my heart was racing. After a few minutes my heart rate went down. The next day, I went to the ER. Had a CT scan, EKG, and blood work. All were fine. Doc says it's Bell's Palsy but very benign. You wouldn't notice unless I pointed it out. Ok, no big deal. I was even making jokes about it. 

The next week, I'm watching No Way Home with the kids and my HR jumps to 161 BPM. I tell my wife and we make another trip to the ER. Chest x-ray, good work and EKG. All fine. Now I'm told it's a panic attack. 

This has never happened to me. In March I'll be 40. I'm still averaging a 10 minute mile. Sometimes 9 and a half on a good day. No issues when I'm lifting. And not a lot of stress, that I'm conscious about. 

That ER doc referred me to a cardiologist. So I go, and the cardio doc sets up a heart monitor to wear for a week and says to ""let it rip"" in the gym. In the meantime, she also prescribes Metoprolol 25mg. Huge mistake. I took that for about 2 weeks and thought I was gonna die. Told my primary care and Cardiologist. They told me to stop taking it and I did. Cardiologist gets results from the monitor back. No palpitations or other issues. But over the last few weeks since the second ER visit and follow up with Cardio, I've developed intermittent tingling in my hands face and the in my head. The Bell's palsy is still there but hasn't gotten worse. I make another appointment with PC. They say it's anxiety...

My Mom (she has a Master's in Psychology), tells me to look up the definition of a hypochondriac (don't need to, im aware of the term), and that I should talk to someone. After some back and forth with my wife and others , I give therapy a shot. Still having the tingling, my heart races from time to time and then go back to normal. I also notice my vision gets a little blurry some muscle tightness and chest soreness. My therapist believes I do have stress but doesn't think that it's enough to cause all of these symptoms. But from everything I've read (therefore I'm an expert, sarcasm), it all points to anxiety. I'm also trying to get an MRI done, where I live, getting in to neurologist will take an Act of Congress. 

Could this really be this simple. Is it just something new that's happening that I need to get used to? If you've made it this far and have some good insight, I appreciate it.!",1677643339.0

It was all fine until about the second day after eating something my stomach cramped I felt the period cramps in my stomach. It felt like I was constipated and needed to fart. I could not fart and nothing came out. That continued into the next day and only a few pebbles and one pebble log of poop came out. It got better next day a little after taking miralax (however the miralax did nothing) no pain. So now it’s been about 4 days since taking the miralax and nothing. No stomach pain nor have I had a bowel movement. It’s nearing the end of my period and now my left ovary is acting up again. Here’s the thing I went to go try and poop.

***Valium without dependence? Individual GABAA receptor subtype contribution toward benzodiazepine addiction, tolerance, and therapeutic effects***

>In the light of current evidence, α1 dormant, α2, α3, and α5 subtype partial agonists not only possess low abuse potential but are also low or devoid of tolerance building. There is evidence that α1 containing GABAA receptors directly contributes to the downstream effects of tolerance because α1 (H101R) mice have been shown to maintain expressions in neuroplasticity-coding transcripts after diazepam administration.120 This perfectly agrees with data from animal studies regarding the lack of tolerance in α1 subtype inactive compounds such as TPA023B and imidazenil.121–126 Future drug discovery involving tranquilizers should look for partial agonists of α2 , α3 , and α5 containing GABAA receptors; Valium without its side effects is potentially achievable.

**Imidazenil**[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazenil#cite_note-1) is an experimental [anxiolytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiolytic) drug which is derived from the [benzodiazepine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) family, and is most closely related to other imidazobenzodiazepines such as [midazolam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midazolam), [flumazenil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flumazenil), and [bretazenil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretazenil).

Imidazenil is a highly potent [benzodiazepine receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine_receptor) [partial agonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_agonist)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazenil#cite_note-2) with an unusual profile of effects, producing some of the effects associated with normal benzodiazepines such as [anticonvulsant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant) and [anxiolytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiolytic) effects, yet without any notable [sedative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedative) or [amnestic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnestic)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazenil#cite_note-3) effects. In fact, Imidazenil blocks the sedative effects of [diazepam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazepam), yet without lowering the convulsion threshold,[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazenil#cite_note-4) and so potentially could be a more flexible antidote than the antagonist [flumazenil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flumazenil) which is commonly used to treat [benzodiazepine overdose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine_overdose) at present.

Imidazenil has not yet been developed commercially for use in humans, however it has been suggested as a safe and effective treatment for [anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety),[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazenil#cite_note-5) a potent yet non-sedating anticonvulsant which might be particularly useful in the treatment of poisoning with organophosphate [nerve agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_agent),[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazenil#cite_note-6)[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazenil#cite_note-7) and as a novel treatment for [schizophrenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia).[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazenil#cite_note-8)

546,Understanding Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,2,11eib4e,Anxietyhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/11eib4e/understanding_obsessive_compulsive_disorder/,0,"OCD is an anxiety disorder and considered to be a neurotic condition but is was less considered disabling than a psychotic illness 

  
Other anxiety disorders include phobias, panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. They all share anxiety as a fundamental function and there is an overlap of symptoms among them.   
OCD has to do with obsessive and compulsive thoughts which are persistent. The sufferer tries to get rid of them in a daily battle with this disorder. 

  
Obsessions are psychological while Compulsions are motor actions. However this is not always the case. You can have mental psychological compulsions. A feature of compulsions that need to be worried here is that an obsession is actively brought by the patient: he is not happy about doing it, but it is essentially his voluntary action, performed because of his compulsive desire, and not an automated behavior. It is different from tics and muscle spams that are typically found in some people which are basically uncontrolled motor responses. 

  
What we mean by compulsion here is different from the everyday language of using that word. Compulsions are acts which are the result of a desire that the person normally tries to resist, and which are carried out unwillingly. They are viewed as basically illogical or ridiculous, and give no satisfaction or fulfillment. Forms of conduct like compulsive betting, compulsive lying, and compulsive eating do not show these features although they’re issues in their own right, they aren’t part of obsessive-compulsive disorder.   
At times, the term ‘compulsive’ is used for behavior like recurrent nail-biting, thumb sucking, and hair pulling. Those are routines, and the persons generally participates in them, at least part of the time, without being aware of the,. They lack the characteristic features of the compulsion in obsessive-compulsive disorder. True compulsions are carried out to achieve some aim; conduct like nail-biting, hair pulling, and so on is not. Nor do they provoke a feeling of resistance. Those types of behavior are best viewed as habits rather than true compulsions, as their resemblance to the latter is superficial.",1677614526.0

The pain started as a little pain through my shoulder blade, after moving a vehicle. I realized when I got Stoney or anxious it would hurt more prompting me to go to Urgent care. At first the Urgent care doctor said everything was good and she gave me a diagnosis of Costochondritis due to respiratory infection, She said my lungs sounded fine and everything was good, but that we could do an ECG to rule out anything. Once we did the ECG she said due to me coming in with pain in my chest area the ECG was abnormal. Keep in mind I mentioned I was having a hard time breathing, and pain the was radiating from shoulder blade to jaw, to neck, to hand. She said she was 100% positive that I wasn't having a heart attack but to protect her license she needed to give me the option of going to the ER. I was okay with the diagnosis having heard she was 100% that I wasn't having a heart attack. My brain wasn't though.
The next night I had a Massive Panic attack, my whole body shook, My legs felt weak, and I was scared. I never really had health anxiety before but I was now fearing dying in my sleep. Over the next 11 days I'd only sleep for 2 hours, and wake up at 3:45 every other night in constant panic. It was odd 1 day I was good the next, 2 days in pain, 1 Day hardly any anxiety, the next 3 days I was convincing myself i was dying. I had gotten really weak at one point, and the inability to breathe got worse. I went back to urgent care and was diagnosed again with Costochondritis and Told my left side was very tensed and that my anxiety wasn't helping. I did another ECG and this time it was normal, my BP normal like always. I was okay, until I wasn't again. After realizing the veins in my left arm began to pop out I decided to bite the bullet and just go to the ER. I had 0 hope after urgent care. The ER doctor asked what was wrong i explained everything. Respiratory infection after COVID. Pain that radiated. Tingling and numbness on the left part of my face. Pain near left temple. Shortness of breath. Pain on mostly left half that radiates to my left hand, and now all over. He told me that there is NOTHING that causes pain from there to there and whatever he pressed on my body and said he's 100% sure it's fibromyalgia. He said that it's fibromyalgia brought on by anxiety Did another ECG and he said my heart was healthy, healthier than his even. I accepted the diagnosis did research and was like hmmm it makes more sense than Costochondritis but certain things didn't. Fibromyalgia has pain throughout the body constantly, I have it mostly on the left half. I took my findings to a NP and she said she agreed it's probably anxiety, She referred me to a Psychiatrist, told me the reason for being unable to breathe is probably due to allergies (i have really bad allergies), and that the reason for the pain is probably fibromyalgia brought on by anxiety. I went to a psychiatrist he said he is positive it's Costochondritis, Bipolar depression, Severe Anxiety, and Hypochondriasis (he said it means My brain over feels what's going on. It's happening but just not as exaggerated). At this point I convinced myself I was having Heart failure, Blood clots, stroke, pulmonary embolism, diabetes, and asthma. All because no one could tell me what was wrong. I began feeling weak due to not eating enough because I was constantly in anxiety. I felt crazy because everytime I met a doctor they asked if I had anxiety and just said well Costochondritis. Even tho the only symptoms i have that coincide w/ Costochondritis is Radiating pain on one half, and tenderness when you press my second rib. I went back to the ER after feeling super weak, and my arm veins began popping through and hurting. This time they saw the state I was in and did US on my veins in the left arm. Labs to rule out diabetes. ECG and X-rays of my chest. Everything came back good. And I again was told It could be Fibromyalgia, and the reason for my veins protruding is anxiety. I told my NP the findings she agrees that the anxiety is probably causing the protruding. It's now been a month of being in constant pain, probably over a month of being in anxiety/panic, and a month of being frustrated. My arm still hurts, pain still radiates. They told me Tylenol, and my Medications for the mental things, and exercise. i did notice if I can't focus on the anxiety or pain for a brief second I don't have too much pain. I'm just exhausted and depressed over all this. I keep praying (I'm not even religious) That it'll all just go away but...sometimes I feel it's getting worse and I don't know what to do. I'm defeated. Hopeless. And anxiously in pain.",1677575205.0

So the other day, my parents were fighting (common sight at my house). They fight like, shouting at each other abusing etc. And my mom dragged me in between. She came to me and said. 

- she called my anxiety issues a cry for sympathy
- she said that she does care whether I live or die

(P.s. not the first time she said all of this)

Today, i thought lets chuck it, let me start a convo with mom, I tried and in that conversation I tried telling her that the two lines she said to me really did hurt a lot. Her reply was:

- first she got super pissed
- then she said I am dying every single day because of you, you can’t see that
- I left so much for you including my job and if I ask you today to leave something for me, I know you wouldn’t. 
- She said I don’t care and i don’t give a fuck do whatever you want to do
- i didn’t say anything wrong

Basically she was talking like a narcissist who instead of accepting the mistake, trying to make it look like she is the victim. 

It pinched me so hard that my own mother does not care. I was crying so badly at that time and she wasn’t even bothered or concerned.

Okay so I am a 29 almost 30 year old woman who has never been SA. I was however severally physically, emotionally, and mentally abused as a child, but until recently I have never had any issue what-so-ever with intimacy. It has only started happening in recent years. It has gotten so bad that I cannot even watch ""romance scenes"" or even KISSING in films!!! Not without my entire body screaming at me. It's almost like I start to panic. I get really scared and nervous, my body tenses, I get super hot, my eyes water, my breathing becomes labored and I get the internal screaming meme if you will. What's worse is that it's not just films, although films are much much worse. I used to be a big hugger and now I can barely stand letting someone touch me, period. This came literally out of no where. I never had any issues with this stuff then one day all of a sudden I can't stand people touching me and I can't even watch a freaking kiss on the big screen. Honestly just talking about this is making my head hurt, and my shoulders and neck super tense. I don't know what to do and I can't even tell you where this problem arose from.

It never affected me before, however in the past couple years I’ve begun struggling with night time guilt.

Every night when I lay in bed I spend 1-2+ hours with this disgusting guilty feeling in my stomach. I spend that time going over my entire day over and over trying to find things I’ve done wrong that could be causing this feeling. It then spirals into realizing ‘oh no I messed that up/I upset that person’ which then spirals me even further. 

I’m not sure how to handle this anymore as it’s starting to affect my sleep and I’ve become more and more anxious about the things I do or say. I’m on antidepressants already and I’m currently not in the financial case to ‘waste money on therapy’ as I’ve been told. My doctor unfortunately relies on pills but none of them seem to work for more than a couple days.

I’m hoping for advice or recommendations on things I could do to help? Ways to calm this feeling or rid myself of this feeling that not even sleeping pills can numb.

I cant even get up to get a glass of water because I’d have to pass the common area and my coworkers would see me and also Id have to interact. I hesitate going to the bathroom because I’d have to pass there again and my coworkers would see me and know Im going to the bathroom.

Is it being perceived that scares me?

Im ok at conversation with my close friends but I absolutely lock up with new people. I actually cant even breathe. My body and voice start shaking whenever Im in a meeting with more than 1 person. I literally suffocate. There is a constant heavy feeling in my chest, as if I’m always scared. 

Even eating in front of everyone is scary. They all tell me not to starve myself and I actually bring a lunchbox everyday but I’ve never eaten at the office.

But if anyone wants to read this I want to say the thought that very, very gently came into my head when I was on the edge, with one foot off of it already, 99% ready to undergo *another* 24 hour meltdown of: crying, not being productive at my job, not eating, not bathing, not doing anything I love or that could ease my mind for even an hour. I had already done it all that day, and I was ready to do it again…

But this very very firm yet gentle thought came into my head and asked me a question: “how can you ever expect yourself to be kind to others, if you don’t even give that to yourself?”

It changed me. The logic fit so soundly into my head I knew my anxiety and/or low self-esteem would never block off self kindness in the same way ever again. Like “I am *stuck* with me. I can’t divorce me, breakup with me, fire me, etc I can’t do it. So I *have* to be nice to myself. And being nice to myself will then allow me to be that much nicer to others — to those who deserve it of course.”

Of course, lots of other stuff came on top of this as I held it in my mind and began to change my behavior, but it all came from this foundation. And it’s rock solid (to me) for the reason I gave. I hope it helps. I’ve been dealing with self-hatred for a long long time and this honestly gave me an exit route I’d never knew existed.",1677522318.0

So little backstory I have somewhat been able to so far live a perfect health related life. I have never had any major illness neither has anyone in my family. Outside of my mother having asthma nothing major. Same goes for my wife’s family. Well in October of 2022 my mother in law suffered a seizure. It was the first time I had ever had to call 911 and I guess go into panic mode. She was fine and went to hospital got a bunch of test and she had continued living her life as normal ever since. For me it was a very scary moment seeing my wife’s reaction and everyone in the room panic. The following week I came down with the flu. I have been steady in my weight for about 8 years the flu caused me to loose 8 pounds in a matter of days. I immediately got scared and thought this was not normal. The week after I developed a stomach infection that caused my stomach to gurgle and I had watery stool  for about two weeks. Went to the doctor and they told me everything was alright just take these ills and go on with your day. Everything was ok I thought but the day I got home from doctor I was scrolling through Tik tok and someone posted a video to advocate for colon cancer. She explained what you will see when your get your first symptoms and of course they include the some flu symptoms upset stomach, water stool, indigestion so I started to freak out. These fears went away after about a week or so but I moved on. Later on New Year’s Eve I noticed my thumb twitching I kinda got scared so looked it up here on Reddit and read a comment saying how a pulsating thumb is the first sign of Parkinson’s or ALS again this freaked me out. I asked my sister and she said to drink two gatorades and I’ll be fine. Next day everything was back to normal. So everything has been good for the most part but just this past Friday night I was driving home when a random pressure came to my chest it felt like the pressure froze me in a way. This last about a good 30-45 seconds then went away however as soon as I got home it was all I could think about. I went to bed and I had like racing thoughts and my heart was beating fast. This lasted about an hour and I ended up falling asleep and woke up in the morning. Since Saturday I have felt this wierd slight pressure in the head and my head in a way feels “heavy”. I don’t have a headache or anything I feel completely normal just my head feels odd. The weirdest thing is I only feel this when I am alone. When I talk to my wife or friends everything is normal.

I have been anxious since I can remember. My anxiety comes and goes in waves, but when it comes, it usually lasts months before it sets back. 
I in general don’t avoid triggering situations or things that make me anxious (travel, work, public events, commute etc.). I sometimes know that I will probably have a panic attack, but I still do the thing and overcome it, even though it costs me a lot. The problem is that I don’t feel happy / proud of myself that I did it, I feel exhausted instead. 
This makes me doubt myself and question if is it even worth it to fight so hard. I know I want to lead a normal life like I always have, but I am just exhausted from fighting my everyday anxieties. 
Many people who suffer from panic attacks avoid triggering situations and feel relieved when they don’t have to cope with them. I face them instead, struggle, feel very bad during the panic attack, use methods that help, overcome it at some point, but then feel exhausted. 
I feel this is not fair that my body and mind don’t recover.

I think i've had anxiety ever since I could speak sentences.

Obvious as this post states it was always diminished as being ""shy"". Well it maybe started out as severe shyness but eventually morphed into severe social anxiety and among other things. My dad always pushed me into social situations with other kids.

Funny story actually, there was this girl at this restaurant that was doing homework. My dad decided it would be a great idea to grip me on the shoulders as hard as possible and force me into a conversation with them. I refused to speak because i literally couldn't, my dad had to introduce me because I couldn't  and wouldn't say anything. I literally had to pry his hands off and then i speedwalked to the other end of the restaurant to get away from the situation. I didnt speak to my dad for 3 hours after that. this eventually made a chain reaction of when my dad noticed other kids at parks, restaurants, school etc i would purposely run away and avoid them because i knew my dad would force me to talk with them. 

So i don't know if him pushing me into conversations and then getting annoyed and confused, and sometimes angry made me go deeper into my shell and build walls up. or maybe im being stupid and blaming him.

I suffer from chronic daily headaches/migraines with daily visual disturbances like auras, scolosis, back pain, neck pain, and a fuck load more the whole 9 yards. Life is so damn boring without my green. I own a business and work all the damn time. But I absolutely hate it until I smoke. After I smoke I get ideas I wouldn't have thought of in a million years! When I smoke I'll usually shut the game off or the show whatever I'm doing and get straight to work. I just love to get stuff done and smile about life when I'm high. 

One big problem. I've been smoking almost everyday for about 4 years now and in the past year or 2 it's been guaranteed to give me a headache / migraine. Like no matter what.

It tightens up my suboccipital in the back neck and makes all my other knots so fucking tight. It hurts like hell. I couldn't write on pen and paper on bad the pain is. I always get a pounding migraine. But on the other hand I'm less suicidal. Idk what to do. Every suicide attempt I've had in the past 5 years, I smoked a little weed and chilled the absolute fuck out. Tears stopped, cutting stopped, hung up the phone with Suicide Hotline. Everything. Within the blink of an eye I was looking for food in the kitchen and throwing on a movie (sober I absolutely cannot watch movies or TV in general. I work for myself and it's stressful with chronic ass pain. [This is what I'm dealing with](https://imgur.com/a/9VsONgK) I really really miss the days where I smoked and my headache vanished. Fuck it's so depressing. None of my anxiety meds work, none of my depression meds work. Like weed is the only thing that has worked so far, and got me off a 6 month Xanax addiction. It's depressing when the only thing that works make not one but all your physical pain symptoms worse.

I don't sleep without weed. My anxiety is always at an all time high! Like biting through my shirts heart racing after counting the hours I'm left with to sleep. Daily. Every single night.

What should I do? Why does weed make my muscles hurt so bad? Could it be forcing them to relax? That's what it seems like. I hope I don't have to quit my weed. I have a medical card and it took forever to get that shit.

TLDR: I get chronic daily headaches, and there's almost no way to avoid one. But weed escalates them to migraines. And every suicide attempt I've ever had recently in the past 5 years was saved by weed.",1677425426.0

My gf has anxiety around death, specifically about people she loves dying and the mental state this may/will put her in. 
Her best friend died of cancer five years ago and she was an integral part supporting her in her last year or so. At the same time as her death, her then gf split up and she went into a really deep dark hole that took years of therapy to come out of. She logically know that death is very much part of life and often not much that can be done (apart from being healthy, looking after yourself etc).
We have spoken openly about her anxiety and I know from her that her parents put me dying is something she thinks and worries about every day. Mostly she accepts that these are her thoughts and has learnt not to get affected but sometimes it gets her, esp. when Someone she knows or has read about has died or is very unwell. I love her dearly and try support her wherever I can but we both know that there are things she will have to overcome herself and ask I can do is be there for her. But I am wondering if there are other things I can do, say or read up about that can help her overcome the mindset that any of us can drop dead any second? She has spoken with her therapist about it and they’ve given her a few things she can do to try and get out of her cycle of catastrophising but she still suffers greatly at times?

The past 3 years have been very hard for me. My dad died and many issues surfaced. I had to take care of a lot of family stuff, money issues and try to make balance again. My copping mechanism became food and spending, which resulted in me gaining 30 pounds, sleeping issues and overspending.

I hit rock bottom this month when I could finally get out of a debt but I then, spiraled in a crazy weekend of over eating and overspending. It was so stupid!

My boyfriend says I like trouble but I swear I don’t :( it’s definitely a hard situation, because is the first time in my life I had to admit I’m having real problems and need help.

So basically, I gave my credit cards to my family members, deleted all food deliver apps and Uber and enrolled in a gym.

Now I cant sleep thinking about this new life I want to built and I’m so fucking scared right now.

So I asked Chatgpt where could I find support groups and he said Reddit, so here I am!

It was horrible and they were eventually moved because of their behavior. But that’s when they started stalking and threatening us. More specifically me. My partner has been able to let this issue go easily, I just can’t it seems. 

The neighbors behavior was so bad and threatening I was granted a order of protection against them. We then also moved several hours away. The anxiety attacks slowly started happening less often and I can again hear impact noises without instant going into an attack and dry heaving (used to happen several times daily). 

I recently found out (small town) the neighbor has a long history of this and worse. I think finding that out really upset me. Especially because some of the people who lied for her, seemingly did it just because they didn’t want her living with them so made us deal with her horrible behavior instead. I did really love that home and was so sad to have to move, let alone be forced out or risk my life just to stay. 

Recently (and I honestly kinda blacked most of it out so I don’t remember the exact situation) was talking with someone and it was something about why/how we moved when we did. I said something about how I liked my old house but we couldn’t live there anymore for safety. It quickly turned into them insinuating it was “my fault”. I did try to briefly explain I was granted an order and an ex parte one at that so it clearly wasn’t me making things up or even exaggerating them but they kept going. 

I just shut down. Walked away and fought off the anxiety attack I could feel coming.  I eventually had to go back inside so I was able to leave, which I was able to do without crying. But as soon I was outside it was like my anxiety sucker punched me and I just started sobbing. 

I NEVER had attacks like this before the issues with our neighbor. Now I have break-down level ones every couple months. Only made worse since most ppl don’t even know what’s happening and so keep demanding I tell them what’s wrong/why I’m crying/dry heaving, making it worse. If I’m by myself I can talk myself down but even when I tried to explain (while not having an attack) they just don’t get it. 

How do I get this to stop? It makes me feel completely unhinged and not myself for days after and every time I end up feeling the whole situation is really *is* my fault. It’s not, but I would do anything just to go back and never meet them. I also don’t have any anxiety about them finding my new home or anything like that. It should be over, we moved hundreds of miles away. It is getting better with time but am I going to have to live with this forever now?

I was very trusting of her and didn’t suspect anything when hanging out with the guy so I was 100% blindsided when she broke up with me seemingly out of the blue and immediately started dating the other dude. I am now in another relationship, but because  I’ve developed some serious trust issues from my last one and I don’t really know how to handle it. My ex would often check my phone because she was so worried of me cheating on her and would chastise me for hanging out with other girls platonically to the point where I had to hide when I was grabbing a meal with a friend because of how paranoid she was about it, but now I’m afraid I’m starting down a similar path. Last night I compulsively checked my girlfriends phone and saw some saved snap chats  between her and a friend of hers that I know she’d hung out with when she was back home over the winter. I saw one saved message of her saying “I love you” and another of him calling her hot, both from well over a year before we started dating. I mentioned it to her when I saw it, and she reassured me that it was just a friendly I love you message and that it was all just in jest from being friends. She also told me that they kissed once like 4 years ago, but both of them decided that it wasn’t right and didn’t do it again, as there were no feelings behind it. I believe her, or maybe I just want to believe her, especially since I’ve done similar things with my other platonic girl friends when I wasn’t in relationships, and I don’t doubt that when they hung out over winter that it was all platonic, but my paranoia is setting in and I’m worried as all hell. My ex also chastised me for going to parties and stuff without her because she was worried about me cheating on her, which in retrospect  I now recognize is very toxic behavior, but now I can’t help but be worried about the same thing with my current girlfriend because all the what-ifs of if she’ll also cheat are buried so deep into my head because of the mistrust that I am forced with because of my ex. I want to be the best boyfriend I can for my girlfriend, and I really do care about her and we both said we really want to stay together more long term, but I just want to be the best I can for her and leave my trust issues in the past.

I (21M) have been at a loss for weeks now. It seems like it’s thing after thing that is bothering me, and I’m going crazy. Long story short, I had COVID a couple weeks ago, then developed acute gastritis (seen by an upper endoscopy, non-H. Pylori). I was taking 15mg lansoprazole for it for some time, then transitioned to an H2 blocker. My symptoms have dissipated, which is good,  but my eyes and head have felt “off” the last week or so. This was prior to the change in medication, in fact the change was due to the head symptoms. Although I can only describe it as dizziness, it’s not. It doesn’t feel like the room is spinning, I know what that feels like. My face has been tingling as well. I went to the doctor this past week and got a neurological evaluation, blood work, and an eye test. All came back completely normal. They tested my blood for issues with: my thyroid, kidney, liver, as well as anemia and vitamin deficiencies. 

Now, here’s the one thing I haven’t mentioned yet. I have really bad anxiety. Like, sometimes debilitating. I have had it really bad over the past couple of weeks and I’ve had several panic attacks since the beginning of the month due to the symptoms I’ve been having. I’ve been told by those close to me that these neurological feelings are caused by anxiety and will go away, but with my anxiety I need reassurance a lot. I’ve also strongly considered SSRI medication, and will be seeing a psychiatrist for an evaluation soon, as well as talk therapy.

I know no one knows exactly how I’m feeling but if you’ve ever felt similar or if you have heard of this before, please tell me what you think or how/if these symptoms went away. Or, if you know about people who have had anti-anxiety medicine that have calmed physical symptoms of anxiety. I feel like my vision will never be back to normal and it’s genuinely freaking me out.

I also just had to move after 15 years in my home. Because of the move I had to change doctors. My new doctor would not refill my prescribed xanax that I have been on for years (which I understand as I am aware of how problematic it can be in the long term.)  I am currently taking .5mg a day split in two doses. Before my Mom died I was taking it much less, only when I had a panic attack or a really hard time falling asleep. My new doctor referred me to a psychiatric nurse to manage the xanax. The nurse also agreed that I must come off of the xanax. She is also saying I may need to stop my low dose extended release ritalin which helps me at my technical job and has been helping with my depression. She said she will consider continuing my ritalin but I need to have an EKG to prove my heart is healthy as her insurance will not cover her treating me with a stimulant until that is done and I can't fault her for that. My blood pressure readings have been high in my PCP office because of anxiety but I have purchased an at home monitor and have been able to see and prove that normally my readings are within a normal range. Right now my PCP is managing this ADHD drug that I have been on for years.  


These changes are giving me a lot of anxiety on top of the anxiety I already chronically suffer from. My problem is that she is the only psychiatrist that is covered under my insurance that I can see within the next 6 months. And I feel like she is not giving me any tools to deal with my problems. I feel abandoned. She told me to download an app and I did but it did not help me unfortunately . I have been watching countless YouTube videos on meditation and managing anxiety and how to sleep and to no avail. I suggested to her some alternatives that are not controlled substances such as clonidine and she didn't seem to want to pursue managing any medication for me. She just told me that it should be no problem coming off this low of a dose of xanax and that the worst part would be finding a way to fall asleep. It is true that at night all I can think is my Mom and death.   


I am thinking to talk to my PCP and was wondering if there was any advice of safer medications that can help me with my anxiety. I have tried SSRIs like Paxil and have been on Lamictal and Wellbutrin with no success.  I need the most help with panic attacks and falling asleep and not something that will make me tired and a zombie as I subcontract for Google and I need a lot of focus. I have looked into over the counter supplements like Calm and  L-arginine but I am afraid to take them. I have heard recommendations for Gabapentin but am afraid of the side effects I am hearing...my anxiety really takes me over. I was afraid to even take the xanax when I was first prescribed it. I am weening off of it but know I will need something to replace it and don't want to turn to alcohol because I know how bad that is for me and ow it makes my anxiety worse. Any advice would be so appreciated.",1677352987.0

Today mom was taunting me in the evening that you go out every weekend with friends. I said i work the entire week and then go out once on weekends. She said i just said it randomly. 

My parents fight a lot and she kept on blabbering after that idk why and included dad as well in the conversation. Dad heard her and came. And they started fighting again and within minutes they started abusing each other, shouting at the top of their voice. I came to my room like i always do when they fight (which is atleast once every week). 

In between their fight out of nowhere mom came to my room and said no night stays for you now and if you have to go out on weekends ask for my permission. I said thats not how it works. She went to dad and said the way you speak to me the same way your daughter is speaking to me. 

I am bloody 25..working and independent..no one can dictate my life or impose restrictions. Afterwards, around half an hour later mom came to my room and said you do whatever you want to, go wherever you want to, i don’t care whether you live or die. (Not the first time she used this line but its hurts like crazy every single time). 

Also, i have anxiety. When mom came into my room, before that only my anxiety had started and i was deep breathing to calm myself. She said and i am not going to give you sympathy for this. I said you dont even know what my mental health is at the moment. She said i dont care. I said that why i heal myself..on my own..everytime.

I suffered a panic attack so badly recently I went to A&E thinking I was having a heart attack but 3 different examinations an ECG and blood tests show that there's nothing wrong with me (Apart from being insane clearly lol)

I have been prescribed lansoprazole and propranolol but unfortunately they both give me negative side effects. I've tried yoga and breathing exercises which help but don't make the feeling in my chest go away completely, so the only effective solution I've found is to either having a hot bath or to drink alcohol which are both clearly impractical to do frequently.

Fast forward  almost a decade later I really want to get into studying, I wanted this for a long time, for a long time I have had these ""nightmares"" where I sit in a classroom of my highschool, there's nothing scary about it but I feel very anxious during this dream.
 I never went to college or university but I want to prepare by studying some math as it seems like the only obstacle for me right now, because I kinda suck at it.. 
But I seem to be extremely anxious about it, like almost getting a panic attack.
 Today I opened the book and was overwhelmed and I mean I merely read the intro.

I feel very shy studying  in the presence of other people especially because I am 30 years old and the level of math I should start with is probably like half 9th grade course.
For all of my social circles I was never more than a grunt and I cannot even focus on that when they are around and feel very ashamed about it especially if they intrude my space, read my notebooks etc.

I did not come merely to vent here, I want to deal with this crippling fear which in my eyes is also a fear of being myself. I never bring it up to anyone in depth.
I never talk about things I want because I dread the reactions.


My plan is just owning up to this, making my intentions public telling people that I want to do this and admitting that I suck at it, though whenever I think about doing it I really panic.

 I don't really think this will help me immediately or that there will not be disturbing reactions...

It is important to me, I think it's not the studying that is the biggest road block for me but being mocked for it...


I know how absurd this post looks, like who fears such stuff...

Tomorrow I  intend to just sit down somewhere everyone could see me and do it anyways even if I suck at it and even if their pressence disturbs me...

Over the past year, I've struggled a lot with anxious thoughts and found myself in deadly thought loops, thinking endlessly without finding actual solutions. I tried mindfulness exercises, but couldn't shut off my thoughts because, in a way, I thought they were trying to help me. I started looking for a different solution and came across CBT. I tried catching my cognitive distortions and reframing my thoughts, but found it hard to make it a habit.

After looking for solutions, I decided to build an app for myself to make the process easier. That's how it works:

1. Create a note whenever you're worrying.
2. Get that note analyzed and your thinking traps pointed out.
3. Get your thoughts challenged based on that note.

I use it regularly and it helps me get my thoughts challenged every time I'm struggling, not just when I go to therapy or make time for it.

The app works on web, iOS and Android and is available for testers. I would love to hear your feedback! If you want access just comment or message me directly. :)

About 1.5 years ago I got kicked in the head at work. During the recovery process the doctor often asked how my head was feeling, if I had headaches, forgetfulness, etc. Through this I became much more aware of my head. I was worried that headaches were aneurysms, that me being forgetful was dementia, and so on and so forth. 

Most recently (kind of) was a fear of ALS. My hand was cramping at work, and I did the exact opposite of what someone with anxiety should do, and I went to the internet. Even though carpal tunnel, arthritis, or even just stress can cause these pains I landed on it being ALS. 

Of course stress and anxiety can cause symptoms to manifest, which makes it worse, and the cycle continues and gets worse. 

It was getting better, but every little time I had a little twitch, or got caught up with walking I got scared again. Even though I know the likelihood of it being ALS, especially at my age, is slim, the thoughts still pop up. Even though I can tell myself I'm okay, my mind still worries I'm not. This causes even further worry. 

Maybe my mind is trying to tell me something. On top of that I was worried about it as a kid when we read about Lou Gerighson. So that freaks me out too as maybe it was some sort of sick foreshadowing. 

However, I hope by writing this, and getting my thoughts out I accomplish two things. One. My thoughts aren't trapped anymore. Maybe that will help me. Two. To show people they aren't alone.",1677293794.0

I want to reassure you that you can overcome what you are going through. 

Over ten years ago, my world was flipped upside down by chronic stress and anxiety. I lost my emotional, mental and physical health within a few months and it continued to snowball for years after. 

For so many years, I felt lost and didn’t know wether I was coming or going. 

I couldn’t sleep, was at the doctors constantly checking on a new symptom I was experiencing. I was even suicidal. 

It was my wandering mind that got me into that mess. For so many years I looked for that magic pill, the result from that one test, but it wasn’t until I went within that I began to see real change.

Mindfulness and meditation allowed me to break the chains of being held hostage by my mind. And working with my breath in challenging times and to down regulate was a game changer.

When I started to chip away at my stress and anxiety I began to see look at my life and correct wrongs and build new habits. 

Now, I have found a purpose to be that someone I needed when I felt like I was in the middle of a lake at night unable to see the shore. I have change my life around and am now helping people love from a calm state and take back control. 

I love myself now. For many years I didn’t. I have purpose now, for many years I didn’t. I’m happy now, for many years I wasn’t! 

Use meditation to break thinking patterns and obverse that voice in your head. 

Use the breath to bend, not break in times of stress!!!

Every week or few weeks I am anxious I might have a specific disease, often cancer but sometimes an aneurysm or MS and whatnot. Google thinks I am fine (for real), my doctor thinks I am fine, although I can't get a blood test due to my severe fear of needles I've had since childhood so I can't even properly confirm that I am, in fact, okay. I started realizing that I just have this horrible fear of losing control, this sense of helplessness against everything, for example when a needle is inside of me and it is either taking blood or injecting a vaccine, I am entirely helpless, I can't move, lest the needle breaks or the procedure is screwed and I have to sit there until somebody else relinquishes back the control over myself. In case they are injecting, then I am at the mercy of whatever it is they put inside me and if I react badly then I am screwed.

motivating myself to do anything besides

I went to college for a year & a half until Covid hit. In 2021, I had gotten a job as an instructional support aid through somebody I knew but ended up leaving after 10 months because it mentally and physically drained me. 

While I was at that job, on my break, I had pondered about my future and I was completely disgusted by the thought of having to work for someone else for 5+ years of your life, having to ask someone for days off, not having flexibility to do things your way—basically just taking a huge chunk of your life away for someone else. That terrified me. I kept asking myself “Why are we born to work as slaves for other people and not having the time to actually enjoy life?” 

Now I’m in a situation where I really do want to get the ball rolling for me and just swallow my pride and put in applications so that I can save up and move out and be independent, However, the thought of having to sacrifice my time and energy for someone else is making it hard for me to continue forward. I feel stuck. 

It’s easier said than done when people tell me to “Just do it.” That advice works for some, but for people like me, it’s super hard to do that. I wish there were buttons in my brain that I could simply push so that I can get my shit together, be resilient and work hard like everyone else does.

My parents still loved me they were helping me at every point and silly me was retaliating every time they tried to help me. I also had a best friend, a friend who I used to hangout with, an academic genius and like minded. I enjoyed time with him but suddenly in 8th grade he started ignoring me saying I'm a distraction and short tempered. It hit me, it hit me hard and there started my downfall. My grades and my health started degrading and i got in with the wrong people. I wasted my 9th and 10th grade partying with the wrong people. I thought I was independent and taking my own decisions but i was digging my own grave.

I somehow passed all my classes and covid hit, which helped me pass my 10th grade. 

I always wanted to go to the US for my uni, but i didn't put in effort. I played video games slept late, but lost a little weight during covid times with the help of my father. I got a shit score on my SAT's and an average gpa which didn't really give me a good college. My parents spent a ton on application fees, counselors etc and being an international student it was expensive. My father didn't stop once from spending and happily gave me the money but instead i failed to get even a decent college. I cried again as i failed to fulfill my dream. Then here in my country my father told me to enroll in a t10 college for my bachelor's and pursue one of the most difficult professional courses known to an Indian. I came to a different city unaware of what is going to happen.

I came here cried missing my family for a month and somehow settled. Then cam exams i cried again and i passed. Now the professional course I'm enrolled in  has exams in June and my bachelor's exams is in apr. I'm not prepared and have severe exam anxiety. I have no friends, no female touch or any social life. I do t study i sit in the room and overthink and cry.

Leaving all this behind, I'm fat, not tall, not academically gifted, not good at anything and I'm just kinda wasting my parents money. I eat like a cow and cry about stuff. My parents try to fix it but they are kinda orthodox. When i asked them that should I go to a therapist, my mother was ok, but my father was like ""you wanna go to a doctor for mad people"". Whenever I talk to my father about a problem he always just gives me one solution "" work harder"". This doesn't really get in for me. My mother helps me out but it does not affect me.

I am a good for nothing son, I'm not good at anything, people don't talk to me, i feel excluded from my generation, i am judged and avoided by people, i have no talents, i have no social life or friends, not fit, not academically gifted or smart, I'm just a fat and short guy who cries cries and cries.

I don't really make a difference and feel like i should stop all this a leave this world behind. What is happening with me",1677256696.0

How have I been with my partner this long? How am I supposed to have kids soon?  And other big questions…etc. Life has changed and it’s really hard to cope with.

663,New stomach issues with old anxiety diagnosis,7,11aiwvs,Anxietyhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/11aiwvs/new_stomach_issues_with_old_anxiety_diagnosis/,0,"I have had anxiety/depression symptoms and been in treatment for them for about 9 years (therapy, medications, etc.). I also ended up with fairly severe emetophobia from bad experiences during a trip overseas. Up until now, my symptoms have been mostly panic attacks (shaking, some chest tightness, breathing too fast), insomnia, and obsessive thoughts. I am triggered by overstimulation and anything related to getting sick. Sometimes it has been miserable, especially during covid, but my anxiety symptoms haven't changed in years.

Last fall, a family member whom I love dearly ended up in the hospital for some serious diagnostics. Then I caught a bad cold that kept me up for three weeks coughing. Shortly afterwards, menstrual cycle-based stomach issues that I've had for years began getting significantly worse and lasting longer (bloating, gas, loose stool). I thought things would even out, but in late January, the family member ended up having a severe and unexpected reaction to treatment and died after two weeks of fighting in the hospital. Throughout those two weeks, my stomach issues got progressively worse, to the point of running to the bathroom every time there was bad news. The issues got better for the viewing/funeral, but immediately started up again the next day. It seems to be worse in the morning/early afternoon, but otherwise there isn't much of a pattern. 

This wouldn't be as much of a problem, but my emetophobia is majorly triggered by stomach problems, and my family member who died originally had a digestive tract disorder, so I'm pretty much freaking out. I am in therapy, I currently take a stimulant for the depression among other things, and have xanax in small doses for uncontrollable anxiety episodes. But I don't want to take xanax all the time if I can avoid it. 

Has anyone ever had new symptoms like this show up years after diagnosis? If so, do you have any recommendations for how to get it under control (other than seeing a gastroenterologist, which I plan to do anyway)? It's really interfering with my ability to heal by visiting friends and family and enjoying activities such as going out to eat. Any help would be appreciated.",1677214498.0

I've been mass applying (as graphic designer) on Indeed and other job sites, a lot also have reached out to me which feels good and flattering but the moment they call me or request for a face-to-face interview, I flake out. The self-sabotage happens and start getting anxious over going out, commuting, looking dumb trying to find the place or just interacting with other people to ask questions.. It feels so overwhelming and I just end up withdrawing my applications. I have answered a few calls but it also results to me just withdrawing, because they mentioned a face-to face interview. 

The thing is, I don't mind if I'll work on site... Just that I could start first working from home and then reporting to office. I just need some time to ease in/familiarize with the onboarding process.  I get really anxious thinking 'what if when I'm already at their office, I just go blank at what to do cause I really might not be good enough to be a designer/ I don't really know anyone there and I don't want to disturb them too much with questions' and shit like that. 

So now I'm wondering if its just better to tell them outright that I have anxiety issues but I'm willing to work onsite if they allow me to work from home first just to get comfortable.

I know when this started. A few days ago I got an idea for a game, did some sketches and basic things and decided that I would actually attempt to make this game, this game would be my first ever one and I'm planning on just jumping in and learning as I go.

But for some reason even thinking of this project causes this chest discomfort and ever since it has been constant and has been going on for about 2-3 (?) days now.

This hasn't happened except for one time (for some reason mortality stuck in my mind) but that only lasted for a day and didn't feel like how I do now. I doubt it's anything to do with my heart as I've had it checked before.

I'm going to try more things to perhaps ease this pain but my main issue is that it gets really worse whenever I think about and try to work on the game, I really want to do this and for some damn reason my anxiety is getting uppity for seemingly no reason about it.

I have many many projects that are in development and none of them have effected me like this, so why is my anxiety having an issue with what should be a basic thing??? I've told literally no one about this project.

At first the anxiety quietened when I reminded myself that I have no time limit at all, no one is waiting for this game, I'm young and have no health issues so I ain't gonna die before it's finished, no one except me even knows this idea exists, I can take as much time as I want and learn along the way as slow as I want.

That really helped at first but now it's not and I don't know why, why is my anxiety being such a Crickity BIH about this?? Seriously I'm curious, any idea why it's freaking out so much? I have no job or responsibilities at the moment so I have 0 stress so it can't be that can it?

I'm more curious than anything but also getting really annoyed and infuriated by this cause I really want to work on my game but this is causing me to be so uncomfortable that I can't and I have tried just not thinking or working on it all day but still no dice.

The truth is I look down upon my sister. Even if she does well in school I don’t view her as the most intelligent individual. She lacks pure human empathy and simply a narcissist.

Even thought what she says now doesn’t affect me, it affected me massively when I was younger. 

My anxiety was created because I didn’t grow up in an environment where that I was never able to gain confidence. I hope things get better once I’m no longer living underneath my parents household.",1677177282.0

1.) Weed. I watched a true crime video and ever since I've had intense paranoia. I've since stopped smoking.

2.) Estrogen. I'm on HRT, MtF, and I take estrogen regularly. When I started having panic attacks, I stopped taking the estrogen. I've recently discovered that estrogen withdrawal can cause anxiety.

3.) Alcohol. I have minor gastritis and I drink a bottle of vodka the day before the panic attacks started. I'm afraid that it could have burned up my insides and caused my whole stomach to be fucked up, causing the pain in my stomach.

I've taken Valium and Clonazepam and they hardly work. The Valium works more, but only for a few hours.

This feels a lot like when I was on withdrawal from Clonazepam, which gave me awful panic attacks as well.

704,Constantly walking on eggshells...,2,119h8cm,Anxietyhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/119h8cm/constantly_walking_on_eggshells/,1,"I have had severe anxiety ever since I could remember. To this day, I carry the burdens of anxiety, depression, & PTSD that came with my life story. 

I still feel like I have to walk on eggshells around everyone because I'm so afraid of getting into confrontation or having somebody judging me and thinking differently of me. So I just keep my opinions to myself and do what everyone asks of me for the most part, without any hesitation. 

It's almost like i feel an ""obligation"" to make sure everyone is content and taken care of and that I am the one who is supposed to be making the sacrifices required of life. I don't usually share these sacrifices with others. The burden always falls on me. I take it quietly because it's easier to just shut up and take it rather than try to express how I feel. 

It makes me physically sick. What's also messed up is the people I have to walk on eggshells around, I pretty much depend on as of right now. I can't just get up and leave my situation. 

The people around me also all suffer from some sort of mental illness themselves. One of the people is severely bipolar and you never know which version of him you're gonna get. You cannot tell this person he is wrong, you cannot tell this person you have something wrong with you because he always has to one up you, and yet still they judge you and hold your mistakes over your head. Dangling them in front of you with threats and judging you while lying to your face saying they're helping you. 

Another person in the equation is also bipolar, but not as bad as the person I mentioned first. I'm A LOT closer to this person. He really does try his best to help me in certain ways. But when it comes to problems like anxiety and depression, I get stonewalled. This is the kind of person you should be able to express these kinds of feelings with and not feel uncomfortable. Yet when I try and tell them I'm not okay, I get chastised. 

The third person is 17 and pretty much sees herself as above me. For context, I'm almost 30. She was told basically my entire life story and also was told about my mistakes. These things were not appropriate for her to be told from a third party, very personal, and expressed in confidentiality. Knowing my mistakes, she, too, took the opportunity to blatantly dangle my mistakes over my head with threats that the first person I mentioned backed up. 

Now, these mistakes weren't something unforgivable or taboo. There are so many people who have made the SAME mistakes I have. Including EVERY SINGLE PERSON I mentioned. Literally, the same stupid mistakes. 

What's absolutely nuts to me is these people have the audacity to judge me and crucify me regarding these mistakes, when I'm the ONLY ONE who is actually NOT making these same stupid choices. I'm the ONLY ONE who stepped up and did what I had to do to make myself right again. I'm still in progress, sure. But at least I'm making steps. No one else has, yet they judge me so harshly. 

While all of this crap is going on, here I am so fragile that I feel like I'm going to shatter if I'm even touched with any sort of contention. The anxiety has built so high in me that I haven't really been eating for the last 3 weeks, stomach in knots constantly, muscles and joints are tight and locked, jaw is clenched so hard it gives me a headache, I can go on. You get the point here, I'm freaking anxious to the point where I feel as if I'm going to blow a gasket. 

I have no clue what to do here. I can't just ""find my voice"" all of the sudden. It's not there right now and even if it was it wouldn't matter because to all but one of these people my opinion doesn't really matter. The only one who thinks my opinion matters, can't even talk to me about feeling anxious or depressed. 

I feel trapped inside of myself, locked up. And when I do have to deal with these people, I'm walking on eggshells. The stress and anxiety that causes me feels like it's killing me, both literally and figuratively. 

Please send any advice or tips for calming the hell down because I don't know how much more of this I can take physically. My body is breaking down from not eating properly for so long.",1677107680.0

I’m a paramedic by trade, and it’s pretty much where all of my self worth comes from. I’m not a well adjusted human being, and I don’t know how to be an adult. I live with my parents, despite having 55k in savings with no debt. I don’t know how to be alone, and I’m struggling to find a future for myself. I’m also on the spectrum, and I have horrible social anxiety. However, I’m a paramedic and people actually respect me for that. Nobody ever truly respected me prior to that, my entire life I’ve been an outcast; but I became someone when I earned that title.

I’ve been having increasing anxiety issues since last fall. The constant sleep deprivation working 48 and 72 hour shifts was really starting to wear on me. I felt sick all of the time, and I was incredibly stressed and irritable. Like verge of mental breakdown, irritable. I always liked being the guy who ran the most calls (and the most fucked up ones) but when people started to take advantage of that I became very jaded towards my entire field of work. I loved being a medic when I was on a supportive crew. I got to handle some incredibly difficult calls with limited equipment and 30-60 minute transport times. It really made me into a bad motherfucker. For someone predisposed to anxiety, I really excelled in a field of pure panic. The death notifications to family members, the blood and guts, people pulling guns on me, the dead children; I took it all like a man.

I worked at a rural ambulance service that was run horribly. We had no base tones, just an open radio channel that was shared with four other ambulances. So when I’m on a 48 or a 72, I would have to listen to the tones (they are incredibly loud) of every call that was going out in the entire county. So even when I wasn’t running calls, I was either not sleeping; or I was being startled awake. This was every. Fucking. Shift.

I finally decided to leave for a low-key job at an ER, and despite my hate for the job at the time; I decided to give three weeks to work through the holidays so the others at my job wouldn’t be stuck working the holidays because of my absence. I told my friend (and supervisor) that I was putting in my notice on Monday, as a courtesy to him. Later that day, I was 36 hours into my 48 hour shift and I was told a transfer was coming in. We were about 12 calls deep, and the other base had run 0 calls in 36 hours. I asked my supervisor to give the transfer to them so I could shower and eat before the next call comes in. A crewmember on the other truck refused to take the transfer for me, despite having not run a single call in almost two days. I was then told that I was going to be mandated for another 24 hours at work. I was completely beside myself, and had a meltdown. I refused the transfer, and told my supervisor that I’m sick of being taken advantage of.

So I go to my Chief to give my notice, and he was told that I was quitting before I could tell him. (Big mistake on my part telling my supervisor.) I told him that I appreciated my nearly two years with them, and that I have not been the best version of myself lately and I needed to make a change. 

He then told me he was suspending me for refusing the mandate and it was possible I would be fired if I didn’t quit immediately. His exact words were “I understand you wanted to take care of mental health, but you can’t not do what you’re told.” He did this because I had vacation days saved up that were going to be paid out before I left. Refusing a mandate is a verbal warning the first time. So I went home, thought about it and worded him a resignation letter stating I would be resigning immediately as a result of a hostile work environment and retaliation for seeking mental healthcare. I ended up getting a fat paycheck for my vacation days after that, but my reputation had been trashed because everyone knew I was suspended. I gave that job the best parts of me, and they spit in my fucking face.

I went through a period of really bad depression and laid in bed for about three weeks. I felt thrown away, and worthless. I started drinking to numb the pain, which ended up helping AND making it worse. Anyway, boo-hoo me. I sucked it up and decided to be a man about it and not have a pussy victim complex; because nobody gives a fuck about your sob story. 

I started this new job and was super surprised about how cushy it was. Nurses and doctors have it really good. Nobody expects you to work sleep deprived, or to stay past your scheduled shift time. It’s amazing. Problem is, my anxiety started recently getting to me again. I am doing the easiest job in the world as an ER paramedic; I start IV’s, and run the waiting room. Yet, I am still feeling crippling anxiety when being put under social pressure. It’s not the good pressure; like having someone throw up blood, turn into a bloody geyser, and die in front of you out of nowhere.. (Actually happened, it was fucking awesome.) It’s the people getting pissed off at you, kind of pressure. This doctor is pissed with you because you didn’t do something the way they wanted it, and the patient is pissed off they are sitting in the waiting room, and one charge nurse is pissed off that you aren’t able to handle the job of three people as one person, and even though you didn’t do anything to deserve the negativity; you get to absorb all of it like a sponge. Last shift I started to feel physical symptoms of panic from deflecting so much of everyone’s frustrations.

You just feel like a failure, and I’m so anxious about going back that it makes me physically ill. I laid on the floor for a couple hours after my last shift and had to drink myself out of the hole I was in. I’ve been told by my coworkers that people overwhelmingly respect me, but despite that I still end up feeling like a punching bag. I know I shouldn’t be such a pussy about it, but I am not good at deflecting negativity. I hate social situations in a positive light, so this is really tough for me. The problem is, I have no where to go but through. Running away isn’t an option for me. I wasn’t always like this, and I want to be the person I used to be. I HATE asking for help, or trying to medicate myself; so this is really hard for me to reach out about. I’ve resented the fact that I take antidepressants for the last decade because it kept me from being eligible to join the military. I don’t want to be weak, but accepting that I’m mentally too broken to handle the job anymore is something I am not willing to do. What can I do?! Should I try therapy, or more Zoloft?",1677053184.0

I understand how overwhelming and scary it can be. But I want to share a story of hope and inspiration with you.

There was a time when I used to be an anxious and fearful kid, just like you might be feeling right now. I remember when I was 14, I went to a supermarket to buy a watch that was sold out. I was too scared to just walk out of the store, so I spent 30 minutes nervously walking around while the security guard watched me. Eventually, I bought a small snack, paid, and wanted to walk out when I got stopped by the security guard. I broke down crying as he searched my stuff and found nothing.

At the time, I was too embarrassed to tell anyone, but now I want to share my story to let you know that you're not alone. It's possible to overcome anxiety and fear, and pursue your dreams and passions.

If you're feeling held back by anxiety and fear, I want you to know that it's okay to feel scared. But don't let those negative feelings stop you from living the life you want. Take small steps towards your goals, be patient with yourself, and remember that progress is progress, no matter how small. Seek support from loved ones or a mental health professional if needed.

Since then I have found ways to overcome my fears and deal with anxiety to the point when I am solo travelling the world!!

Remember, you have the power to overcome your fears and anxiety, just like many others have. It's not easy, but it's worth it. You deserve to live a fulfilling life free from the constraints of fear and anxiety. Believe in yourself and take that first step today. 💪🏼",1677092925.0

And I was thinking about my mom and how hard it’s going to be on her, and how she still hasn’t processed her grief for her parents, but how every time she sees a rainbow she says it’s her mom. 
Anyways then my intrusive thoughts started, I thought “if I die, I’ll send her so many rainbows.” And then I was like wait where did that come from, then started to feel emotional, like fighting back tears in public. And then I was reminded about a terrible thought I had when leaving my car at my parents’ house before I set off on this trip. I thought about how sad they’d be if I died during this trip and didn’t come home. And then I was really worried that that was my intuition talking, that I in fact wouldn’t. 

So now I’m anxious. I have like 6 weeks left on this trip and I don’t want to die on it

Especially because I’m not sure if I’m currently doing the right thing. I’m off traveling the world and have been for 3 months. And I don’t really feel like myself anymore. I don’t want something to happen on this trip to me and then that’s how I went out, instead of pushing myself forward and being with my friends and family and actively chasing my dreams, even though yes, it is a life dream to see every country in the world. So I’m just super anxious now and I want to cry.

Long trips are the culprit (I think), but only ones where I do all the driving. 
First there was the 8 hr trip, where, 7 hrs in, I started repeatedly biting my lips together from the inside. I inadvertently started rolling my lips between my teeth, over and over. My incessant biting didn’t stop until the inside of my lips were swollen and mangled with scar tissue and the pain had gotten more intense than the urge to bite, which wasn’t until a couple days after the car trip had ended.
I drove a 10 hr trip yesterday and the biting automatically started up again about 7 hrs into the drive. Now it's a pattern. 
From my understanding of the little research I did, the biting could be what’s called a motor tic which is usually triggered by anxiety. But I’ve never struggled with anxiety before and I didn’t feel anxious during the trip. Plus, as I’m writing this, it has been 12 hours since I've been in my car and I still haven't stopped biting my lips. 
I mean I've tried!
If I try to focus on not biting my lips, I can get myself to stop for as long as 2 whole seconds (that's the adhd). If I clench my jaw, I can suppress the tic for a few more seconds.. which also wears away at my teeth and makes my mouth ache. Chewing gum works best but only if I chew aggressively enough to satiate my vicious teeth. 
I'm also now afflicted with a few canker sores: first one in my cheek, then one on my tonsil, and now one on my tongue. They're probably from the stress of driving and/or accidentally and aggressively chewing my mouth instead of my gum. Maybe I'm becoming a cannibal. 
My entire mouth is hurting and I'm frustrated and confused. 
Why would my body hurt itself without my permission?? To sooth my anxiety? I'm not feeling very soothed! Is this even a symptom of anxiety or is it something else? Has anyone else experienced something similar? How do I make it stop without having wait it out??!",1677062031.0

I like his fiance, she's a good girl, they seem good together and she and I get along. After the proposal obviously came time to start planning the wedding. I was curious if they would ask me to be part of the bridal party but I was lowkey hoping they weren't going to. I also hoped my brother remembered how much I didn't enjoy being part of it at my cousin's wedding.

For fathers day we all gathered at their apartment. Her side and his/my side. At the event, she gave her 2 sisters bridesmaid proposals. I did not get one, so I thought, okay, I'm not part of it. A couple of weeks later she posted a picture with all of her friends on social media basically saying she asked all of them too. That really solidified it in my mind that I'm not part of it. Then....a random day 2 months later I went to drop something off at their place and I walk in and see a bridesmaid proposal for me... of course, I was polite and said thank you but my brain was scrambled. Why am I, the groom's sister, being asked 2 months later than everyone else to be part of the bridal party?!? I didn't say anything about it but I think that's pretty rude still.

On my drive home, I open the bridesmaid thing and look through it to see what the ""duties"" are. She wants us to all buy our dresses from this 1 website, we are not allowed to wear off-the-shoulder dresses, and we were given a couple of shades of blue to choose from. She wanted us all to be in different dresses as well.

The no off-the-shoulder part bugged me because I love wearing that to cover my arms a little. For months I would scroll through this website, I would keep track of new release dates, and I could never find something that I would be any sort of comfortable in. She wanted everyone to finalize their dress so I ordered 3 to try on. All terrible quality and all made me feel terrible. I am extremely insecure about my appearance. I suffer from body dysmorphia as well as terrible anxiety on a daily basis.

I chose one because I had to. It was the best of the worst. But I'm still very much uncomfortable. This literally takes up my thoughts daily and I am so uncomfortable that it makes me cry. I pretty much feel naked. This day is already going to be extremely uncomfortable for me. My parents are divorced and they're both going to be there with both sides of the family so I'll be running around from side to side trying to maintain peace. I'd at least like to be comfortable in my skin while doing it.

Obviously, this isn't an event where I can just cancel. But honestly, I'm so uncomfortable I rather. My dad's girlfriend suggested that I wear the blue dress for the ceremony and pictures in the beginning and then change into another dress that I'm comfortable in regardless of color or where its from for the reception since all bridal party duties will be over by then. It's a good idea but then for the first half of the day I'm still going to be extremely uncomfortable. I literally don't know anyone in the bridal party its just going to be me all alone with all of these people for the first half of the day doing nothing but being in my head about this.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to cause problems but I'm so uncomfortable. And I don't want to be there allll day uncomfortable in my own skin on the verge of tears. Its not like I just don't like the dress and am being a brat. I am genuinely so uncomfortable I think about this daily dreading the day. I'm afraid if I say something they'll just get annoyed with me and call me a brat.",1677035098.0

I have agoraphobia and pretty much never leave my house.

I am already on Wellbutrin, Sertraline (Zoloft), and Hydroxyzine as needed. I also use medical cannabis for anxiety and it helps, but it is not helping the panic attacks.   


I moved states right at the beginning of COVID / quarantine and prior to that I had been seeing a psychiatrist who suggested Xanax temporarily to help me manage the panic attacks, but I was hesitant because my sister was an addict and it destroyed her life. Now, I am desperate and feel this might be my only opportunity to have something that will intervene and help in those worst moments, but....   


My previous psychiatrist can't see me because I'm no longer a resident, as mentioned, I have severe agoraphobia and establishing myself with a new doctor would do more harm than good right now and honestly feels impossible even if that were not the case....

I was worried about going, but my therapist suggested it’s good to continue with normal activities and this would be a good exposure. The minute I stepped off the plane on Sunday, I started having major anxiety attacks that come and go in waves throughout the day. The first night was horrible, pins and needles in my extremities during the night and just feeling of being anxious and not able to fall asleep. During the day I’d feel completely normal for a couple of hours and then a huge wave comes over and I don’t feel myself, like out of body experience, foggy, derealization and just fearful.

Since February 11 (now eleven days,) my mental health has taken a weird and confusing turn and I can't really or exactly pinpoint why. I have suddenly been experiencing:

Agoraphobia (struggling to sit down at restaurants, talk to people, hop on meetings with co-workers)

Frequent dizzy spells

Extreme fatigue

Struggling to manage heart palpitations

Struggling to manage shortness of breath

Close to fainting spells

Numb

Disconnected

Waves of extreme anxiety and sadness

Trouble concentrating

Memory fog

Digestive problems

Appetite problems  


So far, I have acquired the following supplements:

* Magnesium
* SAMe
* 5HTP 
* Ashwagandha, tulsi, and mimosa seed blend
* Daily probiotic blend
* Omega 3/vitamin D blend
* Vitamin C
* Iron (Spatone)
* Mushroom supplement
* Oils infused with magnesium  

Right now, I'm going to try a daily morning routine of Spatone Iron, a daily probiotic and Omega 3/vitamin D blend.

I am taking 5mg of hydroxyzine at night to help me fall and stay asleep. I think I may need something stronger to control the dizzy spells, however. I have a work trip coming up and I am worried about how I am going to manage my energy levels and near-fainting spells for 2 days.

I wake up with my chest heavy and my heart racing. I get really, really tired at about 6pm, and I want to fall asleep fully by 9pm. Last night, I slept from 9pm-8am (11 hours). Today, I feel tired and disconnected. I haven't seen many people or friends for nearly two weeks.

I have a therapist, but it is text/talk therapy. We voice note back and forth on a semi-regular basis. I am exploring options with a psychologist. I recently tried acupuncture which I enjoyed but felt really exhausted afterward.

I just want to get back to being me. I have bloodwork and a neurologist appt tomorrow...I'm hoping to get some answers from them. I almost hope they can pinpoint a medical problem or root for this so I can get medicine for it and get on with my life.",1677001527.0
747,reoccurring thoughts even though I dealt with them,1,1185cvl,Anxietyhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/1185cvl/reoccurring_thoughts_even_though_i_dealt_with_them/,7,"Hi everyone. I'm wondering if anyone has any good methods of calming anxiety when you have reoccurring thoughts that trigger the anxiety? 

I've had this happen for months due to a unhealthy friend group. After an incident happened that was mostly my fault, I've been having reoccurring anxiety and nonstop obsessive thoughts about things that I made up in my mind, things I resolved with others and talked out, like friends and my partner. It would be things like differences between my partner and I. I talked out with my friends my fear of abandonment and rejection sensitivity, and they comforted me saying they'll always be with me and have no judgement, and I'm working to deal with my social anxiety and fear of being behind. Alot of things trigger my social anxiety, so not much can be done about it other then forcing myself to normalize again. But other things are what's the main issue. I cannot stop thinking I'm doomed, and everyone is actually against me, I'm ruining lives, I'm behind everyone else, a failure of an adult already, and financial stress. 

Despite all this (me walking it out with those dear to me, letting myself cry it out), and also logging when I experience these pains, and when it starts up, I can't stop it for a while. Nothing really triggers it but my own brain quickly relating whatever I'm experiencing to that's caused me anxiety. Sometimes. Wiring it out helps, but it doesn't take long for me to feel anxious again. 

I just need some advice. I can't get to a professional soon enough, and I can't find any medicine that might help. I'm avoiding caffeine, weed, ect, things I know will trigger it more. I just wish I had a better living situation, because everything feels like doom, and I'm alone in the world. My chest just feels heavy, and with my lingering migraine, it's making me nauseous and lightheaded.

Typing this since my anxiety has kept me up since 3am and now I need to get ready for work. 

I’ve been struggling with social and high functioning anxiety disorder for as long as I can remember and been working corporate since I graduated college. I hate it. The “high functioning” aspect is what I think keeps me at my current stressful job, but I’ve been struggling over the past year to find fulfillment in the work I’m doing. All at the expense of my mental health, ability to sleep, and now depression. I seem to never like any job I’m in but I’m too afraid to let it go because of the potential consequences. The job I’m working now is the most corporate role I’ve ever had, a very reactive role so I don’t really ever know what I’m doing (very triggering for me), and I’m on a contract till the end of the year so I don’t get health insurance or PTO (also a huge source of anxiety for me). I feel like I can’t leave the job because I’m afraid of trivial “consequences” like how it’ll affect my resume, what people will think of me, how will I ever make money again etc. To add even more flavor to this anxiety recipe, my partner and I are also actively house hunting with our realtor so I feel even more stuck in my current position. 

I’m sure many others can relate to this, but I find myself dreading every Sunday afternoon knowing that work is coming the next day. I feel like I’m only enjoying life literally on Saturdays when I know I don’t have to think about work the next day. I don’t sleep more than 4 hours a night because I can’t get myself to stop stressing about what’s to come, what work I haven’t finished, what my coworkers think of me etc etc. 

Have you been in a similar situation before? Does it get better? Do I quit corporate forever like I’ve always dreamed of but never thought it was possible? I feel like I’ve been lost for years now, so I would love to hear other experiences to help me feel like I’m not alone in this. 

Would also love to hear any remedies to help you stay asleep (if you use medication, preferably over the counter) I feel like I haven’t had a good night sleep in months.",1676987235.0

*Hierarchical in nature and problem-focused, CBPT involves teaching skills and coping strategies to help children effectively deal with a wide range of emotional responses by using tools which include playful experiences. Children are often unable to ‘know’ why they feel the way they feel or ‘act’ they way they do, and are most often unable to effectively communicate with words about how they feel.* *Thus, playful mediums such as toys and art materials support the child’s journey of communicating/processing their inner most challenges in a non-hindering, safer way.*  *Books, art, sand and other playful medium support the child to cathartically express themselves via playing out their unconscious or conscious emotions and experiences when using these times.*  *The trained play therapist, uses formal CBPT strategies and techniques to teach children about how their brain and body respond to emotions and experiences.*  *This allows the young client to learn techniques which support mastery and healing (rather than the emotion / response being in control of the child).* *CBPT is considered a top-down approach whereby the child must have achieved some cognitive skills and abilities prior to being able to understand and then master maladaptive coping strategies.*  *Other interventions such as Theraplay, EMDR or Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy (DDP) can be combined within the treatment plan can be introduced simultaneously during the treatment process and supportive to the healing journey.*",1676968552.0

I'm here to share my current experience - I feel misunderstood by everyone pretty much, therefore I hope you can appreciate this monologue of mine.

I am a father, a husband, a friend and a worker. I try to excel in all I do, but unfortunately since I have moved to Europe from Canada I feel anxiety is not letting me live my fullest.

Me and my wife have 3 kids, and they're wonderful... As much as living in a madhouse with 3 kids, I feel good, safe and at ease here. I was always very outgoing, always looking for the next trip or experience to change or spice up my life. Then Covid... We spent 2 years locked up pretty much with my wife and 2 kids (we got pregnant during Covid). We found the strength to move to Europe, closer to our family members... But all of a sudden I feel like the pace is unbearable for me. I started feeling anxious when I go to work... I wonder if people talk behind my back, second guess every single decision... I feel out of place. I'm not sure what to do with myself, as I can't simply be a father, because 3 children need a good life, and I need a good job... But I completely lost myself, I have no idea where to begin.

Please forgive me if the post is such a mess, it's difficult to incorporate all the feelings in one post - and I probably failed. But I'm really struggling, and even though my wife understands, she is battling her own things... And I need to be throng. But I feellike all I want is to be with my children, and my wife, and just do nothing... Enjoying olaying, laughing, hugging... I don't want to do anything else.

Learn to let go. If someone is hell bent on not listening to you - not your problem. If they refuse to take your guidance. Not your problem. For years, I made it my problem 

For years, I advised friends, family and colleagues..all for free. 

I find if people want to value your advice, they pay for it and take it. But it was only too recently did I learn that if they ask for your advice- you do not own their actions; only your advice.

I spent a long time in meditation thinking about how anxious I would get for the outcomes of my advice..what if my friend did x instead of y? What if they didn't leave their abusive partner ? What if my buddy went bankrupt not listening to my advice that his house move was too much for him to handle at his income level? What if my work colleagues who asked for career advice made bad moves that jeopardized their growth?

Stop.

My coworker told me something; I care too much. I analyze too deeply. Let go. Stop worrying about the outcome. If you're asked for advice, don't give it. Chuck it. Throw it into the wind. Let it go. Release it after you give it.

This simple mental adjustment really helped me out and in turn I started helping a colleague who suffered pretty serious stress from a similar situation. I saw how worked up she was getting over advising a client.. and the client wouldn't listen and kept ignoring her. So, she was wrecked with stress. I gave her this simple advice of letting go of the advice.. and it was like a big reveal. 

Letting go of the obligation to feel responsible for anyone else for their inability to listen to you. Is. Not. Your. Problem.

Learning to give and let go has been a powerful revelation for me managing my anxiety at work. I just wish I figured it out sooner.",1676838841.0

Then today I had to leave a job early because of the exact same reason! My heart was fine but I still felt really ill, this time a headache started. I had a bad cough a week ago where I was choking and wondered if it's affecting my health/death anxiety. 
Also this week: 
•I have become obsessed with a great film that has death as a major theme. There is also a character who represents death and is really cool but I'm struggle to reconcile the fact that I like the character while still having a fear of dying in real life.  
•I've been looking up near death experiences to try and ease my anxiety surrounding death. 
•I'm constantly afraid I'll scare myself so much I'll have a heart attack (I have no history of heart problems and have been checked by my doctors) 
•I'm obsessed with the health of my lungs, heart, kidneys, liver and brain. 
•I'm worried about randomly collapsing in public in the street and get nervous when I start feeling unwell. 
•I'm worried about flying out of my body or feeling overly fatigued. 
•I'm scanning every symptom in my body in case it's a sign of something. 
•I'm always tense, on edge and doing OCD compulsions and wearing good luck items to try and ward off bad feelings.

I was sexually abused as a child by a neighbor. My parents are still married and my home life with my brothers was pretty normal I believe. My mom may sort of have narcissistic tendencies, and my dad had slight anger issues and depression, but nothing that you’d think would lead to trauma in the way that I’m experiencing it. I barely noticed these things as a child and am more realizing these things now as an adult. 

I just recently started dating someone for the last few months. 

Previous to this I got out of a ten year sometimes toxic relationship with an alcoholic SO.

This new relationship started off very whirlwindy and intimate and fast honestly. I tried to put it off and actually denied him from anything serious for about a month. We’ve now been dating three months.

We’ve met each other as friends and family and spend every weekend together. 

In the beginning of our relationship, probably up until three weeks or so ago, he had been giving me an abundance of attention - almost too much sometimes. We always had fun together and couldn’t get enough of just being around eachother. 

I don’t know if it’s just that we’re coming down from a honeymoon phase but it seems like it’s becoming less and less, however when we’re together nothing much has changed we are still very lovey and stuff. 

When we are apart he used to text me every few hours. Now I’m lucky if I hear from him twice a day some days. This is causing me significant anxiety and depression though. I was never like this is my previous relationship. 

I’m feeling super anxious about it and insecure. 

I can’t tell if it’s my own issues that I’m just projecting or if it’s my intuition telling me that something is off. I’ve never really considered myself to be somebody who was worried about being abandoned, but I have this overwhelming sense of feeling like he’s going to abandon me even though we both have tons of stuff at each other’s houses and have plans for the future. 

I’ve been in bed all day riddled with anxiety, hardly able to get up. When he has reached out to me as ignored him because I’m worried that I’m becoming too attached. 

I wish I had money to see if therapist because I really know that I should be in therapy. This is getting increasingly worse and it seems like every time I start to get anxious. It lasts longer than the last time and feels a lot worse.

Why am I experiencing new abandonment anxiety issues? 

I have a previous anxiety issues back in high school, but nothing like this has happened for a long time. I really like this person and I’m just worried that he’s getting sick of me or won’t like me soon and will break up with me. I don’t want to talk to him about it because I feel like he’s just gonna think I’m crazy and not know what I’m talking about or I might take him off guard by doing so.

I have a great half-time job that I've been at 1.5 years. When I first started, my boss wanted to pay me under the table for the first three months to make sure I was a good fit before adding me to payroll. However, I barely survive living paycheck to paycheck and that extra $100-$200 in taxes is actually needed to make sure my bills are paid so I have asked him to keep me under the table and he has no problem with that. He sends me some kind of legal form each year that I'm supposed to use once I file my taxes.

Anyway - there is a medical/dental/behavioral clinic and pharmacy here that goes on a sliding scale for patients with no health insurance. I just started using them about 5 months ago and I have been telling them I'm unemployed so I can be on the sliding scale where my 6 monthly medications are around $70 instead of $300 and doctor appointments are only $25. I know this is not right and I always feel really bad about it and I've been thinking about showing them the document my boss sends me each year to prove my wages but I'm so scared I won't be able to afford my medications or counseling appointments.

Here's my pickle: The main thing I want/need counseling/therapy for is my fucking boss (yes it's an online company and I work from home and have never met him but holy fuck lol).

I’ve been thinking this week about whether or not I’d like to seek out a psychiatrist for a formal diagnosis of an anxiety disorder.

I am fairly certain that I meet the diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorder. I have dealt with the symptoms my whole life, and although the severity and nature of the symptoms have fluctuated throughout my life, I have never been entirely free of anxiety. As a chid and teenager I often found my anxiety debilitating, and had frequent panic attacks when away from family/comfortable spaces and developed compulsive germaphobia as an adolescent. Today I am a high functioning and fairly successful young adult. I spent over two years in therapy in university and saw massive improvements in my day to day life, but I’m uninsured so I’m no longer doing that.

A couple years ago when my mental health was really bad I saw a psychiatrist who ultimately prescribed me antidepressants and told me I met the criteria for several mental illnesses (a variety run in my family) but did not offer a diagnosis. At the time I was very young, did not advocate for myself, was really struggling mentally, and honestly had very little understanding of what went on in my own head. I’m wondering if I’d like to try again as a more self-assured adult in a much better place.

I’m not really looking to medicate. There’s no real reason I need to do this I guess. I just grew up in a household that was very dismissive of mental illness, despite an illustrious and tragic family history, and never received any help, guidance or treatment until I was an adult and sought it out myself. I think it would feel validating to have a mental health professional confirm what I feel I’ve always known. I also still feel some strange sort of imposter syndrome about my anxiety since it was constantly dismissed growing up and I feel that the lack of a medical confirmation means I do not have the right to claim my struggles with anxiety. It makes it more difficult for me to talk openly about it because I always feel as though I’m appropriating an experience that is not my own somehow.

I’m writing this post today because I’m wondering what people who have already done this think — is a diagnosis worth it? Is it difficult to get? Are there any reasons (i.e. employment opportunities, stigma) that it might be better not to, if I don’t want to medicate? I am Canadian, so the psychiatrist appointment would not cost me anything. Is there anything I should know about how diagnosis works before I decide?

Thanks in advance for reading and for your advice.",1676737962.0

I had basically moved on from most of my anxieties, including the sickness fear. I was so mentally healthy and happy. 

Then last year happened. I have Endometriosis and have had surgery for it twice. My first experience, in 2020, was extremely traumatic and I could have lost my life. My endo got so bad again, I had to have a second surgery last year. It seemed like the right thing to do for my health and I was in a great place mentally about it all. 

But… I woke up from surgery a completely different person. I was having multiple panic attacks a night, extremely anxious all day, bouts of depression, and so on. My main anxiety was all about throwing up and my health. I freak out about everything I feel, I fixate on anything my body does, I work myself up to a panic and convince myself I’m going to puke. 

It’s been 8 months since my surgery and I have made good progress with the help of therapy, family support, and lots of doctors appts that have basically proved I’m fine. I don’t have severe panic attacks anymore and I practice a lot of tools I’ve learned through therapy. I am generally doing better, but I still have that lurking anxiety and fear that presents itself and will put me right back in a place I don’t want to be.

Every single day if something minuscule but frustrating happens like someone messes up my order or I deal with a rude client/someone in customer service I worry that I’ll deal with the bad luck I experienced earlier in my life. When I went through that period of my life it was consistent along with other issues, not sporadic like the present. I’m always expecting something bad to happen as a coping mechanism & just anxiety, some may say it’s negative. Is this normal? Medication hasn’t helped & therapy is a waste bc I can’t find the right fit. Is this overthinking just how I manage?

So the other day I was on call while at work and my coworkers started having a conversation that made me heavily uncomfortable. Was not a fun time and I was getting very anxious. I stayed quiet during this conversation because I was uncomfortable, freaking out and also begging to over think wether I contribute or not contribute to the conversation, and what they would think either way. 

I’m very health conscious, especially in regards to my heart and in this moment took an ECG on my Apple Watch. I’ve never done one of these mid panic but the result turned out AFIB.

The symptoms are similar if not identical of that to a panic attack, so my panicked have gotten so bad its now detectable with a watch

No more, I’ve had it with this shit.
First catching feelings for someone making me nervous, now this; it never ends

Life seems to keep getting worse atm and this is just adding to it.

I wanted to share it in the hope that it might help others. I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/108hy73/things_that_helped_me/) a while ago about some things that were helping me with my anxiety. I was travelling last week and my anxiety came back strong. 

I got home earlier this week and decided to take a day off Reddit. Not sure what the motivation for that was but I had been on here a LOT while I was traveling - I use Reddit to alleviate the agony of boredom (I have ADHD). 

I noticed that I felt happier and less anxious all day. I wasn't sure if this was down to my travel or not, so I took another day off Reddit, and then another. I feel SO much better this week and much more clear-headed. I have been less anxious and happier all week. I am not going to count this post as breaking my social media detox :-) 

So I then searched the internet for ""anxiety and social media"" and there are a growing number of studies showing that people who use social media more, are more anxious and more depressed. 

I have always been careful with the subs i join and what shows up on my reddit feed. I avoid things that will upset me or make me feel bad (triggers) but I'm starting to think that my constant scrolling, looking for the next laugh or awesome video that I can share with friends was leading to anxiety. And it just became a cycle for me. If I felt bad, I got out reddit and looked for something to cheer me up. 

Going forward, I'm going to try and make social media a smaller and smaller part of my life. I don't think I need to quit it 100% though. I've set a daily 20min app limit on my iphone, and I've moved the apps off my home screen so I'm not tempted. I'm also more present and less distracted when I'm around my family.",1676646766.0

First week was horrible. Wasn’t sleeping wasn’t eating I felt off and still headache. By the 2nd week I started to feel better emotionally. My physical anxiety kind of went away. My tightness in the chest my trouble breathing went away. Yes still had thoughts that would ruin my day but no physical symptoms. Just still a headache. Week 3 and 4 same but now it’s a weird pressure. Some days just my forehead. Then other days top of the head. Just pressure. But it ruins my whole day. I literally start thinking it’s a damn tumor. It’s the only symptom. I hwte it tho. Tylonel excedrin nothing works. I’ve been sleeping better and eating better drinking tons of water and nothing works. Since I wake up this pressure is there.

I sometimes feel I cannot get a full breath so I take deep breaths in every now and then.

I am now fixating on the lower number even though I have heard people say that oximeters tend to fluctuate for many varied reasons. But thats health anxiety, I cannot shake the feeling that something extremely terrible is wrong.

Life going going ok for the most part, until early 2021. I got engaged, and then had to break it off in March 2021. In January 2022, I started panicking and having anxiety issues over all sorts of nonsense - nothing that actually was an issues - like my house - fearing there could be some major issues (there really wasn't any).  In April, I had a bad motorcycle accident - collided with a deer and ended up breaking my hand and needing two hand surgeries (luckily - broken hand bones (deer impacted my handle bar) was the only injury that I sustained - even after sliding down the road face down (full gear from head to toe saved my life and skin). I had to spend a lot more time living at my parent's house during those four months of recovery and surgeries, because not having a right hand made life difficult. 

I healed up, but the anxiety just kept spinning out of control. It's not even normal anxiety, like work. It's worrying about silly stupid issues - all that can be fixed - like is my septic full and what happens if it backs up (it wasn't full and it is operating normally) to very light water spots on my driver's seat from rain (worrying if the lease company is going to penalize me for it - even though it is very hard to even see them).  I try to reason these things out, but the anxiety seems to win. During this time, a friend of mine's cancer has been getting progressively worse, and I been feeling absolutely hopeless with it.  (In my 30's, my brother passed away, my uncle (we were very close in age and hung out often) died, two of my grandparents passed, my next door neighbor I was very close with passed.  My mom got and beat cancer three times. So maybe all of these things are finally catching up with me, as each time, I tried to be the rock that everyone can lean on during all of those difficult times. 

I been getting stomach issues,  headaches, waves of panic thoughts and extreme worries that are  overwhelming me. I was teaching my night course on Tuesday night, and I  guess it took a toll on me finally, where I got extremely lightheaded in  class and dizzy. I ended class early, which I never do, and Wednesday I  had to call out.

I've tried  talking to friends, coworkers, family, and the worst thing is realizing  that none of them understand. None of them offer anything in the form of  insight or help. I have a friend that tried talking to someone for his  OCD and depression issues, and all they did was pump him up with pills  that just made him very sick and his OCD got progressively worse to the  point he can not function normally anymore.

I  tried marijuana gummies in the fall - Delta-9 THC - 10 MG. It's a  band-aid and nothing more. While it clears my head, allows me to fall  sound asleep and stay asleep, once the effects are out of my system the  next day, the anxiety comes back like a freight train twice as bad as it  was before.   I am now fighting the urge to take them, as I think I am  started to get hooked on them at night before bed.  I been limiting  myself to once or twice a week, but I want to stop taking them  altogether.

I am realizing that  social activity is one of the few things that seems to work.  My social  life is absolute crap, as most of my friends either got married and  moved on with life or they passed away in our 30s.  I been trying to  make an effort at doing some social activities and doing them seems to  be the few times I have a reprieve from anxiety. Also keeping busy seems  to help, but I find that is not good either, because as soon as the  stress from keeping hyper busy with work suddenly vanishes, I get  headaches and can't relax at all. Even though nothing is happening, my  head is spinning with panic thoughts and worries - even though there is  nothing happening to feel a sense of panic, dread, and worry.  I am  literally sitting there on a Saturday morning, with an empty calendar  that day, sipping coffee, having breakfast, and watching deer strolling  through the yard... I should be at peace, and that used to give me a  sense of peace, but lately I am sitting there unable to relax and have  this horrible feeling of dread as if my whole world is about to crumble  and fall apart.

I am still trying  to figure things out. While I always had anxiety, I always had been able  to manage it.  In the past year, something changed, and it is running  away.  I am in my early 40s, and not sure why.  There has to be an  answer somewhere, and that is what I am struggling to find.",1676605320.0

My whole life, I’ve suffered from social anxiety. I struggled to form friendships, and the panic attacks I would get jeopardized my job. It wasn’t something I was able to address until I learned about cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and tools like thought journaling. Applying these techniques taught me how to challenge my unhelpful thoughts and really improve my mental health.

I looked for apps and online tools to help me with this process, but I couldn’t find one that worked well for me. A big hurdle was that I prefer typing on a keyboard but I couldn’t find anything that let me also journal from my computer. So I was inspired to try and build an app myself!

Unstuck is based on CBT, the evidence-based framework that’s considered the gold standard in therapy. I worked with a psychologist to ensure the content is backed by the relevant science.

The main features:

* A structured thought journal that is designed to help you recognize and challenge harmful thinking patterns.
* A savoring journal that helps you appreciate positive moments in your life. It’s similar to a gratitude journal, except recent research indicates savoring is more effective than gratitude at addressing anxiety and depression.
* Insights based on your entries, such as which thinking traps you are most susceptible to.

For most of my teenage/adult life I've suffered with severe anxiety however after tons of research I figured it might be anxious attachment to my parents because of past experiences growing up (they left my and my siblings alone at home a lot to party and I'd have to babysit them ( even tho I was only 13 myself)) 

Through that whenever my parents go out at night and we're left at home I tend to get extremely anxious and worried for them, even though I know it's irrational. Is there any way to overcome this feeling? As I said I'm 20 yo and don't think u should be feeling this way about being home alone but it's a massive trigger for me and I can't seem to shake it.

A few years ago I used to get really paranoid about food and I was convinced there were bugs in it and that they would start crawling around inside me (stupid I know). That went away mostly but last night I ate one of my fear foods (an egg) that has always been the worst for me and then I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong with it. It ended up with me having the worst panic attack I've had in a really long time and being sick for hours. I had to take today off work to recover. I'm scared I'm starting to go crazy and I feel like I can see bugs everywhere even though there's nothing there. I'm always convinced there's something wrong with me and that I'm somehow ill but this is making me feel insane. Does anyone have advice or experience with anything similar?,1676553599.0

Never medicated or anything like that. Started taking amitriptyline for headaches around 3 weeks ago (not for anxiety/depression). 
A couple days after taking them I had this horrible fear about death; myself, my partner & parents etc. I’ve had these worries before but have just told myself not to think about it anytime soon and then I’ve been fine. But this time I haven’t been the same since. I am extremely anxious/fearful 24/7 about death & ageing etc. I see a counsellor, and I have stopped the amitriptyline 1 week ago today. Until just before this started, I was obviously aware of the way life works but I just didn’t think about it and was enjoying life as it goes along. I was also so excited to start a life with my partner and have children etc and now I’m having horrible thoughts like what’s the point in doing things with my life etc and it’s just not the way I want to be. 
I just want to go back to how I was before this I’m not enjoying life because of it which is awful so I just wondered if anyone had any advice. 
I also would like to know if anyone has had any sort of bad effects from taking amitriptyline as my counsellor believes it could be that which has caused this or atleast massively contributed

If I'm leaving the house with someone, or leaving the house on my own to meet someone? No problem. It's only when I'm going out and going to be on my own the entire time that I can't seem to leave the house. 

When I was still in university (the time where it began) I would get the bus from my house alone, then have a friend meet me at the uni bus stop, walk me to the library and then I'd be able to continue my day on my own. Recently, I have asked someone I live with for a lift into town so that I could run errands and get a coffee on my own, spending the day alone and getting home alone no problem. I have no trouble being on my own, spending time on my own, or navigating the world on my own. When I was much younger I had social anxiety which made things like this difficult, but I'm much more confident now and don't really have issues with this. 

The only thing I have tried that enables me to leave the house is having someone be with me for some part of the journey. If I try to get myself to walk 5 minutes to the local shop and back, or just walk around the block, ensuring I wouldn't encounter anyone in this time, I still feel unable to do so. 

It robs me of a lot of my independence, means I have to rely on other people to help me do basic stuff, and it also means that lots of my days off work are wasted spent pacing my room trying, and ultimately failing, to get myself out of the house. Sometimes it feels a lot worse than other times, however, I think that this more coincides with time periods where I'm spending lots of time with other people so notice it less. 

This has been happening for over 4 years. It began when I was in my final year of university and the stress of this, combined with losing a loved one, caused my already questionable mental health to decline and I went on to a new antidepressant. One mental health professional whom I consulted about this at the time said that it was just me adjusting to being on new medication. I am still on this medication if that's helpful, and feel it has and continues to help me in lots of ways. 

I have tried to look online to find tips or ways to support myself with this, but when I try to google it lots of stuff about agoraphobia comes up, and I don't think it's agoraphobia as I can leave the house just fine when others are involved it's just this one specific situation that I'm struggling with. 

I guess I'm looking for either tips to try to alleviate this or what to call it so I can google it I guess? Thanks

I got attached to cannabis after I realised it helps calm me down.
It has gotten to a point now if I even think about leaving the house my heart sinks and rate increases significantly
I wanted to go to the doctors but I can't even bring myself to do that.
As of now I spend more money on cannabis than I do food and if have to choose between weed and food I choose weed.
Due to this my weight has also dropped to a point where you can see my ribs.

I woke up every morning and threw up for about 2 weeks, and I could barely keep any food down. This doesn't happen as often anymore, but it still happens. Usually, in the morning, after waking up, I start thinking about things again until I get anxious and throw up. Sometimes, it happens at night, too, if I have something I can't stop thinking about. 

The days of my life consist of pretty much nothing but sleeping and binge eating, and occasionally homework. I can't even go downstairs to pick up a delivery without wanting to cry from the anxiety. I can't do job interviews or anything without freaking out.

Xanax caused extreme drowsiness so I stopped taking those as well. Working out helped a bit. Weight lifting and climbing stairs helped the pain go away but only for about an hour and then the pain would all come back. I lived in pain everyday. People would keep giving me more work at my office. I am a competitive person so people like working with me and I am the first person my coworkers look for when they need help. I work hard and I do my job well but people don’t know that I suffer from anxiety and physical pain. So a couple of weeks ago people were calling me for all kinds of things at work. I decided that I couldn’t take it anymore so I just bought myself a flight ticket and flew to Hawaii. Without telling anyone(except for the HR of course). I just left. Stayed in a nice hotel in Hawaii. Went swimming in the ocean everyday. Went shopping. Nobody could reach me because I wasn’t checking my emails. (I was away for a week and my inbox had 81 new emails when I got back. Of course some of them were spam but there were more than 20 very important work emails as well lol. ) The moment I got on that airplane the whole body pain that had been making me miserable disappeared like magic. And I am still pain free, a week after I got back from my vacation. Anxiety has subsided at least for now. I am thinking maybe the problem was vitamin D difficiency because my bloodwork showed extremely low vitamin D. Maybe that was the cause of the muscle pain. Anyways I am a new person. A relaxing getaway solved my physical pain and took my anxiety away. I haven’t felt like this in years.",1676451706.0

Add on to this, if I sit at a row with seating available, this one weird kid will sit next to me who honestly makes me very uncomfortable. This leads to me having to come to class earlier to claim my seat but last time I tried, they were already there with his seat saved.

3. Wedding planning- asking friends to be in my wedding party. Asking my fiancé’s cousin but I’m worried she’ll say no, and my cousin being so far away. Worried about my grandma wanting to come to my first dress try on. My mom asking if I want to open the can of worms with my dad by having my maternal grandpa walk me down the aisle instead of him.

4. The shooting at MSU- just with how far away he got. Then being in the community with the hoax call of an active shooter threat. Just every bump and noise in the night has me on edge- even though I tell myself if my dog is snoring next to me I’m okay. (He barks at a leaf rolling by so, I think he’d know if something was up) 

5. Going to a large city soon that I’ve never been to with a man who physically make me uncomfortable. But I already paid for my trip- and I can’t really say no. He wasn’t originally in the plan but not my trip so

I'll just call them ""John"". 

Some brief history: 

John is around 18 years old and has dealt with this issue since around middle school age. It began with him not wanting to attend school some days, and eventually it grew to where he could not go to school at all because he would have a panic attack. He was home schooled from then onward. Since then, the social anxiety has impacted every aspect of his life. He has a few friends, but does not see them much. They go to college out of town now. He struggles to leave the house to do basic tasks like taking out the trash. Going to a more public area with a lot of people would typically cause him to have severe panic.

He saw a therapist and was medicated for a short amount of time in his younger teenage years, but he hated it and refused to go to therapy or take medication. 

My family and I are quite lost with trying to help him. We try to guide him through CBT and simple exposure therapy. The exposure therapy is very ""light"" also. It's really simple stuff like taking a step out the door or a walk down the street in their quiet neighborhood. He still refuses to go back to therapy. We've tried a handful of ""sit-downs"" or ""family talks"" where we try to talk to him about it and help him, but he is like a locked box.

We don't know what else we can do at this point if he won't go to therapy and he can't even accomplish basic exposure therapy. This anxiety completely rules his life. At this trajectory, he has very little chance of getting an education or ever maintaining even a part time job. Since he's 18, we can't force him to do anything.

I would love any advice that anyone can offer. Thank you.",1676388337.0

888,Anxiety? Stress? Guilt? Scarred?,1,112apbz,Anxietyhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/112apbz/anxiety_stress_guilt_scarred/,0,"I’ll try to cut my story short in hope of someone out there being able to help me and guide me as I feel like I can no longer continue living with this feeling.

A general idea about myself is that I am a 22 yrs old medical student. I usually stress and worry a lot about medical school and my examinations, regardless of the fact that I score the highest amongst my batch. 

My story starts the summer of 2021 where I met a girl that goes to the same medical school as I do. Half way through the relationship problems start to arise between the two of us and I didn’t think anything of them as all relationships have their ups and downs. At this time, my partner began to say bad and mean things to me when we fought which initially didn’t affect me as I knew it was because of her being angry (she also reassured me after the fight resolves that she didn’t mean it). This started to escalate in which the problems became more frequent and almost every time I’ve had hurtful things being said to me. This progressively increased till the summer of 2022 (~11 months past for our relationship) which was the same summer in which I would take my Step 1 exam (a really important, exhausting and dreadful exam). At this point I used to always worry about our future and if were are even compatible, I used to have a weird heart clenching feeling that is filled with worry and anxiety, I also used to wake up from sleep several times with my heart racing or wake up before my alarm with the thought of our relationship overwhelming. We had a fight around 3 weeks before my exam which was my last straw and I communicated to my partner at that time that I want to end things as I felt I should communicate to her my true feelings that I no longer feel like I can continue in this relationship or think we have a future together (the things that were said to me where the worse out of all fights). She was devastated, cried and begged for me to give her another chance as she will change herself. I was heistant but decided to give her a chance, it worked out for the first few days but then the same heart clenching weird anxious feeling returned. I tried to battle it and not disclose it to her, but eventually I couldn’t hide it anymore and told her I couldn’t accept and give her another chance (around ~4 days before my exam). The whole 4 days and holiday after the exam was devastating I was really sad and down. With time, I used to distract myself and go out with friends (I don’t drink) almost every other day which helped me try to forget the whole situation. 

Keep in mind that I’ve got several messages from my ex weeks after the breakup about how I was wrong and that she would never forgive me and other prayers. Similarly over the last couple of months (it’s been 6 months since our breakup) I’ve been getting tiktok reposts from her account of videos taking about injustice and how sad/devastated she was which always made me feel very guilty as I was the reason for her current feelings. Similarly, it made me self-conscious about my decisions and doubt my feelings as she claims I never loved her and if I did I would never leave her.

Fast forward to the last month (5 months since breakup) where I finally approached a girl in my class that was always getting my attention and I couldn’t lay my eyes off her. In the first 3 days (through text), I was very happy and excited to get to know her. Three days later (which was also when the new school year started and the week of my important sport tournament) I started to have this same tiring, coruscating and exhaustive heart clenching feeling as if there is something I am worrying about. It started to increase progressively and I’ve always tried to forget it and keep it in the back of my head,, but it has been really taking a toll on me as I almost wake up everyday with this feeling and it stays throughout the day. Keeping in mind that throughout this period we’ve grown really close and she seems to really care about me. I have this feeling in the background around 60% of the day, 20% is me being distracted by work and friends and the remainder 20% consist of me actually overthinking and worrying. I really don’t understand why is this happening:
	a. Am I feeling guilty that I am meeting a new person?
	b. Am I worrying that this new relationship may end like the previous one?
	c. Am I scarred and no longer can commit to a relationship? 
	d. Why is the same feeling (but less intensity) that I was having before I left my ex happening again????
	e. Is the person not compatible for me and I am still seeking my ex?
	f. Did I still not move on from my previous relationship (prior to the new girl I was certain that I did move on and had 0 feelings, but I brought it up now because I have 		no idea what is the reason for this feeling)

Any input can help me understand this feeling that is taking a huge toll on me.

You know how when hardships arise, people always say, “I miss being a kid.” Or “I want to be a kid again.” It sucks when there is no ‘before’ for you. It’s always been this constant pain. 

As long as I can remember, all I’ve known is agony. My whole life filled with it. 

I suffered for years when I was a kid by drinking, smoking and having casual sex as early as 12 years old. I’m 22 now. I remember the period of 12-17 years old just being full of alcohol and sex - all to distract the constant pain I feel inside. 

From 17 to 20 years old, I was in a toxic relationship and got cheated on from the beginning and only got told in the end. I was suicidal throughout the relationship because of both my family and ex and everyone continued treating me like I was worth nothing. I took care of my ex a lot with his own physical issues while I suffered alone with my mental illness. I never went out, never did anything fun and 4 years of my life went just like that. All that for nothing too in the end. I’m super loyal and love deeply, I’ve only had 2 relationships and the first one before this was extremely emotionally and mentally abusive too. I have never known love. 

Last year I tried my best to heal myself but because I was so broken from the disbelief of getting cheated on, I drank almost every week, really heavily. It would be days at a time sometimes. I was hooking up with a guy on and off for a few months and it was another distraction too. All I did was drink, have sex and regret as usual. I would survive on 4 hours of sleep and drink and I’d repeat that often. I barely slept and would stay awake for hours, just drinking. I constantly felt so empty. I just feel like all I’ve ever known is pain, no one has ever loved me. Not my family, not my ex’s, no one at all. I never had genuine friends too. Everyone betrayed or backstabbed me one way or another. I was always left alone with no one to trust or lean on. 

One day I woke up and told myself if I want change, I have to make changes. I drank really badly one night and the next night I was lying down and had already decided I’ll stop and better myself. This is where my life took a turn for the worst, as if it was not horrible enough already. 

I was using my phone and lying down in bed when I had tunnel vision for the first time in my life, everything was black except a small dot in the middle of my vision. Next, I had the worst pain in the back of the left side of my head. I tried pressing it and it wouldn’t go away and suddenly I felt numb all over, I couldn’t lift my hands up normally, they felt so heavy and suddenly I couldn’t think or speak. I felt like I was about to faint and when the paramedics came and asked me for my personal info, I didn’t understand a thing and asked what was that. I couldn’t speak, I couldn’t type, I couldn’t think. I couldn’t even form a thought. Otw in the ambulance I felt like I was going to swallow my own tongue, it was curling back in and I couldn’t straighten it out and felt like I was about to die. It was spasming super badly and I felt like I was having a stroke. It was the weirdest and scariest experience of my life. I got to the ER and I threw up and it went off. The doctor told me it was a panic attack. 

Ever since that day I’ve not been normal or the same. Everyday I experience dizziness, I dissociate every second, I can’t yawn normally most of the time, I can’t sleep, I get tremors in my body, I get twitches, spasms all over. I haven’t had an episode like that first one since then, but everyday there’s something and I can’t live my life normally anymore. I don’t go out anymore, I cancel plans, I say no to plans, I just stay home and rot all because I’m physically unable to be out there. I’m unable to function like an able bodied human. I feel disabled. I live in fear everyday I’m going to be paralysed or disabled someday. I’m constantly suffering. I have never had a break. Doctor’s keep saying it’s anxiety/panic attacks but I feel like my soul is just gone. Since that night, something in me changed forever and I don’t know what went wrong in my body. But the tests always come back clear.

I wanted to change my life for the better but idk why the Universe is punishing me so badly. Idk what I’ve done to deserve a lifetime of pain and sufferings. I just want to be a normal 22 year old. I see everyone living their lives and being so happy, I wish that could be me too. I wish I was normal. All my life I was mentally tormented by depression and anxiety and now I have another burden that’s all so physical and completely debilitating. 

I’ve suffered with sleep issues since a kid and always had a hard time falling asleep because I’d want to be awake every night. It followed into my teens and adulthood because I always loved the night and wanted to be out or awake then. Now all I want is to desperately sleep but I can’t anymore. It worsened after that night. I have so many issues. I’m so tired.

I just feel so sad and alone. I wish I wasn’t born. I was put here just to suffer and be in pain. I’ve been so full of empathy and love all my life and it hurts that this is my reality. I just wish I had the courage to end it for good so I won’t have to suffer anymore.",1676314964.0
895,Not coping with new job,3,111s7ig,Anxietyhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/111s7ig/not_coping_with_new_job/,1," (32F, suffer from anxiety, depression and overthinking). I'll make this post short. I have recently started my first ""real"" job at a high school cafeteria. We are understaffed and the work is very fast and we are expected to do everything. Serve hundreds of students, clean, set up areas, dishes etc. I am trying my best every shift but I've found myself breaking down crying when they called me in to work later today. I've gotten this job right as my depression was starting to get worse, and I think I am definitely not coping with this. I find myself thinking how long I have until my next shift.

I am not on antidepressants (never have been) and the wait time to see a psychologist is beyond ridiculous. It sounds stupid but I am hesitant to take antidepressants purely because I've heard they can make you gain weight. I've spent the last 2+ years losing over 130lb/60kg and I still have to lose more. But I am struggling to lose weight lately. I think because I have been so stressed from all these new changes. 

Is it a stupid reason not to want to take medication? I am also depressed because of another person in my life and don't think taking antidepressants would do much. I would be even more depressed if I saw that I had gained weight.

Just tell me straight if I am being unreasonable here.

I find myself wanting to cry every day at random times. I feel hopeless, nothing to look forward to, low self esteem, and physically and mentally exhausted. I'm constantly overthinking and making myself feel worse. My mood is always low these days and find no enjoyment from doing anything (for example, i have no motivation to watch or play something).

If I did take antidepressants, how would they help me?

Which medication would be best for anxiety as well? My heart is racing throughout my entire shift and I really hate that feeling so much.

We both attend the same university. To be honest I used to be happier before I dated him. He's very toxic and pessimistic. He even slapped me on the arm and snapped at me. He even acknowledged that he hit me at that moment. Then later dismissed it by changing up what really happened at that moment saying that he did it on accident saying it wasn't a hit. It was a soft slap... (The slap left a red mark)

He has history of getting it on with people. He does the thing and leave them. He's been liking the photos of the person he did it with which he's allowed to. I sometimes think that he might still be talking to him but that's besides the point. I mean in this case it doesn't matter to me anymore.

I share what I'm interested with him he dismisses it saying ""does it matter?""

He has a history of always saying that he hated people and he hates other couples

I want to press the block button and avoid him at school(even if he comes up to me) I want to be happy again and the only way to do that if I cut him out of my life. I've cut people out like no problem but with this person I'm not sure.

He's never there for me. When I cried in front of his face he just sighed and turned the other way. When I was fainted the other day he texted me later that he was annoyed I kept fainting when I couldn't help it.

For context, I've battled anxiety and depression since adolescence. I am currently in therapy and on 10mg of Prozac and reevaluating my relationship with alcohol all together.

I get nervous in social situations, especially around my partners friends who I don't know as well. I feel like since I turned 21, more than half of the group settings I'm in involve alcohol. Once I have a drink or two, I no longer feel that anxiety, but I don't want to lean on alcohol. I just want to be confident enough in who I am as a person without substances.

I drank once in the past two weeks - I was at a dinner with my partners friends and had a few glasses of wine. I felt horrible the next day because I always sleep like crap when I drink wine. Aside from that one night, I am enjoying learning that I can attend brunches and other group events with my friends where people are drinking and I'm not. I went to a galentine's brunch a few days ago and nobody even questioned why I wasn't drinking.

I have a bunch of weddings, bachelorettes, etc coming up and there will be a lot of drinking. My partner also drinks a fair amount. I don't know if I should completely stop or just set boundaries with myself when I choose to drink? I have never been a person that has needed alcohol everyday, but I hate the anxiety I feel after drinking. Prior to 2023, I was drinking 1-3 nights a week. Usually a few glasses of wine 2 nights and then would get tipsy or drunk at bars or out with friends once a week.

I don't know if my problem is alcohol or if my problem is not being comfortable with myself. Any advice? Should I just give it up? I don't know! I feel like I'm spiraling and just obsessing over this.",1676306136.0

For those unfamiliar, paruresis  is the fear of peeing in front of others, aka shy bladder. I feel that this problem may overlap with more generalized forms of anxiety, or really just anyone who needs privacy.  

A friend of mine and I have been working to create an app specifically focused on helping those affected with Paruresis. We've shared the beta version of the app with r/Paruresis and received a lot of positive feedback. We thought it might be interesting for folks here - feel free to poke around and tell us what you think. Here's some info about the app itself:

The app is intentionally simple and quick to use, with the main focus being on identifying the ""safety"" of a bathroom on a scale of 1-5 (1 being the least safe, 5 being the most safe). Here’s a quick breakdown of the features and some notes regarding the app itself:

Current Features/Function

* link to site: [www.paruapp.com](http://www.paruapp.com/)
* App can be used on a computer or phone browser, but we're going to make it a true app asap.
* Interactive map showing bathrooms nearby + reviews based completely on how “safe”/private they are. Red dots identify a bathroom that already has at least one review.
* Bathroom reviews – users are able to select any business or location with a bathroom at it. Reviews will be entirely based on privacy of said bathroom, or lack thereof. Cleanliness, lighting, etc are not part of the review
* Reviews are simple and numerical. Select a 1-5 scale for each of the following: Privacy, Ambient Noise, Layout, Traffic. The overall bathroom score is a weighted average of these four aspects.

We currently have a working version of the app anyone can use, if you're interested. Feel free to poke around or leave some reviews!

Lastly, neither of us are programmers. Through the process of creating this, we've had to learn how to code and do everything else related to an app. We'd love to hear feedback on what we're doing right or wrong here.",1676301137.0

I am convinced that I will die in my sleep. Which is why I put off going to sleep as much as possible. Whenever I think about dying I can feel myself starting to panic, I can feel the panic in my stomach just like when I have a panic attack. Thankfully I can usually stop the panic, but sometimes I do have a panic attack because of this. Which means I wake up fully again. I try to keep my brain occupied with youtube or music untill I am almost asleep and then when I close my computer or phone, my brain suddenly wakes up again and starts to panic. I feel like falling asleep to youtube isn't ideal. I want to be able to sleep without any help. I also take melatonin, but I don't want to take it every night.

Firstly I hope that whatever you’re dealing with that is giving you stress or anxiety that you are coping well and know you’re not alone in your battle. Don’t ever give up, I believe in you!

About 5/6 years ago I used to suffer with bad anxiety (I still suffer from time to time but nowhere near as much) , I suffered alone as I felt I couldn’t speak to others out of fear I’d be judged…but I was wrong, now I regularly go out with friends and openly tell them whenever I’m feeling anxious, and they reassure me and I even reassure myself that these feelings will pass! I know it’s easier said than done but believe me you are stronger than you think 💪🏽

Somethings which helped me which I would recommend:
- Cut back on the alcohol
- Have a break from social media
- Create a structured routine that you can follow
- Meditate (even if it’s for 10 minutes a day)
- Every morning say 5 things you’re grateful for

I also recommend an app I use called Brain.FM - this has different modes such as Focus (I use for work). Relax (for unwinding, taking a break, to read or meditate) and sleep mode. Disclaimer this isn’t an ad I just felt it really helped me personally.

My anxiety always used to come in the middle of the night, I’d have bad dreams almost every night and wake up to my heart beating extremely fast and have a million thoughts running through my head! The main thing which helped me to relax and drop back off to sleep was ASMR Ambience videos, due to this a couple of years back I created my own ASMR Ambience channel, I shared it on here once before but only really told friends but if possible would like to help as many people as possible!

My channel is called: Sleep, Relaxation & Zen

Here is a link if you’re interested: https://youtube.com/@sleeprelaxationzen7390

If you are then please subscribe and recommend to anyone you feel could benefit from it! Even if this helps just one person that would be amazing! If you like the idea of the channel but are looking for a certain video which you feel would help then please let me know.

I wish you all the best and hope you find your peace. You’re a warrior so keep your head held high and never give up.",1676167974.0

About a month ago i went trough a breakup and smoked weed. I had what you could call an anxiety attack and developed chest pain. Day later it got triggered after having a fight with my ex and it got severe. Came in waves, constant palpitations, sharp/crushing feeling in left pec, pulse around 90-100, i was not having a panic attack but i was anxious about it. I’d say the pain was a 8.5/10. I had an ECG and they took bloodwork, they said everything seemed fine and sent me home. Since then i’ve been dealing with some heart anxiety (checking pulse at times and so on). 

Eitherway what’s been concering me is that i’ve been able to see my heart forcefully beating in my left pec since then (slightly below to the right of the nipple). The heartbeat causes the left pec to shake and this has been happening on and off during the month. I can see as i would describe as my heart nodding under the skin. This sometimes causes discomfort but not to the same intesenity of pain as i experience a month ago. My pulse is a bit high but below 100. I’ve been feeling lightheaded at time but assumed it anxiety, as well as feeling tired but ive been able to workout (weightlifting) like normal. For those thinking it’s normal palpitations it isn’t. I have a few palpitations a day but this is something that is constant and usually lasts hours.

Is this something i should see a cardiologist about? Do i need to have a chest echo/24h ECG or stress test? Or could i just assume that this is anxiety? I’m worried i’ve developed some typ of arrythima as i have palpitations quite often (more when anxious).

Ik that this post comes across as a bit medical, but i honestly just need to hear some second opinions on this as i’m not sure if it’s normal or not.",1676154116.0

So I have anxiety. I get really anxious at times and its difficult to understand my thoughts or feelings in that moment. 

Lately, from the past 40-45 days I have been feeling really off. I do experience instances when I am feeling low or sad for 2-3 days and it gets better after that. But this time it has been a constant struggle to feel good. I haven’t been able to figure out my emotions, I try to write down how i am feeling but still it feels empty from inside, that feeling i cannot describe or write. 

I will list down a few things that are coming to my mind, that sort of trigger me:

1. Parents fighting with each other almost every other day
2. Almost all my friends have left me
3. I work from home, so i am in my room all day
4. Feeling of not being good enough, comparing myself to other people
5. No one understands me when i try to explain how i am feeling

I am unable to figure out my emotions. These were a few things that I have acknowledged that trigger me but there are a lot of other things which i am not able to comprehend. I make videos on instagram, but from the past one month i have been so demotivated to shoot and post. This is one thing that i love but i just dont feel like doing it anymore. 

I do get suicidal thoughts at times, i feel that if i am not alive, I wouldn’t have to feel all of this. It sucks feeling so sad and depressed every single day. I try to make myself happy but fail every single time. I am ignored at home by my parents so many times and by my friends. I feel so alone and shitty.  

I want to feel better. I hate having this anxiety and depression with no one to understand me. 

I am unable to figure out what the hell is wrong with me.

It’s embarrassing to say how much their presence has an effect on me. They deserve this trip and I’m happy for them but this change has affected my sleep and it worries me. I get sleepy and once it’s time for bed my heart feels like it drops and I get this uneasy feeling and small noises startle me and wake me up. It feels like I don’t get full rest and it’s hard because I feel the urge to sleep but my chest/heart makes itself present. I do miss them but I’m an adult and have to learn to adjust.

I also have some friends who offered some of their medications but I am very anxious of using them without a prescription.

One of my friends has bad panic attacks, and offered me some klonopin, which i know is a benzodiazepine. Does anybody have any experience with this medication?

My other friend takes hydroxyzine for her allergies , since it is an antihistamine but can also be used for anxiety! Does anybody have experience with this medication.

Which one should I use if I get it????

Ps- I went to urgent care and they said they can’t give me anything since I need to go to primary doctor , then I went to my primary doctor and they said I have to make an appointment to see the psychiatrist which would take a whole month but I don’t even have a month .

972,Looking for Advice!!,3,10zbqbj,Anxietyhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/10zbqbj/looking_for_advice/,5,"Hi everyone. Looking for advice here.

32 year old male, persistent anxiety for many years. My main problem is almost immediate diarrhea when presented with new (but totally normal) situations, like taking a trip, going in to town for a ride or going to a meeting with short notice. Think things that most of us do easily on a daily basis - I will feel 100% ok until I walk out the door, then I start to have a very active GI tract...

Often it seems to be associated with traveling / leaving the house, but I don't have any recollection as to why that might be. Also happens a lot with going new places. The day before and morning of a long drive is awful. And most mornings before work. If I get stuck in traffic, it happens 95% of the time. Same with stopping at traffic lights.

Only other symptom is increased heart rate.

No luck on SSRIs (tried many of them)

No success with klonopin

Various other heart rate meds have not helped either.

Counseling hasn't helped (3 years)

Doctors have confirmed it's not dietary or GI-issue related.

I'm not able to go out and enjoy things like I used to be able to do. I cannot attribute this to any particular event. I want to do so much, but my body often says no.

Who has dealt with something similar? What worked for you?

973,Why do I feel like everyone hates me?,2,10zffuj,Anxietyhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/10zffuj/why_do_i_feel_like_everyone_hates_me/,1,"   For the longest time, I have had this deep feeling that everyone secretly hates me. Last year I transferred to a new university as a sophomore and I started making friends pretty easily. Then one day, I had an off interaction with someone that I considered a friend, and now I feel like I can’t interact normally with anyone. 

   It’s like I have this deep feeling of paranoia about how others perceive me. It’s like I feel like there’s something deeply wrong with me at the core of my being that makes me repulsive to others. And I know this isn’t the case, that this stuff is exaggerated in my mind. It’s like my brain is gaslighting me. 

   The smallest behaviors in other people seem to tick off this paranoia. If the energy of a conversation changes, or if someone leaves a message I sent on read, I go into a downward spiral of self loathing and depression. Once my roommate kind of snapped at me for something minor, and I became depressed for weeks on end, and I had thoughts of hurting myself.

   I wish I didn’t care about these thing as much as I do, but I don’t know how to stop thinking these thoughts. It all just hurts so much and I feel like I have no one to turn to.  I feel like if I tell my friends that I do have about how I feel, then they’re going to be offended that I think they dislike me. I just don’t know what to do.

First of all I want to apologize for my English since it is not my first language. And this text has turnt out to be pretty long I’m sorry.
I’ve been suffering from panic disorder since March 22. That was a really stressful time, but this January was even more stressful combined with big life changes etc. 
I was I officially diagnosed with panic disorder last summer, then I went to Therapy and it helped a lot, although it never fully went away. Since last week my mental health is at it’s lowest since I can remember. I think it is because the stress of final exams ( I study architecture) is over and my body needs to get rid of the adrenalin. I genuinely am pretty educated about the psychology of panic attacks, but with a real panic attack, you basically always think you’re about to die and it is the worst feeling imaginable for me. Currently I experience panic attacks daily, sometimes even three times a day. I can’t sleep unless I get drunk or take Benzos ( I still handle these responsibly though). It’s horrible. 
For me the worst symptoms are dizziness, nausea, heart palpitations, the feeling that my heart just stoppt, tingling body parts and the feeling I can’t breathe. These symptoms also appear daily on their own without a full blown panic attack. My body is healthy though. But I still can‘t really believe that the doctors are right about that. I always think something is wrong with me and I’m about to drop dead.
This affects my life dramatically and I hate it. 
On top, I feel really depressed since February, I don’t enjoy anything and have no motivation to do something. My emotional eating has become worse (used to really suffer from disordered eating as well) and my general anxiety (nervous belly, sweating especially before social events) has gotten far worse as well. 
I plan on trying to call another therapist soon because I think my current one has taught me all that she can already.
