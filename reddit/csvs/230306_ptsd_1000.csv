I don’t know what I’m even asking. I’ve had ptsd for 12 years, just diagnosed 8 months ago. On the outside I look successful, have a beautiful, understanding, amazing wife. Great mom and dad, super supportive. For 12 years I’ve been cleaning up my act. From drug addict/alcoholic to sober, exercising, therapy every two weeks, psychiatrist every 3 months. I do everything, all the homework, I’m honest about my entire life with psychiatrist and psychologist. I’m currently almost done cpt with the psychologist, and the psychiatrist has me on Wellbutrin, seroquel, and clonazepam. Truthfully, I just don’t want to be alive anymore. I feel like crying all the time, and all that I ever have, is the HOPE that things might get better. For years I’ve felt suicidal, but I’m always waiting because “there’s hope”, to be hopeful. If I’m being honest with myself I’m out of hope. I’ve been a shell of a person who’s afraid to leave the house for 12 years. I do it, because there’s always “hope” that maybe it will get better one day. It’s never gotten better, I don’t think it’ll get better. 12 years out the window, not knowing what’s wrong, and now knowing what’s wrong, still can’t fix it. My beliefs about others harming me are so deep, I just can’t change them, no matter how many exercises I do on paper. Has anyone ever gotten better? I know there’s no cure, but did life ever become worth living after the trauma. I just want to die all the time, I fantasize about it. Other than guilt, my cats the only thing that really keeps me from just ending it. I just feel hopeless. What’s the point if nothing works? Has anyone found anything that works?

For someone afraid of confrontation, I have this need to confront my abuser. I want to get angry, yell at them. Shame anyone who is currently sympathetic to them. But I can't. Because it would make me a bad person if I went to that petty level. The abuse I've faced eats me up inside every day, and I've heard all the advice I could. 

""Focus on yourself."" ""Keep moving forward."" ""Do some self care.""

I'm not ignoring the advice. It's all reasonable and good. But it feels like no matter how much I practice mindfulness and self care, I'm still stuck with this need to confront my abuser. I want the power that was taken from me. 

Even if it didn't make everything worse for me, would it *really* be better if I got my chance to yell at them? It'd be out of my system, but then what? Any sadness I feel afterward would be frustrating because ""confrontation was supposed to make me feel better."" 

I just hate this feeling of worthlessness. This powerlessness. This.. need to be aggressive toward the person who killed my spirit.

10,jaw issues???,11,11iyke7,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11iyke7/jaw_issues/,18,"I was diagnosed with PTSD around October of this past year. I started having fairly excruciating jaw pain that just got worse in December or so. It was giving me a lot of trouble, I would wake up with throbbing headaches… That would easily last throughout the day. I would wake up in the middle of the night because my jaw would be hurting so much.

And then after about a month and some change, it stopped. Pretty much out of nowhere, suddenly.

I thought it was weird… But I didn’t question it, as it was so painful, why would I question not being in pain anymore? I figured that maybe it was just a temporary thing and I was done with it, it wasn’t a problem anymore. 

well, I woke up yesterday with my jaw hurting again. At least before when I had the flare up, my jaw didn’t pop when I ate/talked. Now it is. I can tell that it’s getting worse, it’s only been another day since it started, but it’s worse than yesterday. And if it follows the same trend that the last flareup did, it will just hurt more and more each day.

I absolutely know I need to go to the doctor, I have a appointment with my PCP this coming week. But my understanding is that this is something that can stem from PTSD. And I really feel like that’s the only thing it can stem from in my case as well. My close friend also has PTSD, and she told me that she deals with jaw issues from her PTSD as well, and that she was told the only treatment for this is a mouthguard. And from the research I’ve done on the Internet, that seems to be the case.

So just to clarify, I’m not really asking about treatment for this, I’m just wondering how common it is for other people like if you experience it. and if it comes in episodes like this for other people… And for those who have had the PTSD diagnosis longer than a year, unlike I have, if this is a “it’s just the reality now” sort of thing aka if this will keep happening. I am also wondering, if anyone has had this in an episodic sort of way, if they notice when/how the onset of this happens. Could it be that something with my PTSD was triggered, and that’s why it started happening again?

19,Everything is confusing,1,11jg4on,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11jg4on/everything_is_confusing/,0,"Around a month or so ago I had an appointment with CAMHS that went on for around four or so hours, a lot of it was spent talking about my trauma. The main things I spoke about were the car crash I was involved in two years ago, the bullying I’ve experienced since I’ve started school, the abuse from my nan, there are some things I wish I had mentioned but I was too scared to. My cousin would continuously hit me and at some point threatened me with a knife to my throat which has caused me to have an overwhelming fear around people holding sharp objects ever since. It doesn’t matter if it’s a knife, scissors or a razor, if I’m not in control of that object I’ll immediately go into flight or fight. I said nothing about this as the only person in real life who knows about this is my friend, I’m 14 now and this happened when I was 8 and. I don’t want to cause any arguments in my family and it isn’t like I can prove it. 

Anyway, the woman I was talking to had me do a CRIES assessment and she said my marks were very high and when I got home I searched stuff up about it and learnt that it’s a brief screening for PTSD. I told my friend about the CAMHS appointment and she said that it won’t be surprising if I do end up finding out I have PTSD, I’ve honestly been suspicious of it for a while now. Most nights I worry about sleeping as I’m worried I’ll have more nightmares, there is a common theme of sharp objects, being screamed at, car crashes and accidents, getting beaten and being unable to fight back, never being strong enough to defend myself, being ignored as if I’m not there, being tortured, I remember I once accidentally fell asleep on the sofa next to my mum after I woke up in the morning when she came in (this is when I used to sleep on the sofa a few months, it went on for two years and it sucked) and I had a dream where she was screaming at me, she wouldn’t acknowledge anything I said, she begun throwing things at me and I all I could do was yell “shut up” in response and I ended up yelling that in real life the second I woke up. She scowled and said “you shut up” and before I could even proceed anything I just started crying, not because she told me to shut up, I just did and I don’t know why. Outside of nightmares there’s the fact that I constantly feel on edge, I always feel like I need to be prepared for something bad to happen. Sometimes this gets so bad that I feel a need to keep a knife on hand incase anything happens. I feel terrified when people raise their voice, even if it’s because they’re happy or even if it’s not directed towards me. Sometimes it reaches a point where I can barely breathe, it happens so often for so many stupid reasons. I cant really go into much more detail currently as Reddit is lagging horribly while typing which is annoying but I will proceed to copy and paste what I’ve written in my notes.

I want to talk to my mum about this as the woman at CAMHS said something about a team that helps with trauma however I may have to do a 10 week thing for anxiety. I want to mention the possibility of PTSD but I’m scared that she’ll think I’m being stupid as I’m 14 and I’m worried that that’s generally how I come off when I speak about this. I don’t want to have PTSD, I just want confirmation as to why I feel like this. I hate it, I hate being left in the dark about this. My mum hasn’t spoken to me about the CAMHS appointment and acts cold when I try to talk to her about it. A week after I had the CAMHS appointment we found out that we’re getting evicted in April I believe which is fucking terrifying. I don’t know how I can get used to anywhere other than this shitty flat I’ve lived in my whole life. I want to stay here with my friend as she’s the only person who I actually see as family. She’s said that if we’re unable to find somewhere to live I can stay with her and if we have to leave the area we’re currently situated in I can live with her, that’s what her and her mum have said. According to my friends tennis coach who used to be a psychiatrist she says that based on what she knows about me it’s likely that I have PTSD based on what she’s been told. She’s also says my mum exudes narcissistic traits which isn’t surprising and it’s another reason as to why I’d like to stay with my friend. All of that is for another time but my best bet is to stay with my friend if all goes wrong. If my mum can’t find somewhere she’ll have to stay with my nan who as I’ve previously said is abusive and thankfully my mum isn’t forcing me to see her, even more so since the CAMHS appointment due to the opinions given by the CAMHS woman. Thanks to everything going on I can’t exactly speak much to my mum as I don’t have a chance as everything is currently busy but I’m worried it’ll still be like this when everything is resolved. I don’t know what to do, everything feels like a mess and I’m not sure how much longer I can cope with it in healthy manners",1678055628.0

21,NSFW: Fatal Accident At Work. TW: sound and blood,70,11icv3b,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11icv3b/nsfw_fatal_accident_at_work_tw_sound_and_blood/,16,"Note: I’m currently speaking with a therapist and we are working on coping techniques for me. I still have a hard time talking about this to anyone at work and I find that speaking with people outside of work is easier. The next two paragraphs are for some context to help you better understand. I’m going to keep other details as vague as I possibly can. 

I worked security for 7 years, went to police academy and failed out 1 week before graduation, and supervised part of a warehouse for almost 2 years. The training and knowledge I have lends itself in the story below. I now rent cars in a very busy operation. 

The parking garage where we rent cars has low clearance and we have our customers sign an addendum stating that they cannot bring large vans inside the garage; they must call 15 minutes prior to arriving and we will meet them and process the return.

One evening a customer brought a van down to the parking garage. Two of our company drivers were trying to move this van out of the garage. One driver decided to go up on the back of the van to check for clearance. The other driver inside must not have seen this and was slowly backing up the van. I was inside our office along with some other coworkers and my supervisor. Myself and two others were watching this unfold and were puzzled. Suddenly, I heard this loud cracking noise and saw the man on the back pinned against the van. It sounded almost like metal getting smacked super hard or the sound of a branch breaking. I soon realized it was the sound of bones breaking. 

The two drivers didn’t see the low support beam. By the time the driver backing up the van heard and saw, it was too late. The man on the back of the van was crushed between the van and the support beam.

I sprinted over to the van and was one of the first ones there. My supervisor arrived shortly after me she and knelt down beside him. The driver on the rear fell down and crumpled onto his side in the recovery position. I don’t remember seeing where the blood was pouring out from, but there was dark red blood on the ground and he wasn’t moving. My training kicked in. 

I directed some bystanders to call 911 and for the now growing crowd of onlookers to get back. Remembering the ABC’s and MARCH, I ran over to where we keep the bleed bag (it was more of a pouch) to see if I could get some hemostatic dressing for the bleeding. Of course, when I got back he hadn’t moved from where he landed. I didn’t see his chest moving and at this point I knew he was dead. 

I don’t remember feeling anything for the next 30 minutes except for a sense of urgency and an eerie calm. To prevent everyone from freezing and panicking, I barked out orders to give everyone clear and concise tasks. While my supervisor was on the phone with emergency services, I redirected all of our operations to prevent people from walking into the scene or witnessing the man on the ground. I checked in on all of my coworkers: 2 were crying uncontrollably in the back room, one was clearly in shock, and one girl asked if he was going to make it. I flatly told her that he was gone and I didn’t think he suffered. 

Police finally arrived after about 5 minutes. We continued with the modified plan until another supervisor arrived on scene and closed the area down.

I was placed at a corner near the scene for the next 4 hours while police closed it off and started their investigation. The feeling of calm and urgency left me when the adrenaline wore off. I was restless and hated faking a smile and pretending nothing happened while I redirected traffic. The feeling soon changed to anger and frustration for not having any new safety policies or trainings after I asked for them 2 months ago.

I was finally able to provide my statement and went home. I went to work the next day and all of upper management was there. After speaking with some on-site counselors, I finally felt the weight come off my shoulders, broke down, and went home. 

I couldn’t sleep for the first two days, I kept seeing it happen over and over again. I spoke to my wife, some friends, and finally got in touch with a therapist. Work transferred me to another location and now I’m trying to move forward. I still have some nightmares and some loud noises still trigger me. 

If you made it to the end of this story, please let me know your coping mechanisms when you get triggered.",1677963091.0

After, he blew up on our friends, texting them ""why'd you tell her?"" and ""you promised me you wouldn't say anything!"" Our friend were shocked about the girlfriend, but no one believed it. It seemed like he made it up because he was too embarrassed to admit he liked me. So I requested to follow him on social media. He left it pending for two weeks before rejecting it. It was then that I knew he really did have a girlfriend, because he clearly did like me, so would he say no? I overreacted, and I blocked him. 

Two months later, they broke up. Literal days after, he started looking at my social media. It's been two years, and he always looks at it. I know that it doesn't mean anything. I get that sometimes people are curious to see what other people are up to, but let me ask you this: if you feel whatever about someone, are you going to be looking at their profiles everyday? I don't forgive him. Not to mention, I feel insecure because I feel like his ex is more attractive because she’s blonde and I’m brown skinned with black hair.",1678056824.0

I just recently spoke to a clinical psychologist who specializes in PTSD. He asked me all about my trauma from my childhood to present. After the assessment/session it triggered an episode for me.

I know triggers are unique to each individual but I can’t seem to figure mine out. All I know is that flashbacks can trigger episodes.

Usually I can tell when an episode is coming. I start to have intrusive thoughts, I start to pace, high agitation, frequent hand washing, then I seem to fall into an ‘alternative reality’ where I feel not safe, unable to trust anyone, it is very real. During these episodes it’s hard to talk to people because of my fear and delusions.

The entire time throughout my childhood I had anxiety and health issues, but my parents wouldn’t take me to see a doctor. Ever…I had scoliosis thanks to my school nurse noticing and she spoke to my parents to take me to a specialist because my curve was pretty bad and that with my young age surgery would benefit me. My dad refused that and instead had a family friend who was a chiropractor. The man would adjust me for free, but he made my pain worse…so bad that there would be days that I couldn’t move my neck, (he also wasn’t actually a chiropractor and inappropriately touched me) my dad didn’t care and I think he knew what he was getting me into and maybe thats why it was free for him. When I told him the chiropractor made me uncomfortable he said I was being ridiculous. 

My father was, and is, an awful human. He is a pedophile, drunk and narcissist. He abused my sister and I. Sometimes he would lock me in small ice coolers when he was drunk, throw me into walls, yank my hair, not let me have locks on my doors, read my diary, log into all my social media accounts and threatened to kill me when angry. He would strangle me when he was mad at my mother and would only stop once she said sorry. 

My mother was an alcoholic who gaslighted me very often, she crumbled what my view of reality was. She also had agoraphobia, paranoia and was extremely mentally abusive. Once I had a kidney infection and was urinating blood, crying and vomiting. She told me if I wasn’t such a whore this wouldn’t happen. My best friends mom who was a doctor came to pick me up and took me to her clinic. She said I almost died and was glad I called her. She hated my parents and wanted me to live with her, but trying to fight that would have been too dangerous at the time. My dad was too unpredictable. 

I developed endometriosis when I was about 13, (i wasn’t officially diagnosed until a few years ago but had all the symptoms) I would soak through ten pads a day and curl over, black out and moan from the pain and feel exhausted, but my mom said that was normal. She fat shamed me, didnt believe me when I told her about my dad abusing me, pulled me out of high school junior year, and forbid me from seeing my friends because I treated them like my family. I found an online high school program and secretly finished my degree. I got scholarships and wanted to study in college, I qualified for financial aid because we were under the poverty level. I had to get a parent to cosign and my mother wouldn’t cosign financial aid for me to duel enroll in college. She wouldn’t let my dad either. I knew where she kept IRS documents and stole them, forged her signature and enrolled. 

I finally turned 18 and moved in with some friends…my dad found out where I lived and would show up often, sometimes to bring me food from friends or try to convince me to come back home.

I refused and one day woke up dizzy, wheezing, pain, unable to walk with a fever of 101. My father showed up to my house again told me it was probably something I exposed myself to it by changing my flat tire on my vehicle…both my parents wouldn’t let me tell anyone that I was sick and on the brink of death. I obviously defied those demands and contacted my best friend’s mother who was a doctor. She picked me up from my house, had to carry me to her car and brought me to her clinic, she tested me for toxins and it was positive for arsenic. My mother found the chemicals my dad had hidden away in a cabinet and later told me when the diagnosis came out. My fingernails fell off! My bffs doc let me live with her while I healed. It took 3 months to rid it all from my system. To this day I wonder if it triggered any of the issues I have today. This also made me fail college. 

To this day I believe a mix of my genetics, environment and mental anguish caused irreversible damage to my mind and body. I have panic disorders and multiple diseases.",1677979624.0

One group are all the people I met when i was very messed up and untreated. They still have severe problems involving drugs, alcohol, and suicide. I can understand them emotionally but i can't connect anymore because my life is too put together for that type of chaos, so I stay away. On the other hand I have friends at school that are regular people with regular lives. Basically they're normal and because of that they can never understand what I've been through and how it impacted me. I have to constantly mask my symptoms to make them comfortable and I feel uncomfortable and afraid to be judged, so interacting there is also a tiring and stressful experience. Mostly because their stress tolerance is so low. I care about these people and love some of them but i do not feel like they can truly love me or truly care about me enough to accept me if they ever saw my symptoms.I can't help but feel they just tolerate me.

I would have areas of my body hurt days after (like a sore bruise) yet there wouldn’t be a huge visible spot. 

My mum on the other hand has very very sensitive and fragile skin. She medically has some sort of iron haemoglobin issues that means sometimes bruises randomly appear on her body and a single scratch on her skin can take days to be gone (she is very prone to bruising unlike me) 

Recently I’ve been starting to fight back the abuse. I was twisted and pinned into this wall. She was so much stronger. Her adult force on me was far more than my force on her. The only thing I could use were my nails to grab at her arm. I finally freed myself and had two welts across my face along with the inside of my cheeks blistered because of how hard she pressed them (hurting consistently for three days now). The welts went away in two hours. My glasses were so badly twisted from the impact that I had to take a screwdriver and tools to actually bend them back into place. Yet all the evidence on my body was gone within two hours. Now there are invisible parts that still ache when touched. (Appear weirdly with a blue undertone when pressed under heavy light)

tw: mentions of rape and discussing the mental state I was in

So for context: I'm 20f, bi, demisexual (ace spectrum), I'm single and nor interested in anyone right now, also can't and won't do hook ups due to being demi. I was raped three years ago, diagnosed with PTSD and taking meds. I'm in therapy, but I don't have money to do it as frequently as I want to

And pease, try to be nice, I'm doing good right now, otherwise I wouldn't post it, but I still can get triggered if you start to blame me for not saying no and stuff during the thing, my brain just did what it had to do to survive and god knows what would've happened if it didn't. And also please leave out judgment about my sexuality and discussions whether or not ace/bi ppl exist. Thank you

So I realize it's not a pressing issue right now, but it will be someday and I want to have advice on what to do in that case.

I was raped by the man and I'm bi, so I thought I won't have an issue with it when it comes to women, but I do. I had my girlfriend (girl who is a friend, yeah) interested in me, we were at a bar and at one point went to the bathroom to vape a little bit. I wasn't drunk, she was kinda a bit at that point. She confessed she had feelings for me and started touching me and stuff, we never actually did anything and she is a survivor herself, so she made it very clear that I can say no at any point. Nevertheless I froze. I couldn't say to her that I didn't want it for a couple of minutes. I just went back to that state, ""mb if I just wait and don't do anything, they eventually will get bored and just leave me alone"". I just started dissociating from my body a bit and was prepared to wait it out, but I managed to pull myself back into reality and told her to stop. And she did. We talked about it, I said I don't like her romanticaly, therefore I don't want to do anything sexual with her, she understood and we still talk like friends. 

But the coming back to the state I was in really scared me. I had flashbacks to rape the next day. I never want to feel like that again, but I understand I most likely will. And also I read one post here and ppl were discussing in the comments how much stronger men can be than women, I just also afraid that if I fall in love with a guy, I'd be too scared to have sex with him ever. I don't ever want to feel helpless. Even if they give me explicit permission to say no, I now know that I can still freeze and dissociate and it is difficult to pull myself out of it, it's like you just want everything to be over, you don't feel there at the moment, you just think if you wait they finally will leave you be. 

I also knew my rapist and were in love with him before rape (luckily, once I've realized what happened, it just disappeared immediately. Even before I realized), it was a long process of him violating my boundaries over one year period. So I don't trust my judgement when I fall in love, even though I knew it wasn't healthy and broke it off before rape myself. And I just feel like I can't trust myself anymore, especially when it comes to men. I fall in love really-really rarely and with ppl of different genders, I don't have many experience bc of it. 

I understand that this issue almost likely can be resolved only with a partner and I'm not even in love with anybody right now, but it is bothering me in the present moment and having information makes me calmer. Also, mb there is something I can do right now to prevent this from repeating? 

I'd be really grateful for your thoughts on this or if you can just say smth nice😅",1677949040.0

im a cis (or something) woman for context.

my sexual trauma starts when i was as young as 5, but continues throughout my entire life, mostly in the way of being groomed. groomed unknowingly by adults, groomed by men who wanted to take advantage of me, groomed by society. being hypersexual my whole life i think as a response to trauma. its too much to get into and this isnt therapy so i dont want to get into it but. i cant even masturbate most of the time because it makes me feel disgusted to think about touching myself. i cant think about sexual things, can't think about having sex with my boyfriend, sometimes i don't even want him to touch me. i tried to give him a blowjob a couple weeks ago and had to stop because i felt like i was going to pass out or throw up. this started last winter and has just gotten worse and worse and worse over the last year. i thought i just had low libido because i was stressed. ive even questioned if im actually asexual. but i want to have sex, i want to feel close to my partner.

it's even affected my gender expression in a way, feeling disgusted by the way other people look at me.

it just started in the last year, i used to be such a sexual person, i loved sex, i loved talking about sex, i loved taking nudes, i loved sexting, anything sexual was like a core part of my personality. in a way im glad its not anymore. its gotten to the point where i feel like sex hurts my soul. i feel like sex is a waste of time. i told my boyfriend i dont want to have sex anymore because im ""depressed"" and it ""feels wrong"" which is true but i think the full berth of it that im not telling him is more grim.

i googled why i might feel guilty for masturbating and an article came up talking about ""if you masturbate you'll learn how to make your partner feel better too!"" and felt sick to my stomach. i thought ""fuck making my partner feel good."" after being groomed and used for so long i dont fucking care about making anyone cum. fuck you.

I love my friends and family, and I wish I could see them and not feel scared. I can’t even enjoy music, and usually all I do is listen to music. I have never felt so unlike myself and so confused. I guess I’m just needing to know that I’m not alone in this. Engaging with these posts has really helped me. Thank you to everyone posting and for reading this. I have support and professionals in my life, so I will make it through, but I’ve been glad to find this group. :)",1677972211.0

For context: my dad is 44
Onto the question: 
I was in the car with my dad yesterday after he picked me up from campus to go home for the weekend, and he told me that what happened to me wasn’t traumatic, but rather (in his mind), an experience, I was held against my will by an ex-roommate for 2-ish minutes after I had told him to back off (by the right push handle of my wheelchair) while I tried to get away from him. I have PTSD from the incident (diagnosed by my school therapist), how do I get my dad to understand that it is trauma?

My parents bought a ticket to travel to Turkey. One of my biggest triggers for PTSD is to do with the fact my main abuser was Middle Eastern.

Turkey is not as Middle Eastern as, say, Iran, but still I'm getting mad anxiety as it is just thinking about it.

The trip is in June and my parents don't mind if I refund the ticket. But I feel like I may let them down and miss out.

At the same time, its only been a year since diagnosis/PTSD developed and I still struggle with strongly linked triggers. I have learned to deal with most triggers but the thought of being in a place that's alien to me and reminds me constantly of the abuser.

Its hard thinking about it. I don't know if I feel comfortable being in that country knowing I could flashback or panic attack any moment- and how is that dealt with over there?

Im seriously considering cancelling the plane ticket, or talking with my therapist on Tuesday.

Either way, does anyone have experience jn this kind of actuation?

I’m currently at school, where some really unlucky bad stuff happened that makes it really hard for me to feel safe here. I find myself often struggling with staying present due to a lot of flashbacks, overthinking/anxiety, but also trouble thinking. 

It has manifested a lot in social interactions. For example, I went to the aquarium yesterday with a friend and could not focus on actually looking at the fish and instead was in my head, and I know it seemed to my friend that I was just bored and disinterested. Today he texted me a joke about fish and it took me a good bit to remember we even went to the aquarium. Beyond this example, my anxiety/flashbacks has definitely made me less aware, withdrawn, and less fun to be around which has negatively impacted my relationships.

It was the scariest experience I’ve had, and I haven’t been able to go to any public areas without thinking about it since then.

Today I (21) was sitting in class and we are currently discussing the topic mental health and especially depression. We were watching a movie about a young girl who survived suicide and she talked about being bullied in the past amongst other things.

I am a lesbian and have homophobic parents, so I went through a shitload of homophobia and emotional abuse after I had come out of the closet when I was 15; I was rejected by my parents for who I am. I have nearly no memory of my life before that, so I always thought this was the point where me being traumatized really started, which lead to my mental health issues now.

Suddenly while I‘m sitting in class today I had the most random flashbacks, remembering I was bullied intermittently between ages 12-15, remembering I had my first serious suicidal thoughts before I turned 13 (like goddamn I was really so young?); remembering how I felt incredibly alone and emotionally abandoned by my parents to the point my dance teacher became more of a parent figure to me than my actual parents ever were at age 15. Remembering I had no real friends at all before turning 16. 

I literally forgot all of this and it really baffled me how this suddenly came back; I kind of can’t imagine I really went through all of this? I‘m at a way much better point mentally now gladly and I also have a healthier relationship to my parents. 

But like, do you ever realize “holy shit my childhood really was that bad so it makes sense I turned to be fucked up like this today“?
How do you deal with painful memories like these? I mean, I guess it shaped me into the person I have become today, and I certainly grew from it, but holy shit I wished I could go back to my 14 year old self and give them the biggest fattest hug ever. This person felt so lonely for so many years. Like how did I even survive this lmao

I used to get physically abused pretty frequently. Because of that I had a constant sense of threat. I used to react more explosively to any possible insult or offense I felt when I was at school. Now I look back and it makes complete sense why I was the kid who’d get into the most aggressive verbal arguments with others. 

I even got in trouble for physical fights which were pretty rare. I was always so skeptical of other kids. That’s why a lot of other kids, despite developing a liking for me at first ended up hating me by the end.

I recently read in the book The Body Keeps the Score, “Abused children are very sensitive to changes in voices and faces, but they tend to respond to them as threats rather than cues for staying in sync unlike securely attached children who learn to be in tune with other people and notice changes in voices and faces to adjust their behavior so they can be a valued member of society. 

This is one of the reason abused kids become so easily defensive or scared. Imagine what it’s like to make your way through a sea of faces in the school corridor, trying to figure out who might assault you. Children who overreact to their peers’ aggression, who don’t pick up on other kids’ needs, who easily shut down or lose control of their impulses are like to be shunned and left out of sleepovers or play dates”",1677900841.0

Well, this may be long and jumbled but I will try my best to explain everything. I'd love have someone read this but I understand if it's too long. So, I've struggled with depression, anxiety, and OCD since I was 8 years old. I was diagnosed with all three early on in life. I am currently 24 and was diagnosed with PTSD 3 years ago from a lot of stressful events that happened around 5 years ago and some stuff in between. I'm a very sensitive person. I feel everything. My senses get overloaded easily. Etc. I've had sleep issues ever since I was 13. They seem to be getting weirder and more stressful as I get older and more stressed. So around December I got covid. It triggered an OCD spiral that I couldn't get out of and essentially it created a lot of associations and flashbacks of things that happened 5 years ago. I haven't had emotions tied to my trauma ever. Until recently in December. It hit me suddenly and I began to spiral with flashbacks, panic attacks, losing weight, shaking everyday, not sleeping, etc etc. I was a complete wreck. I would shake all day long. Get no sleep. Cry all day. Get flashbacks non stop. Panic all day. Etc. once this started consistently going on all day everyday, my derealization/depersonalization kicked in really badly. My depression got insanely bad to the point I felt ready to k!ll myself. I gasped for air before falling asleep everynight, I have nightmares, bad dreams, wake up every hour confused and disoriented. I'll wake up feeling so dark and depressed like my world is crashing. Like a huge dark cloud is over me. Everything feels distant and fake and dark. Even thinking about my parents or sister or my house, it all feels dark and fake and I don't know why. I have racing thoughts before falling asleep. These thoughts are jumbled and don't make sense or have any correlation to reality. I fall asleep and within an hour I'm tossing and turning and half awake half asleep. While I wake up these times throughout the night I wake up feeling disoriented and saying and thinking random shit that seems like an alternate reality. I keep feeling the same feeling as it happens like every night now. How my night of sleep goes, bleeds into my day. Throughout the day I'll remember what it was like to feel confused and disoriented thinking weird thoughts that make no sense. It takes me back to how I felt in those moments and it freaks me out and makes me really depressed. I know a lot of these weird symptoms happen only surrounding sleep but it feels like psychosis or something during those times at night bc it's so confusing and disorienting. I hate feeling out of control. I have a fear of going crazy. During the day, my senses are heightened and pick up on everything. I feel groggy all day. Sleep deprived. Not thinking straight. Depressed as hell. Everything feels dark. All the symptoms of DR/DP. I have a hard time eating. I panic non stop. I had to stop my life lately (I can't work, go to the gym, hang with friends, drive, leave the house, etc). I've been to two psych inpatient units bc of how out of control I felt. I lost 12 pounds from my stress. I am already light weight so it's detrimental. 110lbs down to 97/98. Was able to bring it back up a little bit but it's a battle. I don't have an eating disorder. Anxiety just hits me in my stomach. All day long I suffer ocd intrusive thoughts and have rituals and compulsions. I feel crazy and alone. I over analyze everything I feel or think bc of my fear of losing touch with reality. I am nervous I have irreversible brain damage from all the stress. I know writing this doesn't capture what really has been going on and I understand that. I just want to know if anyone has every felt so stressed that every second of the day and night, they are bombarded by mental issues? Strange sleep issues, panic, depression, feeling of darkness, DR/DP symptoms, racing thoughts, senses heightened, weird feelings u can't explain, etc. idk. It's so hard to explain.",1677926861.0

My PTSD comes from street violence, War, and my job in a violent field.  Here is what has helped me. Brief bio: Combat Vet, work in mental health field.

Your healing is a journey, and may not be quick. It takes dedication and good support along the way (friends/family/therapy). If you don't have family support, groups can help.

After the first tip, not necessarily in order. I do highly recommend the first:

1. Having a therapist, one I trust and feel comfortable with. You don't need to open up, immediately, but you should feel comfortable with them. The therapist could be male, female, trans, younger/older, whatever you feel safe with. If you don't connect to them after a time, feel free to ask for a change, or make the change yourself.
2. Know where to get help (quickly, if needed). Here in NY, people can get help faster if they visit urgent mental health care facilities, or emergency rooms. You should not have to pay out of pocket. If you have no insurance, there are places that do sliding scales.
3. Medications: finding the right fit, dosages, and if there are side effects. Medication effectiveness can change over time, however.
4. Arts: I do photography and writing, but any art may help you. 
5. Exercise; gym, cardio, yoga. I find Yoga and Jiu Jitsu help a great deal.
6. Mediation (guided, mindfulness, Transcendental, etc.)
7. Exploring different types of therapy; DBT, CBT, drug and alcohol treatment, group therapy, psychedelic-assisted treatment, and marijuana.

You can't likely do all of these at once if you have a busy lifestyle. Mixing and matching may be a good option.  I am not saying this would work for all of you, but it's worth a shot if you haven't tried some of it.

I was terrified to go because when I was a kid my mom let the nurses and doctors SA me in exchange for prescription drugs and i get very triggered now. I haven't seen a doctor except once since i was a kid and i have avoided all health related stuff until now.

  So i went to the cardiologist and i went back and got weighed, the nurse took me into one of the rooms and took and EKG and stuff, then started with the weird.

Nurse - ""You know your very young to be in here, im much older than you""

Me - ""okay... how old."" 

N- ""42""

She then starts asking about my drug use, i tell her i used many things (i wont list all) but im sober now. She keeps asking for more details, keeps asking why i would use XYZ drug. Her tone felt evil and at this point I have a bad feeling. 

 She sits down while im still on the bench thing and starts reading my file;

N - "" anxiety, i have that too. depression, okay. PTSD? How is your relationship with your parents?""

Me - "" I dont talk to them anymore.""

N- ""why not?""

Me - "" They abused me and are severe drug addicts""

N - "" Oh im sure they mean well, my dad is a drug addict""

Me - "" No, I dont want to talk to them or have them in my life""

&#x200B;

At this point im dissociating so hard i stop seeing color and the walls are swirling and melting

 N - ""Okay your heartrate is ---/---""

Me - ""okay what does that mean?""

N - "" I dont know, ask the doctor when he comes in here, (aggressively) what were the numbers?!""

Me - "" Im not sure im heavily dissociated""

N - "" Okay we need you to focus, we need you to pay attention so we can help you.""

Me - "" I cant really help it, im trying my best""

N - ""Try harder, you have to actually try""

&#x200B;

Now im fucking pissed and i can literally feel my heart twitching and i lock eyes with her with a scowl

N - ""(sweet motherlike voice) Hey no-one is going to fuck with you, the doctor takes care of me and my grandma, hes really great!"" 

She also kept saying how hot it was in the room, it was cold if anything, but she asks me to move and sit on the chairs so she can get on top of the table i was sitting at and she stands on top if it to mess with a vent on the ceiling, then leaves the room. 

She comes back and sits in the chair next to me and hands me a glass of water, puts her arm around me and starts rubbing my back and says;

N - "" so why dont you like nurses?""

Me - "" I said my parents were drug addicts, i was payment most of the time""

N - ""Oh""

Nurse then immediately gets up and walks away, gets the doctor and I dont see her again.

It has been weeks since it happened but i have night terrors again and ive been hallucinating really bad again, i cant stop replaying it in my head.

My past response is to completely shut down and isolate for days to over a week. Then put out the fires I made by doing so. 

I used all my willpower to notify my professor just so she is aware and I will be in class online next day. It took 5-10 minutes to do that, but wow felt like eternity. Kept typing then deleting. Knew I was just going to spiral and if continues I'll end up just not saying anything. So caught myself and just hit sent. (it was so badly written, but my professor replied immediately and said its okay and not to worry)

  I even had someone reach out and ask if I was okay. I of course didn't respond, but that text did help snap me out enough to do some self care/love.

  I made some comfort food, and mellowed out alone. 
In the morning I tried to attend class, but due to storm wifi kept going out. I just want to shut down, this is some bs... I have no reception so second I had wifi for a min I ask my professor to record the lecture and apologize. Again she says not to worry and will record it.

  I just lay in bed and try not to spiral. I can't drive anywhere cus not in the right mental state and its raining hard. So here I am alone with my thoughts and little to no distractions...

  IDK, I just kept telling myself ""action leads to feeling"" and I got up after a few hours to force myself to do some mundane tasks.  I found doing tasks that require no thought paired with focusing intensely on my breathing seems to work well.

  What I do: Think and say outload ""Inhale (as I inhale through my nose)"" *pause*  ""exhale (as I exhale through my mouth with slightly pursed lips. kind of like an O)"" The pause is like with windshield wipers. very brief. 

  I do this as I dry/wash some dishes, pick up cloths, scrub the stove, recycle the accumulated plastic bottles.

 It varies, could be 5 minutes or 30 minutes later. This isn't enough and intrusive thoughts start flooding in more. The second I notice this I add more to the breathing. On inhale I consciously expand my stomach as for out as it goes, on exhale I deflate it as much as I can, like I am trying to pull my bellybutton to my back/spine.

  When I can do this with little to no thought, I add to it again. This time imagining a wave like motion. As I inhale the wave comes down the back of my stomach deep into in my belly. As I exhale the wave comes up as my belly button pulls to my back and out my mouth.

I do this and keep doing no thought tasks. I honestly am unaware of time when I do this. My body is constantly moving and I am so focused on breathing my brain doesn't have a chance to even think about anything else.  
  
  .

  What happens is this: 
  
   While cleaning and focusing so hard on my breathing I feel like I am completely unaware of time. There is no before, there is no after. All I see is this stove that with every scrub, every wipe is becoming cleaner and cleaner

  at some point while cleaning the stove my eyes search for more grime or whatever to clean and my eyes start rapidly moving all over looking for more to clean. When it can't find anything it snaps me out of the cleaning/breathing state I was in.

  Maybe 5 minutes passed, maybe 30 or 1 hour. It doesn't matter. Here I am now in the aftermath of what felt like eternity while doing it, feeling a bunch of things.
  Things like: happy/accomplished as I look at a now clean stove. conflicted because its over and I am now ""back to reality."" 

  Since I was/am in a hypervigilant state, taking in everything I possibly can and it is a new memory my brain just starts replaying it over and over again (like how when I get triggered and relive a flashback).  

  So what am I now reliving what feels like 10 or 100 times every second now?  Me cleaning a stove. Feels like it will never end. I tell myself with every wipe or scrub it becomes slightly cleaner. That there is only X or a finite amount to clean. Logic and reasoning have no place here to me. cognitive dissonance kicks in. My brain rejects all log/reason and I genuinely feel like that no matter what I do this stove will never be cleaned. 
  But here I am staring with my own eyes at a clean stove and touching it with my fingers. I kind of have a ""huh"" moment. This felt like eternity, but had an end, ""when have I experienced this before?"" My brain feels like its being overclocked as it scans through a lifetime of memories and brings them all up at once. ""dang, this has happened a lot actually... Like thousands of times."" 

  I can feel my emotional state shift as my brain is forced to comes to terms with it being wrong earlier and I actually feel disappointed lol. I end up feeling the need to comfort my own brain and tell myself ""its okay, these things happen."" 

  I just kind of accept that all of this (the episode, feeling like there is no before or after and stuck reliving traumas or unpleasant memories) was not the first time and it will probably happen again in the future, it is just a part of my life, something I cannot change and that is okay, because one day this too will end. 
  What I can change is my response to it. I know if I do nothing I will just keep spiring, isolate, push everyone and everything away until I do something, anything positive and come out of it. 
So of it doesn't matter if I delay doing it by weeks, years, or a few hours, I'll have to eventually come out of it. Past experience has taught me that.
   So I choose to sit with it for a few hours in real life, experience my traumas, relive them for a bit (yeah it was my personal hell, I was treated horribly, and I get angry/sad but at the same time kind of feels ""safe"" or comforting in a weird way). Then I get happy and smile because if I am reliving the traumas, that means I am no longer in those times now. 

  Yeah no shit it would be amazing if the traumas never happened to begin with, but guess what? If I never went through it I'd be a completely different person. This is all a part of me and what makes me who I am. I struggled hard with finding meaning from all this. I spent about 10 years going through everything over and over again. I know how it all happened, what I or others could/should have done differently. In their minds they did what they thought was best/right at the time. I said everything I wanted to say to them. 

  My peace is this ""Everyone tries their best, and that is all anyone can do."" Not best as in for a very specific thing, but best as in overall with everything considered. 

  Like how someone has a long day at work and is too exhausted to cook so they snack on chips or eat fast food. It was the best they can do at the time. yeah sure maybe they could push harder and cook or make healthier options. But they didn't so their best at the time was fast food. Maybe years later they they have health problems from all the fast food, and keep doing it. Still their best. Maybe one day they spend a few seconds considering a healthier option, then eat the same amount. Those few seconds of even considering a healthier option is the best they can do that day. In my mind just because one can physically do more, does not mean they aren't doing their best. 

  I am starting to go off tangents lol. I have a strong urge to delete this and not even post it. In the past I would try to go back, revise, make it as good as I possibly can, prolly spiral. Then not even post it it cus ""what's the point?"" or if I do post it, I'd feel like I have to upvote and reply to every comment because I know I can do it so if I don't then I'm not doing my best. 
  But that isn't right, posting this as is, is my current best. Maybe    I reply to 1 or 2 comments, maybe I do reply to all of them. Or maybe I reply to none and delete this in the future. Whatever I do end up doing, I now know and accept is/will be my best.",1677883966.0
64,Do you keep yourself awake because you know sleep will be worse?,3,11hlmar,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11hlmar/do_you_keep_yourself_awake_because_you_know_sleep/,5,"I am exhausted. I have two young kids, I work full time and I am pretty much always physically and mentally tired. But most of it is self-inflicted. I know that if I fall asleep I’ll have horrible, panic filled nightmares. 

Some are indirect. Memories recovered from the recesses of my mind and contorted by my subconscious into a bizarre dream that leaves me confused and anxious. I know it is some sort of subconscious interpretation of past events, dreamified to the point of weirdness. My trauma twisted into something more like scenes from a fantasy film than my actual life. 

In some ways these types of nightmares are worse. I feel unsettled, anxious and frightened, and yet I have no idea quite *why*. I am left feeling that sense of dread and unease over the past and the future, but I can’t even properly identify the trigger for my restlessness. 

Others are direct. A flashback in dream form. I either watch events unfold, as a passive observer, or else I am in the scene, taking part and reliving it. I don’t know how to act when I am involved in the scene. I feel all the emotions of the time, but an elation that I’m getting a second chance. I vow to do things better this time, but the outcome is always the same. The despair is crushing. And I scream and scream, and apparently it comes out in real life, because I wake up my wife and kids with it. But I am stuck in the nightmare and I can’t escape. Sometimes I know it’s a dream, other times not, but I always feel the panic and claustrophobia rising in my chest. 

These dreams make me feel crushed. The band around my chest gets tighter, and I feel like none of my breaths are deep enough. I do have a lot of flashbacks anyway, but there is something so immersive about the dreams, I feel like they’re a worse form of torture. The pit in my stomach deepens and fills with the emotion awakened by the dream. Despair, guilt, anger, sadness, dread, regret, panic. They suffocate me. Every single night. And I’m sick of it. I HATE it. 

I’m exhausted, I desperately crave sleep. And yet I intentionally keep myself awake, scrolling through my phone, reading, anything to stop myself from drifting off. It is so unfair that sleep is a necessity. It’s so frustrating that the restorative powers of sleep are overwhelmed by the crap that goes along with it. I could be so much better as a parent, husband, brother, better at my job and happier, if I could just rest. But I’m standing in my own way, because I HAVE to, to avoid the nightmares. I just want to weep sometimes, it makes me so angry and sad and I feel like I’m failing my wife and kids by being a sleep-deprived zombie. But being woken up by my screams is probably worse. It is the choice between a punch in the face and a kick in the balls.",1677893545.0

Lately when I hear about a big change in someone else’s life (marriage, pregnancy, moving etc) I feel overwhelmed and can’t cope. 

It’s like I’m unable to process or cope with hearing others lives changing. I don’t know if it’s sadness that my life didn’t work out. I don’t know it’s that my brain can’t comprehend the time that’s passed. I don’t know if it’s that I am not prepared or expecting for the change. 

I don’t understand why I feel this way. But no one understands. The way I remember things up to the trauma is the way I want things to stay. It’s particularly hard when a cousin tells me they are having a baby. Because I’m supposed to be happy for them and instead I just fele immensely sad and confused and upset. 

It’s like I just want life to go back to the way I remember it. It’s just too upsetting to not be able to move on or understand who I am.

67,TW — PTSD has ruined my life. (Just venting),2,11hl81r,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11hl81r/tw_ptsd_has_ruined_my_life_just_venting/,1,"***Very big TW for many things***

Throwaway because god forbid anyone find out who I am. I'm rambling a lot in this because I'm in the middle of an anxiety attack and am extremely sad, so I apologize and thank you very much if you even read this through

PTSD from a past relationship has completely fucking ruined my life.

Last year, after a few experiences in my life with abusive people, I got into another abusive relationship. Except in this one, they love bombed me and raped me almost every day for nearly two months.

I had to drop out of university. My parents used that as an opportunity to tell me they won't be supporting me financially any more (especially since I won't be doing 5 classes per semester when I do rejoin. I'll be doing 3 as that is what is best for my mental health). I accepted a part-time job that leaves me mentally exhausted because I have not had a routine in MONTHS and desperately needed it (I am autistic and have ADHD). Since I dropped out, I lost access to my bus pass. I was borrowing a friend's, but somehow I lost it and my friend says they don't have time to make an appointment to get a new one (I said I'd fully pay for the replacement). I can't afford to take the bus by paying out of pocket, and the low-income pass is still way too god damn expensive. I *definitely* won't qualify for disability, despite the amount of shit I have going on that constitutes as a disability, so I can't get the disability pass either. I can barely afford my rent, personal needs, phone bill, etc. I am trying to rely on $40 gift cards from my university's sexual assault support centre, but with the state of our economy, it doesn't exactly help. I can't find another full-time job because no one will hire me as I am now newly 20 years old without a license and I have no qualifications/important experience. My autism and ADHD make it not possible to get a retail or food-related job as it would lead me to become suicidal again, so that's not helping in finding a job. I also just need a job that doesn't require me to travel by bus, but that's next to impossible when living out of the city. My 20th birthday was also definitely the worst birthday I've had in my life. My 18th and 19th were spent in quarantine, my 19th being forgotten by almost everyone except for one of my long distance friends and my parents. At least this year only one person forgot, but I didn't get to see my dad because I had to work that day (my dad is my best friend and since the PTSD started, not being able to be at home with him and my dog in an environment I feel safe and secure in, and I know, is indescribably difficult). Two of my friends wanted to do something with me for my birthday because they forgot last year, but then one of them forgot it was my birthday until two weeks later AGAIN, and the other never brought it up so I never did anything for my birthday. In casual conversation when I reminded my one friend who never brought up celebrating, they said that I just need to find things to do by myself and I have never wanted to scream at someone so badly lmfao

I hate my life and I hate myself for so many things. My list of regrets is so long that it 's choking me. I am doing CPT, but CBT is not made for neurodivergents, so it's honestly a living hell most of the time, despite somehow making progress.

I also feel the need to explain that I know I am privileged in terms of my financial situation with my parents if I wasn't in my current circumstances. They just sprung it on me at an *extremely* distressing moment and my mother is *not* a good mother, so she presented (and still does) the situation inappropriately/unfairly. They pressured me to get a job in high school, but I was severely mentally unstable at the time, meanwhile very occupied with a gifted arts program.",1677892505.0

Hi, this is my first post here so I’m not really sure how to go about this, but a little warning if you don’t wanna be triggered I just need advice. This also might be a long story. I went through something traumatic a little over a year ago where my sisters pitbull that she had for 4 months mauled our family cat of 16 years. My mom & I were in the middle of this attack to the point where I had bite marks on my hands from my cat & the dog. My cat had her bones and neck broken & she died on my lap when I finally got her out. I ended up going to the hospital bc 
 fingers were so messed up & losing an entire nail. My best friend had to drive me there and had to help me bathe the next day bc I wasn’t able. She had to take out my dead cats fur out from my hair. So naturally I had really bad ptsd after all this happened from the smell of death, to the noises, & seeing it repeatedly. I used to scream myself hoarse from how bad it got. I still can’t sleep over the nightmares I have of being attacked and my cat being attacked almost every other day. It also took almost an entire year for my fingers  to heal completely. I still have pain from my fingers doing everyday tasks. They said it was an accident & that no one saw it was coming as of if my warnings for weeks didn’t matter. They called me selfish & a brat bc I didn’t accept or like the dog. My mom said that it’s in a dogs instinct to attack as if that justifies this situation. My mom has forgiven her & is trying to get me to forgive her to bc this hurts my sister too. Yet she did nothing to help the situation. I  can’t forgive her bc she ended up keeping the dog that did all of this. I felt extremely disrespected & hurt from this decision bc it was like she chose a dog she had for 4 months over me & our cat. It also sucks bc the dog is named after my birth stone so that’s completely ruined for me besides the point. My sisters wedding is coming up in a few weeks & my family is trying to force me to go & guilt trip into going cause they want me to be there. I don’t know what to do cause I have absolutely no relationship with my sister. I also don’t want to go to a party & celebrate two people who caused me an extreme amount of pain and who made these decisions of getting & keeping the dog even after all this happened I don’t know what to do & I’m extremely hurt. I never had a good relationship with my sister & to me this was the last straw for me to try & salvage any kind of relationship with her. I keep crying bc I would love to see all my family bc I don’t see them very often & to be able to dress up in a fancy dress. Other than that I’d be completely miserable the whole time and be looked at like I’m the problem at the party. I’m so tired so If anyone has any advice for me please.

This relationship ended about four years ago but I’m still healing from it; he threatened to kill me and on one occasion held a knife to me. But he would also sexually abuse me, do things to hurt me and then laugh when I cried, would threaten to break up with me unless I dropped everything and made myself sexually available to him whenever he wanted (even in the middle of the night—we didn’t live together either). 

So I’ve been working on healing. I feel like I’ve made good progress. The last two years I’ve been dating someone new who is amazing and thoughtful and patient and kind. The only problem is that while our sex life started off as very healthy, the pas few months, I’ve started to feel really guilty and ashamed about any sexual thoughts or acts. It’s killed my sex drive, I feel so uncomfortable and anxious about the idea of sex. There’s been a slow decline in the amount of sex we have. We have started seeing a couple’s sex therapist together.

However, last night he told me that if our counselor doesn’t have any advice for us in our session today, that he was going to ask me if we can be polyamorous. He said he’s miserable and he can’t stand himself now because he thinks about sex constantly and masturbation isn’t enough. I feel so guilty, like I’m not enough, and I’m doing a bad job and failing him as a partner.

So I’ve always had very bad nightmares. They’re usually always related to my traumas. 
I also remember my dreams (sometimes to a point where I’m not sure if it actually happened or if I dreamt it - even with every day basic stuff) I barely ever forgot them.

I’ve taken prescription medication in the past to help me sleep which was always great. However my GP won’t keep me on them due to the fact you can develop a dependency on them. I’ve also taken illegal (illegal in Australia anyway…) drugs to help me sleep but I don’t want to continue that. Both of these options help me to NOT dream which is what I want basically.

So the alternative for me was Melatonin. It was great at the start however now I’m getting the typical fucked up nightmares with them. They’re renown for their nightmares so this sort of defeats the purpose. 
I woke up at 3am this morning from one of my usual bad nightmares & refused to go back to sleep (even though I’m drowsy from the melatonin).

Has anyone else experienced this? Or have any recommendations for me?

I stayed at that facility for 9 fucking months practically for nothing, 6 of those months was just me waiting for a program like that to open up so i wouldn't have to be in contact with my abusive mother or neglectful father any more. Now that my only clear chance of genuinely getting better was taken away i feel so fucking depressed.

I guess I learned the path of least resistance... so this has been building up and causing tension between me and my spouse... to the point I was asked to leave the house...

Upon leaving we started couples counselling and it turns out I have PTSD stemming back to my childhood, my dad, and later the loss of my mom.

I have to admit that looking back I have been very numb for a while... going to sleep I could be gone in a couple minutes. No problem sleeping. I think realizing something was not right with me. I have trouble making plans, making friends, sticking with goals, etc.

I am all in with my therapy, dont get me wrong... it is just weird coming to terms with what has happened to me, and mostly now answering ""Who am I?""

My dad was quite absent. He worked long days. My mom was the foundation in my family. She worked hard, and when I was young (12, 13) I realized my mom was supporting the family mostly. My dad provided the basic moneys for the house, but my mom still needed to be wise with our money. My dad had a good job. We then moved countries and my dad decided this was a good time to pursue his own interests, trying to make a career out of a hobby... so more than ever, my mom is left supporting our family.

Eventually, he cheats on her, and they get divorced... I am 18/19 by this point. My sibling has been married for a few years, so for the last while its really been me and my mom. She was fantastic as a mom. She constantly praised me and was my strongest cheerleader. Looking back, these years is when I was at my most healthy emotionally... I had friends, I was happy.

About 10 years ago, my mom passed away. It was quick in that she was diagnosed with a brain tumor and 2 months later she was gone. I saw her the night she passed away... paramedics were gone and she was just there... I said my good byes and I will not forget that night.

I grieved greatly for a couple days, and then I was 'fine'.

So we fast forward a couple years... I get laid off from this massive company, which is in a downward spiral... I had been there 14 years. I quickly find another job and am there until the pandemic...

At first things were ok, company make some adjustments, but layoffs... 8 months into Covid, I get laid off... I have severance as I had been there 6 years... Once that starts winding down I get back to the job hunt.... I have a couple good interviews, but nothing comes out of it...

I end up on a contract temp job through an agency. Been here 2 years now...

So this is where our brains start connecting the dots and making 'sense' of our world... my being laid off, not finding good work, being a temp for 2 years and the company dragging their feet getting me full time... yeah, thats my dad. I become that little kid again, feeling I am not worth the attention of my dad, feeling worthless, feeling powerless. I end up in an emotional pit, just stuck, not being able to move... my spouse becomes my ""mom""... I am looking to her to prop me up, to be my cheerleader to help me... she did do that, but she is tired after 2 years... she does not need a 3rd child to take care of, especially when you have 2 teenagers going through their own pandemic issues...

My therapist uses EFT and got things moving within the first 30 mins of dealing with her. I am at the start of this healing process, but i still have good days and bad. I have not explored my emotions as much as I have in these last 2 weeks. 

Looking back I recognize I became numb to a lot of what was going on in life... issues with the kids, I was just not moved to action... like hoping the issue would just sort itself out on its own... my poor wife, not sleeping, having anxiety, and me just falling asleep in 30 seconds.

I am coming to grips with the thought that this is PTSD. Maybe there was some depression too? I dont identify with depression in the sense that I did not have suicidal thoughts... though i recognize a difficulty establishing friendships - because i had nothing to offer, or something.

I am feeling better and working towards a point where I can return home and be the father my kids need, be the man my wife married and once again wear the pants in the family.

&#x200B;

My father is a selfish man. I know he has his own issues, and I am coming to terms with that. He must have his own abandonment issues.

My fear of being like him, being selfish has made me do the opposite. I took on too much in my house and had to do everything... not because my wife is unable to cook, or do the shopping, or anything else.... I just had to do it. I think I needed to show I was needed, that I was present, that I was not abandoning them. But when you aim so far to please, you end up smothering... its too much. I failed to stand up to my youngest and show there is a limit. 

My dad did not harm me on purpose. He has his issues. Whatever they are, this was not personal. My mom tried to shield me, upbuilding me, protecting me. But like a virus, even if we take precautions, we can still get sick... and in this case, I was still affected. My mom's attempts to help me failed in the end - thanks brain. But now I am coming to grips with this truth. I am trying to accept that I am great (not to be a narcissist), that I am worth more than I believed. I was successful in my jobs because I was good at them. Companies fail, that was not my fault. I can be a strong person, I am a good worker, I married a beautiful woman, and have so far raised 2 great kids. I need to focus on my victories.

I am hoping that I can fully put this behind me and find that balance in my life. But I am afraid also.

I am afraid of returning home and failing hard. Maybe that fear is good for me?

On a side note - my wife still loves me, and sending me away was to allow me space to heal without the daily burdens. I love her for that... She is holding down the fort and doing great at it. Its hard being away. The longer I am away, the more I want to be better... the more I want to be myself again.

Any tips on making the flashbacks shorter or making them less frequently. 

My mom died suddenly on February 13th without any warning. I have already been diagnosed with ptsd but this is different and worse. 

My mom was my best friend besides my husband. My husband and I live in my now only dad’s house. 

I went in her room and I couldn’t get up or turn her over. I should’ve known but I finally lifted her up up and was an inch away from her face. I hate describing it but I need people to know so they might be able to help. 

Her lips were purple, her eyes were half open, and there was stuff coming out of her right nostril. 

I ran downstairs to get my dad. I called 911. I knew there was nothing I could do. My parents had such a beautiful relationship. They only stayed in separate rooms because my mom is messy and my dad is ocd clean.

I couldn’t and still can’t believe it. There was no autopsy because my dad doesn’t want to know if he could’ve done something. He’s been a wreck. I have told him about these flashes and he said it was my ptsd. 

It’s never been this bad before. Before my mom I had nightmares, anxiety, fear, and some rare flashbacks. Now the flashbacks happen multiple times daily. I’m afraid to even see a picture of my mom who I can’t say enough was my best friend. We always said I love you daily. 


My dad thinks if I talk to her beloved sponser of over 12 years ( she was sober 16 years) that I’ll feel some relief. I know my mom would want it, I am just scared I’ll lose it on the phone.

In many ways, I'm a walking stereotype. I served in the infantry, fought in some wars, and one bullet wound, 2 abdominal lacerations from sharpnel, and 3 Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBIs) later, I am what I am now... good-humored, intelligent, and loving 90% of the time and extremely angry and dangerous the other 10%.

It's difficult for me to overstate the dangerous part. I hate it, but a particular trigger for me seems to be driving; there are just way too many aggressive drivers on the road and the way I have been conditioned to deal with aggression is with overwhelming violence. Sometimes, while I'm driving, I'll see someone indulging in their own little road rage incident, just generally acting reckless. If they're tailgating someone or being threatening, I just can't help myself, I'll insert myself into the situation. Usually, I'll do the same to them, or cut in front of them and force them to slow down or something. I know I should not do this because that person is probably just having a bad day, or is late for work or something. Predictably, they sometimes then turn their anger on me, and this is where it gets scary. It's scary because they are only pretending to be this crazy, dangerous, psycho person, and... I actually am. And I'm terrified of what I might do. So far, I guess I come off as intimidating enough that everyone just decides its best to not escalate any further with me, but at some point that won't be the case.

Enter, the trauma. As I said. I'm a walking stereotype. I have survivors guilt, nightmares from my combat experience, and am, as one person once described it to me, a moral casualty because of the guilt I feel over four men that I killed at very close range in Afghanistan. This experience had a profound effect on me. It darkened my mind and blackened my soul. I had killed one man in combat before this, but it was at a range of about 150 meters, and it really didn't affect my psyche in the same way. It's hard to describe the effect, but I feel like once I realized how easy it is to kill, even at close proximity, I became afraid that I would do it all of the time. For many years, I thought I was a terrible person for feeling such a rush in those moments; what I thought was joy. I thought this must be how serial killers get off. Am I the same as a serial killer? Only through many years of therapy have I come to realize that it was not joy but the feeling of massive adrenaline and incredible relief that I was the survivor in that lethal encounter.

I've been to every kind of therapy that they offer veterans and have been on most of the meds at some point or another, but I am currently off of everything. I've made a ton of progress over the years and recently even got married and am expecting my first child soon. My wife sees the scars on my body and the hearing aids that I have had to wear since my service, but she doesn't know anything about anything else. I don't want to be this way, and I want to be a better person for her and my future child.

Is there anyone else that suffers in this way? And if so, do you have any advice on how to control it?",1677723332.0

I went to my social worker today. We had a chit chat. I told her about this traumatic event that happened on Monday morning. I had a panic attack while narrating it and couldn’t even keep eye contact with her. Even after that I was so shaky because I felt like “I’m a liar. I’ve exaggerated this.

The problem is I always believe people would think it’s not as bad as I’m making it seem. Then suddenly I’ll be at rock bottom trying to find out if it wasn’t “that bad” then why can’t I be “normal” like everyone else. I won’t ever be able to share my trauma because of the shame afterwards that

He was living in Phoenix Arizona, and I live on the east coast, but because of the pandemic and subsequent lockdown, I couldn't make it out to visit him before he passed. I felt extremely guilty, and I still do, as I still haven't been back to AZ since his passing. He was a medevac in Vietnam, and his cancer was caused by exposure to Agent Orange, or at least that's what I was told. His death was also extremely quick, as far as cancer is concerned, only being diagnosed in September of 2018. I've also repressed every memory of the entirety of 2020, either through drinking, or smoking marijuana (which is legal where I live). Every time I do try to bring up a memory from his passing, I get depressed, angry, confused, and hateful mostly towards myself, which is why I have those memories repressed. I don't want to hurt myself, or anyone else, so I keep those memories locked away. Never let them out. My dad was my hero, I looked up to him, idolized him. He meant everything to me, and I never really got to say goodbye. I mean, I called him on the phone every day up until his passing, but... I never got to say goodbye in person. I never got to... I actually can't continue, as I'm becoming increasingly emotionally distressed the more I write about this, so I'll wrap this up.

1. Is it possible that I'm dealing with PTSD, despite not seeing my dad pass away with my own eyes?

2. Is there any way I can get help for whatever it is I am dealing with?

3. Is there any form of therapy that's helpful for a situation like this?

122,Is this PTSD?,6,11fm378,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11fm378/is_this_ptsd/,4,"All my life, whenever I think of my memories of my childhood, it always feels like there’s a wall of fog around them. I can strain against that wall all I want, but it feels like my brain won’t allow me to view those memories. It’s just foggy.

A couple days ago I took a small amount of Adderall. I have diagnosed major depressive disorder and I’m working on getting diagnosed with ADHD.

Everything was normal until I went to go to sleep. I went to bed depressed and I just kept wondering why I am the way I am. Like, “why am I so depressed? Why do I feel so broken?”

It got me to think about my life and I started to shift towards my childhood. Except this time there was no fog. I remembered it all.

I won’t go into it, but I was frequently sexually assaulted from kindergarten to second grade. I didn’t know that until the night I took Adderall.

Long story short, I had a four hour panic attack that night. I couldn’t breathe, I couldn’t stop shaking, I was sweating, I couldn’t think. It took around 11 hours total before my heart stopped racing and I stopped shaking entirely. I didn’t sleep at all that night. I felt like I would have to relive everything if I let my mind relax so I kept it busy. I recited powers of two over and over all night long.

The next day, once I felt calm again, the fog returned. It doesn’t feel like the panic attack happened to me, and I feel like i’ve completely dissociated from the memory of
my childhood again. Everything just feels like it didn’t happen to me. There’s no emotion, and hardly a memory at all.

I guess what i’m asking, is this PTSD? I don’t know what’s going on with me.",1677713903.0
123,Why aren’t we funding this!?!!?!!,11,11fivm5,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11fivm5/why_arent_we_funding_this/,2,"TW’s :Childhood trauma, suicide, depression, drug use.

Ok, TL:DR up front.  I have years of childhood trauma.  I Recently had a breakthrough experience with MDMA that has imprinted on my brain and removed my aversion to touch, and allowed me to engage with my experiences in a manner that didn’t leave me a sobbing mess for days.

The short version here is my mom used to beat the shit out of us growing up.  When that wasn’t happening I was largely ignored because I liked to read and write poetry and talk about physics which made me a weirdo to my cowboy culture family.  My dad killed himself when I was 16, and I almost caved in my moms new husband’s skull with a golf club when he threatened to kill my little sister.  

This kinda messed me up in ways both obvious and subtle.  For most of my life I walled off that part of me and pretended it was normal.  It wasn’t until I had a total breakdown and sought therapy that I even thought about how it was affecting me.  My therapist recommended reading The Body Keeps the Score, and after reading the examples in that book and about how trauma works in your brain I realized that it wasn’t normal what happened, but my bodies reaction to it was almost textbook.

Talk therapy has been going well, and I’m still doing that, but I was talking about MDMA with a friend of mine and she cleared up a bunch of misconceptions I had about it being a party drug that just makes you want to dance.  My wife also thought it would be good for me so we agreed to take it together.

I had no idea what to expect, and I thought at best it would be a temporary “fix” like getting blackout drunk.  I was completely and blissfully wrong.

At first I was waiting to just get high, but I never really felt that.  What I felt was a desire for physical contact that I thought I wasn’t allowed to have. I convinced myself that my aversion to touch was just “how I am,” but I had that veil not only ripped down, but it got burned up.  My wife and I cuddled on the couch and listened to music and talked.  She complimented me and asked me questions about what I felt like as a kid, and I found that I could answer her without wanting to break down in tears.  It was like watching a car accident safely perched on a cloud, and it was incredibly productive.

I asked my psych about it and he sent me a clinical study (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01336-3) that confirms with empirical evidence that my experience wasn’t really unique.  

I thought at first that I would wake up and go right back to my hole the day after, but it’s been a week and I still feel a fundamental difference.  I woke up this morning and I had my arms around my wife which is something I don’t recall happening in 15 years of marriage.  Normally if she tried to cuddle with me while I was sleeping I’d wake up in a panic.

I know this is anecdotal, but we really need a reckoning on drug scheduling in this country (USA).  The idea that I have to seek out a drug like this on the black market with the risk of fentanyl spiking etc is ludicrous.

I lived with my boyfriend for two years and he wasn’t the worst, but there was a lot of emotional abuse, coercion into having sex with him, and one time he grabbed me by the hair, held me super hard and threatened to bang my head against the door frame if I ever said that to him again (i was tired of him trying to start an argument and I asked him to be quiet). I ran out fully expecting him to chase me down and kill me based on things he’d said and threatened before this situation occurred.

I feel like he never outright hit me so I don’t have the right to even be traumatised but nevertheless here I am… and every time I get triggered I just get this intense feeling that I NEED someone to hurt me again. To make it feel real, to at least make my feelings fit the situation or to give me what I deserve. I sometimes hit myself or bite myself to cause pain where it won’t show when this happens.

I was raped in 2021. Since then I've been slowly healing and I've come a long way, even though I still have far to go.

I know that it is common for rape victims to be assaulted multiple times, often by different people, and it feels....inevitable, for me.

To my knowledge, this is the only time it's happened to me. But it feels like because it wasn't the ""violent in a park by a stranger"" type of assault you hear about in the news, it doesn't feel like it ""counts"" in a way. And I keep getting these feelings like it SHOULD happen again. Like I'm just in limbo waiting for this next inevitable rape to happen. On my dark days I still get urges that I should hook up with someone shady on grindr, get myself into a situation that can get worse, and just get it over with. 

I felt like this as a kid, growing up without the knowledge that I was actually a trans man, being told that when I grew up I WILL have a man fuck me and I WILL have to bear children. And that damaged me for years to the point where I was not careful about my welfare for a while when I was older (this is about ten years ago now). 
This feeling never left me. The guilt and shame and resignation that this is the lot I have been given and at some point someone is going to come along and collect what's due.

Idk what I'm getting at here. I just want someone to listen, give me some advice or make it stop hurting. I hate how much I think about this and for how long it's been going on.",1677629379.0

Don't really know how to start, but I've entered in a new relationship with a girl that I really like but sometimes we have deep talks and she opened up on her past life, she didn't have an easy life starting from her childhood she was sexually abused from her brother in law, never had a father figure because she was abandoned from him even if they reconnected in the future but failed again and now they don't talk, she never had a healthy relationship which the last one was the worst one, he was really toxic manipulative and used her financially emotionally and forced her to have a treesome even if she was not interested, she did it to make him happy and because she didn't know how to give a voice to her feelings and needs.

Now she asked me if was an intelligent idea to reach out to him because back in the days he came uninvited to her house asking to reconnect, but she just want a healthy closure and go on with her life in peace because she don't feel secure and having nightmare of him showing up and stalking her, so she reached out they had a talk and she got a little depressed because of old negative emotions, but at the end of the day it was worth it because they managed to understand that they need to live their life in peace.

Most of the days she is good but sometimes she let intrusive thoughts like not being enough or being scared of me that I'm gonna change in the future and she says things like maybe I'm not good at this (romantic relationship) and have anxiety for the future or the unknown, on top of this we are doing LDR so all the negative emotions comes up (and it's the only time when it happens) because she never had any problems when we are together and she is the first that says that we are solid she loves me and she wants a future with me.

In starting to getting info on this behavior and it fit perfectly on PTRD in a branch of PTSD related to past relationships and abuse events, can you guys tell me or give me info on how to help her?

Or maybe somebody that experienced the same things, did you got better and what worked for you to got to this point?

Or, so I thought. I've always had PTSD symptoms. A therapist once used the phrase ""We'll never know if it was [Genetic Disorder] or CPTSD that caused these symptoms, since they look so alike, and there was never a you that existed without trauma.""

Ouch.

The CPTSD symptoms since I was 14, that I can remember. Certainly coping mechanisms before that, a generally quirky kid, and an ""old soul,"" ""act your age,"" ""enjoy your youth,"" child. 

When I went to therapy for the first time since I was court mandated to, within the first session they mentioned I cycled through nearly every PTSD symptom. My current therapist felt the same way.

However, now that I'm just now out of the traumatic shit, I'm showing more symptoms than before. Dissociation, constant chest pains from anxiety, Derealization, roughly the same intrusive thoughts in amount, but their quality feel more severe. More anxious, assuming the worst, even the tiniest hiccup feels like the world is collapsing around me and everything I've created that is peaceful is breaking.

My therapist said this is the POST part of PTSD. I, semi-jokingly, asked them if what I had before was PRE-PTSD. I know it's just the complexity. I'm scared they're going to get worse. Some things are better - I have less nightmares, less insomnia, less sudden sadnesses & nearly no depression. 

I'm just scared I'm going to be nothing more than a walking mental illness. I already had like every fucking symptom of PTSD. Maybe not in high quality, but it fucking hurts. I'm fucking scared each and every symptom is going to be hopelessly exasperated and I'll ruin the peace I have. 

I'm scared of the part of my subconscious that is so scared of the calm that it's solution is to burn everything to the ground. It's my own thought, my own voice, and it begets no action. It's simply an anxious thought. But I hate every anxious thought, every chest pain that sends me through a panic attack, the weakness of struggling to order food once the cashier tells me they're out of the third items I've tried to order when I've survived countless sexual assailants, 2 narc parents, and countless abuse. I feel weak & anxious & helpless.

At the same time, for the first time in my life I am calm. I feel loved. My friends are kind. I have a place to call home. My work is good to me. I travel. I eat decently. I struggle like a normal person does, with things like overhearing someone gossiping and wondering if I should say something to the person being talked about. My biggest stressor in day to day is cleaning my room, or looking at the news. 

But my brain just wants to has up the old shit in the car. It's scared, and I know in a way it is right to be. It's fear served it well for some time, and we're only in the clear by a few months. 2 months and some change, really. 

I know it's not a lot of time, and thag it will likely improve instead of get worse. But i'm scared of the opposite. I'm terrified of the POST just all adding up at once. 

Fuck CPTSD. Fuck having a trial period of all the symptoms and still it getting worse when you're finally free. I'm scared of being trapped with a trauma of my own organ's creating, a side of my brain mutating and staging a mutiny against me.

164,was I misdiagnosed? TW: guns and child abuse ahead,1,11enr19,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11enr19/was_i_misdiagnosed_tw_guns_and_child_abuse_ahead/,1,"
Hello there.
Just to make things clear, I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder, not PTSD, but several people within the psychiatry field have said that my case looks far from bipolar. I was diagnosed a year ago after what my psychiatrist called a suicide attempt and she hasn’t consider to re-diagnose me so far.
This is going to be long and this is going to be detailed, so I’m sorry in advance. You don’t have to read this if you are sensitive to topics that have anything to do with guns and child abuse.
I’ve been through a lot. Some of the weirdest events in my life include these:
- At the age of four my parents left me behind to cover my vitals in a roly poly-like position when a drunk man pulled out a gun and started shooting. Long story short, when the shooting was over and I unrolled hoping to see my parents rolled up beside me, I saw them walking away casually like it was your typical vacation day with the family. The police were involved (the guy shot a dog in its leg). At nineteen I reproached my mother for leaving me back there, but she said it was no big deal, her argument being “he had no gun, just a crossbow”. However, I clearly remember the shots being so loud my ears felt muffled, and crossbows aren’t that loud.
- I’ve been abused by my mother for the most of my upbringing, physically, mentally and medically. Most of the physical abuse was just beating me up, but a couple of times I genuinely felt she was trying to damage my body seriously. Also, for whatever reason she believed that smashing me on my back unexpectedly would cure my scoliosis. This especially made me kind of nervous and jumpy to the point of being convulsed when touched on my back in my teen years. Also, she gave me homeopathic injection shots (she is not qualified for that) which gave me leg seizures, and at that time I thought I could lose my legs for good (sorry I was a pretty dumb kid)
I no longer suffer from jumpiness, but I had recurring dreams about fighting against my mother and my arms being too light to deliver a proper punch or defend myself. Later these dreams transformed finally giving me the power to fight back, but now I mostly beat her to death by the end of these dreams. I also have a recurring dream of crawling in a crowded street half-unconscious, feeling like I’m dying, no one bothering to help me despite the street being crowded. These ones are extremely hard for me, I can’t wake up, I can’t die, the only things I can do are crawl and suffer. 
I do get triggered and I do have memories of the things I’ve been through build up uncontrollably in my head, but it’s as if I don’t care. I don’t know how to put it into words. The only emotion I feel about these events is “oh shit”, and then I suddenly feel empty and weak. Like life leaving my body.
It doesn’t really look like the PTSD they describe in quizzes and articles, so I doubt that the psychiatrists will even try to give me any different diagnosis when I ask them to look deeper into my health problems. I don’t know what to do.",1677627433.0

I have PTSD from a abusive and neglectful relationship with my ex, he constantly put a game above me and also pushed me to play it even using guilt tripping to do so. 

Move forward to now, I've got a amazing new boyfriend who is passionate about all things gaming. Including this particular game, we've been working on my PTSD with it and I thought I was getting better  however a new dlc just dropped and I've had a massive spiral. Seeing the game made me nauseous, emotional, brought back memories and feelings I didn't wanna think about and I couldn't help it. So I left the room, went downstairs to distract myself with some comfort YouTube so he could enjoy the game without worrying about me, however this act has upset my partner. He understands why I left and he says he is happy I did for my own sake as well as to let him have his fun with his friends but he still knew I was upset and it made things hard. 

We've had a long discussion after all his mates came off about everything and I cried alot but I feel stupid for feeling this way. I know my current partner is the complete opposite of my ex, he doesn't neglect me for games and he doesn't make me feel bad about not wanting to play but the anxiety and those intrusive thoughts won't leave me alone.

Forced me to go to his place but I ran away. He asked me to accompany him every lunch. He always made sexual comment about my body in front of everyone.

179,Forgiveness seems impossible,2,11dzcwa,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11dzcwa/forgiveness_seems_impossible/,4,"Hi everybody, I had to swollow the anxiety for this 1 my first time posting so please excuse me being a noob.

I will try keep it short as possible. Growing up I had 2 significant traumas and the worst of the 2 being my father passing away when I was 12. 
I have a very disfuctional family all drinkers very aggressive and violence is the norm, even the women in my family have toxic masculinity. 

My uncle John (my mom's brother) is defiantly the worst of the family and one day his son got into a fight with the neighbours kid and my uncle went crazy and came after me for not doing anything about it and knowing his aggression I was scared shitless so naturally I ran to my dad and my dad tried to stop my uncle from coming after me, they ended up in a fight and my dad got killed in the process. This all happened right in front of my eyes. All I remember after that was the most intense fear I had ever felt in my life I could see people screaming but I couldn't hear a thing over the ringing in my ears, my heartbeat was so violently strong it felt like my head was going to explode. The memory of this feeling has never left me.

In the beginning I forgave my uncle ( I thought I did atleast) but at that young age I couldn't  even begin to comprehend how that day would affect the rest of my life so I always had the attitude of wjat ever doesn't kill you makes you stronger. The problem is I used that as a crutch to avoid dealing with anything and I spent my teenage years very withdrawn.

I am now turning 30 this year and I have a small family of my own. The best thing that ever happened to me and I honestly don't know what i would have done without my wife being there for me all these years. My daughter has brought back so much joy and innocence to my life what i thought was lost forever.

My first problem is my family doesn't  speak about anything which explains why they are so dysfunctional so I have  ever even gotten a simple im sorry from my uncle. Way to proud, nobody in the family even speaks about my dad anymore because they just want to avoid the subject entirely, and second problem is the older I get the more angry I get. I get angry because now I realise how much my uncle stole not only from me but my daughter too. I k ow my dad would have been the proudest grandfather and that probably hurts me the most. I'm angry because he stole mine and my dad's first beer together, he stole my first driving lesson, he stole the proud look on my dad's face at my wedding, he stole my daughters grandfather he stole my best friend.

Now its been about 18 years since my father passed and at this point I don't want his apology that will only serve to make him feel better he is 18 years too late.

I need to find a way to forgiveness maybe its myself I should be forgiving I don't know. Another poinyof anger for me is the court case for the murder of my father was thrown out of court, because I live in South Africa the courts and government are extremely corrupt so him being in a much better financial position then me he could pay the courts to "" loose the documents"".  All I know is this hatred is killing me and I cant carry on like this because the irony is I am busy becoming my uncle. I have become very short tempered and aggressive lately the smallest thing will set me off and I have tried my hardest to keep my daughter away from that.

I know trauma makes you feel completly alone I the world but what everybody is doing in this thread is wholesome just reading some posts makes me feel less alone.

I accepted that he did it not because of something I did or who I am but because of who he is. If I was replaced by a different girl he would've done the same thing. I accepted that the only way I could've avoided it was never meeting him at all.

I never thought I would be this type of person before. Why the FUCK do people especially therapists insist you should accept your trauma and abuse??? Therapists were part of me being traumatized anyway so don't tell me to go to one, but they constantly just say ""accept it"" like they want me to be happy about being abused or accept that I deserved it. When pressed they'll say ""No, no. That's not what I'm saying"" But what the FUCK are they saying?

I fucking looked up the definition one day, read the manuals, and it basically means to never be upset about my abuse again as if I'm not entitled to an emotional reaction. It's not allowed. It's a Bad, Unallowed feeling to be upset about my abuse. I hate these people. I'm not going to accept my abuse. If being happy about my abuse and never being allowed to feel anything about being abused is the path to ""healing"" it fuck it. Fine. 

I will be PTSD forever. Even if it kills me. I'm miserable. I frequently think suicide is the only way out and I just recently got to a point where I'm not so depressed and suicidal all the time, but PTSD might make me take my own life anyway. Finally, I don't want to die, but I feel like I need to because PTSD is wrecking me, but I will deal with it as long as I can rather than accept my abuse. I'm not accepting my abuse.

i’m looking for headphone recommendations. i’m going to be at an inpatient facility (again, fuck) for a good while. i’ve been there before. so i know that this time around, i definitely want a pair of **over-ear headphones**.

i’m looking for:
- bluetooth
- good “transparency” mode so that i can hear what’s happening around me with the headphones on and while listening to music. my hypervigilance is unbearable when i can’t hear my surroundings. for example, if someone was walking up behind me or something similar. 
- comfy
- affordable is better than not affordable but it’s a must have for sanity and safety purposes 
- preferably black in colour 

i’m in Canada and have the ‘zon and access to all big box stores. i already have ear buds so i’m good in that regard. i just need some visible “don’t talk to me” headphones.

thanks in advance for any/all suggestions. 

i hope you take care of yourself today.

I'm new here and I'm not formally diagnosed with ptsd, but I feel I definitely have a form of it from my early childhood. I grew up in an old shack type of house with my extended family. I can't give too many details as my parents use reddit. I was raised primarily by my grandparents who are amazing people. I was an accident and don't know my birth father. My younger sibling was born 2 years after me. We grew up in a moderately violent household. My mother wasn't ready for children. It became normal for me and my sibling to ""get the rod"" every day or two from her. My new father who I grew up thinking was my birth dad was seldom in the house as he worked constantly. We were hit with random objects all the time and then hit for crying or being scared. My father never hit us, but he was hard on us to grow up to be his version of men.

Once we started school it got worse. I took the blunt of everything being the oldest child. It effected us both differently, my brother growing to be a softer person and I grew up to be a serial liar and eventually a sociopathic type of person. I'd have to lie to stay put of trouble and avoid being struck when I came home from school. It got out of control and I'd lie about everything to anyone I could for no reason, and I'd hurt my friends at school emotionally for no reason. Then I'd come home to all types of mental and physical abuses from my mom or constant lectures from my father.

As I grew to be a teen I was an outcast socially at school and the lying and manipulation got a lot worse, and the stigma from what I did destroyed me as I just wanted to have friends but couldn't stop playing with peoples emotions. I became extremely depressed. Eventually towards the end of high school my parents divorced due to their really bad relationship. The abuses we had gotten calmed down a good amount till visitation and custody battles started. At this point I was 18 years old and was used by my parents as a mediator in-between them both to relay their stupid problems, and my brother was a kind of bargaining chip with the custody thing. I snooped around in the paperwork to learn my dad wasn't my birth dad at that point.

I ended up hooked on different drugs and was a mess. I contracted venereal diseases from serial dating and just not caring at all. I moved out and my brother went with my father. I met a girl and we were together for 3 years in a relationship that drove me to extreme alcoholism. She cheated on me and I lost my house. I ended up in jail a couple times and had to move back in with my mother and her new husband, who is a really good person and he seemed to straighten everything out with my mother. She became a lot nicer of a person and her temper calmed a lot. I was extremely depressed on arrival and attempted self termination 7 times. I started a band and it's been an outlet for everything.

As of now I'm off of drugs, sober 4 years and work a great job. I'm with my future wife but am still struggling a small bit with drinking sometimes. I'm planning on moving out soon with my future fiance and starting my life over again. I'm in my mid 20s. I know this is a long bunch of words but I thank anyone here who chooses to read. I still struggle with my feelings from my childhood but I'm working on it one day at a time.",1677524164.0

At the same time he would try and beat up my pregnant mum but 5 year old me would step in the way to try and protect her, at this point my mums ex was beating her up everyday, I still remember the glass smashing on her head and other not so nice things, not to mention the time that he tried to kill me which led me to get knocked out and bite my tongue into three pieces in the process. When I was a baby I was also blinded in one eye because of my brother  

The way my childhood was really effected the way I grew up, I’ve never been able to trust people, I’ve always been scared of doing or saying something that people don’t like. Every minute of the day outside or around people I feel like everybody is looking at me, saying things about me or thinking things about me, I think this is due to the severe bullying I went through in school.  I can’t get any hobbies, I try to make friends then it’s like I forget they exist and I just forget to speak to them. My two mental states are what I’d describe as very manic and complete nothingness which is very dissociative though. 

I’m only 21 but I feel like I’ve wasted my whole life, I get sudden aspirations and then within a day or two they disappear, I’m just at a point where I don’t get what I’m supposed to do, I’m not a physical person due to my childhood abuse but 2 months ago I punched through a fireproof glass pane and was told I started laughing when my arm started bleeding a lot, alls I remember is that I thought I was going to die with the amount of blood and I laughed because I thought it was funny , I don’t even remember why I did it in the first place.

I used to compulsively measure and rank the traumatic incidents in my life and compared it with everyone I came across to. 

I remember sitting in group therapy and mentally created a hierarchy of who I thought had it “the worst” I wouldn’t even bother to listen to that person again in group therapy if I deemed their trauma as “not enough”.

I was ultimately a victim of my own hierarchy too I was filled with so much shame all the time whenever I ranked someone else as having “more” trauma than me. The shame came after we shared some stories and from the thoughts “I knew I should have kept my mouth shut. My story is probably mocked now. Im a laughing stock. Im inferior. I should disappear. My story wasn’t worth attention because theirs was worth far more than mine.” I’ve even gone into multiple severe suicidal crises because of this. 

Maybe this feeling that my trauma should have been worse to be real was enforced in me since I was a kid. I was made to look at dying starving or kidnapped kids so my parents could excuse their utterly horrible physical, emotional and verbal abuse and neglect towards me. I had to in fact go through more abuse that also involved traumatic invalidation whenever I tried coming up with my stories of abuse. 

Perhaps that’s why I started labeling trauma as not enough or enough because that’s what I was taught to do and no matter what, my trauma could never be rough. 

Now whenever I do the trauma ranking, not only I invalidate other but I also traumatically invalidate myself causing a sudden emotional flashback and a suicidal crisis.

Due to this, the severity of my PTSD went up before I was able to work through the trauma in my childhood.

Since the relationship especially, I have more things that have been triggering me and because of dissociation being my main response, I was out of it basically all the time. Whenever I was grounded it was hard to even function because I would have to deal with the emotions and triggers of the day, week, or month. I'm finally to the point where I am present at least 50% of the time, and everything's calming down in my brain but I still am struggling being able to notice when I start dissociating. 

I noticed it today and was able to ground myself pretty quickly before it got bad. So like I have the tools and ability, but cause I've been dissociated so long, I often don't notice something triggering me. So I don't even know the triggers or if I may even be accidentally triggering myself. When I am dissociated for a longer time it takes longer for me to ground, so I want to be able to notice and help myself in the moment instead of being incapacitated for hours later.

i did this by going to see my grandma on my dads side (F69) who has always been my safe haven (love you mawmaw even tho i know you'll never see this) i half heartedly expected my dad to still be living in my grandmas house but he wasn't he had moved back into my childhood home with his new boyfriend. i can still vividly remember the day i laid eyes on my dad again for the first time in 2 years. and for the first time that i can remember i saw my dad cry. he took me back into my old room still set up the exact way i'd have it. for the first time in 2+ years at that point i slept soundly.



after i visited my dad more frequently i decided to spend the summer with him. he then saw my living conditions.... these memories still haunt me. and the words my dad said will stay with me forever. ""son you can't keep living this way. is this what you wanted?"" and i just walked away. i packed what little i owned into my backpack and moved back in with my dad. 


from here nothing was truly bad bad (in comparison to what i already had been through) we moved around a bit before settling back into my hometown. from there my dad met his current and longest standing relationship. he proceeded to move out of state to live with his new boyfriend but my grandma (the saint she is) demanded i stay in my hometown to finish school. so there i was living with my grandma after my dad yet again disappeared to chase his sexuality. throughout highschool i was your stereotypical neck beard. but once i got out of my home state of Georgia and moved to texas i started to wonder why i couldn't work for a female manager, how even tho i myself accepted that i am pansexual not straight, my inability to talk to people all of these things weight on my brain everyday and i'm slowly falling apart. 


i know this was a long one but i really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read the ramblings of a mildly interesting stoner. the main focus of sharing my story is to learn i don't know exactly what's wrong i think it's PTSD but i've also been told by friends it could be CPTSD. i don't know so if anyone can help me it would be greatly appreciated.

217,Advice on living with someone who triggers you?,4,11ch9ek,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11ch9ek/advice_on_living_with_someone_who_triggers_you/,1,"(Throwaway account since my friends and family know about the ongoing situation)


My partner and I have been together for around 2.5 years. It's always been a very comfortable and safe relationship, he's been very aware of my trauma from an ex + childhood, and has strongly avoided any triggers, even though I'd never had a trauma response that couldn't be calmed down relatively quickly. Until 14 days ago. He triggered the worst flashback I've ever had, and I went into a sort of dissociative state for the rest of the night. (For info: he was being a drunk jerk, and while he was being obnoxious in a way he's **NEVER** remotely been before, the actual trigger was a very specific phrase+tone+facial expression that I had never brought up, which he had no way of knowing would trigger me. Obviously still an asshole for being drunk and argumentative, but it was NOT on purpose, and he has apologized repeatedly for since!)


Since that night though, I've basically been stuck in a trauma response around him. I feel incredibly anxious near him, I can only sleep on a couch in a part of our apartment that I don't associate with him, and while I've made progress in being able to talk for short periods of time, longer stretches of conversation bring me up to 99% of a panic attack, as does trying to spend time where I was sitting during my flashback, or in our bed. Home alone in my separate area talking to friends over the phone or when I'm out of the apartment/at a friend's place, I feel completely normal. But the anxiety comes back the second I see or hear him.


My doctor gave me additional medication to help bring my overall anxiety levels down, and one is able to be used up to 3 times a day, but taking more than just one will just make me sleep about 15 hours lol. While I do have a follow up soon, I wanted to see if anyone has experience with this situation. I have no idea what relative time frame I'll be dealing with this, but it's exhausting spending so much time dealing with the physical reactions of trauma even when my brain knows I'm still safe and okay. He's been as accommodating as he can, but I'm disabled so I spend most of my time in our home around potential triggers, save for maybe a walk around the neighborhood if I can physically make it happen. If anyone has any advice, or experiences with this (kind of specific) situation, it would be greatly appreciated! Thank you :)",1677418369.0

I am between the ages of 13-15 and I haven't been diagnosed with PTSD or anything like that(I have never been to a psychologist even if I had PTSD I would't know). My parents have been abusive to me my whole life and I still live with them.

So for about a year now I've became very aware that my parents are abusive. That's when this obsession started, I started researching everything I could about abuse and trauma trying to find something similar to my childhood. This started in the summer when I was on vacation and I would literally stay up till 5 am researching. I even found some childhood pictures and I tried to remember stuff about my childhood by looking at them. I would cry every night because I forced myself to remember all the things that happened to me and I think I made myself emotionally numb because I can't cry anymore and it's worse like this because I fell nothing and I want to try and trigger myself even more in order to have some emotion. When school started I couldn't focus properly on the lessons because I would always have these thoughts consume me and I would just zone out constantly. I'm still a good student but it's clear that my performance is starting to be affected. I also constantly try to bring up trauma in conversations and when talking to people I still can't stop these thoughts they are always in the back of my mind. I am ashamed to admit this but it's like I want to fell sad and have flashbacks(I don't think I've ever had them) and I keep thinking that if I was really traumatised I wouldn't want to be reminded of the trauma. Also I can't even shower or brush my teeth everyday there are times I don't shower for a week( I'd probably do it even mor than that if I wasn't worried about my parents and friends noticing) because I have no motivation what so ever. And this makes things even worse because I fell disgusting witch seems to make these thoughts even more frequent but I can't bring myself to shower more often.

Please help me how can I stop this? It is taking over my life and I don't know what to do.",1677371083.0

Haven't gotten a chance to see a professional yet, but I just came out of a 2 year window where my dad literally went insane, became extremely violent and did a lot of crazy stuff I don't even know how to describe but that ruined my life, meanwhile I watched my grandpa and dog both die, lost the girlfriend I was going to marry to our immigration system, and then was the only one who could care for and watch as my dad died a really slow and ugly death. I get flashbacks, especially auditory and quick image flashes, have been experiencing cognitive impairment, and am easy to put in panic mode, but what's the worst is that I don't seem to be who I used to remember myself as. My behavior has changed in ways that I often find myself really ashamed and embarrassed of after the fact, and it's completely ruining my ability to try to make friends and rebuild my life. Recently I tried dating a girl I'd met after my dad passed, and at that point I was abusing alcohol and weed to drown things out. I acted like a manic asshole in ways I never used to so she left. I sobered up afterward, but then later at an event she was also at with a circle of friends I've also been trying to build a relationship with I guess I kept shutting down and staring into the distance with a glare, which made everyone uncomfortable. She felt like I was staring at her which made them even more uncomfortable. I think I've lost awareness of myself in social settings.

My (almost 30f) older brother has a history of sexually abusing me, from the time I was 8 to 14 years old. I'm now almost 30 and have been putting a lot of time, effort, and therapy into processing a traumatic childhood, in part due to him. Up until last spring, the only people who knew about what he'd done were him, me, my therapist, and my husband. But, last June, I finally found the courage to open up to my mom and admitted to her what he'd done. And she brushed it under the rug, dismissed it, and ignored it.

I was disheartened, and was going to leave it at that, and just let it be and continue on my own healing, but then my younger sister got pregnant and is expecting a baby girl. And I've decided I'm going to be telling her, and the rest of my immediate family, about my brother's sexual abuse of me, because I'm afraid of him perpetuating the same harm onto his future niece.

But, when I told my mom that I was going to be telling other family members about it, she started acting as though I was being dramatic, and heavily implied I was ruining my brother's life over nothing, etc. I've expressly said I don't want that. It's not that I want contact cut off between him and his future niece, just that he maybe not be allowed to be alone with her, and definitely don't let him babysit her as she gets older. Because he can't be trusted. But, mom's words are getting into my head and making me feel as though warning other family members about his past behavior, out of fear my my future niece's safety, is the wrong move. And that I'm being vindictive and only doing this out of spite. I keep having the feeling that that what he did to me wasn't even ""that bad""  and, since I don't know with certainty that he'd do anything to the baby, that I'm just going out of my way to wreck his life. It's starting to confuse me a lot and is making me second guess telling my other family members.

So, WITBA for warning them about his past abuse?",1677348314.0

When I was 11 I was in a crash that very nearly resulted in death - the last noise I heard before it happened was the ear-splitting rattle of one of the tires coming apart. I was in the seat closest to it, and it felt like it made the entire car shake. We careened into the barrier wall, the right half of the car made it over the edge of the highway, and logically, this shouldn't have happened, but by some miracle it heaved back over at the last second. No one was maimed or killed. It affected me pretty severely at first, but by now I have the good fortune of being able to forget about it...unless something triggers the memory again. A lot of the roads in my town have rough patches that create just about the same shaking and rattling that the tire did. When I'm in the car, and it goes over one of those patches, I freeze up, and then if it goes on longer than a second or two it's like my brain switches off. I'll cling to my seat for dear life and I can feel myself hyperventilating. The longer or louder the shaking is, the worse it gets. All I can think is ""I'm about to die"", and then when it's over I might feel uneasy for hours. Even if I *know* it's coming I still can't stay calm. Today stood out to me because I got so lightheaded I thought I was going to pass out.

I've been noticing it a lot more in the last couple years. I might be getting worse again, or our roads are just falling apart. I don't know. On top of that, I'm tired of not being able to drive. I just want to be independent and it's honestly embarrassing since most people my age already have a license. But I doubt I'd be a safe driver when a bumpy road can shut my mind down like that. My muscles could lock up and then I might end up in another wreck. I could never forgive myself if I decided to get behind a wheel anyway, froze up, and got someone else hurt.

And? As much as it terrifies me when my brain thinks it's happening again, it doesn't usually bother me outside of that anymore. That makes it feel weirder for me. I think I struggle more with the repeated trauma I've experienced than one-off incidents like this, and I don't feel like the accident alone has given me more issues than I can consciously identify...but it also causes the most knee-jerk, lizard-brain reactions I can ever remember having. I don't know if words can convey how helpless it makes you feel to be stuck in a speeding metal box, bracing in an instant for it to send you falling off an overpass, even when you're right in your neighborhood and safe on the ground.",1677379024.0

238,Protected disability,8,11b8uiz,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11b8uiz/protected_disability/,2,"Hello. I’ve had CPTSD, and often run into problems at work when others become hostile, aggressive or belittling. 

I have one co worker who is lying and twisting words, arguing constantly, dismissing my experience when I try to set boundaries and not respecting them, minimizing my efforts, and interrupting / challenging me in public forums. 

My boss thinks this is an interpersonal thing that we need to manage between us, but I’m concerned. I’m not so triggered being around this person I feel like I’m going to have a panic attack. I am worried they will push me to a reaction that will reflect poorly on me. 

I’m trying to understand in this world of D&I, what’s the right way to talk about it? 

I work for someone who is very pro d&i and has a disability network, but I’ve never learned into this type of stuff because I was always worried that talking about PTSD as a disability would limit my growth. I have the opportunity to be promoted to director soon and I’m worried this entire situation could ruin it. 

Now I’m wondering if it’s an opportunity to advocate for myself. How do I educate my employer and co workers, and what protections are there?

I know this post might come off as selfish when I say I've been ""avoiding"" it. It's not like I don't care about what's happening over there. Of course I care, but I just feel like I can't handle seeing it.

I did hear from a Turkish friend that the workers managed to rescue a lot of people from the rubble at least, so it's good to hear that so many were saved. From what I was told anyway. But still, I'm avoiding news about it anyway.

Honestly, I've never even looked at any actual footage of the earthquake aftermath. Just reading/hearing about was more than enough. Something about situations like that which are so vast in scope and are so full of unspeakable tragedy, really get to me. Especially because it makes you feel powerless.

And even worse, we live in an age where technology/social media has given us the horrors of world events in real time. So now instead of it being restricted to the evening news, we see everything as it unfolds and learn about every single gruesome and horrific detail. It's just too much for one human being to process.

In a way, ""avoiding"" the news almost feels like some kind of trigger response when tragic world events like this happen. And plus, I nearly drove myself insane last year when the Ukraine war was on social media everyday. So I know what doom-scrolling and staying constantly plugged into tragic news can do to you. Or at the very least, what it did to me anyway.

I know this is a situation has no affect on my own personal life since I'm so far away from it, but I'm still human. And there's almost a sense of guilt knowing that I'm more ""privileged"" and can only move on with my life every day while others are suffering. I don't know, I'm just at my limit with so much going on.

So, earlier in the dream I was playing bass, and I still had it in my hands so I started hitting his head with it.

248,"As part of your PTSD, have you had months-long episodes of cognitive and memory issues? As if thinking requires extra energy - like the mental equivalent of squinting. Mixing up words that sound similar (but thcatching yourself... usually), randomly forgetting things that used to be 2nd nature, etc.",72,11aklzf,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11aklzf/as_part_of_your_ptsd_have_you_had_monthslong/,23,"I have had post-traumatic stress for most of my life due to violence in my family throughout my youth. I was diagnosed in my teens, before the phrase 'complex trauma' was really used as its own diagnosis; there's definitely a complex-trauma component, but it was a pretty explosive home environment and I also understand I have symptoms more similar to 'regular' PTSD. So I guess this question is for people who have both PTSD, CPTSD, or both.Over the last three years, I've had these months-long episodes where I feel like my brain isn't really 'on' or I'm having trouble... navigating my way through my thoughts and memories. I've seen a few neurologists about it, gotten an MRI (which was normal), and I'll have months where I feel normal and 'recovered' and then it comes back. I'm having another episode right now, and it's freaking me out.I was pretty articulate before now, and still generally feel I can speak thoughtfully/intelligently, but randomly I have been saying or doing completely bizarre things I sometimes catch myself doing, and sometimes don't. It's like something is mis-firing in the ways that I make connections, or DON'T make connections. Mixing up similar-sounding words and names I \*NEVER\* would have mixed up in the past - Tanzania/Tasmania, Tom Cruise/Tom Hanks. Many MANY other examples of this. Having this weird thing where I can't quite remember how words are pronounced or where the emphasis is - I have to kind of reason it out and keep doubting myself. I recently used the word 'nauseous' and truly could not remember how it was pronounced, whether it was a hard 'sh' or more of a 'zh.' English is my first language, the language I've been speaking since age 1, and I have been a professional editor for 10 years.

I have strong negative feelings about the power celebrities get in our society, but recently I brought up my generally anti-celebrity feelings to a portrait photographer I generally like... in his own studio full of celebrity portraits... without even realizing until days later that this was inappropriate. I mean, his portraits are mostly public figures I respect, like Madonna and Nelson Mandelia; they're not the type of celebrities I typically rant against, but HE didn't know that - and it literally didn't even occur to me to differentiate to him during my rant, or that he might be offended or confused thinking I was railing against all public figures. It's just like there are connections and obvious things that would occur to other people that have just been going over my head. This particularly points to my PTSD as the cause for my symptoms because I had severe hypervigilance tendencies for most of my life... I wonder if this is my brain being like, 'fuck this, fuck feeling overwhelmed, fuck trying to think of everything to avoid humiliation / shame / danger, we're not even going to think of obvious stuff.' But I'm still not sure if it's just PTSD.

Am having trouble retrieving information when my memory/recall used to be absolutely fantastic and I recalled names, faces, details of people instantaneously - having soaked information up like a sponge. I have hard times reasoning through math problems, or reading even a somewhat mindless book without having to concentrate, like the mental version of squinting. It's almost like my brain used to be a home in which I could wander freely from room to room, looking for the thing I was remembering or whatever, but now I get 'trapped' in a room and don't know how to get to the next room. Or perhaps it's just the \*feeling\* of being trapped when the info is right in front of me - because there are also episodes where I feel vaguely delusional, and things just seem strangely \*off\* even when they aren't and I'm pretty sure I'm pronouncing words right but it sounds like I'm not.  
Again, I first experienced several months of this three years ago, in my late 20s, and it came and went for quite a few years - with many months of normalcy. Now started again. I'm in my 30s and really starting to wonder what is going on, and whether this is PTSD (some but not all of my episodes followed very triggering events), a neuro symptom of an endocrine issue I have, long-term complications of a few concussions I had over the years, or dementia or something. Worth mentioning that I experienced a number of events in the last few years that echoed my childhood traumas and likely retraumatized me - was also living in a somewhat formless fashion that confused my brain, as a digital nomad - and often a very solitary fashion without much long-term connection. Perhaps the lack of social contact is also related to this.

I would appreciate hearing from others who have PTSD or CPTSD - is this something you've experienced?",1677220306.0

Me think I can trust him and let into my life and how I love my life but he does not understand but continues to again my home and judge me and how I live in my own home but here I am thinking I am being toxic when I’m trying to be calm and explain how I’m trying to work on things and coping and that I had a really fucked up childhood which he knows but said I should’ve fixed years ago ever though I really only had this big realization recently. 

This probably isn’t right either but there are so many things that he’s fucked up makes bad decisions but I literally never say anything I just try and support him.

!!! This post is by no means trying to diminish the pain of ppl who are ACTUALLY in the war zone or telling that what I'm experiencing is so freaking bad and important and stuff, I honestly recommend that no one from Ukraine read this, it's meant for people who do not have bombs flying over their heads and loved ones dying, ect. And it is obviously a very different type of trauma. But it's what I'm talking about, the different aspect not everyone thinks about when talking about PTSD from war. It is about my own trauma, but also about how traumatic events can affect society as a whole !!!

I am from russia, I'm against the war and I'm pretty vocal about it. Luckily, I don't really have much of an audience on my platform and nobody has told on me yet. So I have been really fortunate in that department. Not so much in life in general though.

I've been raped three years ago. And the two don't seem connected, but my brain doesn't care. I know witnessing other people go through trauma can traumatize you and mb it can be retraumatizing if you have prior trauma? I don't exactly know what to call it, there is certainly a name for this. What I know is, I am a traumatized person living in a now more than ever traumatized society. My symptoms of PTSD have gotten worse when the war started. My nightmares are now all over the place, it's like the war indeed retraumatized me, although I am not directly involved and feel like I have no right to suffer from this, but I still do¿ I'm scared of loud sounds, I'm scared of my own reckless honesty, I'm scared of all these ppl who've done horrible things coming back, I'm scared of the violence level rising, I'm scared every time I see the police… I'm scared that this will not end, I didn't expect for the war to last a fucking year, I didn't expect for it to start in the first place, but can my bloody country pls loose already? 

I'm well aware of the effects that acceptance of violence has on a society. I know that the crime level in russia will rise. And I know that the soldiers are going to come back and they are going to have weapons and PTSD, I know they won't receive help, I know they might go on to do whatever. I know that the possibility of me being raped again if I don't get out of here will be higher. And my symptoms are indeed affected by this. I also feel guilty for even complaining about it, for thinking about myself, for being triggered. 

But there are more subtle effects of higher tolerance for violence. People get used to it, everyone, it's just a defense mechanism. It's designed to protect you. People adapt to the most horrific of circumstances. A year ago an event with one human victim would be a tragedy, now a hundred is an everyday occurrence. And there's so much more hate everywhere! Everyone is more scared and more defensive, everyone expects something bad to happen. People learn to never be direct and to talk with a great amount of hints, people are used to talking in riddles now. If you are against the war you can get in real legal trouble, but where I hang out people who are for this shit learn to talk in riddles too, because it is not acceptable everywhere. You know, not everyone likes when people are pro-genocide. But only if you are against it you can get jail time, so… Yeah, you can literally be persecuted for writing the word ""peace"" and stating that ""killing people is bad"" can be perceived as a controversial take, it's so ridiculous and surreal. And also scary. 

I feel like so many ppl are going to have PTSD from it, there are so many not obvious types of trauma related to the war. This whole thing is really messy, I don't know if I did a good job explaining what I meant, it is still raw and going to be until either I move from russia or this whole thing finally ends. I realise most of you won't get what I'm talking about, some of you won't believe me (I'm choosing to take anyone not believing me as a compliment to my English, by the way))0) or think that I am a terrible person. The truth is, this kind of trauma indeed makes you worse as a person, as any trauma can. You know this thing, trauma doesn't make you a better person, you become a better person only despite it? Now imagine that nearly everyone is in some way traumatized, I mean, the whole country is going through different shit, because the war affects EVERYBODY in one way or another. And ppl like me, who have been traumatized before, for some reason become retraumatized by something terrible happening to someone else. And not everyone will become better despite it, most ppl won't get help with this, some will lack self awareness to realise they need it, some won't be able to afford it, some will succumb to effects of the stigma, some will choose alcohol instead… 

Sorry, it's been kinda nonsensical and unstructured, maybe I'll rewrite it some day. I just thought mb it would be interesting. I used to have a bit of a special interest in nazi Germany and I have read about stuff some of which I see happening in my country right now, it is so surreal. And you kinda get tired of feeling, of being sad, shocked, mad and after a while you can only laugh or dissociate. You live in this chronic state of stress. Well, I was in it for a long time before, but right now nearly everyone I know is. Luckily, almost all ppl I know are against the war. 
Thanks for making it till the end if anyone did. I'm really sorry for the actions of my country and can't wait for it to end.",1677223461.0

This is my first semester back after deferring my last semester due to a suicide attempt and hospitalisation at the start of the semester (so no access to my virtual classes). I opted for 4 modules across 2 terms in the semester, and they assigned me the heaviest 3 modules in my first term (so 3 classes a week concurrently). The deadlines and tasks are so scary. I don’t know how I’m going to make the submissions in time. The deadlines and tasks feel impossible and like beasts I can’t conquer. The deadline has already been extended as a concession due to my mental struggles. 

Right now I’m struggling so much with starting the other 2 assignments. One is a long essay, and the other is like 5 multiple-part questions statistics (which I barely understand because we only have a total of 6 classes to learn everything). 

I’m fretting so much and my mind just goes blank, and even though I’m facing so much anxiety, it feels impossible to even try to start. I can’t concentrate at all. My last essay, it took me several hours just to write 300 words, and I stayed up till 5am every day just trying to produce something. I still haven’t resumed a normal sleep cycle yet after 3 weeks. I’m having heart palpitations. 

I don’t want to fail these modules. I need to hit these deadlines. But I don’t know how to bring myself to start. It’s just so hard and I can’t break out of Freeze right now. What do I do?",1677238234.0

I've already posted this but nobody answered, but I'm so thankful in advance if someone does this time.

I'm (F25) sleepy, tired, and exhausted. This time of year is particularly triggering since more than one trauma has happened by the end of February and at the beginning of March. The one that caused me to seek help for PTSD happened the night between the last day of February and the first day of March. This year, I feel quite good since my symptoms have gotten better even though I've recently faced some fresh trauma and a pretty nasty breakup. However, something very different is going on. I tried to switch up my sleep patterns, eat more healthily, meditate a lot, etc. but I still feel sleepy and tired all the time. Not just mentally, but also physically. I could sleep for days. I'm highly functional, and work and study don't suffer (yet). Maybe I try and shy away from potential flashes, or I try to face the trauma in dreams - my dreams are crazily vivid and life-like. Sometimes, I'm even sleepwalking and yelling, and you guessed it - I wake up tired after 10 hours of dreaming and processing information. I don't feel like I've been sleeping at all. However, I generally don't feel too anxious nor this messes up with my life - except for the social side, that segment is mostly non-existent for the previous 3 years, ever since the most triggering one happened (I simply don't trust people and I enjoy my own company, but that's the story of another time). I'm aware this could be a sign of depression, but I'm very familiar with it, and this is not depression, it's something new. Am I reliving the cocoon stage of healing? Is this a healthy coping mechanism? Does it happen to anyone else? Anything would be helpful, thanks in advance. ❤️",1677232114.0

I don't know if my brain is purposley just trying to drive me insane but a few nights ago i had a physical sensation flashback type thing. 

Like i dont know if my brain is just acting things out now i know part of the truth but the place where i was this time was different like the thing i remembered i was against a wall being assaulted and this time my body felt i was in a bed (i mean i was trying to sleep to be fair at the time) but not my bed. It was some kind of distortion thing where my mind was in the here and now but my body was there with echos of sounds that weren't from my actual room. 

Now my brain is like did it happen more than once? I know you guys can't answer that question but iys driving me a bit mad wondering how much ive forgotten and how much is left to come now. I regularly wonder if its all a damn lie but why would i remember specifics and there was indications that i now see. So i dunno what to do.",1677233323.0

For context, I’m 17, and had a history of neglect under my fathers watch on the weekends. I still love him, he had bpd and had some substance issues at the time that made him unfit to be a caretaker, but he’s a good person and we still talk on the phone. My therapist (who I have because of a depression diagnosis) told me that because I was frequently made promises that were always broken (like being told he would buy food for us, get out of bed to take care of me, clean up all the filth I came over to, etc.) that I’ve developed an extreme and irrational response to broken promises now.

My boyfriend always sends me every morning a plethora of nice messages to wake up to after I fall asleep the previous night, as we are now in a three hour timezone difference after I moved. Today he did not. I was really upset but said that when I took my my after school nap he could then, but I napped and he forgot a second time. Within 10 minutes this caused a horrible meltdown, causing me to miss a show my family was seeing that we already bought tickets and reserved seats for. Right before we left my mom came upstairs to tell me it was time to go, and the only think I could say while looking at the floor was “I don’t want to”. After a couple minutes she let me stay home and they left.

Seconds after I heard the car pull away I started screaming loudly and sobbing uncontrollably, as the reality of being alone and missing a once in a lifetime show in new york slaughtered me. I laid crying on the bathroom floor for a long time, about to throw up multiple times. I was scream crying and repeating phrases like “what did I do” and “how could he do this” and “what’s wrong with me” as I was helplessly losing it. 

I’m now in my bed, still crying after an hour and a half trying to figure out what is happening to me. I logically know I shouldn’t be this mad at my bf, but I can’t forgive him and cannot stand to talk to him after what he caused (especially because he knows about how I react to disappointment). I feel like he broke me, I feel so pathetic for now being able to get my shit together to go to this cool event, and I don’t know how to calm down.

Tw: violence/ some in-depth discussion of trauma

Hey, I go to Michigan State University, and about a week and a half ago, I experienced a mass shooting. I wasn’t at the shooting scene, but I was about two buildings away (meaning that I heard everything, including the shots and sirens). Obviously, I’ve been dealing with some pretty intense trauma symptoms/ flashbacks. Right now, my biggest symptom is brain fog. I’m not actively dissociating in the sense that I know where I am and feel like I am connected to my body, but I feel like anything I have to think about is automatically 10x harder to do (aka having trouble processing higher order thoughts). It kinda feels like trying to write a research project while having the flu or trying to sludge through a bog just to get a sentence out. This means that I haven’t been able to do schoolwork/ my job for the past couple of days, which is bad for obvious reasons. Has anyone had any experience alleviating this type of thing?

I’ve also been experiencing other symptoms like emotional numbness, sudden outbursts of sadness, shaking intensely whenever I hear sirens or helicopters, and avoiding places that could be triggering as much as possible. I took a couple ptsd quizzes and i think it’s safe to say I’m at pretty high risk (I also have some comorbid disorders). Is there anything I can do to mitigate the chances of developing ptsd from this? I see a therapist but idk i still feel terrible. Sorry if this feels clinical, I just don’t have a lot of energy right now.",1677227340.0

My brother killed himself when I was 10. My parents poured our family image into me, dancing ballet semi professionally. To make up for the damage of my brother, killing himself to the family image. My mother used me as an extension of her self, while at the same time, breaking me down to keep control of me. Putting me on a diet when I was 11 and then shipping me off when I was 12 to train with companies for 8 to 10 weeks at a time by myself. Telling me I was so beautiful and how ugly my acne made me. My poor sister was a scapegoat. I’ve suffered a lot of outward trauma that was very profound and deep. Including a boyfriend that was killed when I was 25. Finally at 32. I have come to realize that my mother is a narcissist. I’m so angry at myself how much I catered to her. I’m angry at myself. I was so blind for so long, putting my parents on such a pedestal. I’m angry that they had the means to be better and they didn’t. How much everything revolves around her emotions and needs even when she was addicted to painkillers in my teens my memories of her being on her bed for days and weeks at a time. But my father made good money and worked long hours. My sister became my mother, but when she turned 18 she left for college she had to save herself. Her therapist even told her it was like I lost a parent when she left, which is true sadly. At that time, my mom said to come out of the drugs, realizing that I was going to be leaving soon. When I turned 18 my parents forced me to pay them back $15,000 from a trust fund that was left for me when brother died. Blaming me for not going further with my ballet career and stopping at 17. But because of all of my outward trauma and guilt of not being a good daughter, I didn’t see the psychological damage of narcissistic mother. Until now at 32. Even last week, my mother said that I need to come home to take care of my father (her other child as she said) after my recent break up. Even last year I tried to kill myself. I went through a lot of therapy to try and tell them about my attempt. I felt so much shame and guilt that I had failed them. I was supposed to be the good and perfect one. I finally told them, and my mother waited for my father to leave and verbally attacked me.. she asked why I thought she was a bitch that day and treated her like a child. Which I was having to treat her like a child because she doesn’t act like an adult I even had to apologize to the owners of the place we were staying at because of her behavior. I left to go to the bathroom after my father came back . I came back, my father told me I had to apologize to my mother give her a hug and let her know that I still love her after how I treated her that day. It is absolutely so painful to me, realizing how narcissistic my mother is and how much of an enabler my father is I’ve gone so much of my life catering to their emotions and I excused my mother for so many horrible psychological damages. All in the sake of keeping an image. I’m in double therapy twice a week again. Pouring myself into work. And I lost one person who actually cared about me because I was so unhealed. I feel so I absolutely alone and all this pain and anger at myself and them. It wasn’t until this year that I finally told people that I used to sleep on my mothers floor next to her bed until I was 16. My therapist says it’s because I wanted her love and I didn’t know any other way to get it. All I wanted was love and I have tried so long and hard. It’s crushing to realize the choices I’ve made because of the way I was raised. I feel like I was raised to be a monster. I will be a narcissist, like my mother. And I will never be capable of being loved.

The first half is about how I ended up in the hospital. I almost died. I experienced what it's like to know that you're about to die, and there is nothing anyone can do about it. 

0/10. Would not recommend.

The second half is about what I woke up to a day later. In the dim night, when everyone else was gone. Having to limp out of the hospital in pain. Remembering hands, and the other person, and the giddy-with-insanity-as-it-broke-my-brain realization that nobody was going to come and save me. That this was just going to happen. Trying to sit up. Being pushed back down. Passing back out.

I was 18.

Some completely pulverized piece of me will never accept that this actually happened. What goes hand in hand with that is the irrational, unshakeable certainty that nobody will ever believe me. Despite that already not being true.

At first, I told myself it was because hospitals had to have cameras in those rooms. This couldn't have happened. Then I told myself that my parents would've been there overnight.

Neither of that's true.

And the risk of false memory syndrome doesn't explain the pain.

Or the fact that a serial rapist who worked around that hospital went on trial less than 2 years later, and he looked like every shard of memory that I have.

It's many years later, now. 

Things are usually better than this.

But it's a month from the time this happened, and I'm drinking tonight. A lot. And I just want to say it. The truth. To someone besides my wife.

*This happened.*

Even though the chances of it happening were infinitesimal. 

Statistically, false memory syndrome is infinitely more likely.

But false memories don't leave you checking for blood because you're in so much fucking goddamn pain that you're shaking at having to use the fucking bathroom.

I don't know what anyone can say back to this. I don't know what there is to say. 

*I* don't know what to say about it.

How could you?

The next time I woke up, it was the most beautiful day you've ever seen in your life. There was a huge window in the room, and a phenomenal view of the city and the rolling hills.

Now I have to put up blackout curtains on beautiful springtime days. Because the sunlight is radioactive. It makes me start throwing up before I realize why I'm sick. Every tired fucking year. Despite meds that do help, and therapists who've never been worth a damn.

I stood at that window, just staring out of it. Pathologically docile. I said yes to everyone. I told them everything they wanted to hear. I was human putty, spineless and soft.

Because all I could think was ""I want to go home.""

*Please, let me go home. Please, I need a shower. I feel disgusting. Everything feels disgusting. Please don't force me to stay here.*

When I finally finished jumping through hoops, and went home? 

They guilted me for the cost of the ambulance they'd called to save my life.

I went upstairs. I finally got to take a shower. 

And as soon as I got into it, all I could do was cry.

No, I'm not stable right now. Yes, I'm weird and broken and pathetic.

But you know what? If anyone else had to live through this shit, along with everything that came before it, and everything that came after it? They would be too.

I felt forced by the universe to do some more goddamn healing work. I've dealt with PTSD for the past 13 years and actively learning about trauma for the past 5 years. Had many relapses, triggers, depressive episodes in between.

I have a very strange situation that I'm not sure how to deal with. Trigger Warning: I talk about panic attacks & flashbacks.

Throughout my therapy journey, my psychiatrist and therapist both agree that I also have very intense CPTSD, though I'm not sure its a ""formal"" diagnosis. But it checks out to me. I get triggered and my body immediately reacts as if I'm living in the past.

Here's the problem at hand: My landlady triggers me every morning.

I live in New York City and I managed to luck out on a spot to rent. Its an older lady's entire basement. I have my own bathroom, lots of space.. the works. My rent is insanely low for NYC, which is why I moved there. The lady who owns the house is so nice. I do everything in my power to try and seem like I'm invisible so I don't disturb her and I let her know my gratitude on a consistent basis. The only issue is, I haven't been able to wake up normally in months. 

One of my biggest triggers are footsteps approaching. The sound of footsteps makes my heart race, I get nauseous, I feel like I'm in immediate danger. Every morning for the past few months I have woken up to intense flashbacks of traumatic events associated with footsteps (unfortunately its a lot of bad memories associated with footsteps lmaoooo). My land lady is a small woman, but her footsteps sound like thunder. It wakes me up in a complete panic everytime.

I feel like it is unreasonable for me to ask her to stop walking so heavy down the stairs. This house was built in the 1920's so it probably sounds worse in the basement (where I live) than what it actually is. On top of this, this will not be my first time someone lives above me while living in New York City. To try and counteract this, I started setting my alarm for 5:30 AM. At first it was good, but then she started waking up at 5:30. So I set it for 5:00 AM. Then she started waking up at 5:00 AM. Now I'm waking up at 4:30 AM to avoid the footsteps despite my job starting at 9:00AM. Last night I almost went crazy because I was awoken to footsteps at midnight and at 4:00 AM. I couldn't go back to sleep. 

I take my sleep very seriously and I credit good sleep hygiene with my ability to heal and recover. I do not want to seem like people have to live their life to avoid triggering me. However, at the same time, I feel like this *could* be an easy fix? I don't want to tell a grown woman who owns a 3 bedroom home by herself in new york city what to do in her own house, ya know? Plus, footsteps are always going to be around.

Any advice? I really don't want to intrude on her or anything. She is not noisy at all besides those footsteps, I swear. And the fact she keeps waking right before my alarm just in time to make me feel like I'm for real a scared kid again is starting to have an impact on my daily life. And it sucks because I know for a fact she isn't waking up like ""yeah lets ruin bingbong8382's day!"". But suffering from flashbacks and panic attacks first thing in the morning is exhausting. My work is being effected by this lol. Idk what to do.

I appreciate you help <3

EDIT: thank you everybody for your kind words and suggestions! I’m glad I asked for advice because I really felt uncomfortable asking my land lady to walk lighter. So I’m glad y’all validated me that my hunch was right. I’m actively looking for the products you guys suggested and saving up for some Bose headphones immediately.

It's known that the more you work the higher chance of developing an allergy. Usually people start off with hives or burning eyes before getting asthma or worse. My lucky ass don't have hives but straight to asthma if I go more than 10 min without my mask.

I had to tell my boss and coworkers that I had to report my allergy increase and talk to the people in charge of reducing my risk at work. Out of the people I've told it only seems like 1 coworker and my boss taking it seriously. 

Someone was like look, I have allergies too and showed a few red spots on their arm. Internally I was like ""technically yeah but it's not the same"". I have ezcema I wish I just got hives I'm used to that kind of reaction. I never had asthma. And it triggered my ptsd tbh. Sitting there gasping for air scared the shit out of me.

Only one coworker was like ""are you okay? I bet that was really scary, be careful "" everyone else is just like ""okay and? We all get allergies."" But from what I know of they only get hives when they are touched by the rats (they shouldnt be touching you in the first place so they should rarely be touched) or just a simple OTC allergy pills gets rid of their reactions. 

I feel like I'm being dramatic now. Everyone comparing it to minor hives and I can tell the person who showed me their arm thinks I'm overreacting by getting evaluated by the on-site doctors about my level of risk.

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like many of my family members get it. The greatest example is recently, I drew a somewhat abstract piece about my appetite, which I've noticed is negatively affected when my other PTSD symptoms are on the rise. The process of drawing it helped me process specific elements about the symptom; how I struggle to identify hunger at times and that I need to at least try eating even when I don't feel it, because I need to eat aha.

I've been in a small discord server (<10 people) with friends for a few months and was under the impression we were all in the 18-23 age range based on our conversations and the rules of the server we initially met in. However, I learned today that one of my friends in the server who is another friend(21)'s younger sister is in fact much younger than I thought (14 or 15 years old, I don't know her exact birthday). I am currently 22 turning 23 very soon, so of course learning that the person I have a matching icon with is extremely young is shocking.

The triggering part comes from my own experiences when I was 13-15 years old. I was groomed & abused online via various social media & messaging services by primarily men in their early to mid 20s. Learning our exact age gap after months of friendship (we all talk in our private server almost daily for at least ""hi, hru, etc"" type of stuff) has triggered me and makes me wildly uncomfortable.

I think it's important to say that I have no intentions towards this girl that are inappropriate or harmful; we have only been talking in the server where other people can see the conversations. 

Is there even a good way to address any of this? Or is this just a me problem and it shouldn't be brought up? I'm incredibly lost on what to do right now because I don't want to leave the server and potentially cut off my other friends who are of a more appropriate age nor do I want to upset the young friend since it's not her fault that she's that age and that I'm traumatized.",1677191587.0
275,Been thinking of driving again ..,2,11aamw3,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11aamw3/been_thinking_of_driving_again/,3,"For context.. My family was in a bad car accident when I was 1, and while I was too young to remember it , I’ve heard a lot about it, and how it took my dad. I’m 22 now, and I have been in a few accidents since then.. 

Not to be mean but , my mom is not the best driver, since I was a kid her driving has scared me on some level, she’d drive when she was sick, cut people off , look at her phone that kind of stuff and whenever were in car accidents it’s with her. 

And since the last accident a few years ago I’ve been suffering from ptsd, it was pretty bad at first, I started to have panic attacks in the car and would grip the seat till my fingers hurt, I would be terrified whenever we’d pull onto the road or pass a car pulling onto the lane next to us … I think I was most terrified whenever we’d drive on bridges or next to see hills or ditches , winter driving terrified me even more and every time I was on the road my head would scare me with thoughts of the accidents that could happen at any moment…

I started having terrible nightmares, that started the night we got back from the trip that had the last accident , they would mostly consist of my mom driving us off a cliff I would yell at her to stop but she wouldn’t listen and I could feel us in the air and would wake up the moment we hit the ground.. needless to say the nightmares themselves were traumatizing and I would wake up crying and scared , and I stopped driving for a while because of it 

I haven’t had any nightmares in a while mostly because alot of other things kept happening I guess I had more on my mind, but I’m always scared it’ll come back

I’ve been thinking and planning on of town And if I do that means I’ll have to start driving again.. I stopped driving for years I even sold my car because I really didn’t thinK I’d ever consider it again,  

It hasn’t bothers me in a while and I really can’t stand the thought of staying in this town  but I’m just nervous I’m worried if I try to drive again it’ll just all come flooding back",1677191019.0

277,Insecure about my trauma,2,11a971k,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11a971k/insecure_about_my_trauma/,0,"Trigger warning: I’ll be talking about what happened. Harassment? Assault? I don’t really know how to define it.

So I jumped the gun a bit, I don’t actually have a formal diagnosis. My doctor thinks I might have high functioning PTSD. I have a few friends who says I do as well, but I don’t know. People can be quick to label someone. My GP shouldn’t do that though. I often question the validity of what happened and I’m finally coming to terms with it at least having been traumatic.

So what happened? When I was 6 years old, might have been 7, a much larger mentally retarded boy asked me if I wanted to be together. Me being denser than a loaf of bread thought he wanted to play together and said yes. To my confusion he started cheering and ran off. The next day as I walked to school, he came running at full speed towards me. In the middle of the school grounds he captures me. He picks me up by my upper arms, and kisses me. His drool suffocating me. I couldn’t breathe. He didn’t use the toungue the first time. I kick him in the knee and fall to the ground and I run off. I got bruised on my arms where he was holding me. He chased me.
He would chase me roughly every day for the next 3 years. When he captured me, he would kiss me and hug me. He would roar out my name and make noises, so I would usually hear him coming a long way away.
I have several memories of events with this guy. I remember jumping out of the second floor window when he cornered me in the classroom, and I got in trouble for that. I remember hiding in the bathroom stall and him just barging in unlocking the stall with such ease. I remember my fear the first time he did that. How I froze. I remember him coming to my home, knocking on the door, naked. Shouting my name. Knocking so hard I thought he would knock down the door. He never got in trouble for anything. People saying this was just harmless “boys will be boys” stuff. He was sent away suddenly, and I thought it was over.

As a teenager I spot him in the newspaper. My family had relocated to another city. Coincidentally this is where he had ended up. I started having flashbacks. Feeling like he was running after me again, and I could smell him, like he was actually there. Somehow kids in school found out about -this- and started bullying me about it, calling me a coward for overreacting to this, and a whore for being with a retarded boy. I stop having flashbacks a 18-19, and maybe coincidentally start having migraines. As time goes on i think less about the events, but every now and again I got intrusive memories, but eventually those faded too.

Today I’m in my late 30s, the intrusive memories are coming back. A few weeks ago I encountered someone who reminded me of the the guy and I responded by spending every ounce of my energy to not fall apart. I almost felt I could smell him again. I had to turn my back to the people there as I couldn’t focus on everyone. But I couldn’t leave, because my boyfriend didn’t understand and I would fall apart if I had tried to explain it. I haven’t been able to explain -this- to him before.
So far rain seems to trigger memories, running occasionally does too, and, I’m sorry to say, mentally handicapped people shouting out noises will also trigger memories.. but they’re just memories…
On one hand, this has without a doubt a grip on me, but am I traumatised? I have low self confidence, some depression and some generalised  anxiety. I have a thing about locks where I feel safer if I lock/check the lock twice, but it’s not at an OCD level.",1677187459.0

I’m in my mid-30s, lying next to my wife (who has no clue I’m on Reddit), and suffering another sleepless night with my mind racing to all the possible “worst case” scenarios for my new symptoms. Never did I think I’d be so lost in such a dark mental space after the life I’ve had thus far. 

I’ve lived a privileged life. My parents worked hard to provide, never leaving any request I had unfulfilled, and in turn I studied hard to get into medical school, reaching my dream to qualify as a doctor some years ago. 

But during my residency training, and less than a year after I got married, on one quiet Saturday afternoon, I had a sudden inability to speak, and my speech became slurred for 30s, before my symptoms disappeared as quickly as it started. My heart raced as I was driven to the ER, and was diagnosed with a cryptogenic stroke. Cryptogenic being the key - “cause uncertain”.

My entire life turned upside down since then. From feeling like a superstar doctor, saving lives, I suddenly found myself diagnosed with an illness for which the cause was uncertain. Why did this happen to me? I was upset and angry. But Thankfully, my symptoms had resolved. I was started on chronic medication. I took time off work to reflect if this is a path I wanted to continue on, and chose to do so as I knew I could help many many patients, which I did and have done since. I resumed residency and passed out a few years later as a specialist. However, my mind has never been settled. I’ve struggled a lot mentally.

During my residency, I was focussed on getting through it - with the plan to get to the end and reassess these health issues only then. I started to develop neck pain 2 years ago when I fell whilst carrying my kid, which thankfully my kid herself survived relatively unscathed. I have often ignored my symptoms on the rare occasion it came on, and it was initially manageable. However, recently the symptoms have progressed to cause immense pain : a constant ache down my arm for almost 2-3 months now.. it’s making me miserable! And I know I need to get a MRI scan of my neck done to get a diagnosis of what’s wrong, but I can’t just bring myself to do it.. with common things being common, it could be a tiny slipped disc. But I now also always think that even the worst case scenario like a tumour is possible! And I don’t want to deal with it. I don’t want to know. I don’t want another terrible diagnosis!

As I live this lie of “ignorance is bliss”, I suffer almost daily from the pain - maybe on average 3-4 days a week.. and have some days pain free. The pain comes and goes. I know carrying my kid worsens it, so I’ve stopped doing so which makes me sad. Especially when she looks at me like I’m a half man for not being able to lift her, and I’m only in my mid30s!

My problem is this - my whole life changed when I was diagnosed with the stroke. I was put on medications ever since, and the fact that I’m no longer a super star human being really affected me. It made me realise how vulnerable I am, how fragile life is. And now I feel “sick” - as a mid 30s young man with this history of a stroke. And I have children now - all the more I find myself not wanting to deal with this new neck pain issue that has now converted into an arm pain. Because I’m worried it’s a tumour and I just don’t want to deal with it. Today I can’t sleep - because of this, but I can’t bring myself to get a MRI to acknowledge this and seek help. What do I do? 

Is this PTSD? I’m so afraid of the consequences that came with my previous diagnosis of stroke, that I don’t want to have to deal with another illness whatever that may be. 

Please help me. I can tell it’s also affecting my wife when she keeps telling me to seek medical attention but I refuse. I want to live without any additional illnesses for as long as possible. I pray that my symptoms will just disappear. 

Is this PTSD? Do I need help? Have I not gotten over what happened to me ? I feel so blessed to have survived a stroke, but I don’t want to be labelled with anything else. I feel so young. I’m a doctor - I’m the person who’s meant to be helping the sick. I don’t want to be sick. 

Please lend some advice. 
Thank you.",1677180270.0

But it doesn’t make sense to me. A normal person wouldn’t have gotten ptsd from that. It wasn’t even that big of a deal. I feel like I’m overreacting. 


Tw: sex, rape, choking 

Our sex wasn’t very vanilla. He used to choke me during it. Except it wasn’t choking it was more like strangling. He only used one hand but it would happen so quickly. The color would start draining from everything and it would become fuzzy. My whole body would tingle and then become numb. But he always let go right before I passed out. It took me a minute to function properly again. And even though I told him he probably shouldn’t do it that hard that’s what would always happen. But then it started to happen outside of sex. I think whenever HE was horny. One time we were just eating ramen and watching tv and he turned to me, smirked, and the next thing I knew everything was in black and white. I was a bit scared knowing it could happen at any moment. 

He and I had a rape play kink. Probably from the trauma of me being groomed as a kid. But one time he told me, “I want to rape your unconscious body in a field.” I don’t know why but that particular idea made me feel scared. Maybe it was the fact I’d be unconscious and unconsenting. Or maybe it was the fact I’d be raped in a field and no one could see or hear me. 

To me he’s not a bad person. I thought I was the bad person for a long while after he dumped me. He never told me why. But he did say, “you make me feel like something I’m not. You make me feel like a bad person.” I was confused. I think it was because I cried about everything even if it didn’t matter. 

Afterwards I couldn’t be intimate with anyone for a year. I’d start shaking uncontrollably and not being able to hold myself up. Ofc guys don’t find that attractive. I got a lot of remarks like, “wow you’re really bad at this.” “Does a hand job make you shake.” “Come on please I was so close.” They didn’t care about me. Of course they didn’t. But I still felt like the problem. And those were always the last times I’d ever be intimate with those people. 

I had to switch schools because seeing him in the hallway made my stomach churn. It made me self harm every time I saw him. As in I’d push my skin into the wall as I walked until I bled. No one noticed except my dad. I had horrible paranoia. I was so scared of catching a glimpse of him my flight or fight mode never turned off. I spent my lunches in the bathroom. I didn’t eat. I just sat there. So the only meal I’d have was dinner during the weekdays. I ended up switching to a new school. A virtual one. Because I also had a problem with hyperventilating in the hallways. I still do, but at least it’s one day a week for half the time.",1677158158.0

289,can bad experience with an edible give you ptsd/trauma or is this something else ? help,1,11a22lr,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11a22lr/can_bad_experience_with_an_edible_give_you/,2,"i don’t know if this was a good place to post and i feel like using the word ptsd or trauma is a bit too strong but i just feel so crazy, scared, and confused about this. 

About 2-3 weeks ago i ate an edible for the first time. It wasn’t laced or anything, i got it from a friend (who is absolutely trustworthy) who got it from a dispensary. She had the same gummy before, just saved one for me. I’ve smoked weed before and gotten a little buzzed but never actually high high. The edible was 15mg. I was with my friend in her car and we were either driving around or at parking lots. I didn’t eat beforehand because i wanted it to hit quicker (dumb i know) and i also just kept worrying about what if i freak, what if hours pass and i’m still high, what if my parents find out, etc. before and during my high.

It hit me hard and it felt super super overwhelming that i had to constantly lay back, close my eyes, and breathe. but over all i was handling it surprisingly well. It was a mixture being on the verge of fear and then being completely giddy about it. we had food and we decided to eat but looking at my food.. it didn’t look right. long story short i freaked myself out threw up twice and started panicking really badly. when the high wore off i was still very much shaken up and ever since then i’ve just been having constant anxiety. 

honestly for the first week and a half after, it came it went and i was scared of being sick or anxious again but i was able to manage. Some days were good and i didn’t think bad or confuse my bodily sensations as me being sick again. but other days im shaking because i randomly feel extremely anxious to a point where i get sick.. and then i get more anxious because now im feeling sick and the last time i was this way was with the edible. 

I feel like it’s gotten worse very recently. I think i felt sick or made myself feel sick one night and had a panic. Ever since then i haven’t been able to move on or to calm down. i don’t know if personal issues recently have also amplified it too and i feel like not only do i get anxiety about.. anxiety lol (or being sick) but also about my situation and surroundings. It’s affected my eating habits and i’ve either been eating very little or not at all. My stomach currently hurts and i feel sick because i barely have anything in me. i had a little bit of oatmeal, smoothie, and currently trying to snack on some crackers but i can’t finish or continue on without feeling bad. Both hunger or eating makes my stomach hurt, and then it makes me panic. it’s a vicious cycle.

i go back and forth between the roots, either the stress i had with the edible gave/worsen my anxiety or it was so traumatizing that it’s still basically stuck on me and anything can set it off (esp feeling sick or being around weed). or i thought maybe emetophobia but i never had a problem with vomit before in my life ever. like yeah i hated it, never wanted to do it and i haven’t done it in forever until then, i never wanna be in a room w it.. but never anything like a phobia i mean i’ve been super sick before and never had a panic. Yesterday my stomach hurt and i took medicine but i threw up and i felt fine after. i was shaken up because of yk aftermath of throwing up like i felt regular sickness but then later on i randomly started feeling anxious. was i anxious about throwing up or something else, or a combo of things i don’t know. maybe there’s another option where there’s deeper meaning instead.. like maybe this anxiety is just about losing control and being vulnerable like that 

Sometimes i wonder if i should just make myself throw up to convince you brain to shut up but most times what i’m feeling is literally anxiety nausea not actual nausea. I’m going to see a doctor today to speak about this because it’s ruining my life and to ask see if i’ve damaged myself medically and physically due to the poor habits i’ve developed. i can’t do things that i used to do before and it’s like i’m no longer my old self. I also started seeing a therapist and had my first session a couple of days ago to help out.

It feels stupid and dramatic to feel like this after one bad experience with an edible. And a lot of it is my fault because i keep overthinking or dwelling on negative thoughts or about every sensation because i keep thinking about how i felt when i panicked and i get so scared of feeling like that again. i try to be within the anxiety, like accept it, and to be less hard on myself but this is so exhausting and terrifying i want it to be over.",1677170250.0

So, I’ve been diagnosed with CPTSD along with a slew of other stuff. I was finally beginning to feel better on a new medication cocktail, and I was turning my life around. I was going to the gym, eating better, sleeping better, and being more productive. However, this weekend is a major trauma anniversary- the 2nd anniversary of my rape. I’m currently pursuing a university case against my rapist, which has helped but is also stirring up old feelings. Plus, I’m extra on-edge because I got rejected from my dream grad school the day before what would have been my ex and I’s anniversary.

As a result of all these compiling things, I’ve had nightmares for like a week, and they are causing me to have debilitating panic attacks and agoraphobic episodes during the day. I’m becoming afraid to sleep because of how horrific these dreams are, which is making the daytime episodes worse. I am at my wit’s end.

I’m so frustrated because I was finally doing better after years of bs. I was finally feeling back on track and ready to handle life again. Instead, I have to fight against my subconscious to even cook myself a meal instead of order-in because of my agoraphobia. My PTSD is actively becoming expensive, especially since it might be triggering an auto-immune response.

I am tired of always feeling so abnormal. I want to build a life for myself, and I can’t do that if i’m constantly hiding and experiencing fight-or-flight. Words of support would be welcomed, but honestly thanks for taking the time to read.",1677152799.0

This happened last night. I woke up crying. I had a terrible dream about a couple of key traumas. Now I’m left awake feeling… angry, ashamed, sad. I feel like the trauma just happened. It felt so real in the dream. 

How do I take a step back and let go of the dream if it’s about trauma that I haven’t gotten over in real life?",1677152457.0

This put pretty much every campus around those schools, along with the schools themselves, on lockdown.  I'm in Twin Falls at the College Of Southern Idaho.  CSI went on lockdown and people were terrified.  Several students, including myself, were in tears.  We were then told that they were false threats, all made by the same phone number.  As someone who has PTSD from gun violence, that is a sick way to get attention.  Making people fear for their lives or the lives of people around them is not okay.  I know there are whispers that a few people at Canyon Ridge High School heard gunshots, but there's no evidence of that and I speculate some sort of mass hysteria.

I'm (F25) sleepy, tired, and exhausted. This time of year is particularly triggering since more than one trauma has happened by the end of February and at the beginning of March. The one that caused me to seek help for PTSD happened the night between the last day of February and the first day of March. This year, I feel quite good since my symptoms have gotten better even though I've recently faced some fresh trauma and a pretty nasty breakup. However, something very different is going on. I tried to switch up my sleep patterns, eat more healthily, meditate a lot, etc. but I still feel sleepy and tired all the time. Not just mentally, but also physically. I could sleep for days. I'm highly functional, and work and study don't suffer (yet). Maybe I try and shy away from potential flashes, or I try to face the trauma in dreams - my dreams are crazily vivid and life-like. Sometimes, I'm even sleepwalking and yelling, and you guessed it - I wake up tired after 10 hours of dreaming and processing information. I don't feel like I've been sleeping at all. However, I generally don't feel too anxious nor this messes up with my life - except for the social side, that segment is mostly non-existent for the previous 3 years, ever since the most triggering one happened (I simply don't trust people and I enjoy my own company, but that's the story of another time). I'm aware this could be a sign of depression, but I'm very familiar with it, and this is not depression, it's something new. Am I reliving the cocoon stage of healing? Is this a healthy coping mechanism? Does it happen to anyone else? Anything would be helpful, thanks in advance. ❤️",1677151889.0

night two was slightly better. my dad drove a bulldozer into my current home, jumped out and started shooting at me and my mom. i grabbed my mom's gun and shot him in the chest, woke up, then dreamt again of ozzy osbourne being my school's principal.


night three i dreamt that my stepdad was just yelling at me for something stupid, so i swung at him. apparently i put all my force into it because i woke up throwing the punch and i fell on the ground.

But, before she always makes excuses to her promises like us hanging out but then she makes an excuse the last minute, I always text first, and sometimes well most of the time she never responds to any of them, also the time she lied to her then best friend saying that I lied about something she said when she did said it and her best friend believed her and told me please not to lie and I took it in like it was my fault, also asked why when I told her the next time I stay with her when she was down after something but said it coldly, and also when I told her I was banned from the art room she said okay and just left me at the spot to talk to her friends and stuff (also she never came to my lunch table as she promised). So anyway, I told her sorry about my mom calling her a problem child and told her she didn't mean it, and she didn't respond I kept saying sorry on text after two days of her not responding. But then, she got the nerve to basically let her best friend now that she was upset and so her best friend gave my phone number away to a stranger and I never forgot what that stranger told me that it was my fault, that that girl has every right to not be friends with me anymore, and that I'm a coward. And it just went on and on and so I got to her best friend and her best friend told me well we could've still been friends if you hadn't done what you done and I told her all I wanted to do was be your friend and I found the true meaning of friendship thanks to them (or so I thought) and her best friend replied by saying well I don't care leave us alone and if you want to know what the girl did she did absolutely nothing but just let this stranger and her best friend did the talking for her. And so after that, I still kept saying sorry on email like 5 times but she didn't respond in fact while at school she seemed happier with all these new friends and her and her best friend seem to have not been friends anymore. Anyway, some time later, I encountered her again and I asked her did she care how much of a broken person she made me she said she cared but she was just hurt by what I said and I hated when she said that cause I was like at that moment when did you prove it, and also she awkwardly nodes when I ask her do you care for me like she's saying but yet again it's not their, and then I told her I will never forgive her she said okay coldly, and then me feeling like an idiot and traumatized, I asked her why didn't she say anything she just looked at me with a cold look and didn't respond to the question she just went by on her class. After that, I felt mad, angry, and depressed, heck I felt this for a long time and I still am depressed. Oh and for those of you wondering, she still after that moment, is laughing with boys and enjoying her life and playing innocent to people, in fact her excuse before we're things like I gotta hang out with my friends or my mom said I can't hang out with boys till I'm 16.

I'm gonna describe some of the thing that happen to me, so caution Trigger Warning here.


I used to live in a Big happy family of five kids, and my older brother, the older one was rebellious, he didn't want to work, he didn't want to be a slave for the the system he says, and when he was 18, he go try his chance on the road, living with some gypsie people (hope that not offensive, I don't know other words) 
He come back to the house 1 year later, I was 5 years old.
He explain in front of me to my father that he was addicted to heroin, and he prostitute himself to pay the drugs. Even if I was 5, I fully understand what he mean. That night, he was on crisis because he don't have his drug, so he go total freakout. He do things to me, he forced me, then he beat his gilrfriend nearly to death, then take a gun in his backpack and he say that he gonna kill everybody in this fucking house and kill himself. I was crying of course, i was only 5 years old. And as he saw me cry, he stop. He say to his gilrfriend to get on her knees and thank me, because of she was still alive that night it was because of me. Having an adult, maybe 19/20 years old thanking you, crying, ect, that fucked up m'y mind.
Next day my father tell him to leave. 

He come back 2/3 years later, swearing he was not addicted anymore. A lie. 
That night new crisis, beat up his new girlfriend, and he kill his dog, slitting his troat in front of me. 
He go, Come back years later and cycle continue.
Last time I saw him I was 12 i think. 
Even with all of this, I was a very happy kids, the funny one ! 
The one who was smart, happy, Always on a journey, going to different country with great friends ! 
No ptsd, some nightmare sometime, but I was okay, living a good life.

And One day, I was 21, preparing myself to a day of work, a very normal day, my heart start hurting, feeling sweaty, vision blurring, it got worse and worse, go to hospital, complete check of my body and ... Nothing wrong ! 
It was strange but okay, few days later same thing.
Going to hospital, check, nothing wrong.
The third they say to me, that maybe it was not physical, but more psychological.
That's how my ptsd was diagnostic. 

It's been 3 years now, with good and bad times. And since few weeks I was asking to myself, did one day I will become the same person that I was before, that good happy daring kid ?

Plus my last therapist before my current one died tragically and it took me a long time to find this one. I had to explain to my parents how wrong it was to do that and even put my therapist in that position. I can’t believe I even had to explain that.,1677003471.0

I was hanging out with my boyfriend M(22) and I just went into shut down mode and started remembering all of these past memories that have been locked away in my mind since they first happened. I don't think anything really triggered it because we were just watching an innocent cartoon movie. Of course this has led to me having some pretty intense anxiety over the past few days which has been interfering with my daily activities. Does anyone know what could have caused all these old memories to resurface years later, especially without having a clear ""trigger"" for them?

Today however my dad went into spine surgery and I got pretty triggered. 

My sister and brother were at the hospital all day with my dad but only two visitors at a time, so I waited till my mom got off work. We went together and my sister said he was done with surgery. Turns out he went into second surgery. 

I was already feeling really weird from being in the hospital so I didn’t want to have to wait 4 hours while I could also could be studying for my exam I need to pass (something my dad really wants me to do)

I freaked out because my brother was shaming me for wanting to leave. I definitely overreacted but I’ve already been feeling misunderstood by him recently. 

For context with my PTSD my ex partner of 5 years mother died last year in March. I spent all week in the hospital with him. Sleeping there, missing work etc. it was traumatic for me as I watched her take her last breathe. 

2 days later my (other) ex committed suicide. 

3 weeks later my ex who’s mother died had a near death experience I witnessed that I struggled with for a long time (still)

Less then five months later while we were at burning man my ex told me he was in love with his boss. 

Being at hospitals for me apparently brings up all the twisted emotions of everyone dying plus some.

330,Sleep medication possibly having a negative interaction with my PTSD?,1,118lrxv,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/118lrxv/sleep_medication_possibly_having_a_negative/,3,"Hey, everyone. To start, I was diagnosed with PTSD about a year and a half ago after suffering instances of SA. Last September, I began to notice an improvement. My flashbacks and nightmares notably reduced, and I was ruminating on the events themselves a lot less. I have always had sleep issues, which were semi-manageable because I've grown so accustomed to only sleeping a few hours a day. Eventually, though, I wanted to confront these problems and so I brought them up to my neurologist. She firstly prescribed me with Ambien. It worked like a charm (no surprise) but I was stressing myself out way too much about the possibility of becoming addicted to it. I'm also diagnosed with bipolar, so I have to be extremely careful about the meds I'm taking. (Disclaimer: my neurologist knows this and prescribed me with the Ambien anyway). Moving on, I stopped taking the Ambien myself and at our next appointment, I told her that I wanted to try something else. She prescribed me with Dayvigo. I was pretty excited about this, seeing as it wasn't an addictive medication and it was something that I could take long-term. 

Once I started taking it, I noticed that it would do its job of putting me to sleep, but I cannot stay asleep. When I am sleeping, I keep having incredibly graphic nightmares about SA. I'll force myself to go back to bed, then have another nightmare, then wake up the next hour. Rinse and repeat until I have to get up and get ready for the day. I cope by suppressing things and so I just ignore it and try to tell myself that they're just dreams, and it must just be me getting used to the medication, or that I'm already stressed so that's why I'm having nightmares. I will come up with anything possible to make myself ""feel better"" so that I can just get on with my day, but it's getting increasingly really difficult and translating into my daily life. I find myself becoming a lot more avoidant, self-isolating because social interaction is too exhausting/anxiety-inducing, re-engaging with trauma-related compulsions, overly jumpy at any sort of loud noise/sudden movement, feeling like I'm going to have a panic attack when I'm out in public (especially so if a man is near me, even walking past me in a store or something), and overall just super paranoid/irritable/mistrustful of others. I also find myself disassociating again in public and wearing hats so that I don't have to see anyone's faces around me. It feels awful because I've made so much progress and I feel like I'm slowly returning to square 1. I want to bring this up to my neurologist, so that she keeps my PTSD in mind when prescribing a different medication, but my mom sees her too and I really fear the chance that she'll find anything out. I'm 22 so that's probably not viable, but it still freaks me out.

Has anyone else had a similar experience on Dayvigo/other sleep meds? I'm not sure if I should just stop taking it, but at this point my anxiety is so high that I feel like I won't be able to sleep at all.",1677030903.0

(Unregulated internet access since about 9)  


Since the age of maybe 11, something would happen, and I would block various online friends, change over to completely different accounts and start over, returning to these old accounts used to give me horrible panic attacks. I do believe I've been doing better, not great, there's still a lot of aspects of social media + the internet that freaks me out sometimes, and sometimes I’ll find myself just muting everyone for a while, but I haven't been suddenly disappearing.  


Recently though, one of my friends uncovered an old twitter account of mine that I had owned between 2020/21- and it freaked me out. This person, I really do think she's great, she's done nothing wrong; hell, I gave her the name I used to go by on there, and I had not expressed that there would be any issue with her looking at it- so just to be clear, she's done absolutely nothing wrong.. and that's the issue. Something about someone I know now seeing the 'me' from before I had done a complete switch over makes me feel like I have to block not only her, but other people who we both closely associated with.

So now, here I am, mostly trying to distract myself. I've already considered looking for new names, deleting everything, or just never replying to them, i hate how easy it would be, i've done it so many times before. Realistically, I think the easiest option would just be to talk to these people, explain to them that I'm taking some sort of break, but it's terrifying, and never something i've done before. For now, I'll probably just go to bed, and try deal with it in the morning, but I really do feel like I'm just going to end up falling back into this cycle of forming an entire new identity, dropping it, and moving onto the next.",1677028328.0

A while back I applied to a scientific study where people who have experienced life crises (including things that led to PTSD) will get individually tweaked internet based treatment + weekly support from a therapist over 8 weeks.

Two weeks ago I found out that I'm going to be in the wait list control group, which basically means that I'll get the full treatment but after the first group is done with theirs.

There's a several years long wait list at my local psychiatry services for similar forms of treatment so this feels like a big win even though I think the treatment will only have limited effects on me (bad experiences with past treatment/therapy so I find it hard to be optimistic).

But above all else, the therapist I got allotted is just so nice to talk to. He listens, he actually seems empathetic (whereas other therapist have seemed to fake it) and in just an hour long phone call with him he accomplished more than other therapists have done over the course of months!

Just feeling seen and understood has helped a lot with my self-esteem so far. Hopefully there will be more moments like this throughout the treatment.

I stopped cold turkey. Then on day four I caved had a single stick but it made me feel horrible. I was able to put it out without entirely finishing it and do some inner reflecting.
Idk how to explain this. I’m not so much addicted to the nicotine or having trouble with the withdrawaling from it bc of the actual substance.  I quit cigarettes several times in the past but always fall back to it. 
But rather my brain has used it as a short coping Mechanism that mimics deep breathing since the early stages of my ptsd lol when I don’t do it 
It gives me anxiety bc I could feel all the physical tension I’ve been putting on myself rather than dealing with it and it’s like reminding me of all the emotions and memories that are attached to this stupid stick that inevitably landed me with ptsd. It no longer serves me but my brain feels as if it’s hard wired to not “let go” even though I’m saying LETS DO THIS. My mind is made up like a non smoker however there’s shame and guilt in letting go of a bad habit. 
// I wanna add on the topic of “letting go” use to have a fear of missing out as a child that creeped into adulthood as I was learning ways to cope with new depression and issues. I would stay up super late drinking with friends venting bc it felt good even though if it makes sense I didn’t want to? I’ve just moved to a better area where there isn’t so many triggers.

It felt good to go home realize I was somewhat restoring power back to myself I didn’t have in the past. Didn’t miss out on much at all. Few years ago would have never been able to say no to a social interaction that didn’t suit me. I would often people please bc part of me feels a lack of connection and loneliness but it has nothing to do with wanting attention from people.

last night i fell asleep probably around 12 am and woke up at 4 to pee and couldn’t go back to sleep. my mind was just kind of racing about all kinds of things, not really trauma related, so i stayed up for a while on pintrest and like planning meals, shit like that. eventually got up and had breakfast and did some chores and fell asleep in the livingroom at maybe 9 or 10? then had a series of nightmares revolving around sexual abuse and just people being creeps.

i rarely dream about actual events that happened to me, just kind of similar things or things that would fall under that scope with a wide variety of characters, sometimes people that actually abused me, sometimes other people i know, sometimes strangers or dream people that i don’t know…

sometimes these dreams end in me shaking my head back and forth while crying irl, and recently developed to me punching my partner while still asleep O_o i’m often afraid to go back to sleep because i don’t want more nightmares.

basically this really sucks and i’m always tired. i used to smoke weed which prevented dreams but i decided to stop because 1. it made me really paranoid 2. not legal in my state 3. too many munchies and 4. really just became a bad habit.

I was 18 when my dad booked a trip back east (he was from Boston but moved to California where he met my mom) and we were going to go to my cousin's wedding. The flight he scheduled back was united flight 93 Newark to San Francisco, the one that was hijacked on 9/11/01. Although the wedding was in Boston my dad was a money saver and this flight was a better deal. 

Anyhow at the last minute my dad decided to cancel the trip. I was very upset as I was looking forward to going and expressed my discontent about it to him. His reason was he just didn't feel we should go and he wanted to save money.

Well that morning 9/11/01 my dad called my mom from work to turn on the TV and also wake me up.

About several months later I joined a Christian fundamentalist church that told me I was given a second chance. I left it two years later coming to my senses.

However I still think about that flight sometimes the people on it. Why did we get to escape and they didn't. What if my dad didn't cancel. My dad died in 2013 of natural causes. 

The youngest passenger was 20 from San Diego. Had I gone I would have been the youngest. That sends chills down my spine. My older brother would have been left with no parents or sister. 

For awhile I continued to fly. Money constraints have made it difficult to take flying trips but I've been doing a tad better financially and now I'm thinking of going to NYC w my daughter. Yet sometimes I get panic attacks thinking what if it happens this time like final destination. I have nightmares of being in a plane crash every few years. Each year during 9/11 anniversary I begin to feel very weak and this bad impending feeling of doom.

I just thought I'd reach out and see if anyone knows better than me. Anyway, I was wondering if ptsd compounds at all? Not sure if that's how to describe it. I was diagnosed with ptsd and the initial incident that I won't get into happened when I was very young. But I have flashbacks and triggers relating to my early home life, bullying at school/work and from a boss at my last job who treated me really badly and was verbally degrading me, as well as triggers from the original incident. 

I feel bad because I'm not sure if the proceeding experiences are bad enough to have developed ptsd from, especially as I already was experiencing it. I'm worried this makes me too sensitive? Thanks",1676963950.0

I got out of an abusive relationship about two months ago. She is an alcoholic, gaslit me, manipulated me, SA'd me, so on and so forth... and ended the relationship by trying to kill herself in front of me. 

Needless to say this was all very traumatizing for me, to the point where my therapist thinks I have PTSD and I'm going in for my first EMDR session on thursday. 

I'm a graduate student in a *very* demanding program with an overwhelming amount of work to do at any given point. I'm a year and a half into my three year program and so far the workload has been tough, but this term has been different. I don't know what it is but I simply cannot bring myself to work. 

Is this a symptom of PTSD? 

Is this just good ol' fashioned burnout? 

Some combination thereof?

Is there something I can do about it? 

I understand that time, therapy and self care are the best things for it but in the meanwhile my work is piling up and I'm struggling with everything in my life.",1676955670.0

355,Fear of driving,9,117d9qz,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/117d9qz/fear_of_driving/,2,"Hi. Just want to say first off that I’m very grateful this subreddit exists. I’m not a big poster but I am a big reader and your vulnerability, bravery, and insight have been a huge source of comfort and information to me. I’m one of those people who have such a bad case of PTSD that I have gotten shuffled from doctor to doctor because I’m “beyond their level of expertise.” Luckily, I finally have a psychiatrist who has taken me off medications (some that I’ve been on since I was 17 and I’m currently 41) that were actually making my flashbacks worse. I also have the great fortune to be able to see a trauma psychologist once a week. She’s not cheap and I’m struggling to pay for her but she’s a constant source of validation and safety. 

Anyways, I was thrust into this not-so-lovely disorder because of a variety of particular incidents, but the one I really need to focus on right now is my fear of driving. In 2019 was a passenger in a head-on collision less than a mile from my house with my 2 year old in the car. She’s fine now but we both sustained traumatic brain injuries and I was left with severe PTSD, migraines, occipital neuralgia, what appear to be non-epileptic seizures from the accident (I take low dose Benzos as needed for them). I spent 5 months in occupational therapy learning to drive again but I’ve never felt comfortable and avoid driving as much as possible. I live in Atlanta which is a nightmare of a place to drive for anyone but it’s particularly terrifying for me. I am a very good and very defensive driver but it leaves me feeling incredibly drained and usually with a headache if I drive any more than down the street. Also, being the super safety-minded, PTSD-fueled person I am, I’m kind of afraid that driving with this fear combined with coming off a bunch of medications could lead to a seizure or migraine that could cause me to hurt someone else while behind the wheel. My neurologist and psychiatrist have never told specifically told me not to drive but are very encouraging of me not doing something like driving that makes me feel worse (at least for now).

I was able to push through the fear by taking Uber/Lyft rides with absolute angels who drove gently and carefully, let me listen to Lizzo for strength, and allowed me to play my baritone ukulele in the back seat to distract myself. Kinda funny in retrospect. 

Anyhoo, it was amazing for me to take Ubers/Lyfts then and it continues to be the only way I can travel around this city without being triggered to the point where I have a migraine or am just absolutely DONE for the rest of the day. The big problem is that these rides add up and are an extreme cost that I can’t afford right now. 

I live in a neighborhood where I can walk my kid to school, I use Instacart, and I have a super safe car (that sits in my driveway most of the time) but it’s nearly impossible to live and work in ATL without getting into a car. I’m a single mom and I don’t have family in town and I’m not one to ask people for rides because I don’t like putting people out and when I ask it makes me feel worse. Also the public transit buses stopped coming to my part of town (Tucker) when the pandemic hit. 

My question is…does anyone know if there is some kind of help that exists for people with debilitating PTSD who are afraid of driving? Like a Netflix for car service that you pay once a month and can use for unlimited rides? Or a non-profit that assists single moms with PTSD? I’ve asked my doctors and done quite a bit of googling but nobody knows of anything (at least for civilians). 

If this tells you anything about how bad my fear is, I have an invitation to get out of town without my child for the first time in years to go to Mardi Gras in NOLA where I was born and I’m sitting here hyperventilating and crying about the drive down. I trust the person driving but his car is too low/too old/too blah blah blah for me to feel safe driving down there in it. He even bought me a plane ticket back so it’s just this one trip I have to make it through. I do plan on bringing an instrument to play and I hope he likes Lizzo.

Wanted to share my feelings with people who might understand. Today I had my second EMDR session. I was raped last summer. Two weeks ago we started with an image from that moment, which triggered an intense panic attack. The week following was a living hell, the image was stuck in my head and my body was stuck in that moment. I didn't sleep for more than 2 hours in a row. Last week I told my therapist I was not ready to revisit the memory during the session, because I could already notice myself falling back to suicidal thoughts, due to the lack of sleep and the stress. 
Today I felt quite stable so I wanted to try the EMDR again. I was very nervous, since last time was so hard. This time I didn't really feel that stressed, but as soon as we started to revisit I felt this extreme sadness. For the first time since it happened I cried over the fact that I got raped. I just couldn't stop. After the session my therapist made some small talk to make sure I would get home safe, which helped, but as soon as I got home I broke down again. Tears after tears after tears. I feel this overwhelming sadness that I had not felt about this yet and I also can't remember ever feeling this intensely sad. 
I feel like it's important for the healing process, but jeez, it is a hard time. The image is stuck in my head again and my body feels like it's not mine, and all I can do is cry. My dear friend is coming over to stay the night at mine so I don't have to be alone.

Then he was pissed and told me it’s my responsability and went to sleep making me feel bad because of what I did. I don’t like smoking either but I‘m used to do it since it was a way to cope for me. 

I told him not to treat me like this because he made me feel bad that I hurt myself and wasn’t trying to comfort me or at least ask nicely to stop it. I told him I‘ll stop but I feel so bad that I did it. 

We talked again this morning and he said that he won’t be there for me if I keep hurting myself purposely because his BPD has been getting better and he doesn’t want to feel worse again when he‘s confronted with me hurting myself.

On July 13th 2022, my dog was in a car accident with his dog walker. She had a head on collision with another car and he was sitting in the front of the van with her. He was secured with a dog seat belt to his collar but it snapped in the force of the accident. The dog walker phoned me straight away and I rushed to the scene. I waited so long for all the people to get taken out of the vehicles, the passenger of the other car was in a really bad way and they were slumped forward in their seat. They required several paramedics to remove them from the car. Once everyone was clear, my Dad checked over my dog and lifted him out of the van. His injuries were catastrophic and the emergency vet was over 30mins away. He passed away at the side of the road within minutes but they were not peaceful. He was one month shy of his 3rd birthday and he was the first dog that I raised all by myself. More than 7 months on and I'm not coping, most days have passed in a daze and I've just tried to keep hanging on and keep things normal. Over the months, my mood has been low and I've been irritable at times. I've had trouble concentrating at work and some days, intense memories of the accident come back and I'm immediately crying and feeling panicked. My sleep has been disturbed, I've tossed and turned every night and recently I've started remembering dreams I've had that become deeply disturbing. I'm so exhausted, I slept 18 hours straight one day last week due to the pressure I'm feeling. In December I started on antidepressants and two weeks ago, after speaking to the doctor again and explaining how I was struggling, she diagnosed me with PTSD and I've been referred for trauma counselling.

Over the two weeks, I've become more aware of my symptoms and I've had several flashbacks and panic attacks. My biggest issue now is that I keep waking up in the middle of the night with shortness of breath, chest tightness and a racing heart. I can't get back to sleep after this and it happened again last night, I've taken the morning off work and spoken to the doctor again. They're prescribing propranolol for the anxiety and stressed the benefit of therapy again but I'm still waiting for a call from the trauma counselling team. I hate that this is happening, I hate feeling this way and I feel so horrendous. I feel so weak, I feel like a burden and I'm stressed about the time I've taken off work so far. My manager isn't the most empathetic and she isn't the best at reassurance and I'm struggling to feel supported in the workplace.

This doesn't feel like bad enough trauma to have PTSD, it was really horrible watching what my boy went through but I feel like people around me think I should be over it because he was ""just a dog"". He was my everything though and he got me through the pandemic and was my only companion most days. He looked out for me as much as I looked after him. There's no justice in his death either as dogs are just seen as property under the law. I'm not even privvy to any updates regarding the case because I'm ""not a victim or witness"". I believe my dog walker is being charged and I've heard some updates through the grapevine that the passenger had pretty bad injuries and needed to spend an extended period of time in hospital. I just don't know how to begin working through this and it just feels like it's getting harder and harder. I don't want to be a burden to those I love. I just want the old me back again. I just wish the accident never happened. 

Thank you to everyone who read this far. I just needed to scream into the void about how unfair all this is.",1676897559.0

The purpose of this is to make the victim believe they are less than, and to subtly convince them that they aren’t worthy of better treatment. This often starts in small, less offensive ways, and builds in intensity and frequency as the victim becomes more and more accustomed to the name-calling.”

I got diagnosed with PTSD, dissociation disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.
Things recently have been kind of hard, which made me relapse hard into my dissociation. At the same time I have been discussing much with my therapist about the cause of my PTSD, which we were never really able to understand.
This until yesterday night; after a night out with my friends I went back home and had a proper realization moment. I was pretty stoned, which is okay I have been smoking for years now and it has helped my anxiety a lot, but in my ""trip"" i guess i was able to figure out the main reason of my traumas.
It's not like a suddenly remembered a specific episode or anything, it's as if the fog around my childhood got off and everything started to be clear and not blurry anymore.
I've had a dysfunctional family and abusive father, but only now I was able to see his actions as abusive.
Now that I've acknowledged the reality tho I do not feel much, apart from sadness and kind of a numb feeling. I really don't know what the next steps should be : what I should do today or who I should be with, what kind of environment I should put myself into in order not to have a strong relapse or panic attacks.

I've said to myself for so many years that it's ""weird that I don't have PTSD"" but just shrugged it off as an ""eh, not everyone gets PTSD"". Just chalked everything up to anxiety and depression.

Very recently, I was able to admit and realize that my mom verbally and physically abused me as a child, and continued to verbally abuse me as an adult. I won't  bore you with the details although if you want you can read about it [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/10h8ohb/i_finally_realize_i_was_physically_abused/) She threatened to kill me many times in my childhood, and on a couple occasions almost went through with it. 

I feel...I feel pissed off at my therapist. She keeps cancelling appointments on me. She has cancelled every other appointment with me for the past three months now. Yes, I am going to get a new therapist - but it won't be for at least another month, because I'm in kind of an important spot with her right now (what with recently ""discovering"" the physical abuse).

My therapist said she's been suspecting I have PTSD for years, but never brought it up to me because she ""didn't want to overwhelm me"" or for me to ""feel worse from knowing"". Totally bullshit, btw. I think people have a right to know these things.

Rant over - I'm currently in need of help for what to do when I'm having an episode. The reason the PTSD was hard to recognize is because my PTSD rarely comes with memory flashbacks. It's usually me briefly (for 1 second) remembering something unpleasant, and then I feel ""antsy"".

My ""antsy"" feeling is something I hate - I have on several occasions driven to another state impulsively to try to escape the feeling. I did this most recently in January, even. I binge eat to try to escape. I'm trying to form better  habits, so recently my avoidance takes the form of exercise. 

I don't know how to ""sit through"" an episode. I don't know what to do. I'll do anything to make this stop. Is guided mindful meditation a way to ""sit through"" an episode? Doing that helps, but I'm not thinking about the things that upset me, so it feels like that's just another form of avoidance. I try to take hot showers to calm myself down, but I tell myself that's my time to ""relax"" and again I just continue to avoid and feel bad and avoid and feel bad.

I was diagnosed with PTSD almost 10 years ago. I learned some coping strategies based on mindfulness and went back to work.

Since then I have continued to practice mindfulness, meditation and studied a heap of philosophy to give myself as many tools as I can to deal with situations as they arise.

Lately I’ve had a return of some of the issues. On reflection I realised that many memories still trigger extreme emotional reactions. Ordinarily if they come up I bring myself back to the present and focus on sensory inputs. Again this is coping. After using coping and/or avoidance for many years I’m curious if there is a more thorough way to treat ptsd.

I’m wondering if there are any strategies to deal directly with the trauma and work through it. Reframe it and live a full and happy life without concern for situations I may need to avoid or the risk of extreme reactions.

I’ve been reading a lot about psylocibin and MDMA being used for this. But these treatment options aren’t currently available in my country. 

Does anyone have any recommendations for other methods that might work? Perhaps EMDR?

389,Is it normal for anxiety symptoms to come and go in waves?,17,116h3mz,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/116h3mz/is_it_normal_for_anxiety_symptoms_to_come_and_go/,4,"I’m 20 years old and started having anxiety about a year ago. Before that I never really had bad anxiety, but all of a sudden I started having panic attacks, derealisation and weird physical sensations. I first thought there was something physically wrong with my body, but after going to the hospital several times without finding anything out of the ordinary, the conclusion is that I have anxiety.

I had a messed up childhood and I’ve experienced a lot of traumatic events. I have a lot of racing thoughts that I try to run away from. But my panic attacks usually don’t appear in correlation to these thoughts, in fact they most often appear out of the blue when I’m focused on something else. That’s why for a long time I thought there was something medically wrong with me. 

I’m a sensitive person, but I always try to distract myself from my feelings. Often, for example when I get flashbacks from traumatic events, it’s like I have feelings but I don’t really feel them if that makes sense. It’s like I didn’t experience the trauma and I feel sad and emphatic for someone else who experienced it, although it in fact happened to me.

During my panic attacks it’s different. I instead feel very scared and emotionally vulnerable. Usually I’ll just stare blankly and try not to think about anything, because everything from noice to memories of traumatic events cause a lot of distress. I recently discovered that during my panic attacks, if I try to process my feelings or reflect over a traumatic event despite the extreme emotional stress and discomfort, I actually start feeling better after a few minutes. The anxiety symptoms ease and I become calmer.

Sry for mentioning stuff unrelated to the title. I’m currently feeling a bit anxious and thought sharing my experience would calm me down.

My question is - is it normal for anxiety symptoms to come and go? Weeks can go where I hardly feel any anxiety at all. Then there can be periods where I have several panick attacks a day. Is this normal? Can anyone relate to this, or anything else I’ve written?",1676824269.0

My PTSD got so bad after being scammed by a person who took $10K pretending to be a licensed contractor, did demolition to my home and then ran off with the money when he was caught lying about his credentials, that I wasn't able to preform my job anymore.

&#x200B;

It was a tipping point to PTSD that has been stringing back for many years. I would just go to work and I couldn't think straight, or I would cry secretly or just hold it in and let the pain and tension run through my body. My Fitbit was even going in the yellow and red while I was sitting at my desk because of panic attacks.

&#x200B;

The police and state wont help me, I don't think they are taking me seriously because I'm in a state of panic, crying or screaming when I try to talk to them, they wont even allow my mother to be used as a mental health translator.

&#x200B;

I got a free attorney and he looked over the evidence and said this was without a doubt a crime and no judge would state otherwise. Even showing me the law that impersonating a contractor is a misdemeanor on the first offences.

&#x200B;

I'm to afraid to go to civil court because if the person was willing to lie and take so much money, and the cops and state wont help me, why would I feel safe going into a room with a person that works for the state and the person who lied to take money from me?

&#x200B;

I was told I can't get therapy by 4 different therapists, all turning me away saying I need intensive outpatient care because I'm in a PTSD episode, that my insurance can't seem to figure out how to cover, even if they did I wouldn't be able to afford to leave work 3 days a week for half days to get the treatment. Another reason I quit my job, to try to get on Medicaid so I can get treatment, since I can't balance work and mental health anymore anyways I might as well choose mental health now so I can help others later, instead of trying to balance something that I'm not able to.

&#x200B;

Without the police to help protect me, a therapist to help me process, I wake up every night with nightmares, I'm afraid to go grocery shopping, paranoid I will run into the person who took so much money from me, on the weekends and evenings, I try to repair the damages to my home. Normally I would meditate, and I try to, but I don't feel safe anywhere enough to shut my eyes and try to let go and get into these deep feelings.

&#x200B;

Ultimately I am stuck in a loop. I believe I should be protected. I believe I should be safe, I believe the cops should help me and doctors should be available, but these things aren't true. So then I feel attacked three or more times instead of just once. Once by the scam, again by the police, again by the state investigator, again by the insurance company.

&#x200B;

How does one let go of the idea that people should be here to protect us, so I can find the strength to let go of all of this?

&#x200B;

I'm trying to move to a monastery, to meditate for the next year and learn to let go of this fear and expectation, to hopefully find strength in my mind and compassion for those who lie and scam so I wont be afraid anymore.

Does anyone have any advice? I know I can't be the only one with PTSD that feels abandoned and unsafe and has to learn to live with that.

I’m a switch and naturally flow into a submissive space, dominant space, and neutral. I knew that I was prone to reliving trauma when I was behaving and feeling more submissive. But until I had these discoveries, I enjoyed that. The best sex was sex in which I could re-engage with sexual dynamics from childhood. Trauma sex also felt the most like emotional bonding. The second most being sex in which my partner is making themselves so vulnerable to me that it’s surreal and I’m observing myself physically overpower, control, and please my partner on *my* terms and loving it. 

But I did not understand that when I am the dominant person or when I’m in that dominant head space, I’m prone to project my experience as a SA victim onto the person I’m with. It’s extremely hard to play a dominant role when I am deep down petrified that I just sexually assaulted my partner and that—like me—they aren’t strong enough to speak up for themselves and tell me how they feel. Knowing only intellectually that it’s probably not the case, I proceed with veiled caution and extreme discomfort.

I also discovered that when I sense I am being asked/told to “perform” during sex, I get triggered and immediately feel like I don’t want to be doing this. But then I do it anyway, which in turn makes me feel like I’m reliving the sexual abuse from when I was asked or encouraged to perform by saying sexual things or doing sexual things in a way that contradicted how I feel about the situation. But in reality my sexual partner is just requesting that I smack their ass or telling me to get on all fours or asking me to tell them what I want to do to them.. but for me, I am suddenly no longer present and then when I go along with it, I feel like a total outsider to the pleasure of the sexual experience just like I felt when I was being molested. 

TLDR; The question is: While I work on it in therapy, what has worked for yall to help you ground yourself when you’re triggered during sex? My partners are very understanding but I personally don’t want to be celibate for the entire time it takes me to heal in therapy. I would like to learn grounding techniques.",1676833477.0
396,Mother daughter sexual assault: feeling alone,56,115xeju,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/115xeju/mother_daughter_sexual_assault_feeling_alone/,21,"I  just realized that I've suffered from mother-daughter sexual assault my  entire life and I feel alone in this. Can anyone else relate?

* When  I was in elementary school, my mother would come into the bathroom with  me, watch me use it and wipe for me. There was no privacy and she never  taught me how to wipe so I'd panic whenever I had to go and she wasn't  around.
* When  I was a bit older, my mom would start coming into my showers and  showering me. She'd run the shower hose over me and get a really good  look at me naked. She'd comment on my breasts and weight too.
* My  mom frequently walks around the house naked and leaves the bathroom  door open when she uses it. She's made me watch her go pee.
* My mom shares a bed with my little sister. As far as I know they just sleep together.

Those  are the main things that have been bothering me. I was wondering if  anyone else has experienced this kind of..dare I say abuse? I feel so  alone in this I want to cry but she'd mock me if I cry so I'm holding it  in.

I get frequent emotional flashbacks. They bring me to a state of rage panic and fear. My fight response get triggered whenever I see a kid being hit or reading about someone’s dad talking about how he’s going to “spank their kids”. I want to, whatever it takes, immediately jump in and fight the hell out of that person to stop him. 

I was beaten up by my dad as a kid. I didn’t get spankings. That’s not common in my culture. Usually instead there were multiple blows to the head in succession that left me burning and dizzy then being grabbed by the hair and then shoved somewhere else yet I’ll still catch a flashback from someone even threatening to hit a kid because it reminds of this particular helplessness. This feeling that “whose going to save me now.” when my dad put his hands on me. This feeling that robbed me from my ability to defend myself…rendered me helpless. 

My hypervigilance drained the life out of me. I used to wake up from my sleep because of how hyper vigilant I was (this was mainly triggered my religious trauma). I could hear footsteps from so far away. Capture the differences in someone’s face and tone so quickly. I would get startled at the slightest thing. I flinched a lot near my dad as a kid too because of this hyper-vigilance. If I even hear the slightest reminder of the religious trauma from like 10 miles away I’d freeze and be stuck and wouldn’t be able to get my mind to focus on something else; it would totally hijack my brain.

We had a conversation and I looked over.
A guy was walking with his girlfriend, he had blonde hair, and looked like someone I knew. I looked again, and he stared and straight up smiled at me. It was one of the rapists. 

I focused my eyes. He has brown hair, and looked NOTHING like him. My heart sunk. I instantly put up a sign saying i’ll be right back if customers come and i went to the back office and had a major panic attack while my boyfriend tried to calm me down.

I (27F) am pretty f’d up about this right now. I knew it was bad but I didn’t know it was “child abuse” bad. 

My mother and I have had a rocky relationship my whole life. She had me at 18, had me live with my grandparents for the first 4 years of my life and then came back and I lived with her. She has a lot of trauma from her childhood, and she always kind of took that out on me. I also feel as though she resented me for “ruining” her life. 

I had a very strict household growing up, I was made to babysit, cook, clean and follow all rules all the time. I was an A student, no drugs alcohol or sex. Or any other behavioral problems (besides lying, I would lie to not get in trouble). 

I would get grounded constantly and locked in my room, not allowed to speak to my family because I was in trouble. For things like taking longer than a 5-10 minute shower, not closing my blinds at 8pm, eating things without asking, moving my speakers without asking (got grounded for nine months for that one). I got spanked with a wooden paddle until age 16. When I went to college, my mom cut my contact with my siblings and my stepdad, would check the phone records to see if they called or texted me.
 
I was rarely allowed to hang out with friends, only my neighbors if I wasn’t grounded. I wasn’t allowed to do extra curriculars because they were too expensive, they couldn’t give me rides to and from school, and I needed to babysit after school. I was very isolated all the time. Especially during adolescence. My parents had a separate pantry and fridge drawers for their food and we weren’t allowed to touch it. I can only remember my mother hugging me 4 times my whole childhood. She said “physical touch” made her uncomfortable. She told me she loved me maybe like twice I think. After my suicide attempts in front of a therapist. 

I was screamed at all the time when getting in trouble, once she slapped me across the face and made my nose bleed because I didn’t say “yes ma’am” to her when she was screaming at me. Normally my stepdad would spank me when I got in trouble but she did it once because she was so mad and broke the wooden paddle on me. She was hitting me so hard I put my hands on my butt and she hit those too. I was blamed for my parents marital issues, I was told I was a bad kid. My mom had really terrible anger issues and I’m the only girl and the oldest, so I got most of the heat. She never asked me how I was doing or apologized or anything or comforted or supported me. I was able to do a play for school one time and she didn’t come because it made her uncomfortable “watching people try to act”.  I would get yelled at for asking for school supplies or to use the computer for assignments, she would tell me I need to ask for alternate assignments from my teachers that don’t require those things because “what if we didn’t have a computer or money for a poster?”. 

The shit was horrible. I hated myself I hated her I hated my life I wanted to die 24/7. No one would miss me, they would all be happy without me. But I forgave her. I got older and I forgave her. And we have a good relationship now, we’re friends. I moved on and turned over a new leaf. 

Told my therapist today about this. She told me this was child abuse and is shocked that I have a relationship with her. I don’t think so. I don’t think it was that serious. She was strict and cold, but I don’t think I was “abused”. I’m having a hard time dealing with this word right now, makes it feel a lot heavier than I’ve ever felt. I already had to cut my stepdad out of my life for a SA incident when I was 11. I can’t keep cutting people out or I’ll have no one left. Help anyone?",1676780596.0

I loved exploring and socializing with new people. I was doing really well. Then the pandemic hit and all sorts of awful things happened. I gained 2 stalkers that year, one a man who threatened my friends with a gun, and the other a woman who was a former friend who was angry I told her she was acting like a bitch when she kept pushing at me. She spent over a year terrorizing me, making posts online about me with false accusations to garner sympathy and paint me as the villain, it was horrible, I’m young but I got shingles from the stress it caused me, no matter how many times I blocked her too, she would find my social media and go as far as to mock my dead relatives and health problems I have. 

That year as well I was in a bad relationship that involved heavy gaslighting and intense abuse of me. 

After all those things and more, I find myself no longer enjoying life. I stick to myself and dont let anyone close. A few times I’ve been invited to work parties, and where I use to be the life of the party, I now sit in the corner and avoid talking. 

And worst of all I have a very hard time letting go. It consumes my thoughts every other moment. I’m so angry and hurt that I’ve had my life ruined by liars and abusers and that people have believed them. That now I’m scared to get back into things I use to love doing because I don’t wanna bring any attention to myself. I use to do singing and acting. Now I just want to live in a hole and never come out. And it brings back the memories from childhood of the abuse at home and the bullying at school. 

I can handle a negative comment here or there but the fear of going through another smear campaign or ending up in another abusive situation terrifies me.

My partner has had ptsd for all of her adult life, and has struggled with daily flashbacks/dissociation/ convulsions for even longer. Since we’ve been together, she’s come out of denial and started processing her trauma, albeit slowly. 

Usually flashbacks/convulsions are the end of it, and she is able to gain consciousness, but sometimes (4 or 5 times in the last year) she’ll come out of convulsions into a state of amnesia, where she thinks she is the age she was at the time of the assault. When this happens she doesn’t recognize me (except for having seen me in school) or any of her stuff (new clothing/ stuffed animals)

If I ask her what year it is or who the president is she gives answers corresponding to the year the assault happened. As far as she knows, the assault just happened and nobody else knows, it’s honestly a very surreal experience and I know it’s quite scary for her. 

I’m making this post to ask if anyone else has gone though something similar, if there is a way to explain this better to her therapist/psychiatrist, as they had no clue what I was talking about and didn’t provide any insight or resources, or even seem concerned.

This state always ends with her dissociating, convulsing for a few seconds, and then snapping awake into a panic.

Someone I know is a minor and we both believe that they are suffering from ptsd from abuse. The person gets triggers that are unfortunately unavoidable. Whenever they have an episode they see hallucinations of ""shadow people"" or silowets of people. These people tend to stay at the end of bed or peaking behind their closet. In one instance the person could feel someone touch them. This person also hears footsteps, yelling, and whispering.

Is this a normal symptom of PTSD or is it possible they have another disorder that would cause this?

Is there any way I can help with these hallucinations? Before you ask they unfortunately cant get any therapy or treatment. I just want to help them.",1676700470.0

Everyone on this reddit was very helpful last time I posted and I appreciate it immensely.

So, I began to open up with some people about what I assumed must've been some kind of amnesia or memory issue- something I'm pretty terrified about developing. 

I described it to my therapist and he said it must've been some kind of dissassociation and asked what I'd do to ground myself back down, but... I ground myself pretty fine. I feel like it's not a sense of feeling like things aren't real and more that I just don't remember my days at work anymore. 

For context, I had been SA'd when I was younger, in a 5 year toxic relationship, then just last October I had been struck by a vehicle. 
I've had a lot of wonderful change in my life since then- all good things! I've got great people and dreams and ambitions. 

But when I'm at work these days, I've begun to forget my day. I'll do my entire routine and then look up from my phone, like, ""oh I should start on my tasks"" only to realize it's been done without much memory of it. Sometimes I'm starting to ask myself if something happened or if maybe I'm remembering doing that thing yesterday, not today. As if I can't tell if im going through an old memory or recalling what happened just today. 

I'll have customers come in who know me, can recollect a whole thing I did with them, and I have barely a clue. Its... unsettling. 

I told a close best friend to me about it (I'm trying to not talk too much about it because I know it's not a fun subject to discuss with people) and they too said it sounded like disassociation but I'm not sure what kind. It's almost similar to the brain fog I had when I had covid two years ago.

437,Am I overreacting?,4,114v92z,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/114v92z/am_i_overreacting/,4,"This is my first post on reddit. Sorry if its lengthy.

Im not sure if im over reacting, however I would like some advice if possible please. 

I attended a second physiotherapy appointment earlier this week. I (M) requested a female therapist due to historical issues regarding men (which is the cause of my PTSD) and not wanting to be alone with a male, especially not touched. It was difficult (and embarrassing) enough to request a female therapist at the Physio dept (NHS), as well as the time its taken for me to gain the confidence and ability to attend. I have particularly struggled the last few months with my psychiatrist introducing and altering medication. Its been hard work and very challenging, to say the least! 

Anyway, the therapist initially appeared nice enough. During the last session, I began by appoligising if I seemed 'out of sorts' and explained that I was being titrated on a new psych med and struggling to adjust.  Also, the lack of sleep etc wasn't helping. She seemed quite empathetic and understanding. Well, towards the end of the session she directed me into a posture, which I had to hold. After several seconds I started to tremble/shake. While i was holding the posture, I heared her laughing. The laughing lasted about 3-5 seconds. I asked her what she was laughing at and she said "" you, shaking"". When I asked, I noticed her eyes move from the door, just behind me, then resuming eye contact with me. I quickly glanced behind me to see what she was looking at, I believe I seen one of her colleagues walking away from the door. I said to her, in a jovial/joking manner that its ""not very professional"" of her to laugh at a client. To which she replied lightheartedly that she has a ""tendency to be unprofessional at times"". I replied, in a joking way that I'll have to ""report her unprofessional behavior"". I then left the session and walked to my car in a bit of a daze. It wasn't untill a few hours later, I thought about our interaction and I got quite upset and angry.

It has taken much for me to have the courage to attend such an appointment, where the likelihood of being touched by a stranger is very high. Putting myself in a vulnerable position, having explained briefly why I requested a female therapist and telling her I was struggling with a new medication regime and having sideffects (one of which is getting the shakes!) 

The last few days Ive been ruminating upon our interaction and I feel a number of different emotions, ranging from anger to guilt. Im not sure if it was just some 'banter' she was trying to have. Whatever it was, Ive come to the conclusion that it was highly inappropriate, even if it was not intended to offend.

I will not be going back to see her. It has put me off seeing another therapist if im honest. Im not sure if she was just having a joke or if she actually is that insensitive. However, it feels like I have been knocked back and the little confidence I had mustered up to go into such a situation has been thoughtlessly crushed.

Im not sure how to proceed as I don't want to get anyone in trouble, but I think she needs to be made aware. Do I contact her or her boss? I dunno, for some reason I feel like Im being dramatic and possibly making something out of nothing. I fluctuate from wanting to inform her boss to thinking 'fuck it', draw a line and just move on.

TL;DR: 
   Is it time to decrease my Wellbutrin dose now that I have been exposed to my trigger a lot and am doing better in that setting?

Stats:
  43M, 205lbs, 5’6”, clean diet, CrossFit 3-4x week, occasionally drink (2-3 beers once a week; every couple of months I may go out and have an all nighter). No cigarettes. Occasional marijuana use when not working the next few days.

Rx: 
   100mg losartan SID pm, 20mg Famotidine BID (GERD), 450mg Buproprion SID am. Xyzol and multivitamin.

Long back story:    
    I worked as a nurse in a Pedi ICU. It is a level 1 center (Suicide, gun shots, motor vehicle, etc). I started my nursing career in this field and it was overwhelming and I developed anxiety issues due to it. I switched units 4 months into my career. The unit I went to was less critical. I was able to grow comfortably. The unit I was in was the only unit that could “float” (substitute nurse for when the icu was short on nurses) to the icu. I was given much less critical patients and all was well. Once covid hit, everyone started floating to the icu much more often and we’re given much more critical patients; in some cases, a legitimate icu patient (intubated, sedation management, having to ambu bag ventilate when the patient crashes, etc.) I began floating once a week or twice. It flared up the anxiety I was having to the point of feeling the adrenaline dump the night before going to work. I spoke with a psychologist who recommended l-tyrosine and Wellbutrin. My PCP wrote the script for Wellbutrin. I tapered up from 150mg to 300mg in 2 weeks. Then a month later went to 450mg. 450mg worked well for the past 18 months. I eventually decided to transfer back to the icu officially. I had 2 months of training and have been on my own for 3 months. Now I am starting to notice odd feelings. Most often nausea and disinterest in food (not daily, 1-2 times a week), a heightened sense of awareness but oddly coupled with a disconnect from my surroundings. I will feel pressure behind my eyes as if my BP is elevated, but I am commonly within my accepted parameters after checking my BP. *edit: also, I am experiencing blurry vision after waking. 

The question is: 
   Is it possible that now that I have been exposed to my trigger so much, and am doing much better in that setting, that my body no longer needs the added dopamine and norepi that Wellbutrin has been keeping elevated? Perhaps I should cut back to 300mg and reassess in 1-2 months. 

Thank you-

I was recently officially diagnosed with PTSD after an incident that happened in July 2022 where my best friend attempted suicide using my firearm in my home. I was the only one home and heard it but didn’t want to believe it was a gunshot (I was in the military and am very familiar with the sound of gunfire because of it). I managed to convince myself it wasn’t that but still needed to check on him. He and I were the only ones at my house and I opened my bedroom door to find him standing there trying to get the door open by some miracle after a gsw to the head. I caught him and dragged him outside my house to perform triage and call EMS. He’s alive and doing a lot better now, really I think we all (he and I + our wives) are doing better but we still have moments where we struggle. Now that you have the context, on to the point: I’ve been seeking help and been seeing a psychiatrist since the start of the year and he officially diagnosed me with ptsd and two days ago prescribed me Zoloft in a pretty low dose to get me started on it. I’ve never taken an SSRI before and am honestly nervous, I know it’s supposed to help with the panic attacks, anxiety, etc… but it’s either my pride or nerves talking but I wonder if I truly need it. Most days I feel very neutral, neither happy or sad, or am just not vibing where I feeling anxious all day, remembering the way my house looked that day and being on edge. I still experience happiness but on the days where I feel neutral I kind of gaslight myself into thinking it’s not that bad. Logically on those days I still know I struggle and know I’m not in the clear and frankly might not ever be fully. But when that happens I question if I should take it and get nervous of side effects, if it’ll cause neurological damage etc… has anyone else here ever had similar feelings/worries their first time going on SSRIs? Is there anything I should be looking out for? 

TLDR: I was recently diagnosed with PTSD after friend attempted suicide in my home and I was the one who found him and called Ems. I was prescribed Zoloft two days ago and am nervous about taking it.

I’m also a military veteran, but as I didn’t see combat, my EMS trauma is far worse than any traumatic experience I had in the Army. I’ve also got the trauma of being a DV survivor and the trauma of working in a prison (which I don’t do anymore).

So, I invite you all to explore the catch-22 with me. Imagine my brain is the bed of a pickup truck. I have a truck load of manure in the bed of it, representing my trauma from various sources, and I just haul it around. Every so often I go see my therapist and, in addition to working on my other issues, we climb up in the bed of the pickup truck and use a garden spade to shovel some of the manure out of the bed of the truck, thereby making it easier to drive through life. Sometimes we get more out than other times, but that’s okay; we know we won’t get it all out but as time goes on it’ll be more like dirt than manure. Sounds great, but one problem: as I go about my day at work, we make these pit stops and some manure gets loaded into the bed of the pickup truck on some of the stops. 

Sometimes it’s a small amount, like the old dude’s 10 fingertips when he froze them in the blizzard around Christmas. That was maybe like a soda can worth of manure. The memory is there, but I remember the cold more than I remember the case.

Sometimes it’s as though a front end loader just came up and dumped a whole bunch of manure in the bed of the truck. Such as yesterday, when someone hit a semi and then died in front of us after we loaded him onto the ambulance but before we had the chance to take off for the hospital, and we took him anyway because it was a witnessed cardiac arrest. The lack of detail given should give you an idea—it’s bad enough that I won’t elaborate in a public setting, even with that fucked up sense of humor we medics are known for. Use your imagination; your mental image is probably not far off from the reality.

I was trying to sleep on trains, on train station benches, in the university chapel lounge, anywhere, all to no avail. 

In the end, I had to go home, and after an emergency doctor appointment, was prescribed diazepam, which eventually did put me to sleep, and citalopram. I was on diazepam thrice a day for two weeks until the citalopram started to work. I don't remember much of it. Slowly I got my life back together.

Except, ever since then, I've had a debilitating, overwhelming terror of not being able to sleep. The slightest hint of a rough night and I have a total meltdown. I punch walls, destroy things, scream and cry, and I panic until I can get some good sleep. Even if I *do* sleep, the barest sensation of tiredness and I panic entirely. I'm right back there in 2008, feeling like death.

This terror has held me back for years, stopped me travelling, stopped me working, and worst of all, ruined a relationship. She didn't understand even though I explained in detail, and would deliberately wake me up early 'for cuddles' or to look at sunrises, and then when I would get upset and cry, be angry at me and say she just wanted 'someone normal.' In the end, my sleep fear lead to depression and the relationship failed because, quote 'she just felt like a carer.'

Recently, I got a private therapist, and she explained I have PTSD from the sleep deprivation experience/breakdown. And I feel like an idiot and a fraud. Soldiers are out here with PTSD from seriously messed up experiences, victims of severe and terrible crimes and accidents, and I have PTSD from... being tired? 

I'm struggling immensely with ERP for it, too. Being tired/failing to sleep makes me feel like I'm actually about to die. I've read a dozen assurances that being tired never killed anybody, but progress is incredibly slow. Any advice for 1. not feeling like a pathetic loser and 2. small hacks for handling the flashbacks/freakout?",1676591564.0

So, I have had what my therapist has said is just too many traumatic experiences, my longest and worst being through childhood from ages 4-9. During that time I remember so many details and thought I just lived with all these horrible things. 
Recently I started a program and a very unprofessional psychiatrist pried and triggered my derealization/depersonalization. I’ve known I struggle with this, but this program has allowed me to see just how bad. HOWEVER. This time it triggered stuff I had no idea I wasn’t thinking about and it SENT. ME. BACK. 
I felt like I was walking around in a place in my head. I couldn’t SEE it but I could see it, FEEL it but couldn’t feel it. My body was still operating and going places and I knew it was but I wasn’t there being the operator. It was a place I remembered, one I SPECULATE remembering as a place I used to run when that thing was happening to me as a kid. 
I cannot find anything on it, I just want to know what it could be described as. It was an imaginary world that felt like it had not been visited since I was a child, a rundown world I used to keep alive and run to when the trauma would start. I’ve never been triggered like this before and it’s the first time in a long time I felt like I had been there, in my head. It wasn’t an outside imaginary world, it was a safe room guarded in the depths of my brain for me to run and hide in.

My dad was an detective in ballistics for 25+ years. Part of his job was getting called out to shootings to retrieve bullets from bodies at crime scenes then testify the findings in court. So he has seen a lot of shit. He’s retired now and has never had mental health care ever in his life. He has a lot of demons. He even screams and cries sometimes in his sleep. He has ptsd bad and has never gotten help for it. Within the past year he had a horrible falling out with his closest older brother. They had been close since my dad was little. My uncle screwed me and my brother over and chose money over family and my dad and I were heart broken. Still are. I was so close with my uncle he was my best friend and always there for me. This was a huge loss. Now 6 months later my dad is going down hill bad. He has type one diabetes and is drinking heavily. He is not eating at all. My moms to literally feed him sometimes when his blood sugar gets too low which is often. He does not take care of myself. I truly feel if he doesn’t get help soon he’ll nil himself one way or another. He refuses to get psych help unless it’s in person and always makes excuses if someone actually has availability for him. And because of his mental health declining he doesn’t commit to his doctors appts either. I know he needs psychiatric help and to probably be on psych meds to help him with the ptsd. I think if he gets the much needed psych help he will be more willing to go to his other doctors. My mom has tried so hard to help him but he’s so stubborn.

Not saying that others with PTSD are like me, but I feel as if my condition specifically is just too much to deal with. I randomly explode in rage periodically and I can't contain it until I give myself enough time and space to calm down, and there's no telling how long that will take each time I have an episode.

back in the summer, some things happened with a friend. when that happened, they texted me to ask if i could inform someone in a group they were a part of at the time that they were leaving. they did this with absolutely no explanation and i was honestly kind of scared at the time, especially since i was out of town and couldn't just go check in like i normally could. a couple days later, my mom looks up their name and finds a kind of sketchy local news site with my friend's picture on it, saying they were arrested for assault with a weapon against their partner that they lived with at the time. i proceed to lose my shit and text a mutual friend who was wondering what had happened. we then collectively lose our shit.

a bit after i get back into town, they text me saying hello and call me and i feel my blood run cold. i didn't respond, so they call my mom, who spoke to my friend from time to time. they asked if they could move in for the time being, as they (legally) could not go back to their residence, nor could they contact their partner. i was barely stable after a summer of switching medications, my mom was working, and the other members of my family were uncomfortable with the idea. it was at this time we got more background on my friend's arrest, them telling my mom about why they did it (as self defense after being victimised the entire time they were together) and that they had been admitted to the hospital.  they ended up staying with someone else.

since then, whenever they've texted me, i feel my stomach drop. i almost always anticipate something bad. we don't talk much anymore, and i feel almost... grateful. a year ago, they were one of my closest friends. and now the thought of seeing them is enough to make my stomach feel off and my skin feel itchy. 

since this happened, they moved back home. about a month later, i find out from the aforementioned mutual friend that they got back together with their boyfriend. the one they weren't supposed to contact. i remember spending hours seething about this. i'm not supposed to know they're back together. they still have not told me and it's been around four months. whenever they are asked about this, they lie and beat around the bush. that one friend is the only one who gets a straight answer.

hearing from them sends me into panic. it's the one reason i'm happy we rarely speak these days.

they weren't a saint either. they were messy. they had impulse control problems and anger issues and probably had a drinking problem. but they were my friend who listened to me and dealt with my bullshit. i get why they didn't tell me after i didn't respond to them when they were in the hospital. it still sucks.

i'm not sure why it rubs me the wrong way that they got back together with their abusive ex so much. it's statistically likely that they were going to. maybe it's a logical fallacy, one there's probably a word for. maybe it reminds me of my own bad decisions too much.

i would write a better tldr than the one i put for the title but even that doesn't do it justice in my opinion. hearing from them today put me on edge for hours and i needed to just let it out.",1676616545.0

I feel lost. I live in a regional city & I just can’t help but feel that there’s nothing here for me. I have a friendship group, I’m on good money, I live a five minute drive to the water. But still, I feel miserable. 

I went back to Sydney for a week and ended up really missing the place. The anonymity. The fact you can meet people in a heart beat. The liveliness of it all. It’s overwhelming , but my town is underwhelming.  


I’m seriously debating moving but I’m wondering if I’m just caught in a trauma induced depression and that making a decision like this could be not worth my while. So I’m waiting before I go ahead and put job applications in… I mean I’m gonna start working on the applications anyway in the meantime because it makes me feel something but I’m still trying to see if this feeling passes. 

I don’t know if things will change because I’ve truthfully felt mostly lonely anywhere I go.  Hell I went to Phuket for two weeks and travelled by myself. That was my choice though (escaped a Contiki). 

Two weeks ago I had to flee my town because my ex was harassing me and the month before that I was SA by a date. 

So . It’s really hard to separate the two experiences.

It doesn't. Having PTSD is soul-crushing and debilitating in so many ways. For a lot of people it can completely ruin their life and relationships.

I keep seeing people say they have ""flashbacks"" to their childhood or other times in their life and they're just talking about normal memories, like just remembering something casually.
I don't know when using mental illness as a joke took off either. ""Lmao it's giving me PTSD"" said over something trivial. If I'm managing to have a somewhat normal day it instantly reminds me of everything and I feel like I fall through the floor.

""Haha that's schizo behaviour."" What the fuck. Since when was it okay to use a serious mental illness as a derogatory term?? I don't have schizophrenia but knowing the effects of one mental illness and the effect of using PTSD in the same joking way, I can imagine how that feels for people who do. It's so weird. And I keep seeing people use it who are meant to be ""understanding and accepting"", and people like streamers with huge audiences using it, letting their followers know it's okay to do that. I don't understand where using ""schizo"" has come from but I wish it would stop already.

I hate too the fact that ""triggered"" has become a joke. It got overused to hell and back for jokes and now if I ever work up the courage to tell someone I'm acting the way I am because I got triggered by something, I feel like I can't even say it without sounding like a complete moron.

I don't understand why mental illness is used as a joke. I hate going about my life and for once having a day where I've been awake a few hours and managed not to think about it, and then some asshole makes a joke about PTSD or getting triggered or flashbacks and I'm reminded that it all happened.

The assault itself, and the way I was really abhorrently treated by the police and medical staff following the assault when I reported, gaslighting me, laughing at me, manipulating my victim statement about the assault (to say i consented to the s-x) just so the officer didn’t have to do any extra work. It’s been 1.5 years and still, I feel so much need to see people being angry with me and for me (against the people that hurt me during the traumatic event and immediately after that). It seems like I just need the external validation, a large group of people telling me “yes, you **should** be angry, what they did was incredibly fucked up and not right, you deserved better”, because I can internally validate the same for myself. 

Yet many times I’ve shared my story online, particularly in local online communities, and I get a huge majority of extremely vile and cruel comments. People that know my story and yet are getting angry with me for sharing, for experiencing it, for being angry with it happening, for making up stories about it because to them, it can’t be true and I must be lying, for seeking sympathy and attention, for being “fucking weak” and not doing enough with my case now to help other people in the future, for being a wh-re, for being upset even when I “deserved” to be r-ped, for being the kind of woman that people should hate, for somehow being a victim that to them, deserves not one bit of sympathy. Even for supposedly having mental disorders (that I do not have, but they insist I do) that is causing me to make up stories for sympathy to feed my fractured psyche.

It’s fucking hard to see those comments, and to know that they are being angry and cruel to me, the victim, rather than the people who they should help me be angry and say cruel things at.

I’ve been struggling with the comments these past few days because they were the worst I ever experienced. 90% of the comments were like this towards me, 6% was me defending myself, and 4% were the nice and empathetic ones that felt my pain. I kept thinking what was wrong with me, why I deserved it, what did I do wrong, why am i public enemy number 1 here, and why the fuck was I being so affected by it. 

It literally only just dawned on me that as much as I want everyone to be angry for me and with me, and for and with people like me / us, there are just some cruel people out there that will just be angry at us for no imaginable reason. And I should stop letting these people invalidate the validity of my anger, dictate the person that I am, or infect the way that I feel, and I should focus on the people that DO feel angry with me and for me. They are the ones that matter. I am the one that matters too, because I am the one who lived through that trauma.

I am still learning, and it’s going to take a fuckton of time, but at least knowing this now is better than letting the people that are unreasonably angry at me over being victimised, consume all of me and cast opaque shadows over the tiny bits of light I have in my life.",1676581392.0

I just wanted to ask if anyone else here has had a tough time verbalizing what they are thinking or feeling? If so, how do you overcome or compensate for that in therapy? 

I usually know the issues/things I need to address in my head but I’m having a really tough time saying it to anyone without rambling, completely going off topic, or forgetting what I wanted to say. Even now typing this, I thought I had a fully formed paragraph already in my head but nothing is coming out the way I want/thought it would. My therapist suggested to text them when thoughts come up but I don’t know how to type it out cause it just keeps disappearing or becoming blurry. 

This applies to feelings too. I am better at communicating the facts of the situation (even though I forget about what happened all the time too), but every time my T asked about how I felt or what emotions came up during the discussion my mind just turns blank. T would suggest some examples of how people would feel during those times and that does help me verbalize mine as they usually resonate with mine, but I am worried that I’m not expressing myself accurately or even minimizing the effect these issues have on me. 

I heard that it could be dissociation but the world doesn’t look fake to me; it doesn’t feel like I’m watching from a third perspective; it also doesn’t feel like I’m watching a movie when the troubles with expressions happen.

 I smoke to fill the emptiness or absense of emotion. because I feel emotionally withdrawn from myself.. the more I smoke.

I just want to get better.  But I dont know where to start, or where to look for ... 

And Im always judging my thoughts. sometimes to the point where I would become an observer of my own body, words, and actions. I smoke because I wanted to feel emotions again.

 but it started to become more and more compelling. And it gets harder everytime I pick it back up.  My mom treats it like its not a serious addiction, or pretends like Its not possible to get addicted to marijuana..

 and it really makes me question wether my emotions are really valid and sometimes I think to myself ""does she even want to hear what I have to say.""

Im lost, I dont really know what I want wt my life, and I feel like its killing my self-esteem. it makes me feel vulnerable. sometimes I think ""Maybe its to late for me.""

So I had to adjust to these heightened emotions by building a wall (defense mechanism) now I struggle with inner conflicts between my ego and myself. Questioning my every antic/ bizare thought.

But I'm practically scared to move out because I don't want to offend my landlord (we've grown really close over the months that I've been living here). I left a (very) toxic environment that my parents created. I rent a room from a woman that I recently met and we hit it off great. We both have bipolar disorder and it's helped us to understand each other in some ways. She tells me that I'm welcome to leave at any time but she's glad that I'm living here because she gets lonely pretty easily. And that we have a special bond.

 I have a lot of sympathy for her since she's a single mother that's stuck in an ""on again, off again "" toxic relationship.

This is not what I have PTSD from, I just felt more comfortable posting in this community because that’s where I generally do (and its related to trauma responses). But anyways, so I struggled with bulimia for like 6 years. Thankfully, I’ve been in recovery for a year now (my longest stretch yet!) so that’s good. But I remember when I was actively purging, my heart would beat irregularly, at one point my hair was falling out and I’d feel lightheaded. 

The last time I relapsed I had intentionally purged in the morning. Later that day, I threw up again but not out of a desire to get rid of excess calories, but just because I felt nauseous. In the evening, I started to look pale and feel sick. My mom told me to lay down, and as I was turning the corner I fainted and hit my head on the doorframe on the way down. I’d never fainted before so I hadn’t been expecting it at all. I came to a few seconds later and I literally never felt so close to dying. I literally thought I was because bulimia (coupled with whatever sickness I had) was finally doing me in.

Obviously, I’m fine now. I used to never sweat illness but now every time I get sick—even a cold, like I have right now—I’ll feel myself instantly dissociate at times, like feeling detached from my body, like things aren’t real. I get so scared I’m going to die, and I feel guilty for how I hurt my body over the years, like one day I’ll pay the ultimate price for it. Any tips on how to regain my rationality?",1676486137.0

Writing details about each main part I need to do so I can be prepared and have an idea on what's going on and not actually fall behind. It's been hard cause I have adhd and my sticky note method of being organized isn't working but I found a new system. I planned out a 5 month project and almost finished it. I decided to leave the office before finishing cause I felt good about, I was the last one there and I know soon I'd burn out.

I also always feel so dead after work. I think it's the like hypervigilance and having a mentally demanding job. I just, idk since my latest truama feel like it doesn't take much to drain me.

When I got home I actually felt like I had the energy to either cook a full fancy meal or play some video games. Lately I feel so drained after work even video games sounds like a chore. 

So I texted my friend if I should play video games and microwave some food or cook a fancy meal and watch TV. He said ""cook some food cause you have been bad lately"". I know logically he didn't mean it like this but the way it made me feel was that I havnt been putting in effort in making sure I eat and that I havnt been trying enough to be better.

I had 1hr of feeling like I had my shit together. For once I felt like I could do something to enjoy it and not feel like a chore. I just broke down. My appetite was gone. I started to dissociate. Eventually I got myself to be like ""fuck him imma play video games""

I just hate that I spent 4hrs building my confidence and feeling like i ""have my shit together"" again and its just taken away by one single comment that probably didn't even have bad intentions behind.

I hate this 1 step forward 2 steps back.",1676447999.0

My therapist said have sex alone, use toys, get used to it feeling good again etc etc. but last time I had sex I had a panic attack during it and anyway the last 5-10 times I really didn’t like it and it’s been years now that I’m ‘recovered’ and I still don’t like it, even solo sex is playing with flashback fire.

I’ve always been romantically oriented, I can talk about goals and how I want my life to be but that’s not true, the only goal I ever reallly wanted was to be in love, have sex and wake up together but now that’s all out of the question. That’s how I get psychosis not orgasms.

I go to pay my respects in the only place I’m able to (a garden made in memorial outside my highschool) and I’m trying not to show my face to the reporters. As I’m crying and praying with my boyfriend (I’m not religious at all but he is and on the chance he is right I needed to make sure they were taken care of it’s the only thing I’ve ever prayed for), I can see a guy with a camera in my peripheral moving over to get a better angle of me. I kept turning and so did he until he hit the fence. When I was done another news reporter asked me if I cared to share. I said no but I have many reasons to think even if they didn’t get my face I will be on the news tonight. When it first happened, the street was lined back to back with reporters every day when I walked out of school and some of them even legitimately chased my friend when she was crying and ran away because she didn’t want to be recorded. I had a fear anytime I saw a news crew anywhere (and often even if there wasn’t one) that they’d find me somehow, find out what I’d been through and start harassing me. I know they have more than enough footage after the years and thousands of cameras, so I don’t get why they need to harass us. The one place I can pay my respects, and it’s not even safe or private. The whole world has to see me when I CLEARLY don’t want them to. I was going to ask the guy scooting to get a better angle to delete it, but I know so many others were recording me, and will probably use it, on top of the being immediately asked to comment after I was literally turning from the cameras, and I was just too defeated. I couldn’t even tell them no I just shook my head over and over for what felt like several full seconds. The crossing guard who was there every day of every year told them “some people don’t want to share” and I feel so thankful for her always being there for me, even after I’ve graduated from the school. 

Now that we aren’t in the blurb everyone can see without clicking on the post I’ll share the event was a shooting. So on top of what I just described, today I find out that a survivor of a shooting was just involved in a second one. Let me tell you when I survived the Douglas shooting, my only solace that kept me going was that it was so rare it’d never happen to me again. I couldn’t change politics so it’d never happen to anyone again, but at least it’s never happen to me or any of the people I had been through it with again. Even though I logically knew that, it didn’t stop the nightmares. Every single time I had a nightmare about being in another shooting, the only thought in my mind every time was “how could this happen again”. This is literately my worst nightmare. I was able to rationalize before that it had never happened to anybody twice, but now… now I don’t even have that. And of all days to find out, I had to find out on the anniversary. I feel so angry at the world at the same time so helpless, and now the little sense of safety I had gathered up over the years is now destroyed by both the reporters, and the fact it’s starting to happen a second time to others like me. I was already on mental health leave from my college for almost a year at this point, and now, I feel like any progress I made with relation to what happened to me has just been destroyed.",1676395558.0

I am proud to say I have the most patient and kind partner, but during our relationship I have started to be more and more hard on myself and isolated myself from the world. 


My childhood wasn't great. 
(trigger warning) 

I was verbally abused every day and psysically abused on some occations by my mother as my parents got a divorce. At 5 years old I was also sexually abused by another family member. As I turned 12 my mother developed addictions and I watched her go to jail to then have my bullying teacher tell my whole class about it. My mother was in jail for a short time and when she manipulated me into thinking the therapist I went to was a pedophile in fear she would recieve consequences. 

As time went by they found my mother beaten under a bridge, which made me terrified of not watching over her the coming years when she went out partying and my dad started to tell me i was ungrateful for not chosing to stay at his place during his time. I was terrified of something happening to my mom. My dad until this day compares my story to other people's pain and is distancing himself.

At 18 I could not take it anymore and I started to drink with my mother to cope. Her brother gave me something he said was allergy medicine to ""help with my hangover"" which later proved at hospital to be something else for severe back pain. I OD'd many times and finally went to rehab and have now been sober for 6 years after cutting contact with them. My grandma which was the only one I trusted fell on the floor and died in front of me and I had no one to visit as I finally got my own place.

In rehab I met kind young people my age that believed in me and motivated me to stay sober during a period of 9 months. They all died during my first year on my own.

Today I am very fatigued and I cry a lot.  My boyfriend is so caring and helped me move to another city. Some days I really question my own decitions and I'm terrified in this new city with no family or friends to lean on. I feel ungrateful for being sad when he does his best. Any advice?",1676425624.0

Basically. If anything CAN go wrong it WILL. It causes severe anxiety and panic and I can not focus on anything until the threat passes. One of these triggers lately is abnormal changes to my husbands sleeping habits, causing me to not be able to sleep for fear that I will miss warning signs and he will pass in his sleep. I have to stay awake to monitor breathing, body temp, changes in skin tone, etc. it is clearly unhealthy and I don’t want to live in fear all the time.

Edit: honestly googling symptoms is irrelevant to my anxieties, and in rare cases has calmed them, so please don’t suggest that.

It gets covered by my ensurance and has no waitlist so i figured id start there.

After what litterally felt like hitting a wall in my life i finally decided to seek help, i did once before but it was a terrible experience as the therapist didn't listen to me and forgot to cancel my appointment when she was on holidays. 

Ever since starting the talking therapy in November last year, i've noticed that after every session i feel overstimulated and relieved at the same time? I normally go lay in bed or on the couch and do nothing that day. But these few months i've noticed that i am so much more aware of all the things that happened to me, i feel sad, and for the first time in my life i'm actually allowing myself to feel like a victim of what other people did to me. This just gives me periods of depression, and feeling defeated. I tried to make this clear but he still thinks that talking therapy is the kind of therapy i need.. while i feel like i need something 'more' because of these reactions ive been having. 

Is he right? Or should i keep asking him to send me to a real therapist. The waitlist for EMDR is 12 months in my country he said, but i am more than willing to wait. I feels to me like he's trying to keep me here so the list doesn't get longer..",1676382833.0

I get psychiatric help as a foster youth. When it started my psych already knew I was abused by my bio father and my sister died. Over time I admitted to some other things that were happening. My bio father would often let men pay to spend time with me and my sister, or even invite men over for parties where we were there to entertain the men. We were also used in CP.

My psych told me he's diagnosing me with HPD. He said he doesn't usually diagnose PDs so young but he thinks it's obvious with me. He says it's because I lie in every session. He thinks it's true that my bio father abused me but that I started to add on other stories because I was scared I would lose his attention if my trauma wasn't extreme.

But everything I told him is 100% true. The only reason I didn't say that stuff to start with is my bio father used to threaten things would happen if I told anyone, so I was scared and all I admitted to was what he already knew about. But then I got more comfortable and felt safer because I started to really realize my bio father can't get me anymore.

I even admitted to the crazy behavior which is also a symptom of HPD. So why would I admit to the crazy behavior which would be even worse than lying but then not admit if I was lying? I've always told the truth and been honest about even the bad parts of myself and he thinks I'm just hiding this one thing. And then he based a whole diagnosis on me being a liar, because crazy behavior isn't enough for a HPD diagnosis.

So then today I talked to my caseworker and asked for a different psych. She said I can't switch psychs just because I don't like the diagnosis he gave me. She fully believes I have HPD and I'm just a crazy attention seeking liar. And so I have to get treatment for a disorder I don't even have because no one believes me about how much abuse I actually went through, just because I didn't tell anyone about it right away.",1676335146.0

However the Ptsd has somatic features which has resulted in gerd, sibo, costochondritis (rendering me needing to have 
a twice daily practice of yin yoga)

The head doctor agreed yet during the consult I did not mention Ptsd only the physical stuff. Partially because I was concerned if I simply said Ptsd they’d say “oh that’s for psychology we don’t work with that”. When the research is clear.

As I checked out at the desk I said, “mainly this is for ptsd yet also for the physical reason”. 

They still agreed and their method is they decided to do both left and right side on the same day. They are a pretty professional clinic. So if anyone can chime in if this is the propper method and what their personal experience was? Be well",1676366747.0

I posted more topics regarding this subject but I kinda need advice.   
So i saw my male therapist for the first time today.   
I wasn't looking forward because despite having asked for a female therapist i got a male therapist but i also see the upsides to it.  
The problem is that i'm having trouble being vulnerable with a male therapist because of SA as a child by a male. My head is telling me i'm not safe being vulnerable with a man. He is going to attack me and hurt me. I had lots of therapy but always by a female therapist and I know that maybe i'm at a point that it would be good to see the perspective of a male therapist but it scares the HECK out of me. 

So when I did my intake i got my advice on treatment and they said that i would get schematherapy and we would talk mostly about the here and now and dont' need to go back in my childhood. So that kinda gave my hope. But i also knew that in schematherapy you are going to talk about how schema's developed and so you have to go back into your childhood (in my case). And today was the first appointment and he said he struggled because he knew that having a male therapist is hard for me but especially when we have to talk about the past. But he also said that maybe it was important to do so. We let it go because i got close to dissociation thinking about having to open up to him. And it was only our first meeting. 

But today i thought about it a lot and i'm afraid it will stand in the way of having a good relationship with him and it will be the elephant in the room when we won't talk about it. Also, as I mentioned. I am very aware that it maybe would be a good idea to hear from a male about this. I acknowledge it can also be healing if done correctly. So tonight I was brave and send him an email that i decided to talk about my past with him and that I might be to afraid to say that in person next week so that's why i send him that email. And i am so so so scared. I don't even know how to deal with myself right now. 

I really would like to trust men. I hate that my ptsdbrain thinks it is logical to be afraid of men while talking about my history with SA. He is not my assaulter, he is a therapist and wants to help me. He is not a wrong person. But still i am freaking scared he is going to hurt me. Not only that but my assaulter told me that if I talked about my experience with anyone, that person would get hurt and die. And i am a grown up now. I know that is not going to happen (because of me telling them). But my god. My brain is giving me such a hard time right now.",1676318315.0

Including avoidance, emotional flashbacks, emotional dysregulation, easy startle response, fight or flight mode kicking in when trauma is triggered, feeling stuck and only wanting to think about the horrible things I experienced but there is a new one…self sabotaging. 

I self sabotaged yesterday. My mom had been constantly triggering my religious trauma. I was getting emotional flashbacks. I told her repeatedly that she is triggering me and she refused to step back and continued arguing with me. Something in me snapped and I physically attacked her by gripping onto her shoulders real tight with my nails. She pushed me off. We both fought each other. Left scratches and nail marks. It could have been a normal quiet weekend. But for some reason I enjoyed fighting her in that moment. I was even frustrated she didn’t hit back harder. I wanted her to hurt me more. I wanted her to give me a black eye or something. I was angrier she wasn’t fighting back as hard as I want her to. It broke my heart to see her cry afterwards. It broke my heart to hear her sob. 

I’ve had other occasions where I created problems for myself for no reason. I was in a mental hospital and I fought with their transportation service driver and ended up getting blacklisted (fuck you Avalon, no one needs your rides anyway) and had to call someone else to pick me up in the middle of a blizzard. I was red zoned in that mental hospital then and ripped up whatever worksheets they gave me on impulse control and fought with the staff and never came back.

This is gonna sound weird but please bear with me while i write this out.

I always think of this specific test/incident when i have to get similar tests. I have a PAP smear coming up soon and its gonna be difficult because i have vaginismus and have in the last year uncovered memories of CSA/R***. Which has lead to a diagnosis of PTSD once i was seen by the mental health team. 

When i was early 20s while admitted to hospital it was suggested that i needed a transvaginal ultrasound to see if there was issues causing severe abdo pain/sickness/temps. At this point in my life i hadn't had sex fully because one time i tried it failed to penatrate due to above issues that i didn't know at the time. So for all intents and purposes i was still a virgin to my knowledge. 

Now, i get into the ultrasound room to see a male doctor, there was a female nursing student in the room aswell to chaperone. I had no issues with this until he started to do the test and put the probe in, i stop him and explain how painful it is but he just huffs and explains that if i want answers then we need to do this test. (There was no answers btw). He attempts to do the test again and still the same pain and i try to breathe through tears and he doesn't stop the test. I couldn't say anything at this point and i feel sick and in tears. But its feels stupid because he said the test was needed and is huffy about needing time to relax before pushing further. I walk out with the student. I was shocked/crying and not really knowing what the hell just happened. Like i know now why it was so hard with my muscle issue but why continue with a test thats obviously hurting someone. 

A few years later i explained to a nurse what happened and she said he never should have done that test if i was still a virgin..... i was like so what the actual hell was the need to do that. I felt sick again over the whole thing and now when i have similar tests i can see this in my head.

I am 18 years old and I underwent upper blepharoplasty about 6 months ago. I was first introduced to this procedure by my mother when I was in middle school. I had monolids that were puffy, but I liked them. However, my mother convinced me that I had to get them done. She convinced me that my eyes needed to go under the knives of surgeons so that I could appear normal. ever since then, I always thought my eyes were deformed.  So every time my mother was talking about how she plans to get me surgery when I turn 18 and how she got hers when she was 9, I’ll get excited, but also impatient because I wanted surgery right away. I didn’t want to continue to live as a deformity.

So on that day, 6 months back, I agreed to fly out to NY to get the surgery. My parents were divorced at this point.  My mother, who is a gambling addict, was always at the casino . Looking back, I never thought of the surgery when I was in the house by myself. In fact , I started to love myself more and more without her antics. But she came back from the casino. Besides the mountains of debts that she owes, I knew she had won some money because she was not raging or hitting me and she seemed happy. And I was happy that she was happy. I guess that’s partly why I agreed that day when my mom asked, even though i was just so ready to move out and put all that shit behind me. I hadn’t seen her in weeks and I guess i just wanted to spend some time with her before I had to move to college.And stupidly, I felt like part of the deal of spending time with her was agreeing to the surgery.  And partly, her words came back to make me believe that I needed it, that it was some kind of magical process that’ll give me a new sense of validation that will finally make me feel like I am enough of a person.

I was also at my lowest point. I was hyperventilating and having a panic attack the day we flew out to NY to get my surgery  because I found out my father got scammed by a girl that he was dating online. I couldn’t think. I didn’t want to think. I couldn’t muster up the strength or courage to deny my mother even if I wanted to. I was totally shut down by my dad’s foolishness.  

Now it’s 6 months after the surgery and I have just been miserable. Miserable beyond comprehension.  Even though other surgeons have said that my results are considered objectively good, I can’t help but feel like I have made like a Faustian bargain and lost some critical part of myself. I can’t focus at all on college without breaking down or having a panic attack. I am constantly romanticizing the past, making things prettier than before when I know that it was not any better before the surgery. I have lost all my sense of love and autonomy and appreciation for myself because all I have felt is being stolen and invalidated. I have been diagonsed with acute PTSD and have been dealing with, anxiety attacks, depression, suicidal ideatinons every single day. Only after the surgery did i realize what i had done. Only after the surgery did i realize that I have been manipulated and cheated. Only after the surgery did i realize that my mother had imposed her own childhood traumas onto me. Only after the surgery did i realize that i was totally fine before. That i was not a deformity. That I was ok. That I was beautiful. But I’m afraid these realizations are too late, the surgery lacerated and took out huge amount of fat and distorted the literal anatomy of eyes. The scars are always going to be there. I’ve always had my father’s eyes, but now I am seeing more and more of my mother in myself. And it terrifies me. It fucking disgusts me. right now I am considering revision, but i don’t even know if it’s worth it at this point. Secondary  surgery to change it to how i would like would be really challenging and risky and reverting it seem anatomically impossible. I don’t know.

Years later I find out that how he got me ( I was the side chick) was a lie and that everything he said was a lie. We got together in our senior year of high school, him saying that he wanted me and not his GF who was (all sorts of made up stuff). We got together. I went away to school having decided on a college before we got together. I was miserable and wanted to be with him. I went home for one semester and then my parents realized community college wasn't up to what I was doing. So I went to his school sophomore year and it was basically stockholm syndrome. I venerated my captor and had to do what he wanted to get any affection.

We got married and then the sexual violence escalated, to ""playing rape"" when he would do what he wanted and not stop. At the time I didn't realize what was happening and wanted to fix it. He was cheating on me and moved on. It took me years to realize what he was doing to me, and when I realized it I shut down completely. Shit has happened since then that has made me as non-functional as I've ever been.

The problem is I have dreams of him, and in them I give in to what he wants. I seek him out and give him sex to  make him love me. I usually wake up without resolution and am seriously fucked up.

I am a 22 y/o male. I have been in some abusive relationships in the past. It has been over 2 years since I got out of my last abusive relationship and I have dealt with some serious mental health problems since then. I struggled to accept that I was abused for a really long time even after being diagnosed with PTSD and I think I am starting to understand how serious it is and how severe the implications may be on my future if I don't make an effort to heal. I get triggered by basically anything relating to relationships or trusting people who seem to care about me. I have a substance abuse disorder in which I am a chronic user of opiates/weed to numb my emotions. I think I have also dissociated from the person I used to be quite a bit and have suppressed a lot of memories in the process. I also self harm(ed) after being with my last partner which has significantly impacted how I perceive myself and how I believe others perceive me. I am very insecure about my scars and honestly I'm not even comfortable meeting new people because I'm so worried about what they will think about me if they know pretty much anything about me. I have not worn short sleeves since and it causes me to avoid meeting new people unless I really meed to,

When I was originally diagnosed I was kinda in denial, probably because I have been using drugs for a while to cope and I still had/have feelings for my most recent abuser so I convinced myself that they did not abuse me and that people simply misunderstood the situation. Recently some memories I had lost for a long time resurfaced and they're very scary to me. I am starting to come around to the reality of the situation. I'm just very overwhelmed and I have no idea what to do to even try to have a normal life in the future. I am sorry for the confused post but I am just looking for advice. Preferably things I can do to try and cope which will allow me to try to heal a little before I try to quit using substances. I also wanted to have a family of my own when I'm older (a wife and kids) but I'm not sure if this is realistic/safe for somebody in my situation or if it's something I should try to avoid.

I don't know how to go about getting help because I display the symptoms of PTSD but it's all related to an event that didn't occur in reality. 

At the age of 21 I was attending a university, and spent most of my time using various drugs or drinking a ton of alcohol. One drug I stupidly decided to experiment with was Datura. A pretty, white-flowered plant that turns your life into a living hell for the duration of time you are on it. It is not a psychedelic like LSD or mushrooms, it's an extremely potent deliriant and the time I took it has me honestly traumatized to this day and I am now 29.

The experience of it I would describe as; earth literally turning into a hell for a night, then going back to normal in the morning. The things you see and do are completely indistinguishable from reality. In my case, the hallucinations were far too real and far too gory, involving a disgusting murder.

For many months after the event I believed that it really did happen. Everyone called me crazy and I got diagnosed as schizophrenic. I begged doctors and therapists to help but all they said was ""it wasn't real, get over it.""

Years later I finally accept that the murder was a drug induced fantasy but it still doesn't feel that way and there are still nights where I am up late with this sick/numb feeling and can't get the memories out of my head and all I want to do is cry but I'm not able to.

About 8 years ago, before we met, my husband was deployed in Guantanamo Bay. On his 24th birthday, he was date raped by a woman in his unit. For this reason, his birthday is very triggering to him and he dreads it. We have been together for 5 years and I found this out last summer. 

I always knew he didn't like his birthdays (or anybody's birthdays including my own and our 3 y/o daughter's), but I didn't know the extent or what exactly happened until last year when he had a vivid flashback and a severe mental breakdown that he is still recovering from and in intensive therapy for.

Since I hadn't known all of this until recently, I still would try my best to make his birthdays nice for him so he'd grow to enjoy them in the previous years. I'd never throw him a party because he's very socially anxious, but I'd make him dinner, make or get him gifts, a few intimstand other little things like that. He seemed generally pleased and appreciative. But again, that was pre-flashback. 

He's turning 32 next weekend and he specifically told me he does not want to celebrate his birthday because his birthday ""is and will always be a day of disgust and grief"" to him. I want to respect his boundaries, but I also wouldn't feel right just letting him sulk in misery the whole day. He deserves to enjoy his birthday just as much as anyone else and it would be great to break the cycle of that day being a negative day for him rather than reinforce it.  Our daughter loves celebrating birthdays and figure that maybe her excitement would help him reframe the experience for him. But again, I don't want to push it too far.

A year and a half ago my life changed. The best way to put it, and I see others here who feel the same, is that your old self dies when the trauma awakens. With that old self dying is the frivolous joy, the passion for interests, the ambition on the route to your long term goals. You feel like a passenger along for the ride in your body. I miss laughing with my dad and really feeling it. I miss talking with my mom and only being fixated on whatever topic we were discussing in that moment, be it a memory or what we were looking forward to. Now there’s this black scatter in the background that never turns off, not even for a little bit, constantly going, constantly trying to trigger fight or flight. Constantly making any semblance of true peace or joy impossible. I know it’s only been a year and a half since my diagnosis. But when I tell you that year and a half has felt like a decade, it terrifies me going forward. 

My medicines keep me afloat. They are the one reason I can still be just productive enough to work and support myself. But to say I rely on them is an understatement. It’s hard to describe their effect, it’s like they make it just easy enough to get distracted, like even though there’s a dog biting my leg as hard as it can I can type on a computer. They also make it extremely hard to cry, release, or express any suffering. They make it easy to fake absolutely everything in front of others so they don’t worry. But I need them. 

Truly, it is every single second, of every minute, that this excruciating reality is before me, that no matter how good I am to people, how well of a work day I have, how profound a moment with a loved one is, I know I am trapped as the new damaged shell of who I was, and I succumb to the worst pain and suffering I have ever known. I wouldn’t wish this on anyone except those responsible.

The medication and therapy I’m getting isn’t curing me or even making me feel better. It just prevents me from getting worse. At this point I don’t even know if it’s worth it. I spend 90% of my days crying and having panic attacks alone. This isn’t living",1676142723.0

Almost every single time I’ve shared my pain, my anger, my despair, my panic, my spirals, you have comforted me, related to these uncomfortable feelings, were willing to have these uncomfortable and hard conversations, and empowered me.

At my lowest, you lot empower me. Over and over. You help me feel safe in this space when everywhere else feels dangerous and hopeless.

She said that I show signs of PTSD.  But it just doesn’t feel real. I don’t want to believe it, but I just think it’s time I ask about whether it’s worth looking into or not. TRIGGER WARNING

My trauma comes from the harassment and extreme abuse I took from those very very close to me for many years, and what happened to me after I cut contact.  This is what makes it feel unreal. Compared to other peoples, it doesn’t feel as valid,  no matter how bad the abuse was.

This was so bad, it’s To the point where I have moments where I relive the memories. Whether it be through reliving the emotions I felt at that time. Or One time, I closed my eyes, and all I saw was them. It was like I was in the moment again. I couldn’t move, or cry. It was just them talking to me. But when I snapped out of it, I was in tears and shaking. Even full on nightmares involving these people, years after the events even took place. 

Recently, it’s been getting so frequent that I feel I need to figure out if it’s worth looking into. I’m scared and because of these thoughts/memories, have harmed myself in many ways. 

-TRIGGER WARNING FOR THIS NEXT PART-

It got so bad, I recently tried to end it all to get it to stop. All the memories I’m reliving, and fearing for my safety every day. It’s not worth it anymore. It has only done harm to myself. 

-TRIGGER WARNING END-

I need to know if it’s worth looking into for PTSD in particular.",1676174964.0

but it seems like i've been completely numb to other people's emotions ever since. anything that doesn't directly effect me as a person i have to force myself to care about and react appropriately to it. i have nieces and one of them fell down the stairs late last year and i didn't react at all, i didn't even reflexively try and catch her like i would've pre-ptsd. my mom lost her job and had two heart attacks and yet i really couldn't bring myself to genuinely care and i feel fucking awful about that. all i do is act now.

582,can you get ptsd from yelling,18,10zobhu,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/10zobhu/can_you_get_ptsd_from_yelling/,12,"I tried posting this to no stupid questions, bcs it feels like a stupid question. (The automod removed it bcs it was a ""medical"" question.) I'd never want to take up space in a sub where people really need to be that I may not, but maybe yall can point me in the right direction. 

So here we go:

I [F29] spent about half a year roommating with 3 men. A dad and 2 brothers. The dad (60s) was never mean to me. The other 2 were around late 30s (the dads sons). Those two men would yell. One I was dating for a while would yell at me till we broke up and then he only did it a little bit. The other dude yelled at me a few times too. Every time was scary bcs with the second dude, we hadn't even dated. We weren't even anything to eachother, but there he was in my face yelling at least 3 or 4 instances.

I recently moved back in with my parents because of how hostile things became. The men would drink a lot, and just now when I heard my mom's glass (she was having her morning v8) hit the counter, I froze for a second hearing the sound over and over in my head like, nahhh it wasn't that. Once I was able to turn around I felt so silly to not see a shot glass and that drinking wasn't going on.

The day I left these men was very difficult. In the shower I had a panic attack. Then the 1st shower I had the next day at my parents house, I had a panic attack. Is this on par for what I'm going through, or am I off track and being dramatic? I am physically sick with a cold or something, but also emotionally I feel like a sack of shit.",1676124097.0
583,What is wrong with me,2,1104aqy,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1104aqy/what_is_wrong_with_me/,1,"Firstly, I'm not trying to self-diagnose. I just want some outside perspective. I'm not diagnosed with anything.  
This may contain something triggering, I'm not sure.   


So, sexual abuse has always been a particularly ucomfortable subject for me. I almost always feel weird when it's brought up. Today was one of these moments and I thought about it a little.  
I'm 16. Through my whole life I have always been afraid of being alone. I only got comfortable being home alone at like 13 and using public transport this year. Honestly I still hate being alone somewhere in public.  
At the same time when I'm with someone I always keep my distance. I'm uncomfortable with any touch besides a handshake. And if someone, even a person I know shakes my hand for a little too long it's enough for me to tense up. People find it weird sometimes.  
I'm generally pretty suspicious of strangers but some make me very uneasy. I think.. \~30 year old man, with unshaved facial hair, bald or short-haired, in jeans and black leather jacket.   
Sounds oddly specific. That is the moment that got me really thinking.. maybe something happened to me when I was a kid? I suspect I may have been abused but that feels impossible and surreal.  
I'm also almost afraid to get into any unfamiliar car, even if it's my friends. To be fair, I have quite some trouble trusting people in general.  
I've also had a pretty bad memory. I often find myself not remembering something other people tell me. It may be something I said or did, some event or anything else. They talk like everyone remembers that and I just stand there completely clueless.  
My memory from \~7 to \~14 is very scatterred. I remember several events from here and there but it's really not much. It feels like I remember more of my early childhood.  
I also have a very uncomfortable memory around that period. I was hanging out with some girl from my class and a man (i think he fits the description above) comes to us and asks us to go with him and get in his car. We politely declined even if he was intrusive and got home. I then told all this to my parents.  
I don't know if any of that makes sense or I'm just making things up and exaggerate.  
I'm not sure if I have something or if something happened to me but the thought terrifies me.  
I just don't really know.  
I never ask questions like this on the internet or at all, but I felt very overwhelmed.  
What do you think? Is PTSD a right direction to dig in? Who should I contact to get help? Anything else? Any comment would be great.",1676167280.0

One crazy guy whips out a knife and was threatening to kill one of the passengers if he got off at the next stop. Luckily nothing physically happened to me but that event really shook me. It taught me that no matter where I live, how far I climb the economic ladder, what time of day, I can literally die at any moment.

I grew up poor and have made it really far in life due to hard work, but I’ve also suffered a lot mentally and I still don’t feel like I have accomplished my life goals like graduating college.

I also was hanging out with the wrong crowd last year and got manipulated a lot because I didn’t stand up for myself. Tried my best to end friendships either ethically or maturely as much as possible. 

My past therapist also tried to gaslight me and I called them out on it, so it’s been hard for me trust therapy again. 

Overall, all of these events have made it extremely difficult for me to trust humans in general. We’re driven by fear and I don’t think altruism exists anymore. Everything is conditional, and it seems like people only do things if theres something in it for them.

I am trying my best to overcome my trauma. My motivator right now is fear that I can die at any moment, and I would be really sad if at the moment of my death, I’m not proud of the life I have lived. I’ve been doing a lot of things this year to get out of my comfort zone and experience as much life as possible. 

Every day I think about how I can die at any moment. I am so scared and people don’t understand or show compassion. I’m having a really rough time right now and it’s hard to admit this especially where I live because it’s so normal to have anxiety and depression these days but the moment you have PTSD or some other mental illness besides those two, you are seen as crazy. Oh the irony.

I feel so detached from life. I can’t trust anyone and I feel like I’m just a pawn in this capitalist game. I’m only in my mid twenties and I don’t want my remaining life to be jaded. I wish I could enjoy life to the fullest again. I feel like a lost, unwanted wandering soul

If you made it this far, I hope that you can be a kind human. Even if it’s something as simple as donating or buying your friend a meal who’s going through a rough time or volunteering. The world needs more kindness and empathy.",1676151626.0
585,Anniversary. In need for support,3,10zzosk,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/10zzosk/anniversary_in_need_for_support/,1,"TW: SA

I have been raped three years ago, night from 8 to 9th. Afterwards I had a really bad case of tonsillitis right before the pandemic (yeah, weirdly it was not covid) which wasn't treated correctly, so I also had side effects from antibiotics that have a tendency to come back too. Now my body regularly seems to break down during this time. I now have a temperature of 38.2 Celsius (I don't know what american analog is and honestly I'm too exhausted to care right now), my head is spinning and hurting, I'm coughing, ect. I absolutely hate it. Not only I have to deal with psychological consequences, I have to experience very physical flashbacks and get sick again and again, even though before rape I almost never got sick as intensely. I thought I was doing a lot better this year, suspiciously better, me and my therapist talked about that and the next day after my session in which we discussed the possibility of everything being relatively fine this year, the next day I get extremely sick again. So now I'm crying and feeling sorry for myself, while also being extremely mad and flashback-y. It's probably a good thing in a way that I am so weak, I can barely make myself some food, or otherwise I would be very compelled to find the rapist and throw him of the stairs or something, mb it would make me feel better😅

So I guess I'm just looking for some sympathy and support? Just if you can say something good and wholesome or whatever, I don't need any advice, just for someone to say that it does suck and I'm not weak (well, not mentally) for feeling like this after three freaking years?

I can already feel stinging on my feet. When I explained this to him, that he makes light of my health concerns he dismissed it. I explained that people with high amounts of childhood trauma are so many more times likely to develops diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and other health issues.

I explained that when he negates the things I say it hurts. And that I feel like he’s just saying I’m being lazy when I don’t have energy.

He responds (the same exact way all the time) that he”hears me” and that me feeling that way negates his feelings.

It’s upsetting and gaslighty an I cry and feel sad and triggered and he says I’m being a “bad communicator.” Which feels like a tactic to just get me to not talk about my fielings.

I posted a super long rant with a good amount of detail (not the rape, but how I was treated by the people I sought help from), on a subreddit that was meant for free speech within my country. This was a sub where I’d seen so many people express their frustration with the way the country worked. So I ranted about my rape, and how it was handled so incredibly badly by everyone who was meant to help after submitting the police report. It was a raw and angry post about the police, the medical staff, and the government and its justice system. It was just a rant, I never asked anyone to do anything for me to change things, not once did I mention that I expected someone on that sub to do something. I thought some of them would be able to relate to the local police or government letting them down too.

I started fielding a large majority of comments that said things like “your post so long, what the fuck do you want us to do?”, “the fuck do you want us to do? make it big on tiktok and FB?”, “why you never share name and pic”, “for fuck’s sake, you share all of this but so little detail, what do you want us to do? don’t fucking hide behind and not reveal yourself. why can’t you be more brave and tell us all the details and go do something about it? make your story big so that nobody else has to suffer the way you did. don’t just complain, be the fucking change”, “the system is like that to prevent false accusations. do you think rape is more important than 20 years in prison being bullied for being a rapist?”, “women need to learn how to not get raped, parents need to teach their daughters how to protect themselves”, “maybe don’t have casual sex then you wouldn’t have gotten raped”, “lol women love to ruin men’s lives with rape accusations. didn’t have enough evidence for police? clearly it’s regret sex”, “LOL”, “didn’t read, go cry about it in somewhere that cares”. The mildest one? “I always thought our police was great, it’s really hard to believe that all this happened to you”. 

All these comments were upvoted and the one or two nice comments were downvoted and I believe even reported to be removed. They also severely downvoted my comments trying to explain to them how: 
- the case is closed, I can’t do anything else
- it’s just a rant, i’m not asking anyone to do anything 
- i shared all of the details that i was comfortable sharing to maintain my anonymity, which was already a lot
- I’m only one person who’s hurting, it isn’t my job to change things for this country
- it’s beyond my bandwidth to “be the change”, completely alone, for everyone else after me who would suffer the same issue
- STOP saying that it was sex that I regretted. it was fucking rape. it was forced onto me. 
- It’s a woman’s responsibility to keep ourselves safe, but it’s just as much a man’s responsibility not to rape.
- a bunch of statistics putting into context the sheer number of reported rapes vs the number of actual false accusations vs people who actually get convicted of rape *(which I assume includes false convictions too)*, which by the way: 2.5% reported rapes end in convictions, and from that, imagine how there are only 4% of false accusations *(if i did the math correctly, it’s 0.1% of all reported rapes that end in wrongful convictions)*
- what more evidence could I have provided? please, give me some examples. 

I expressed my anger over the way I was hurt by the system, and people who also hate the system are also angry with me? For what? What did I do wrong?

I know reddit and many online social media platforms are cesspits of horrible people. I don’t really care about upvotes and downvotes, I won’t go “why are you downvoting me? I did nothing wrong!”. I’ve learned to live with downvotes. It’s the significance of those upvotes agreeing with the people being fucking assholes and saying all those completely heartless and blameful things, that hurts. Because I already live in a reality where the institutions around me did not protect or support or believe me. And now I’m reminded that I live in a reality where our male-dominated, chauvinistic, sexist, extremely prejudiced culture enjoy shovelling shit in the face of someone who did nothing to them. They are the kinds of people who tell victims they deserved it because they trusted the rapist, because they asked for it, because once you consent at the start then you consent to everything else, because you’re just crying rape because women enjoy ruining men’s lives over not enjoying what they asked for. 

All this, just because they enjoy it. Just because they, out of their own conviction, purposefully assumed and misinterpreted my intentions. Just because they think they can, or think that I deserve it for being the victim. And these aren’t even trolls with brand new accounts, but real people with years-old accounts who were able to be perfectly civil and kind to others. 

I fucking hate people. I fucking hate this society. How am I supposed to live in a reality where I’m already afraid of people sexually assaulting me again, where institutions cannot be trusted, and where a large majority of the people that exist around me at malls and on public transport are fucking horrid, sadistic, woman-hating, victim-blamers that make vulnerable people hurt even more (and encourage it) just for sport?

It’s not much but I’m filled with absolute terror , I’m sleeping on the couch as I often do, someone like crashes up onto our sidewalk kinda and  runs up to our door and starts knocking heavy and won’t stop and he turns his face and I can see it’s my dad and I fall to the floor in fear of him seeing me, I cry and crawl under my brothers bed hiding behind things under his bed while he pounds on the door, it feels like I’m there like that for hours

It’s only one of the reoccurring dreams I have but I’m just so scared of seeing him, I used to hallucinate that I was seeing him in public all the time and I constantly dream about him showing up(he lives multiple states away) 
 I think I’m really just looking for comfort in knowing I’m not alone in this, it’s been hard lately",1676101354.0

594,Are your nightmares/disturbances ever comically absurd and seemingly unrelated to your very-real trauma,14,10z5sgn,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/10z5sgn/are_your_nightmaresdisturbances_ever_comically/,4,"For example, last night I woke up trapped in a ""parallax of infinite recursion,"" a concept I now know is nonsense, but felt very real in the moment. Basically, there was a vortex in the closet that kept sucking me in and spitting me back into bed from the opposite end of the room, going a few minutes back in time so I would wake up in bed from this nightmare endlessly, in my bed. I woke up for real to my husband pulling out of the vortex, or rather, holding me down so I didn't get up and run around flailing as I'm known to do.

Usually they're less epic than that. A couple nights ago, a grey cube began falling from the sky and almost crushed me. Sometimes I wake up on train tracks.

When I have actual *dreams*, they're more related to lived trauma. But when I wake up hallucinating, it's like my brain is just manifesting the worst possible things it can think of, rather than reliving  something that actually happened.

I can see how feelings of being trapped or stuck could be connected to PTSD, but sometimes it's so freaking random. Is this a normal symptom that you all experience, too?",1676070608.0

Feeling my chest get tight and my body tense up. Now fast forward to today I’m obviously still on alert more than normal. It’s stressful today at work. And one of the cooks slammed a pan and I instantly felt everything rush over me again. It’s crazy how fast your brain and flash that memory through your head. My boss at my old job when the initial incident happened told me “if you think about it it will make itself manifest”. She didn’t believe in it. She didn’t believe that sometimes things happen in your head. I’m glad I have people I can talk to.

The unstable homes lead to me overworking myself at school, at my job, and when I came home at usually 10 or 11pm(because that's when my mother was home and the abuse was less), my father would chase me out into the cold.

I live in Canada. People die on our streets from cold and heat. I knew I had to find places to stay. I couch surfed but that's not safe when you barely know the people.

Considering I'm a woman, you could imagine what I had to do to just get some sleep. A lot of the time it was consensual, however since I was a teen it was primarily pedophiles.

One time it was the coldest day of the year, my parents were refusing to buy me a winter coat or boots, anything really. I came home after work and my father was waiting for me, like a fucking ambush. He tried to grab me by the collar and he missed. Then the yelling, threats, etc ensued. He kicked me out for the night with nothing but my backpack.

Luckily at that time I was living out of my backpack. Every safe place I could have gone wasn't an option that day. I found a guy and went over to his place. He kept insisting I have something to drink and I cave and ask for water. I tried to peak around the corner to see him pouring the glass because safety 101. I couldn't manage to see it and he was forcing me to drink the water at that point.

I took one sip. The water barely touched my mouth. I was drugged.. I started to feel like I couldn't think straight, then I couldn't think at all, then I lost my strength. This dude dragged me to his room and forced himself on me. I screamed no in a house full of men that scoffed at me.

When everything was done, I left immediately. I was still wobbly and couldn't think. I just went home. Just for my parents to freak out at me. I barely remember what happened then.. but I ended up at a bus stop in the cold, waiting for whatever I had wore off. In -40 with nothing but leggings, sneakers, a shirt, and a spring jacket. I don't quite remember but I ended up back home and I snuck in to sleep.

I often want to tell people I have ptsd because I am so self conscious I am a fraction of the person I was before and I often come off weird now. 

I have pretty much fallen off the map and stopped talking to most my friends.

I have my first social away trip with a group of friends only four of which are close and aware of my trauma and ptsd. The other four are three long term acquaintances/friends and one person I haven’t met before. All but one are men.

I am quiet anxious about going away and sleeping in a house with other men (I can’t lock myself away when I sleep) and I think there is a high chance of being triggered badly or having a panic attack. 

I want to prepare something to say to explain myself and also just let people know so they can respond appropriately and not try to comfort me or come close as if i feel really threatened that can be a terrifying shit show for everyone involved. 

Usually I just say “I have ptsd sorry if I am weird” but I don’t think most people really understand the spectrum of ptsd.

So I (F27) was diagnosed with PTSD this past summer. Since then, I’ve been working on myself, going to therapy, and rolling with the punches. Before I got diagnosed, I went to see on of my best friends since childhood in New York City in May of 2022. She’s over there for grad school and was having a really rough time due to a certain experience that happened to her. I myself am not well off money-wise and at the time I was a minimum wage part time employee. It was not easy on me financially, but considering what she went through I really wanted to see her. Not to mention I got to NY, so win/win.

The trip became a flop for multiple reasons:

1) Throughout the trip she embarrassed me in front of her friends.
     -She said that “I was just bragging” when I asked her roommate about the coffee she bought for her French press (I was barista at the time and thought she might be really into coffee and just wanted to make conversation.) I was barely paying my bills with at the time with that job. I don’t think that’s much to brag about.
      -At a celebratory dinner for one of her friends, she outted me (I’m queer) to people I don’t know and basically implied I was an alcoholic (which I barely drink mind you.) One of her friends later made fun of me to my face. saying that I drank too much. Which I had only 1 or two drinks with dinner.

2)She called me a slut out of nowhere as a joke.

3)I felt like I was more of a bother, than her actually enjoying having me there. 
      -A good portion (not all) of the time she way just taking me to random place for a few minutes just to got back on the subway.
       -It felt like was about just getting to point A or point B and not exploring the neighborhoods and shops. I sent most of my trip on the subway.

There were some cool parts of the trip but I ended up feeling more like an afterthought and that I spent a good chunk of money just to be humiliated and have my time wasted. Hell, I’m still financially recovering from the trip. I didn’t talk to her about it at the time because at that point I really had issues with communication due to my trauma. Not to mention I still had multiple days to stay with her.

Since then, my resentment has just built up. It was almost a year ago and we don’t talk much but I still reach out to check up on her. I did my standard check up recently and found out she already has a job set up after her graduation. I know I should be happy for her but because of everything (the trip drama, the fact that she has her family helping her, and etc.) I feel myself filling with negative emotions that I know I shouldn’t. I don’t know if I should just leave it be because it’s been so long/we don’t talk very much or finally talk to her about it. I know her and I are growing apart anyway. We have both changed a lot and I just don’t know if this friendship is worth the energy anymore. I still love and care about her, I just don’t know. Thoughts and advice?",1676047159.0

606,My philosophy class involves a shitload of physical touch for some reason which I cannot handle without being extremely triggered.,54,10y4z8u,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/10y4z8u/my_philosophy_class_involves_a_shitload_of/,29,"I’m in a class where almost the entire class we are doing some sort of game or activity (even though it’s a college course). 

In the most recent class we had to do trust falls. Because of my PTSD I do not let anyone touch me besides my spouse and my dogs. Literally no one else. So I was horrified. I got partnered up and I didn’t know what to do and the world started spinning and I felt like I was going to throw up but I felt too shy to say something so I just tried it. I know this probably sounds dramatic but it was horrible. The flashbacks started pouring in. I started dry heaving and everything. My partner was so confused. I just pretended I choked. My then she was like “let’s try again”. Then I was like “actually I have sensory issues…” (which is also true, I have ADHD too so that contributes to this issue a tiny bit but I feel it’s a little more socially acceptable to say that then to trauma dump on someone you don’t know) anyway so I said “actually I have sensory issues, and I can’t do this activity”. And she was cool with it and she was like “that’s fine I’m anemic and I don’t feel good anyway”. Then my professor noticed we weren’t participating and he gestured at us like “what’s up?” and I said “I can’t do this” and he said “that’s chill” (he’s a hippie) and had my partner go with him. So I’m happy that he was cool about it. But what was really awkward was standing around doing nothing while everyone else was doing it, and other people asking me why I wasn’t doing it. I didn’t know what to say and I could barely talk as it was, I was just trying to stay standing, so I just said “I can’t.”

After class I emailed him explaining. I asked if activities with lots of physical touch were going to be something we were going to have to keep doing going forward, and he said yes.

It wasn’t in the syllabus or course description so I had no idea to expect to this. We’re over a month into the semester so I can’t switch into another class, or drop without losing my money.

I haven’t responded back yet but idk what to say. I feel like since he is very chill, he might not force me to participate, but I’m going to be so uncomfortable standing around being the only one not doing it. Everyone will wonder why I am not. I’m already an outlier because I’m significantly older than everyone. 

It’s going to be really easy for you all to tell me to not care what people think and just proudly not participate. But let me just say this. I have been in thousands of situations in my life, at age 32, where people have tried to convince me to “let up” on my no-touching rule. And I NEVER ever do. Under any circumstance. Ever. And yeah it is usually very easy to not budge. So for the social pressure of this situation to crack me, I’m asking you to trust me that the pressure is very high to participate. We sit in a circle and after every activity we have to tell everyone how we felt about the activity and if it wasn’t deep or real enough we have to try again. So you don’t get to be invisible in any way in this class. So by not participating, I would essentially be doing that at the expense of my privacy about this to everyone else in the class. 

I’ve known people for years and they don’t know I have this issue because they don’t try to touch me. It usually doesn’t come up. There would be no reason any of my classmates should need to know this. And I feel like any educated person would surmise that refusing to be touched only comes from a handful of things, but to do it to the extent that I am is probably from some sort of disorder. So I feel to some extent I could be outing my PTSD as well.",1675973853.0

If you asked me to describe them, it would be kind, gentle, and sweet. They enjoy slice of life video games like Animal Crossing or Harvest Moon, or fun mysteries like Nancy Drew. 

However, they tend to pick up media like horror movies and games easier. For example, today they watched a video on a horror game then we played it together. Admittedly, it was tough for me to stomach, but I like to engage with that they show interest in. Then, tonight, they admit that it actually made them uncomfortable and they don't understand why they cling to gorey and unnerving topics. They mentioned that it feels easier for them to pick up Resident Evil rather than a game like Stardew Valley, even though in their heart they want to play a simple farming simulator.

It made me realise how every interaction with a man who liked me or who I liked had been skewed by these experiences. That I said yes to sex because i was afraid if I said no they’d take it anyway.

Like I haven't gone through anything traumatic enough for it to be that. My therapist says I've experienced many traumatic events that compounded on each other because they all went untreated. As I became numb to these events happening I put up with more and more fucked up things. He didn't say it like that but that's what he meant. I've been held at gun point, sexually assaulted, abused, and neglected, and that was before graduating high school. I'm 28 now and I'm trying to get my life back on track and really work on my mental health. I'm a recovering addict, and I'm still working through the grief of losing my sister. My last relationship I loved a woman that lived a double life. She said she wanted to move across the country with me, but a couple weeks before she ""ended"" things kinda not really, and left with another man she was also living with. To be clear we were living together. She was an addict too and that made things messy. I trusted her completely and she broke it completely. I'm back in school now and I'm going to therapy every week. I'm doing better than I have in years. I don't know very much about PTSD, and again, I don't feel like I've been through anything traumatic enough to get it. I've never been to war, or been kidnapped, or anything that extreme.

I was molested growing up by a family friend off and on from ages 10-18. TI was 18 when I told them and my parents told me that if this got out my family members would kill ""D"". They are violent, take things personally & I didn't want to see him go to jail so I didn't tell anyone. In retrospect they were only protecting themselves but I didn't see it for that time. 

In HS I was that weird kid who didn't like to be touched and was leery of everyone. I panicked anytime I was left alone with an adult male. I refused to talk to anyone because again, I didn't want family to end up in jail. When I turned 16 he had celebrated that I was ""finally legal"" by slapping my ass so hard I had a hand shaped print for a week. I also had an autism diagnosis around this age which didn't help matters. Thankfully he ended up with a new job several states away and I never saw him. I still hate the sound of backfiring trucks because that's when I knew he was home. 

I was maintaining my life well or so I thought. I even graduated early. I still was that weird kid who desperately wanted to make friends though and so I didn't really make or understand people well or how to make friends in the first place. I consider myself intelligence but more or less regressed when it comes to interactions with peers my age. This all came to a head when I was invited to spend a weekend with a ""friend"", her boyfriend and his friends. I ended up being molested and raped by this group over a period of time that weekend and I'm positive that they took videos/photos. I recall a  flash and them laughing but I was so out of it I couldn't name exact details. My guess at this point is GHB based off symptoms. I didn't want to go to the hospital after because I knew the old abuse would be obvious. About a year later that two of them had been arrested in a different state, at uni, doing the same thing to other girls. It turned out that they had done this on a regular basis.

I moved as far away as soon as possible from my family and went for a fresh start. As much as I could. My career path was a very hands on one that requires a lot of work in close contact with people so I was always a little ""on edge"" but the work was very rewarding and people were respectful. There were no incidents for years and I loved my job and love the feeling of contributing to the end product. In 2017 a ""movement"" from within that career started and the strain it caused me was beyond anything I could have imagined. It was everywhere, all the time being discussed and I just felt the joy was sucked out of what I had once loved to do. I understand supporting victims and I WANTED to support them but I just felt like I wasn't ready  to be there for anyone else. I ultimately walked away because I was about to have a nervous breakdown and was self harming. 

Fast forward to Jan. I'm doing pretty well but I see a rather public ""outing"" of a group of boys who throw the parties just like the ones I dealt with but within the career path I was a part of. They  I absolutely fell apart. I've never had my past combined with my career like that and I feel like I'm just drowning.  I've not been sleeping, eating is tough and I've been avoiding anything online. My coping mechanisms aren't working as well.  I've never talked to someone who has truly went through the same that I did and I so badly want to reach out to them but know it's inappropriate. I'm also terrified after seeing how people are treated when people don't believe them online. How people are so incredibly degrading and cruel. I know me not officially reporting what happened to me allowed others to be abused and I try not to let that get to me. In all my years I've never once had my worlds collide like this and I just feel so lost.",1675988278.0

When I was 13, a classmate and former friend of mine held a pair of scissors to my throat and threatened to kill me mid class. apparently, no one saw this, so i pushed it back into the recesses of my mind and kind of just kept assuming i made it up/it was imaginary. this happened 6 years ago.

I cut off all my irl friends, and I don't feel safe in learning environments anymore. 

I feel the need to keep downplaying everything because i'd always felt safe at school before, so if it happened at school, it couldn't have been that bad. i know it's stupid. i still struggle with the fact that it happened. i was convinced for years i just made it up because i couldn't remember until i had a nightmare about the moment it happened and had a panic attack.

I (23F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for three months now, long distance. He’s an old friend, and we finally got together after knowing each other (in person) for around 10 years. It was all great in the beginning, as it always is. 

My boyfriend goes out and gets drunk, shitfaced, twice a week. His whole personality changes, I don’t recognize him. He spams me with texts and calls, cries about how i should just leave him, or just sits there and cries in general or gets angry. Unable to form a single thought or coherent words, and doesnt remember anything the next morning.
I have PTSD, I’ve been to therapy and have healed well. But this behavior of his, the drastic change in personality, is a huge trigger for me. 
We have talked about this, alot. And agreed that when he’s out drinking, I’ll put my phone on «do not disturb», so he won’t bother me.
My problem is; I feel like this hurt and reliving of trauma might be killing my feelings for him. I’m trying my best to get over it, and work through this trauma. We came to an agreement on the problem. But I don’t know if I can romantically heal from this.

I was very triggered. I told them about my experience of being physically abused by my mum when I was a kid and how because I never really bruised easily when I was a kid I didn’t have major marks on me so no one thought it was physical abuse. I told her how secretly I wished there were bruises so I could have had proof. I was telling the lady about how my mum broke hangers on my legs when I was a kid but for some reason there wasn’t a mark. I was in a suicidal crisis because I had actually frozen after my mom casually mentioned a few hours ago that I was never abused because I never had bruises. I felt like a fraud. I was trying to stabilize myself by gaining support from the warm line.

My mom has been eavesdropping on every conversation all my life. I could never feel free of anything. When my call ends with the warm line. She repeatedly knocks on my door. I’m startled and my fight flight response kicks in and I’m begging her not to come in because I can’t bear her presence in my room. Then she starts raging and verbally abusing me. Her words were far more intense than I can describe. She says she heard what I said how I should be ashamed of it. She doesn’t understand why I can’t look at all the good she did for me. She told me people on the warm line don’t give a single fuck about me and if they really cared I can go live with them. She said it in my native language so it was obviously far more aggressive than it sounds in English and her tone was so incredibly triggering. 

I have been in a very severe depressive episode and then I snapped back into a suicidal crisis. It took so much inside of me to not do something dangerous that night. I tried not to self harm since I’m a month clean from it so I had to keep myself safe. My mom was raging enormously, I would have preferred her beating me up to saying those words. I survived the night. But I have no idea how do I survive every other night that’s going to be like this.

623,Are Intrusive thoughts a part if PTSD?,1,10yaks3,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/10yaks3/are_intrusive_thoughts_a_part_if_ptsd/,0,"

So I have CPTSD and a range of symptoms that seem to peak and trough at random times. Sometimes, I don't like being touched, it's pretty much always there but it ebbs and flows in severity. Other times it's flashbacks. Recently its nightmares. They have been hideous of late but seem to be calming down a lot now.
Unfortunately it seem when one calms down another ramps up. Recently, it's intrusive thoughts. 
Every time I get on the bus, I get a strong feeling in my head and a flash of being shot in that part of my head. It's like a dull throb. It doesn't hurt, but it feels like it's highlighting where I'm going to get shot. Today, followed immediately after of being shot, was a visual of having my throat slit.

Now, I hate horror films and never watch them. Infact, I don't watch anything like that, i'm more a Marvel girl or comedy, yet these intrusive thoughts are getting more and more vivid. 

I recognise that they are worse since I broke up from my abusive ex, I have many intrusive sexual thoughts but those make sense as he was very rough and forced me to do thing often, he always left me hurt. But these seem to be totally separate from that?

Is it possible that it's another CPTSD symptom, or am I missing something?",1675987210.0

I’m four years post-trauma and post-diagnosis.

Done a lot of therapeutic work consistently since then.

Some was helpful, most wasn’t.

My biggest issue is constant fatigue and brain fog. 

Blood work is normal.

Exercise makes my fatigue issues worse(light, moderate, or intense, even things like yoga).

Can’t sleep great (issues falling asleep, not staying asleep) but no medication works. I’ve tried over 12 meds for sleep and they either have no effect or make me non-functional the whole day.

Sleep hygiene doesn’t do anything to help me either.

I’ve tried a wide range of anti-depressants (both ssri and snri’s) as well as anxiety meds, none of which were helpful at all. 

I’m in grad school, and I’m struggling. Not sure I can push through till the end.

The brain fog/fatigue has gotten worse over time rather than better. And I’m panicking because it’s getting harder and harder to do anything at all, even things I enjoy.

I was on a subreddit asking about abortion costs because I’m currently in a pregnancy scare (right before new year’s, someone didn’t use a condom although he promised to do so beforehand, and i was too stunned to react. so i haven’t had my period since then, and started to worry because it’s been 20 days past the start of my new cycle — i tested yesterday night and it was negative). 

The guy, I assume, scrolled through my profile where I had an offmychest post about my hypersexuality after a recent assault, and how i was trying to find healing from casual sex in some twisted way. Then he commented on my post saying I should be more concerned about my mental health than about medical procedures. I said I was already in therapy and said I didn’t think my pregnancy scare was important enough to bring up to my T, and asked him what exactly he felt that I should be seeking support for. 

He then replied saying that what I was doing (risky sexual behaviours) was contrary to seeking healing from sexual assault, and that my behaviour was impeding me from healing and perpetuating further instances of abuse. Shouldn’t I just be stopping these behaviours so that I can heal from it and move on? Said I have a big disconnect between my healing process, and actual healing. Honestly, this felt way to simplistic of a view towards healing.

I responded explaining how i felt stuck in a place where I have an uncontrollable need to reenact my experience repeatedly. said it’s common (although often not talked about) that victims of sexual assault and abuse experience hypersexuality, and possibly also as a means to self-harm. that yes, it does put us in more vulnerable positions to be assaulted or abused again, but most times it is very hard to stop these behaviours because of self-blame, self-hatred, feelings of worthlessness and negative + distorted core beliefs of ourselves and the world that were formed through experiencing the trauma. that I definitely want to heal, but healing is complicated and being stuck in maladaptive habits reliving our trauma is painful and unbearable. most people who have experienced severe trauma do experience the disconnect. i said that i didn’t expect anyone who hasn’t been through my specific trauma to understand how helpless we feel to be stuck in these behaviours even though rationally we know it’s contradictory to healing. then ended off saying that although we don’t need people who haven’t been traumatised this way to fully understand, I hoped that my correction educated him about the complexity of healing from trauma, that it is not simple or straightforward like most people think.

He came back saying I’m basically saying that I’m the only one with trauma. And that it wasn’t worth him continuing this convo anymore. 

[You can read the exact conversation here.](https://imgur.com/a/1MjWIB2)

Anyway beyond the pics, I asked him in return where he came to the conclusion that I said that no one else had trauma but me. Said that he made a major generalisation about my healing process and the general healing process as a whole, and that I was making a correction. Maybe don’t make a critical generalisations about other people’s trauma healing and how they are healing wrong, if you don’t like the answers that you’ll get that tell you that your criticism is incorrect. Then said I hoped he finds peace within himself too.

Maybe I was unnecessarily aggressive, although in my original comment explaining to him about how trauma healing really tends to look like, I genuinely was doing it in good faith because I felt like it was common for people not to fully understand how our traumatised brains work. It was only after he made the comment about me thinking I’m the only one who had trauma and that this discussion wasn’t worth his time, that I felt like he had planned to be condescending all this while and felt he was 100% right in his simplistic idea of trauma and healing. 

Anyway, it was a question about potential pregnancy. His comment was completely irrelevant and unnecessary on a thread and subject that didn’t remotely concern my trauma or my healing. I hadn’t mentioned it at all.

People really need to stop commenting about how other people should heal. There is no linear path or a singular “right way” to heal. Stop saying that there is and being critical about how someone else processes their trauma and heals, if they don’t match your idea of it. Keep it to your fucking self.",1675939282.0

On a Saturday afternoon at the end of January this year, I decided to go to the mall with my friends and boyfriend. We got food at the food court, went to a couple stores, then decided to go to a pretzel place for some snacks and drinks. We were waiting in a long line when we heard a loud noise. At first, I thought someone or something fell off of the top floor of the mall (this mall is huge & has 3 floors). I heard it a second, and possibly third time but I can’t remember clearly. Then I saw people running. And I instantly knew what happened.

I am in no means downplaying the situation, but thank god this was not a mass shooting. I am deeply sorry for the life that was lost that day, it was an innocent bystander who was trying to help someone in the midst of an argument.

The scary thing is, in current times, you never know if it is going to be only a couple gunshots, or a mass shooting. That’s what scared me the most. I remember running out of the mall and seeing massive amounts of people panicking and all the cop cars coming into the parking lot.

I feel almost guilty from feeling so traumatized by this though. I never saw the gunshots being fired, I only heard it. I couldn’t sleep for multiple nights. I was literally shaking all day long for multiple days as well as having panic attacks. Even just a mention of the city it happened in or a mention of any mall sends me into panic.

I've asked my therapist and now I'm asking anyone here: is there a particular book (or series of books) which you believe helped you in your healing process?  These can include books that directly discuss PTSD, are intended for PTSD healing, or even works of fiction whose goal wasn't necessarily to help you come to terms with or heal from the trauma, but which did for you regardless?

About a year ago I had a roommate. For 2 years it was good the third year it went downhill. I think changing to a harder major and a break up from a co-dependent relationship triggered them but they became emotionally unstable and took it out on me. We worked together and they didn't drive so I was their ride to work. I would tell them we have to leave in 10 min and they would panic and yell at me to not leave without them or to not rush them. They would scream and throw things when they were frustrated. They would eventually start sleeping in until noon. I would get home from work, waking them up and they would wake up in a panic and cry about how they slept thru their day. Even tho they told me to leave without them. They would want to know where I am at all times. They wouldn't do the dishes or clean the house so I had to. They would cry about not having food and they would only eat if I cooked for them. It was a daily thing of some reason they would be crying or yelling and it went on for about 6 months.

I have been living alone now. At first it was nice and healing. I could enjoy the morning again. But then things went for the worse. In July I had a truamatic event. I have cPTSD so this wasn't my first truamtic event but this is the first time I can't like put it in a box and deal with it later or dive into my work to constantly distract myself. I think my workaholic ways finally got to me and I'm burnt out. I have full PTSD symptoms now, and depression that hasn't effected me this much before. 

Now I have a hard time doing the dishes, I have a hard time getting out of bed, I have a hard time completing task for school, I'm easily overwhelmed. I couldn't figure out what to eat and just sat on the floor crying cause I just picked up groceries and still can't find anything appealing to me. Sometimes I just randomly cry? No idea why. I just like having my nightly cry?

 I don't take it out on people I keep it to myself but I hate that I see things in me that I see in them. I know they were mentally ill and they needed help (they didn't listen when I suggested it then) and I am getting help. I'm going to weekly therapy. I just got back on my mood stabilizers. But I hated how they made me feel when I lived with them and didn't want to sympathize but I'm starting to see the things I hated in me. I'm trying to get better but it's hard. 

A new friend is moving in in August. They know I have adhd and probably suspect depression. They work in the mental health field so I don't want them to feel like they have to come home to the same stuff they see at work and I don't want to do the things my old roommate did to me, to her. I had a talk with her like hey btw sometimes I just randomly cry is that okay? And she was like yeah just communicate with me with what you need when that happens so I don't just worry.

My therapist thinks I have cptsd though she says that’s not an official diagnosis, my trauma stems from childhood.

Ive never seen abusive people especially in enviorments like schools get bored, some treat you with less abuse but others jump from being fake kind ot abusive to fake kind, like it could be just words without ruining your belongings and despite not caring and being emotionally numb and dead it still hurt, I dont care about what people think of me as much as when epople dont think good of me they usually abused me and always in groups and isolated me, constantly being told you are inferior and at least they are not like you or things like stealing your chair and telling you they got there first even at the old age of 18 felt humiliating, I went from smiley and bubbly to emotionaly dead and mute and it is like a hyper mystery to some people - why you dont talk to them - when they never develop the self awareness that they always greet you with screaming or passive agressive insult with smirk...which no one else does. I dont command respect due to my meek nature which makes people show me their true colours, especiallty as an ugly woman I cant exist among certain types of guys who think it is okay to humiliate me when I have many neurological problems...and anxiety i couldnt control and it got so bad i had to take pills because i couldnt leave my house. I was so dead that i couldnt comprehend someone being in the room with me since i dissociated a lot since i couldnt defend my self verbally and emotionally and despite reporting it had failure after failure and the bullying weirdly escalated.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I am not saying this to - BOO HOO POOR ME, and punching anyone would have been uncalled for and hard since i was never physically abused, but no punch or slap in my life has felt as threatening as passive agressive comments with smirk or people taking my chair or throwing ball at my head, i know it may seem small and childish but when your abusers dont listen to you and constantly watch over you, and you hate being perceived and feel ugly cause of them you go insane, i actually started laughing when insulted due to feeling extreme pain and having hard time breathing cause of them and they never care how they affect you, just to get you upset, crying and angry and when you are not they just escalate it, which is why the only solution to bullying is prevention but the problem is that every bully i encountered seems to always get to me and idk how others who stop being bullied stop it, i have rarely seen physical fights stop it and the bullying it self was physical, while psychological and verbal bullying is much more damaging and subtle and never taken seriously, they never take responsiblity or care and are maniacal about your reaction or what you do with your phone, textbook, computer, consntantly commenting on what you do....is maniacal, and yet somehow they have social life, dont think about you and yet when they meet you they never forget to remind you how alone you are, how no one likes you and how you are below them...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

.even though you have no social life and are introverted but the lack of verbal communication and hanging out becomes insane, yet it is so hard to comprehend why you thme and dont talk to them, like what kind of consequences can you set for words and stuff like that, how do you pass the sh1t testing they do when it comes to how far they can push you, cause it seems in my case my abuse never stops until I leave while others do something to make it stop and intigrate them selves into the group...I honestly never understood how, and how i was always left without friends when I started with them, people sh1t on quiet people but never think they may be the reason people are quiet, I was never quiet in other places I was in and dont get me on the whole - EASY TARGET BS, because that is bs, weird and illogcial, a person just existing doesn't ""provoke you"" just because you think they are lame and dont fit your standarts of normal, but people judtify it and abuse you more and get their friends to do it too, so you are left one against many to deal with different kinds of abuse with no support and no one cares, witty comebacks are tricky against someone who doesnt care and what makes them think you are inferior is a mystery, apperently not being an ahole like them. To me boys ganging up on a girl with eating disorder is quite pathetic but to them it was fun, I cant collect my thoughts unless I am alone and walking so this whole fiasco of making fun of me and setting me as an example so your friends can laugh is not needed and weird, especially if you are not sexy or witty people will f you over, it ruined my perception of relationships and men because the only people in relationships were shallow, manipulative and cruel, and things like

\- if you dont have friends, boyfriend or xyz at that age you are a failure, kinda like if you are 30 and dont have kids and are married you are a failure, people never forget to remind you that, bullies arent insecure but it is quite weird how group of guys just hates on random girl for no reason, i never understood the reason behind that and why some people have such bad percetion of me since I had a guy in my class who purposefully ignored what i said and avoided me probably due to gossip from his friends, and when you are quiet you are even more weird and people make bad assumptions about you but you cant speak because the second that you do, you are screamed at to shut up, and laughed at, if you want me to speak it would be better to not scream at me to shut up you know, i honestly dont know how I became everyones scapegoat in high school for their problems, everything was my fault and that ruined me, and like - not being like her - like who? You made me this way and oyu bullied me it is clearly not my fault for once. I became cynical and nihilistic because way worse and more cruel people succeed in life than me and i didnt want t o live at all when people like that succeed, I want to be successful in life too but others opinions hurt me really much, I wouldnt have been happy in a relationship in high school but the pressure to be in one was severe, interestingly i was made fun of for everything under the sun - kissed a boy? Make fun of her for liking him, not kissing a boy or having sex? You are a lesbian, trans, horrible lame person and ""deserve to die alone with 30 cats"" and I honestly odnt know what the point of antagonizing me even for breathing oxygen or how I walk

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\- was, like I tried to blend in with the walls and they still found some flaw in me even in breathing while others did way worse sh than me, it is why i became paranoid that i was watched, being constantly watched should be type of abuse it self, I coudnt even fix my bra strap without someoen sayng - look at what she is doing, What am I doing? something illegal? Also throwing objects my head, I know this is light bullying and to them it is funny but when you no longer react with anger or tears it should be a big sign, it is funny how bullies try to be victim for simple things like telling them to move away when they literally told you to die a few hours ago, weird ego and narcissitic issues and yet they were liked and accepted despite being horrible people. They were constantly out andh ung out with their friends and had normal teenagehood while I was stuck inside my house and barely talked to anyone because ...I dont know why, anxiety and people being mean...and yet they with the social life still found time to make fun of me and make me feel horrible? If no one ""thinks about me"" or ""is looking at me"" and I am imagining it then how did they always find the time to make a stupid or weird comment if they are so busy with their lives, how did I stick out like a sore thumb and couldnt find common ground with anyone even those who liked anime and video games as a girl, which were guys, how did everyone have a group of friends but me, and how did they not get that they were creepy, like the damned conceler was good for nothing, when it comes to retalation it is left in your own hands but usually fighting is when you yourself are beaten up, words are fought words etc but i am not very argument savvy, however they seem to rerort to insults when they dont know what to say, whether hated or disliked doesnt matter, it is quite bizzare to anatagonize a stranger and make up stuff for them and gossip about it and make people not be their friends because no one talks to the bullied kid or wants to sit next ot them, how the hell does anyone think this is funny

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

the only solution is the hardest one which is to be firm and mean but not insulting, if you insult them then a fight between who can insult you better begins and if they get angry they threaten you and get nasty, and yeah reporting is hard, you could record them but then again you cant record everything, in the wild animals that dont conform or are weak become prey if they dont fight but when it comes to social hierchies it ....extremely weird nd bizzare, you cant sit alone or exist alone it seems, I never cared who i sat with but i had way more fun whe ni wasnt alone, however being alone cause no one wants you or likes you and having - no one to talk to, not only to sit with - is quite the punishment for someone who never insulted you or did anything to you, you cant run away forever either and idk why they need physical manifistation of people fearing them and being below them if they are so perfect, bullies use people to get aheard and dont care about them but it is weird how they NEED to remind others how little worth they have, I have rarely seen an insecure bully and I feel like people who say that only say it to make victims of abuse feel better.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I dont know what creates bullying abuse and how it starts, basically bullies have sh1t testing where they test if you will be a good victim but that is very vague and i seem to never pass it seems, I dont know what conseuqnces i should have said but it seems i need to adress it before it escalates, humour and being confident is the answer but that is also vague and hard, and the hardest part is not being emotional, crying and being angry...I was never able to control my tears but bullying me isnt an achievement, anyone could make me cry even a cat or a 3 year old child even if they didnt insult me....also also hormonal disbalance, idk what kind of power and ego boost they get but i never understood why they are tolerated if others dislike them or how they dont get on their bad side and are seen as strong, I am traumatized since i couldnt stop it and that makes me feel like a failure, i honestly dont think punching them would have solved it tho, i need to learn how to speak and snap back and be assertive verbally and at least have some trust in my self and confidence...punching is easy but you are usually punished for it. I honestly dont know how to avoid these people. I am in uni now but I feel like i have to be constantly interested and fake and talking in order to not be abused, there was a period in my life at 16 where i was afraid to walk alone to the store in fear of a stranger bullying me, i was afraid to ask for help for finding a product and couldnt breathe and clenched my teeth to the point where i couldnt open my mouth to eat and had to forcefully relax. Any advice is appreciated. I struggle with boundaries and others respectign them more than saying no. I apologize for the long post, I just wanted to describe the situations I was in in the past, Ive always had weird teachers shouting at me despite being the only student that didnt cheat and study, i dont understand how to command respect as a small woman, even if I put on make up I will just be sexualized, not respected and what hurts me the most is that guys mostly respect manipulative mean girls type since most see it as some sort of confidence, same with guys being toxic isnt being masculine, being toxic is making fun of others and shaming them for no reason just because you find them ugly, what a good man is someone who is honest and brave and hardworking...not hurting little anorexic girls",1675867417.0

656,Can you have PTSD without having that many flashbacks,7,10wigh1,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/10wigh1/can_you_have_ptsd_without_having_that_many/,15,"I won't get too graphic with the details, but last year I was raped numerous times. One of these events involved me being trapped in a room by a man and assaulted repeatedly for hours, the second was a guy saying he could kill me then raping me, and the third was violent rape. They were horrible. During one I thought I was going to be beaten, during another I thought I was going to be killed, and during another I thought the man was going to tear my vagina.  

I don't experience flashbacks that often though. I think I've maybe had 2 real flashbacks regarding these events. Even when I purposely try to trigger a flashback nothing really happens to my mind. The trauma my rapes gave me is pretty intense and I wonder if it's possible it's given me PTSD minus all the flashbacks. After going through all of that I just don't see how I wouldn't have PTSD. 

The trauma has affected me greatly, not in the form of flashbacks though. I'll wake up pouring sweat, I feel an inexplicable emotional pain, my ED is back (so is my cigarette addiction) just to name a few ways it's affected me.",1675817085.0

658,I think I may have PTSD or CPTSD from past sexual abuse. Tips on how to cope to lead a normal healthy life in regards to dating and intimacy?,2,10wmzny,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/10wmzny/i_think_i_may_have_ptsd_or_cptsd_from_past_sexual/,1,"I think I have Complex PTSD (CPTSD) from past sexual abuse. What do I do/read/etc. to have a normal functioning life?

I (26F) was sexually abused when I was a child. In my teens, college, and even up until recently, I had toxic relationships that pushed my boundaries and hurt me over and over, bc I didn’t understand the damage that was done early. I do have to point out, on a side note though, that I’m getting better at picking better relationships. But still. 

Over a year ago at this point, a close friend of mine of about 10 years, sexually assaulted me and betrayed my trust. While I was confiding to him about domestic violence and family problems, which I had never done with him before, he got turned on by my misery perhaps and after an hour of talk, he started jacking off while we were on the phone and verbally said so. He then proceeded to text me a documentary of a porn star or something who was severely beaten and faced domestic violence by her boyfriend, who was some crazy rageful mma fighter, followed with some weird sexual comment from him that I didn’t read more than once before panicking and deleting his text. I couldn’t bear to even see it with my eyes again. It was really weird and disturbing. I was shocked. It felt out of left field. It was not something I expected from him. And it was an absurd response to me talking about something vulnerable and upsetting that I had hid from him and everyone for my whole life. I was confiding in him about some traumatic stuff that was affecting me deeply— and then he did THAT. 

He never properly apologized for what happened. It took me almost a year, but after talking with him a final time, I cut off contact last April, 2022. I stopped answering his angry texts, no more talking, forever. 

For some reason, I am still fucked up during intimate encounters with men. I was always kind of like this, but his actions have led to me being weirder ever since. I tense up, I can’t look people in the eye, my adrenaline and fear is through the roof. And i hate it. It’s damn embarrassing and I don’t trust men at all. 

After any sexual encounter, I get weird the next day too. Like I get an empty feeling and have weird intense flashbacks, some of which are just really intense fantasized morbid day dreaming of terrible things happening to me. I can’t stop it and it’s debilitating. Recently, I slept with this guy I liked. He saw my tension and anxiety in the middle and we stopped. He was concerned and I couldn’t/didn’t want to explain why, i wouldn’t know where to begin! The next day, i was so out of it and morbid daydreaming so much that I got into a car accident on the road, after mindlessly merging into a lane without paying attention. Not the first time I’ve been out of it, but this time I paid the price a little. So Apparently, I’m also a fucking psycho.  

Even when I read about someone else’s sexual encounters or someone asks me for a date or implicitly asks to hook up without me having invited the convo,  it triggers for me. For example, I was reading up on HSV-1 this morning to educate myself on it, just to know! I got curious after watching a health video. But I soon regretted it— soon after reading, I started getting a little shaky, neck tense, cold sweats, morbid day dreaming, and physical exhaustion/sleepiness, like someone shot me with cocaine and anxiety and fear for the past two hours. I didn’t feel this anxiety bc I thought i had the virus, but rather from imagining past sexual encounters with different men, which weren’t even necessarily traumatizing, just me being in that weird scared headspace. Everything seems so evil and scary when it comes to getting physically close to men. It scares the shit out of me. 

What’s happening to me? I need this to stop, it’s ruining my life in many different ways!",1675829714.0

661,I'm new to this... I don't know how much more I can do. TW... infant death,18,10w4mt9,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/10w4mt9/im_new_to_this_i_dont_know_how_much_more_i_can_do/,8,"Hello. Before you go any further, trigger warning on infant death. It happened almost five months ago. I don't know if I'm really looking for support, advise, or just venting. I guess I'm just reaching out. 

I won't go into a lot of detail. I'm part of another group here where I discuss my issues related to death of my son. But I'm seeking further support into my PTSD. I had a therapist. I was supposed to be going once a week and doing group. But I couldn't afford it, so I was reduced to once every two weeks. My work provides really shitty medical. I got a better plan thinking the coverage was going to be better. It wasn't. Now, it doesn't cover anything at all. So I haven't gone in about a month. 

I'm not on medication, and I'll explain why

When I was 26 weeks pregnant, I checked myself into Labor and Delivery because I had trouble breathing. Five hours at the hospital and they lost my son's heartbeat. I was taken to the OR where they had my son out in two minutes. There was no local anesthesia. I went down on that table with four people holding me. I was fighting for my life. And I thought I was going to die. I was eventually knocked out, but not before feel part of the cutting. My son survived, but just barely. And then I spent the next two months almost completely alone over 100 miles away from home. My son was in NICU for 57 days. A good part of that I sat next to him waiting for good news. It never came. Instead, I got a phone call. While I was putting his clothes away in a dresser back home. The doctor told me I needed to get to the hospital fast and to bring the father. When we got there... we were told we had to make a really hard decision. The small chance that my son would live meant that he would be living off a machine for his whole life. Or I could... ""make him comfortable"". When I asked how long we had to make the decision, she said he would be lucky if he made it for two more days. I was so scared my boy was going to pass without me being there. I was so scared he was going to have to go alone. So we did what we thought was best. And we let him go. And now I have these vivid memories of him. 

The flashbacks of the OR were okay for me to deal with because it meant my son lived. But now that he's not here, all I can think about was how I thought I was going to die and how he must have felt in my arms. The worst flashbacks are in that NICU. But I have little ones all the time. Of sitting alone in the housing room, driving miles down to see him, walking down a large empty hospital hallway. And I can't control what triggers them. Or when they'll happen. Or how bad they'll be. Sweet memories I love now grow dark and twist. I look at photos or videos and I break down. 

My goal for therapy was to create a wall so I could remember him without linking him to a bad memory. I want to remember him as my son. But all I can think of is how he sounded when he tried to breathe. I watched him die. And every day I sit in bed and I think of reasons to go on about my day. Because really I'm terrified of what I'm going to see that day. Will I be okay? Will I have a sudden panic attack? Will something remind me of one of the horrible things that happened to me in those two months? Will I get in trouble at work for stepping away for half an hour because I'm hyperventilating? 

I don't know what to do. This trauma... it's... I don't know. I've had childhood trauma. My mother was mentally ill and mentally abused me my whole life. I was taking antidepressants by then time I was 10 for no reason. Which is why I've refused to take pills for this. I want to grieve for my son. I don't want to numb it. I feel like it would only make things worse because I won't learn to control it, I'll just rely on the numbness to feel better. I don't want that. I want to hurt for my son because it's just the love I could never let out. But I'm tired of seeing him in pain over and over and over again. 

Some days I'm okay. The attacks used to be a lot worse. But I still have bad ones. Out of nowhere. I just want to look at photos of my son. I'm tired of feeling guilty for going days without looking at them. But I'm so scared when I do, I'm going to go into a spiral again. I don't know how to talk to people about it. I feel like people at work think I'm lying about the severity of what's happening to me. I don't like it, either. I'm stuck in this border of wanting people to understand but not wanting them to think I'm just doing this for sympathy or to get out of work. I don't know how to talk about it or explain it. I don't know if I can just get doctor's note and say ""hey, look, I'm pretty messed up right now"". Like I don't know what to do. I wish I could just go to therapy like I'm supposed to. I wish drugs weren't so iffy. I wish I could get time off to cry. I mostly just wish my son could have lived.",1675783794.0

I tried hard to soothe him but it didn't work, by the very end he eventually calmed down-when the filling was put on. The dentist said that has never happened before and was dismissive repeatedly about him yelling. The assistant said is your cheek feeling full now. He said yes and now he did't feel anything.

668,Self-help or a therapist?,4,10w9azs,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/10w9azs/selfhelp_or_a_therapist/,7,"So I'm not sure anymore, I have symptoms every day, although meds given by a psychiatrist kind of help in not caring about them that much.

I've been trying to find a right psychotherapist, but it's really hard. Many don't get it. If they do, therapy isn't succesfful. Maybe I just have bad luck. Even my psychiatrist thinks i don't have PTSD, but psychotic symptoms (because I hear or feel things - still) I don't care about the diagnosis, I would just like meds to help, and they kind of help. Could be better, maybe I'll ask a psychiatrist to raise a dosage (I'm on seroquel).

The key question is - would you say finding a psychotherapist is necessery or maybe try self-therapy using books? From my experience, unfortunately, some psychotherapists may make things worse, I think self-help is safe in that matter, because it won't hurt. On the other hand, would it be enough?

So, seek for the right one until I find them, or give up and try self-therapy by reading books?

he was my friend though and i trusted him, and felt safe. i got there and he gave me a hug, and as i started unpacking the things from my bag, he started thrusting against me. i didn’t say anything because i was too scared. we both went and layed on the grass, and he leant over and kissed me. this was my first kiss ever and i feel guilty for not regretting it. it was romantic and i’m glad it was my first kiss, but what happened next is why i feel guilty for enjoying the kiss

he then lifted my shirt up and started fondling my breasts and sucking/kissing them. i remember looking at the sky frozen. it genuinely felt like i was paralysed? afterwards he asked if i wanted to go further and i said no

later on after i left, he called me and literally just said “sorry about the boob thing”. i couldnt look in the mirror for a week and couldn’t touch my own breasts without feeling sick. i was sent to the mental hospital about a week later as i wasn’t doing very well.

He started micromanaging everything, flying off the handle at  trivial things, twist our words and blame us for pretty much everything. He would give us the silent treatment and leave us without proper guidance. He started blaming things on us on account of ""being women"". He even restricted my access to my workplace, and then blame me for ""letting him take care of my own business"". Our boss pretty much left me out to dry; I could not bring myself to report my supervisor, as I felt that I owed him for helping me get this job (that was true, plus I had some, ahem, feelings for him -I know, stupid on my part). My boss knew some things, but still he turned a blind eye and had me do all the grunt work and promised me money he never gave me.

The frustration has been building up: on not being able to laugh, on not living my life, on not feeling alive. The healing process is way too slow... I am tired of being this way.

Every few days I am thinking that I could die tomorrow, and I am ok with dying.  
***But what scares me is dying while already feeling dead.*** I want to die knowing that I lived and felt alive. I want to just experience things and have fun without being afraid to the point of constantly shutting down. I want my last memories to be nice and warm... I want to know that I have started healing and that I am living life expressing myself and doing the things I like.. so that living can be worth it... and so that I can go with a smile.

I used to think that I have no choice in this, but in the past year, I have realized that I have a choice.  
The choice to let myself fall into the risk of feeling all of my emotions.  
The choice to risk having all of my fears happen again.  
Because if I am constantly looking for danger or expecting it... I will never get out of this.

But something in the back of my head is asking:

* What if you will go crazy?
* What if you can't handle it?
* What if you become irrational?
* What if everyone will hate you for being so emotional once you let go?
* What if you will not see the signs of danger anymore once you let go?
* What if not looking for danger is gonna make you forget to look out for danger, and you will fall into the same trap again?
* What will I do when I forget how to have my own back / protect myself? Or when I forget that it is even an option?
* ***What if your fear happens again, and it will be the last thing you'll ever be able to handle?***

I try to ignore all this, not think about it, and go on with my life.  
And while it is slowly getting better... it is still unbearable.  
Even if it doesn't make sense, it feels like life or death.  
As if the moment I step out and let go... I am done.

I have moments in which I try to let go to show myself that I can do it, and every time I try, I feel myself slipping into insanity with unreasonable logic and mood swings. Nothing makes sense in those moments, I get so easily triggered and waves of repressed feelings come crashing. After a few minutes of trying, I shut down and feel like I should never try it again.

And no.. this is not easy to do. There are so many walls I need to push so I can gather the courage to feel, and let myself express what I feel in the moment. I've done this only 2 times so far, for very short times.

\-----------------

No matter how much I want to laugh and live, how much I can't take being like this anymore, something in me is way too afraid to step out of the fear.

   For the past 5 years I was in a relationship with this person. Once, we were having sex after an argument and during it an argument came up again, he forcefully came inside me as I screamed, yelled and tried to push him off of me. It never dawned on him the severe damage he did to me.. I was never pregnant but due to my weakness I stayed. Stayed because I love him, still do even though I also want nothing to do with this person..
  
   Traumatic part: he'd record me during sexual moments even though he knew I was never comfortable with it. Never gave my consent. He continued to do so because it was something he enjoyed, he claimed it was something that I should just get over because we've been together for that long. I should just deal with it because of how much he loves my body and he wants to use it for his own pleasure. Moving forward he went ballistic during a hard time for him, turned into him scaring me, threatening me, him showing screenshots of him being on porn sites promising that he would post the sexual videos of me for all to see, then not do it. Rinse and repeat this kept happening when we got into a fight, if I tried fighting back verbally or ignoring him, he would send me that to manipulate me into talking to him & dealing with his anger & agression.. 

   I'm the last 2 years he's made a lot of progress on certain ways that has been very different from the person he was before. I feel like I've changed even though he would very much argue differently. What I'm need feedback on is we were talking on the phone earlier, he was wanting me to allow myself to be recorded sexually for him, for his birthday, even though my feelings on that are still very the same. He then tells me that I'm so focused on the past I just can't let go, I can't move on from the past or the bad situation I went through being scared of being recorded, him threatening me, severally traumatizing me etc... That I've had ""plenty of time to recover"" apparently.

   I do see some merit in what he's saying but 2 years isn't long enough for me to just get over it. Or simply move on from the past even if I've been seeing him act better. That's still in the back of my head, I don't trust him, I can't stand him wanting to record me I still don't think he's justified in saying oh ""well I'm done dealing with you, & you constantly reminding me of my past, of who I used to be, I'm not going to keep kissing your ass because you don't know how to grow up and move the f**k on with it, this is why we're not together etc..."" I know I'm not perfect but... I can't help how I feel. I want to be able to move on, but I can't, I can't just not think about him hurting me sometimes when it comes to that aspect.. it's not my fault it never would've been there if he never did anything in the first place, & I shouldn't be dictated on my feelings when his actions for multiple years kept literally conditioning me to be in fear of him emotionally, mentally, & sexually. 
He kept saying that I'm weak and I'm never going to be happy because I can't move on because of all this stuff that bothers me... 
So very long story short am I truly wrong for feeling this way, or is it just him trying to force me to feel something that I just can't rush to happen regardless of no incidents in the last 2 years?...

690,PTSD from fire alarm?,1,10vu9f4,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/10vu9f4/ptsd_from_fire_alarm/,3,"The title sounds ridiculous, but hear me out. I’ve had a lot of childhood trauma and sexual trauma, but instead of having panic like symptoms associated with that PTSD it’s more of dissociation and brief depression episodes. So, yes. I do understand at a very basic level what PTSD is, how it can effect people differently, and I have been diagnosed. My problem lies in something else right now. 

About 2 months ago, the fire alarm went off in my building for 5 1/2 hours straight in the middle of the night. I live on the 7th floor. All the emergency fire doors shut and I had JUST moved in, so it was hard for me to find the stairs. I finally huffed it down to the garage and outside. 

After about 30 minutes, someone came out and let us all know that it was due to someone breaking a water pipe on the ground level. I felt better knowing my new apartment wasn’t in any real danger, but they didn’t know how long it would be before they could figure out how to cut it off. 

To make it all worse, since I had just moved in a couple weeks before from an entirely different state, I didn’t know anyone. My car was in the shop and I didn’t have money for an Uber at the time, so I just had to find a semi quiet place downstairs in the lobby to curl up in a ball until it was over so I could try to get some rest. I was also pregnant at the time so this sent my nausea into full swing. The alarms were so loud that my ears were ringing almost the entire next day. 

The reason I bring this up is that now I jump at ANYTHING that sounds like an alarm. My heart will pound and I have to take a few moments to collect myself. Even just from an alarm on TV or a strange noise in my apartment that I can’t immediately identify. I accidentally set the alarm off (only in my unit, thank god) for a few minutes a few weeks ago. I pulled out some baked chicken from the oven, some chicken juice hit the very hot pan, and it instantly sent up some smoke. I was fight or flight IMMEDIATELY. Cut off the stove, grabbed my robe, grabbed my dog, and was headed out the door when it stopped. Then I cried for nearly 5 minutes while shaking uncontrollably. 

Is it crazy to have this much of a panicked reaction to an alarm? Things like this never used to bother me. It keeps me up at night now. Am I just overreacting for some reason, is this PTSD, or is something else going on? Is there any way to stop it? Help, please.",1675749333.0

When I play competitive mode in a video game such as PvP Minecraft or even just think about it, I become very anxious, heart beating fast, shaking, sweating, heavy breathing and adrenaline going wild, as if I was having a re-experience.

Non competitive games don't have this effect, however if friendly fire is possible and I get attacked, it gives the same panicking response as competitive mode, so I think having to fight other people is the reason and not because it's a video game.

This post pains me to make, but I need some help and advice. I don’t want to give a lot of detail, because this is not my story to share, but the gist is, my best friend has been raped since she was a child to almost an adult.  

I’ve slept in the bed with her a few times, and she gets horrible, horrible, terrifying nightmares. She cries and says “ow” over and over, while grabbing at her private areas. I can deal with this. I know she likes to be held, and I talk her through it. However, I have no knowledge in this part of things:

When I slept in the bed with her last night, she woke up from a terrible nightmare and immediately began having a panic attack and grabbing at her private area. She told me it hurts. She’s told me before that after waking up from nightmares that her private part gets really sore, but I have no idea what to tell her or what it even is myself. Last night when she was having this panic attack she said to me “it feels like someone is touching me down there.”

Can someone please explain, is this PTSD manifesting in a physical way? Is she still half asleep during the panic attack? Is there anything she can do to stop it? What can I do to help her? That’s all I want to do. 

She is not ready to see a therapist yet, but I have been gently guiding her towards it. I just need help with the now.

I hope this post isn’t insensitive in anyway. Please let me know if there’s something I should correct or not say at all.",1675677261.0
702,Once you have PTSD can your brain create trauma out of a different situation that is smaller?,2,10v3i3m,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/10v3i3m/once_you_have_ptsd_can_your_brain_create_trauma/,3,"I've worked a lot to overcome my big trauma, one of them, but part of it being so bad was being stranded to cope with it in a foreign country without any help. 

Years later, I ended a relationship while living in another country and staying there. I had arrived without much and he already had all the apartment things you need so I never had to buy them. 4 years later we ended things. Then in a span of 6 weeks I had lost a job and a relationship and had to start from scratch without family help, home items I need(not even towels or sheets), or a job or savings(had been using my wages for therapy and stuff, feeling secure- stupid, i know). Needless to say it was a stressful year and created a ripple ptsd effect that made it almost impossible to work for 3 years even if I were as close to starving and homeless as it gets. Like starving for sure, walking 3h a day cause I couldn't pay for bus definitely, homeless no but evicted almost and finding place with roommates 5 days before I was about to be homeless.

Anyway here we are. And now every money issue creates a super traumatic response from   me, rather than motivation to finish work faster, sometimes I freeze and dissociate or hyperventilate and become hypervigilant and recheck if I locked my door, things like that. And work starts moving at an awful slow pace, I lose time. Is it possible it's because of that time? Like I've worked enough on my original trauma but that created a new trauma I didn't work through hence those reactions? Or am I just trying to find sense of control over my health that I just don't have? I'm tired of having such reactions whenever something goes wrong financially because objectively it just delays me getting more money and not creating such situations. Like having to sell or pawn things because I freaked out and my pay is delayed by a week but I need to pay rent... is it possible those 3 years then created a ripple trauma that if I work through it I can get better about some triggers?",1675679853.0

I can’t handle violence in games and don’t like violent games. I game but usually simulator games or simple platformers. Violent games just remind me of my older sibling who would threaten and assault me daily. And they also remind me of the games I used to play with one friend as a kid, before he and my sibling both s*xually abused me….

Tonight my partner of 7 years downloaded a new horror game. The one based on H.H. Holmes. 10 minutes in and just from being in the room and watching them play, I started bursting into tears and panicking and getting really anxious. My partner paused the game and helped calm me down. I’m in the other room now, trying to stay calm and soothe myself.

I feel like such a loser. This whole past week I’ve been dealing with physical health issues and we’re trying to move soon and then these panic attacks over a fucking video game have me feeling weak.

I went through some harassment yesterday and it's hard to feel like you're overreacting.

Yesterday I was walking down the street with my fiancé and we crossed the street at a zebra crossing. The car approaching us was going much faster than the speed limit and had to brake hard, but again, we were on a zebra crossing. The men in the car rolled down the window and started yelling horrible things at us. We just quickly went into the store and when we came out 15 minutes later, they were still there and kept cruising next to us as we walked home, just yelling incomprehensible things, I only picked up a lot of swearing. At some point my fiancé got frustrated and started yelling back. It got really out of hand and the yelling was quite intense back and forth. The guys started saying they were going to mess him up and one of them opened the car door. The other drove them a bit further and started parking right around the corner, next to our place basically. My fiancé yelled he would call the police which might be why they didn't come for us after all.

At this point I was completely freaking out, I had already had a PTSD flashback earlier and this just made me have one of the worst panic attacks I've ever had. I was crying, frozen, I could barely speak, I was afraid they were going to hurt my fiancé and me really bad or follow us home. The fiancé was really kind and got me calmish enough to take me to walk the long way around to our home. They didn't follow us luckily. I got inside and closed all the curtains and locked the doors and I just felt completely lost and unsafe. My fiancé kept saying they can't get us here, they hadn't seen us go home, we will never see them again. And I know rationally that is probably true, but I can't help but feel terrified of going out at this point. Every sound I hear, I fear it's someone trying to break in. I fear those guys live in the same street, since they went to park there but didn't follow us, and I will run into them if I go out and they will hurt me. 

We called and gamed with some friends yesterday evening and one of them was so very kind, letting me vent it out and comforting me. My fiancé ordered some nice food for us and I ended up taking my emergency meds which helped me calm down and sleep. Other friends didn't really know what to say, one went into how those guys were wrong because the law is they have to let us pass on a zebra crossing, which is of course true but wasn't what I was struggling with. But I understand it is hard to understand and react to and I don't blame them. I guess I'm mostly telling myself I overreacted. My fiancé went to work and doesn't worry about running into them at all. I feel terrified to even go out at all. The experience that caused my trauma wasn't even anything like this, there was no yelling or physical abuse and it happened in my own house by a friend. I don't know why it bothers me so much but then again, I guess that is just PTSD.

I've had this kind of thing before too, I was pickpocketed by some guys that bumped into me in the train 3 years ago and I struggled with that so much too I avoid that train as much as possible. There was another guy that sat down next to me in the train and put an arm around me 2 years ago and now I went back to putting my bag next to me on the chair, only taking it off if I feel safe.

It spikes my anxiety extremely high and frankly its embarrassing because it's such an every day thing. I don't yell or get mad but I freeze up and can feel my heart race, like I'm waiting for something bad. I kind of know where this comes from, but at the same time I feel all the thoughts I can remember are kind of just... dumb? Like when I lived at my grandparents house, they would walk past the door and I would just pray they didn't open it or knock on it. I think I felt like my privacy was being repeatedly invaded because I wasn't allowed to say ""don't come in"" or ""Not right now"" they'd just walk in or knock until I told them yes. It could also be related to an even when a guy broke into my house as a child, though he broke through the window, not a door. 

I think its been especially triggering as of late because I live with roommates so I don't really have a ton of privacy except the bathroom or if I ask for it.

She said “no problem” as I’ve been having night terrors and struggle with vomiting in the mornings and muscle/joint pain. So I need to go to bed at a decent hour in a calm environment.

After 2 months, she kept disrupting my sleep. (Lights, TV, talking, etc) I spoke to her several times about how “I need a quiet, dark place to sleep. So I feel safe.” (I struggle with nightmares and wake up vomiting when off my meds) But nothing has changed and last Thursday she did it again after 10:30pm

But here’s the thing.

she has narcolepsy. So she has symptoms much like we do. And I don’t blame her because it’s not her fault she has narcolepsy. Much like it’s not my fault that I have PTSD.

With all the years in the making and all they have taken
It's time to let go, maybe let them show
Keep in mind as hard as they might be, they no longer will ruin me

Deep in slumber they await for someone to open the gate
A gate hidden by walls, inside nothing but a free for all
Time to bottle them up, let them float away at sea
 let them be only a distant memory
You cannot live by your past, I have realized that at last
As the demons come and go It only proves to show 
These demons inside of me need to be let free 
By the grace of God and all that is abroad 
I pray only for a way to make them go away

But now he has a girlfriend, and his girlfriend is of course not ok with another woman living there with him, so I have to move out asap. My friend gave me one month tops, to look for a place and move. 

The thing is, my parents disagree with me living alone and want me to go back living with them, but that would be terrible for my mental health and wellbeing since they are very abusive, but at the same time I need their financial support because I don't have any idea what to work at and how to get a decent salary. 

Honestly, here in Mexico the wages for the jobs I could do now are too low to have a decent life. I think I need to go back to study, but that also requires money. And besides I have no idea of what I should study. 

I love drawing and have thought about graphic design or animation, but people around me always tell me that you can't make it as an artist in this country. My second opinion is psychology. But really, I need guidance. Right now, all I have is my psychiatrist, who is great, but I have no family or friends, not really. 

I think that if I tried hard to talk things out and be logical about it, I could convince my parents to still help me out and try to start studying. But I need help, I really need ideas.",1675561696.0

Like...I am honestly over they whole thing where I have to give a shit if someone wants me to respect something when I have not even asked their opinion.  My opinion is that they should only ever go and help other people.  Even if it kills them.

So, I am realizing that people think because I have Autism Spectrum Disorder that I am some stupid retard who is just going to help people who I don't have to help.  I honestly...am at the point where I would not even help some woman who seems to be having an issue with some creep on the side of the road.  Would anyone help me?  No.

Why the fuck would I give a shit if someone who I do not care about at all.  Who does not care about me.  Who thinks I give a shit if someone beats them to death. Why would I care if someone like that, who also does not care about me at all...exists.

I mean...I honestly feel like the fact that I stopped caring about someone who I don't have to give a shit about.  Who thinks I should be homeless, outside, and dead.  I think that is wonderful.  I also think it's wonderful that I don't give a shit to help them when it does nothing for me.  No.

I would say that that kind of person should never take care of themselves at all.  Never go to the Doctor.  Eat the most garbage food only.  Or starve themselves.  And pollute their brain with utter and complete bullshit.

So much of it is people convincing you that you must care.  That you must take a seat and listen to their garbage.  No...you don't have to.  You can always validate something that...it doesn't even have to be humane.  Because anything someone else validates, when they want a reaction...it's hilarious.

It's also hilarious when someone tries to convince you that it is the last light...no.  The light rises everyday, and sets everyday.  So, when people use that bullshit...exactly.  They can go and cry.  Especially when they are obviously full of shit...shit that they think they can get some autistic person to buy into.  No.

I also am beyond caring about how others would feel.  Um...that's not my problem.  People have tried to convince me that it is my problem that they eat shit for a living and get paid for that.  No, please eat more shit.  Once you tell me something like that...yea.",1675560449.0

I just had this very dreadful feeling, thinking of souls in the gnostic sense trapped to reincarnate again and again.

My mother died in early 2021 after being diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver and endometrial cancer. The week before her diagnosis, I had had the police called on me by my father due to an anxiety attack. He called twice in one day, and once 2 days before. The first time they came with a social worker, which gave me a number to a mental health place not taking new people, so that was nice. I ended up going to the ER for the night and was discharged. 

I had been refused a refill of my 30mg Lexapro dosage for OCD by a psych NP that I now realize was negligent and uncaring. A week after this episode, my mother vomited blood on me due to her varices bursting. 

A week after that, and about 2 weeks into being back on Lexapro at a lower dosage (I went back to that NP), I remember having this very heavy/dull like feeling in my head, like my head felt like an anvil, and then I got a ton of neurological and physical issues like dizziness, sinus inflammation, chest pain, muscle twitching, nerve numbness and burning, headaches, ear ringing, memory loss, weakness, fatigue, breathing problems, etc. and I quit the Lexapro again because I thought it was the cause, but it kept going.

I told the NP about this, and she refused to further treat me, requiring me to see a local therapist before she would again. She gave me no support or referral to anybody, leaving me to run around trying to find somebody while my mom was dying and I was sick. 

Long story short, my mother passed away horribly, the hospital gave us up support during hospice, and it turns out my mother spent most of my father's money behind his back, and this NP may have left me with long term health problems on top of emotional trauma from their awful treatment of me. It has been over two years now, but I still have episodes that feel like PTSD, where I'll suddenly get very scared and derealized, usually a song or something like trigger it.

I'm just looking for advice or support. I tried looking into legal action against the NP, but it seems I have no legal case, and my complaints to the nursing boards fell on deaf ears.

There was no way around it from my end, even though some of the family could have easily prevented it. Thanks to the two people involved—A and B—I spent that entire time under the roof of an emotionally abusive relative (C) enduring 24/7 exposure to her and a relative whom no one else could stand. (D) C and D are both gone now, and died within a month of each other. I was not compensated for my work or funds spent, and only one person ever thanked me. My cooperation was simply assumed, then taken advantage of. Not long after the situation ended, both relatives died in slow, horrific manners.
I already had PTSD when this happened, as well as physical health problems. The relatives who volunteered me for this (A and B) and who refused to take any of the other options, both knew about this, knew I had health problems beyond the PTSD, and refused to even give me a day off. My husband and I nearly separated from the stress from the situation and the enforced distance, and it took a couple years to recover from the debt. One of our cats has never recovered from the separation anxiety this caused. I wound up in the hospital afterward because my physical health problems went nuclear thanks to the stress, schedule, and ongoing physical stressors. Part of the problem was that I had to quit taking my medications—I couldn’t even leave long enough to pick up refills, and they kept me asleep too long. Sleeping more than a few hours at a time left time for C to get herself in trouble, and one instance led to paramedics being called. I paid the price, and it just made the whole situation worse.
I could go on for hours…but I won’t. Those months are months of my life that I can never get back, and even a few years later, I’m still dealing with the effects. The worst part is I know what I did was necessary, it made the rest of D’s last days manageable, and I would do it all over again, trauma and everything. Last year, I visited C’s grave for the first time. I wound up cussing at her gravestone and telling her about all the parts of me she would have never approved of—I’m bi, I read smutty stories, I _write_ smutty stories, I listen to music with expletives, etc.__and I cried myself sick. I don’t know if it helped or not.
D is as complicated as ever, even after his death. He wasn’t a good person, and as time goes on, we find even more proof of how horrible he was. On the other hand, I became close to him during this time; he gave me time to myself without leaving C alone to injure herself or get into trouble. D was an addict, and a lying, thieving, angry, scumbag, but he was a port in the storm when I most needed one. My feelings regarding him are complicated at best, but I miss him. I’m the only member of the family who misses him, possibly other than B. 
On the other hand, my family talk about C in fond terms. They tell me about the lovely dreams they have of her, and good memories with her. Me? I have _nightmares_ of her on the regular. I dream I’m back in that house, in that situation, and enduring her abusive behavior all over again, and I wake up crying, sick, and shaking. I can’t even talk to my family about it. My husband just gets angry. I can’t burden my friends with it. My father gets angry and takes it out on my mother. My mother blames herself and goes quiet. I haven’t been able to be civil with A and B ever since, and one in particular, I can’t even be within a yard of; any closer, and I can’t promise I’ll be able to refrain from punching B in the balls. I try to avoid family on holidays when he’s going to attend, and when I can’t, I wind up with a hangover from too much whiskey and wine; it’s the only way I can even pretend to be anything less than an asshole. The rest of the year, I may have a few ounces of alcohol once a month, so at least I don’t have to worry about that part.

I don’t wish that the situation never happened; that would be pointless. I just wish I could see it the way the rest do, and that it didn’t scar me so badly. I wish I could dream of C hugging me and telling me everything will be alright, instead of dreaming of her crawling up out of her grave to shout at me about what a horrible person I am. I wish I could focus on the good memories instead of her horribly two-faced manipulative behavior, and that I didn’t get bogged down with depression on a semi regular basis. I just wish I didn’t know what all this is like.",1675503790.0

I am very proud of him and happy that he’s doing this but the toll his PTSD is taking on me is huge 

I feel like my needs are invisible in the relationship, he cannot deal with any perceived or actual criticism, is hyper sensitive and insanely defensive. 

I understand WHY all this is happening but I’m struggling to cope with being the one who cops all his outbursts the hardest. He has never hit me but he has been verbally abusive when triggered - which he has accepted responsibility for and so far hasn’t done again. 

Sometimes I feel like I’m becoming very small, and I can tell my resilience is being worn down. I cry a lot and feel anxious when I can tell he’s getting wound up because it takes so much effort to calm him down especially if I also feel upset or irritated with him (something which makes him spiral into super defensive anger, which in turn is covering up him feeling worthless because I’m annoyed by him, usually about normal relationship stuff which someone without PTSD would find a minor, resolvable issue). 

I guess I just want to know when the therapy really started working - if you partner has CPTSD, when did you feel like the therapy actually began helping them treat you how they say they want to treat you, rather than having their reactions hijacked by PTSD and  staying stuck in the same old hurtful loops.

What’s worse is he left me with the vultures who would capitalize on his passing for their own personal narrative. Who would steal my grief and try it on when it suits them. He left me to the morbidly curious, so quick to ask “how did he pass?”, not prepared for the answer. I had to learn to cope with more than any child should learn to cope with, because he couldn’t. I had to learn to become stronger than him. To live longer than him. To live longer without him. 

And all because my brother prayed for me to be born.",1675402774.0

I have kept asking myself the last few days that question, is the problem me?

I was diagnosed a couple of years ago with cPTSD; I didn't know what that even me. I always thought I could find work quickly, have a life in this new country I live in right now, and will thrive and have the stability that I need the most.

I was fired from 2 jobs because it seemed like my cPTSD was a curse for me; whenever my manager asked me for unpaid overtime, and I said no, they had the right to fire me

it seems like I'm easily triggered in a toxic work environment and highly underpaid 

last job I worked at was for my therapist, and I trusted my therapist; she offered me to work for her and paid me 5 months in advance (around 300 something pounds), but I was working more than required with no day off, or no health insurance, and she fired me too and asked me to pay the rest of the money 

I'm sick of being treated like that, being looked down, and people taking advantage of me; I thought when I asked for asylum in this new country, I would have a better life, healthy life; I should not fake my emotions; I thought I'm safe and would claim my life back, but now all I'm seeing is the horrible world I'm living in, I cannot even take my breath to rest, I'm tired of fighting, or running away.

I lift the last 20+ years with a narcissistic mother and an unsupportive family. My life was miserable; everyone hated me because I'm lesbian, and the society punished me, even my family, so I had to leave because my life was at actual risk.

I had to choose my freedom over my family to live in peace and have a sense of freedom, but still, it seems like I keep fighting, over and over and over, and there is no peace or love in that world; I hate to be a victim of abuse, I want to be a survivor and claim my body, my freedom and my life.

People determine the seriousness and strength of abuse by looking at the bruise it left ignoring the fact that some people bruise so easily and others never bruise despite the same amount of force used on both. 

My mom broke hangers on my leg, punched, kicked, used different tools to hit me; threw me out of the house; dragged me by my hair etc. But I never had a bruise my whole life simply because my skin never bruised despite what happened to it. 

Even in extreme accidental injuries caused by me being a clumsy kid I didn’t bruise; I broke a bone and didn’t have a single bruise on that spot (only a deformed middle toe) it took three days to realize it was broken. I got my finger jammed in a door and pulled it out which cause my whole nail to rip out of it, yet there wasn’t a single bruise on my finger. I’ve been punched in the nose so hard, my skin cut but there wasn’t a bruise. I’ve had many other injuries that would have warranted a mark on someone else yet there wasn’t one on my body. This just proves that some skin types don’t bruise the same as others. 


Now I feel inferior as if my physical abuse doesn’t count because all I’ve seen in media is kids who were abused to be covered in bruises. A bruise is what qualifies as use of excessive force. I did have other marks like scratches and cuts but never bruises.

I guess in someway I forgave him for everything that he did to me because he did take me in another time I believe because he was drunk he didn’t know what he was doing . In 2019 he ended up passing away from liver cirrhosis and my brother ended up living in foster care. I moved to my grandparents, but he couldn’t come because my grandma has stage four cancer. and my brother special needs so she couldn’t really look after him and they didn’t think it was fair to me to look after him. I just really feel bad about what I did to my sister. I think about it all the time. She has never mentioned it and we’re actually very close but it’s in the back of my head constantly.",1675372484.0

The event that gave me PTSD happened in late September 2020. With a therapist I trust, we’re currently doing EMDR therapy slowly but surely (specifically the “flash” technique) because traditional EMDR is a lot for me right now. Really hoping it will help.

1:30am my time, and randomly (as I often do) had a flashback of the memory. It was violent, terrifying and awful. I think of me screaming and crying for help and the fear in my body.  (I do not want to trigger anyone, so I won’t say more.)

What helps you? Like, what REALLY helps you? I suppose for this question specifically, I’m talking more in the short term, when you’re distressed, and say…it’s 1:30am. I’m learning to “sit” with my emotions and it is not easy.

i still vividly remember being so in love with him and waiting every single moment of every single day right beside my phone waiting for him to message me.. and he finally did those times.. but my excitement was short-lived when i read the messages and saw the pictures he sent.. blood running down his face from bashing his head into the wall.. i was only 12.. i started pleading with him to stop. to please not do anything stupid.. he told me goodbye and he was sorry and then i started screaming and crying and yelling at him to call an ambulance or i would.. i was a child.. that shouldn't have been something I had to deal with..  especially alone..   
   
and then he would disappear again for weeks.. sometimes.. months..  and i wouldn't know if he was dead or alive..  and he was someone i looked to for love.. i was only a child and i deserved better..   
he did so many fucked up things to me but that image .. i will never be able to forget that..",1675315594.0

We were in a group about a shared interest, and she started messaging me every day when I was going through a suicidal patch. I really appreciated the support. She still texts me every day, and she's been there for me when I'm having a hard time with the ptsd. However, something has just felt off, escalating recently, and I finally asked for space. I don't know if I'm pushing someone away for no reason or if this makes sense. 

For context we're both adults, but she's about 20 years older than me. She had triggered me with a word that was very similar to something that had to do with me being assaulted. I told her it was a trigger, she didn't know and apologized. I felt really self conscious and asked if she sees me as an equal, she reassured me that she did and that I help her when she's not feeling great. However it feels a bit lopsided to me, like she helps me out way more than I help her out. I'm not always  the most empathetic person, thanks to what happened to me as a kid and caused the ptsd in the first place. 

A few days later she told me she was feeling shattered due to a nightmare and I tried to comfort her by saying I'm sorry and I know the feeling. But within a few hours she said she was shopping and feeling better. What I deal with is severe-- when I have a bad nightmare I'm almost incapacitated for the day and can barely work. 

She travels a lot, and this touches on an old wound of mine. She likes to tell me all about her travels which I understand and I try to be happy for her since she really has nothing to do with the people who hurt me. But I was getting a lot of updates when I was already struggling, and I realized she's never made plans to visit me, which then threw me into a loop of not feeling important and questioning the nature of the friendship. I tried to explain that hearing about her trip is tough for me because of the specific nature of what happened to me and even though she reassured me yesterday, today I got a lot of happy travel updates again like our conversation never happened. I told her I needed space because I was dealing with a lot of triggers. 

I don't think this would have bothered me as much if she hadn't already triggered me in the past. I used to let it slide because i know how reactive i am. But it keeps piling up. I know I'm sensitive, but it's at the point where I want to self harm when I get a message from her. She's told me what she sees in me as a friend and as a strong person outside of the mental illness i deal with, but it's hard for me to believe it. I have had people ""enjoy"" my trauma and pain before and I'm starting to think she may be one of those people. While terrible things have happened to me, I want people to understand my experiences and that I'm also a person outside of them, not just enjoy me as a tragic broken bird--if that makes sense. 

My gut has saved me in the past, but it's also isolated me. I'm not really sure how to proceed.",1675314870.0

I knew I was grieving and did the whole saying goodbye, funeral and wake. I still coped okay.

Now when I'm asleep I wake up and I'm shaking, in tears, gasping for air. I immediately feel dread, and I just replay what happened to my brother over and over.  It's like a movie I can't turn of. It feels so flipping real, I try and go back to sleep so I don't wake my 4-year-old, but I just see my brother staring at me.

He was interrogated, wasn't charged. For the past few months I felt guilty for turning him in, for a number of reasons. One of them being that he intentionally confused me to keep me in the dark, made himself look like the victim. Plus, not having support from family at the beginning affected me greatly. 

I was told I overreacted, asked if I reported him out of anger/revenge, not only by family, but suicide hotline operators. Now my family denies everything; they tell me that they were supportive of me the entire time, ""I don't know what you're talking about."" ""I'd never say that."" The month after everything, lost my job. I've never been fired from a job. I didn't know if I was going to survive at some points. 

I just couldn't trust myself. I've somewhat worked through that in therapy, and it is because I had some unresolved trauma. Now I feel this guilt about going back to him too. I didn't trust myself enough to know that going back to him was a mistake. I just kept betraying myself, again, again, and again. Each time I went back, he hurt me even more. He confused me even more. 

There are nights when I want to go outside, but my paranoia gets the best of me, and I choose to stay indoors instead. I worry that he, or one of his family members will show up.

I told him about my psychological symptoms and he believes they match the criteria for PTSD.

The trauma was a sudden, crippling migraine that lasted 24/7 at full force for several years. One day I was a healthy 20 year old, the next day I was housebound with pain that was sometimes indescribable.

My symptoms are persistent nightmares where my life is ruined in an instant, intrusive memories of particularly painful moments and of the moment my migraine started (which I remember with perfect, terrible clarity), there are large spans of time when my migraine was at its worst that I can’t really remember, and I have a near constant fear of impending doom as if it could return at any moment. Before my migraine, I was an accomplished martial artist and every time I try to use my punching bag the fear of pain overwhelms me.

My pain is well controlled now but the migraine is still with me. Anything that triggers it makes me very anxious and sometimes I find myself just shutting down my emotions. That anxiety fuels the migraine and vice versa, it creates a feedback loop.

- Citalopram made me more depressed

- Amitriptyline got rid of nightmares but made me feel like a zombie (plus it's a TCA so bad long term for heart)

Then I couldn't find work for a long time; I felt like my cptsd was holding me back. Or maybe it makes me feel like getting panicked easily whenever I hear harmful comments; however, I did manage to work 

 I did manage to work a part-time freelancing for a therapy clinic remotely. Still, the salary wasn't enough to pay my rent, so I was holding myself, waiting for the moment I could do something about that.

i think they eventually didn't like my work and let me go

it was a part-time thing. Still, with around 70 or 80 USD a month, it was barely covering half of my bills 

now I lost this opportunity, either. I cannot stop thinking whether the problem is me or it's just bad luck for not being a productive person

i did tell one of my friends about that.  I had lost this opportunity either, and I could not stop thinking whether the problem was me or it was just a bit of bad luck for not being a productive person

i did tell one of my friends about that. She told me that ""some people might take advantage of your situation as a person who has no income and give you a small amount of money because they know that you have no resources or income and want you to rely on them.""

She might be correct, but I wonder if that will be my life now. What do you think I should do? How can I survive like that? I feel lost",1675259529.0

Heya, so like the title says, I \[18AMAB\] don't feel any pleasure during sex. I was raped 3,5 years ago when I was nearly 15 y/o and did EMDR only around 2 months later, It turned out this wasn't enough, so I went through a week long intensive trauma therapy program around Christmas 2021 (not from an English speaking country so idk what the English term would be, mb). I spent 2 days working on my sexual trauma and all seemed pretty good after that until I started having sex around 3-3,5 months later.

I went on a hookup site and didn't feel horrible or anything bad about it (I met my rapist on Grindr) I decided to meet up with a guy to have sex, it wasn't my intention, at first I was just looking arounf because I was turned on, but eventually we decided to meet up. This time I (felt) like I knew more about what I was doing, I got to know him a bit over text and he was pretty sweet. The sex wasn't bad or anything, we did however go to a forest to hook up -the place where I was raped-, but I don't think that affected me negatively in any way. The thing is, I didn't feel any pleasure from bottoming. When I hooked up with another guy a few weeks later I still didn't feel anything, not when bottoming and not while topping. I just feel nothing. 

Fast forward to today, I have 2 fwb, they're a couple \[23M & 25M\] who I met -again, on the same site)-in May 2022 (we didn't really talk for a month but started hanging out and having sex in June, a little after I had turned 18). We've had sex over 10 times by now, but I still don't feel any pleasure; not from topping or bottoming. The most I've felt is what I can only assume to be 1% of what it would normally feel like to penetrate someone. I feel comfortable with these guys and like I can be open with them, so I'm going to try and bring up why I can't feel anything during sex when we hang out this weekend. 

I just feel pretty horrible from time to time when I think about the fact I can't feel anything like physical pleasure from sex. I still enjoy the activity and pleasuring my 2 fwb, but that's really not enough for me. I want to be able to orgasm from having sex, I don't want to have to masturbate with barely any sensation until I'm about to come (even then, I don't feel nearly anything physical), if I can even come at that point because I'll start to feel shitty about not orgasming/not feeling anything.

A side note, I was on citalopram for a while so I thought that could've been the cause since it's an SSRI, but after not having taken any since august/september 2022, it would have to be a long term negative side effect of the meds for that to be the problem.

Sorry for the long post, I don't really know what to do and I feel broken for not feeling a thing during sex. I know sex doesn't make a person whole, but when I have the desire to have sex (and actually feel it) it really fucking sucks. Thanks for any replies and for reading this whole thing :)

&#x200B;

TLDR; I was raped when I was almost 15 y/o, went to therapy for my PTSD, thought eveything was fine until I started having sex a few months after my final PTSD related therapy when I found out I can't feel any physical pleasure (when penetrating or being penetrated). Don't know what to do about it and feel like shit.",1675184642.0

I have no idea what it was or what caused it, but in the weeks preceding, I hadn't left the house at all because of the pandemic, my sleeping schedule was 9 am to 4 pm, so totally fucked, and I was going through some really rough family stuff. It sort of built over the course of maybe a week until it kicked into overdrive, it's to describe what I actually experienced, but it felt like constant mental torture, like every neuron was poked and prodded and irritated. It was accompanied by a lot of dissociation and my emotions felt totally messed up. I could barely sleep or eat anything. A couple times a day it would break, and I would feel normal for a bit, but it would quickly come back. That lasted for a week, and then it happened again three weeks later. Since that point I've had 4 or 5 of these episodes, often with no clear trigger.

The thing I've been really struggling with lately, is that these now sit in my memory and are immensely painful to recall. If I think about anything I would doing, seeing, smelling, tasting, during an episode, it feels like I'm there again. My whole life has become dedicated to not experiencing another episode, but they keep happening. Because I also have OCD, I've now developed basically a complex belief system in regards to how to prevent these episodes. The memories are so triggering, and it's awful, and they don't stop. It just feels like I'm there and I want to leave it all behind me but I keep remembering and I keep having these episodes and I have no idea what they are or why they're happening. 

I have experienced no trauma in my life, but everyone always likens my experience to PTSD when I explain them. I've always had anxiety and OCD, but never like this.

I am looking for some advice on how to deal with my PTSD symptoms that have recently come back. Here's the background (TLDR at the end as this is quite chonky):   


Back when I was at university I got myself into a pretty messed up situation. I was asleep with my girlfriend at the time at her student flat, and her housemate was in a fight with her (abusive) boyfriend. I could hear a struggle, and her screaming for help, so I went to intervene and saw him on top of her about to hit her. I am admittedly not very good at fighting, and the guy was muscular and obviously trained and long story short he beat the living daylights out of me. Carried on beating me while I was limp, and I came to with a knife to my throat. The police showed up straight after and took arrested him, I was taken to hospital in an ambulance with multiple broken bones in my face. My girlfriend at the time could not bear to see me due to her own trauma of watching all of this happen to me, and we broke up. Covid hit right after that, and legally the matter wasn't 'resolved' til 2 years later, where he was convicted of GBH but given 30 days free therapy and no prison time. I spoke to a therapist at the time who diagnosed me with PTSD, but over time symptoms came up less and less until my trauma was buried deep.   


Within the last couple of months, my current girlfriend and I (we've been together for nearly 2 years and she is very understanding) moved into our first rental apartment together. We love every aspect of it apart from one thing - our upstairs neighbours. They are constantly shouting at each other and we hear loud bangs that vibrate the room throughout the day and the night - I am not exaggerating when I say it is constant and frequent, and can be early in the morning or late at night when we are trying to sleep. It is obvious neither of them work or leave the house as they are literally shouting at eachother throughout the day, so there is no peace. It may be that they have set up gym equipment or are practicing wrestling up there, but the loud bangs are often accompanied by loud screaming. We can hear he is screaming at her accusing her of lying to him and then all of a sudden theres a scuffle, screams and loud bangs followed by her wailing in pain, then we hear more loud bangs and more screaming. It is so loud that we can hear exactly what is being said and I have taken video recordings from my living room. She is crying and wailing in pain all the time, pleading with him and trying to convince him to break up, but it never seems to happen. It is draining and miserable hearing such anger and violence non stop every day - especially working from home. We have called the police once and they came for a welfare check after we heard a particularly bad fight, but nothing happened and the officers walked away from the block laughing and joking to each other, so I am assuming the woman told them to go away and that theres no problem.

&#x200B;

The problem is that ANY noise I hear up there now I get fixated on. Any bang, or word spoken loudly, triggers me to be hypervigilant and anxious. I now get flashbacks all the time, especially when he's throwing her about upstairs, and I can't seem to shake it. My girlfriend says I am not acting like myself in this flat, and that she can tell I am in a constant state of stress and that I talk about the upstairs neighbours all the time - this is now affecting my relationship. I want to move flats so that I can be myself again and not be haunted by my trauma at every waking moment, but unfortunately, we are contractually obligated to stay here for the next 6 months.

&#x200B;

So my question - what can I do to stop being so fixated on it all the time?   Has anyone been in a similar situation? How can I stop this. 

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading and any answers.

I was on a waiting list since august and had the intake with a male and female therapist right before christmas. I was very nervous because men scare the hell out of me when it comes to being vulnerable and therapy because of my history with SA as a child.

I was not okay in the meanwhile but yesterday I finally got the call that I can start. At the intake I told them i would really really prefer a woman but I am also away that it could be interesting to have a males perspective on things but yesterday i heard that the male therapist from my intake wil be me therapist and to be honest.. i am so scared. I couldn't sleep last night because of it. I am so afraid of me only dissociating and being scared instead of really getting therapy.

Also they told me I only get 8 sessions (don't ask me why) and i always need some time to get to know my therapist. I'm that patient that acts horrible in the beginning to test out my therapist. It takes a while for me but now I know I only get 8 sessions and it is a male therapist I'm so scared nothing will come of it.

We are going to do schematherapy, no traumatherapy. I really don't know if that means we will not be talking about my past at all. That would make things easier but also.. maybe less important? I really don't know if it will help to just totally ignore my past. It sounds really nice and something i'm really good at haha, but i'm afraid not that helpful. But i'm not sure.

I've crossposted this from r/rape. I apologize if this is not allowed. I'm just trying to get as much help as I can. If it's against the rules, please just remove it.

I'm sorry if I offend anyone here with what I'm posting. Also, this is a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I've been raped and sexually abused multiple times by various people as a child and an adult. One of the times I was sexually abused, was by a group of people (always the same people), and it happened repeatedly for years. I was in my teens during this time. But they didn't just rape me, they were into that kink and BDSM type of stuff. So for years, that's how they would abuse me. It honestly felt like torture. Eventually, they did stop, though.

Now, a few years later, I have a problem. This problem started about 2 years after they stopped abusing me. At first, when my problem started, it felt like this compulsion I'd have where I would sleep around with men. I never knew who they were and I didn't want to know them. But I never actually enjoyed sleeping around or having sex. I hated doing it. It would feel so scared doing it. I don't know why I kept doing it. But I continued doing that until the pandemic happened and lockdowns happened. I haven't done it since.

What happened instead was I turned to porn. But not just regular porn, but the porn they used to show me and force me to watch, with the BDSM stuff. I don't know why I keep watching it, but I do. And every time I tell myself I won't do it again, but then the compulsion hits and I do it. I keep masturbating to it. And I'm not trying to kink-shame anyone because different people like different things, but I, personally, don't actually like it. It makes me feel sick, and it makes me feel like I'm there with them again, which makes me feel really scared and depressed. But I still keep watching it, and then once I orgasm, I have this intensely huge shame spiral because I hate myself for watching it and actually orgasming to it.

I am in therapy, but I just can't bring myself to tell my therapist about this. I did tell my therapist when I used to sleep around, and we were actually working on it. But I just can't bring myself to tell her about the porn stuff, especially because of the type of porn that it is.

I just wanted to know if anyone had a similar experience and had any suggestions for how I can stop this. I really want to stop this because every day it makes me hate myself more and more.",1675119695.0

I am by no means saying I have ptsd but I just suspect there's something wrong and I need to figure out what all my emotions mean. So I want to ask what flashbacks are really like. All I can think of the the typical movie scenes where people just totally disassociate and have visual hallucinations. And like that doesn't happen to me. And I have no clue about the specifics of PTSD.

All that really happens for me is remembering the most violent parts of the incidents or rewatching the scene in my head like recalling a memory. I have memory issues so I shouldn't remember some stuff all that well, but some things I can remember the details. Like facial expressions or the feeling of the tension. I dont have hallucinations. I just recall the memories and it puts a cold chill in my shoulders and stomach. Sometimes I cry or sometimes I just don't stop thinking about it. It brings me alot of frustration, anger, tears, and anxiety. I feel so indifferent to people and sometimes I feel like I walk around like a zombie. Dead stare, looking straight through you. 

But being bipolar makes it really hard for me to be able to tell what emotion I'm feeling or be able to differentiate my symptoms.

I’m a college student and a few months ago i was diagnosed with ptsd due to a sexual assault that happened a year and a half ago.

I’m feeling really frustrated and discouraged, I literally have tears in my eyes lol. I haven’t passed many tests since the event happened. School has been very hard, whether it be homework assignments or tests or projects. I’ve noticed I struggle with my memory now as well. I have failed two classes, luckily I was able to bounce back and retake them and pass them again. But, I’m really feeling lost in school, I’m just really having a hard time with my thoughts in my head and also trying to study. I’m trying my best but I feel even when I try my best, it’s not good. 

I try not to compare myself to my friends but sometimes, it’s so discouraging and frustrating when they are able to breeze through assignments, or they are doing really well on tests. Especially when they say that they didn’t study and they still do well. I’ll study my ass off and still fail.

866,how do i tell anyone that certain household chores trigger flashbacks,2,10ouhkx,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/10ouhkx/how_do_i_tell_anyone_that_certain_household/,3,"(tw: abuse)

so this goes back almost 6 years ago. it was when my mom needed to move to california with my dad who's been working there for 11 years at the time while me and the rest of my family is at home to support us financially. my mom set out my older sister/biological mother (i was adopted by my biological grandparents since she had me at 16, i only found out once i entered high school) who i've never had a close relationship with since childhood, and has always been abusive towards me. 

full disclosure: i have never done chores. it's not that i'm lazy as a child, it's because i grew up with an housekeeper who would also look out after me when no one was at home since i'm the youngest daughter. besides that, i had up to 3 extracurriculars/hobbies on top of school so i never had any time to know how to do basic chores.

one day my sister made me do the dishes. i told her i never knew how and she basically called me a dumbass and would physically abuse me, even while dping the dishes, sometimes even going beyond that. if i didn't do it or if i didn't do it ""properly"", her boyfriend would then beat me up till i had scars and bruises all over me, all while my niece (who was around 3 years old at the time) was witnessing everything.

i was homeschooled for a few months at this time so i never had to worry about people being nosy about my scars, but being at home around them 24/7 just made it worse. i had a brother that was protective of me and would try to keep me away from my sister, so they wouldn't do it while he was around, but as soon as my brother is away, especially when it was his turn to move, the abuse just got worse.

i would tell my parents but my sister would just try to excuse herself into thinking it was my fault instead of theirs. this was then i developed trust issues. i knew no one would believe me. i was 12, i didn't know any better. i was already diagnosed with 
adhd and depression when i was 8, and the abuse certainly did not make it any better.

eventually i convinced my aunt to let me move to her place, she agreed but she didn't understand the full extent i went through. because of this, she was confused on how to deal with me because i would throw a fit when asked to do any chores, or when i get a flashback, she thought i was crazy or something, but they just didn't know how to deal with an emotionally frustrated girl, since that was way beyond on what they think humans work.

i thought i was going crazy, i didn't even know they were flashbacks.

2 years later when i finally moved with my family in california and i finally got a therapist, i got diagnosed with ptsd and everytime i would do the chores it would trigger flashbacks. my parents didn't know this, no one knows this.

till now i can't tell my parents since they side with my sister on it, and they think i'm being crazy, how do i explain this because it hust deteriorated my mental health.",1675058753.0

I have been healing a lot of my PTSD from childhood, yet the process has caused some retraumatizing. What I'm realizing lately is that I am very very sensitive to other people.

I can go from a happy mood to one where I feel small and scared very quickly. I know it's flashback material, but I'm really struggling with this.

Same traumatic event, but very different reactions.",5,10odtgg,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/10odtgg/tw_sudden_death_same_traumatic_event_but_very/,4,"Back in late 2020, a woman fell from the 23rd floor of my apartment building. I was awake, watching TV (it was 12.50am). My partner was asleep. I heard the short scream, then a HUGE noise that sounded like a washing machine crashing to the ground rather than a person. I saw her laying there, right below my first floor balcony. She looked like she was sunbaking, except it was night time. Then for various reasons I won't go into here, I began to realise she was dead.

Some neighbours who had also heard the noise came out to see what had happened. They were freaking out, several called the ambulance, etc. Then 3 ambulances and 3 police cars came. It was quite surreal. It was later discovered that she was pushed by the guest staying in that apartment she was visiting.

I would get up from the couch and check every now and then to see if anything new was happening, but it kind of settled down. They covered her with a tarpaulin and eventually I went to bed. I slept well.

The next day, the entire area below my balcony was still a crime scene. By mid-morning, there were 7 police cars surrounding the building. I went out shopping with a friend (who also lives in my building but had no idea what had happened and was much higher up so couldn't see it) that day and had a good time. We bumped into some neighbours who were VERY disturbed and I had to be careful not to speak too bluntly about what had happened, as I just wasn't distressed by it at all.

My partner got up way before me and when she opened the curtains she was greeted with the crime scene and the woman's body only partly covered as they plastic bagged her hands, feet and hair. So, my partner was deeply traumatised, felt unsafe in her own home and still, over 2 years later, has trouble opening the curtains in case she sees something like that again.

A year later, another death occurred at the building, this time an accident when a young man dived into the outdoor pool, suffered a freak heart attack and died / drowned. Nobody knew he was there until 2 young kids went to use the pool 45 minutes later and found him. The ambulance that came parked under our balcony (the closest place it could park to the proximity to the pool), and I watched as they wheeled the man past (fully covered up). My partner refused to even come into the room until the ambulance had left.

So...I feel no trauma from this stuff at all. It's sad for those who died and for their families. But whether I happened to see it (the event) or not, does not change what happened. It simply isn't about me.

But I wonder if my pre-existing CPTSD and subsequent enormous constant and obsessive fear of my very few loved ones dying is blocking my empathy for people I don't love. Like, I just don't have any room for trauma or distress about people I don't deeply love. So...no care = no trauma.",1675014993.0
875,Trigger warning: house fire; When should I consider talking to someone?

I was the only person in my family that woke up from the alarm I had to wake my husband and my toddler up and my husband almost had to throw our teenager over his shoulder because he was not waking up. I grabbed our toddler out of his crib and he somehow understood what was happening, he was crying hysterically screaming “No my house, my house, smoke and fire, my cat, my cat in the basement.” We got outside with literally minutes to seconds to spare. The fire department showed up 3 minutes later and when they reopened the door the smoke was so thick you couldn’t see into the doorway. 

The apartment is salvageable but we will be out for weeks and we will lose items (we do have insurance). For that I’m thankful but I haven’t been sleeping well, every time I hear beeping I panic, I dream of smoke filling the room, any sound wakes me up and sends me into a flashback I’m standing there watching smoke fill the hallway alone, I keep hearing my toddler screaming those things in my head over and over again, I’m paranoid about anything and everything that could start a fire everything electric is blaring alarms in my head. The fire department told us we were a couple minutes from being dead the smoke was so dangerous and the c02 levels were so high, if I hadn’t woken up my entire family would be gone .

How do you reframe your experiences when everything seems to support your way of interpreting them?,5,10o8n18,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/10o8n18/trigger_warning_how_do_you_deal_with_feeling/,5,"33 year old man.  I asked my therapist to start a more structured therapy for PTSD, and it has been really hard.  Usually, I bury things, which modulates my symptoms but with letting things out, I find everything hitting again hard.  

We started with an impact statement, and I wrote an introduction to mine about all of the contributors to my world view besides the traumatic experiences that we’re going to be working on, just to emphasize that it doesn’t all come from one place.  

I came to this therapist 5 years ago to talk about gender dysphoria and my experiences with being a transgender man and a part of the transgender community.  Friends have been assaulted or tried to kill themselves.  One of my lovers killed themselves.  For the trauma that I started the new PTSD therapy for, I married a man who thought that he could “change me,” and he repeatedly abused me psychologically, sexually, and physically to try to accomplish that.  I can’t trust men anymore and have not been able to bring myself to date even though he left 4 year

The therapist knew all of that.

But she didn’t know about the other things in my introduction to the impact statement.  I have directly experienced terrorism.  I was trapped in a major metropolis during a coordinated series of bombings when I was just 15 years old and traveling.  

Therapist wanted to start there and was shocked that I’d worked with her for years and never mentioned it.  There are other things in the introduction to discuss too before we can even get started with the rest.

I left session feeling exhausted and hopeless.  If our goal is to reframe my experiences so that I can move on… how?  

My impact statement describes the world as incredibly violent and the people in it as either victims or power hungry monsters.  And after session, I realized that that’s just been life for the past 18 years.  

I was 15, and one of the bombers was 18.  An 18 year old doesn’t wake up one day and decide to hate, and he can’t get his hands on a bomb himself.  Someone older than him fed him lies and used him to assert power so that they could continue to enjoy their authority while he died.  Children traumatizing children.

My lover is dead and my friend was assaulted because people (right wing pundits, corrupt politicians, religious leaders, etc) need a scape goat to line their pockets. Power.  Money.  Control.  

My marriage was just a microcosm of the power dynamics and violence that I have come to expect from the world.  

It is impossible for me to not see the world this way.  How can you look at a red apple and say that it isn’t red?

I feel broken and defective.  I can’t imagine what a life would look like that doesn’t revolve around violence and broken power dynamics

Does it ever get better?  For those who have reframed, how did you do it?  What do you focus on?  How do you trust?  

For anyone with similar experiences to mine, have you been able to find healthy and lasting love?

This older woman I work with looked at me once and asked me how I was doing. She asked if she could look at my eyes, and I agreed. She got within an inch of my face and it felt like she was looking into my soul. She said it looked like I was in pain or really sad. I kinda panicked knowing her next question, which was why? I put it on some minor annoyances in my life because in truth, I wouldn't even know where to begin, and if people know, they look at you like you're dangerous or something. How do you explain the mental effects of seeing people die, having someone you loved get abducted, raped, and poisoned multiple times only to turn on you several times attacking you in your sleep, getting targeted and shot at or stalked, set up to be stabbed in the face, having to fear for the lives of your family, having to do things that nobody would ever want to just to save the life of myself or others while the authorities do nothing, and of course the feelings that come with failing to protect your loved ones. 
Like tbh I get these feelings of wanting to commit the big S (I won't so don't worry) because I feel like I'll never be normal again. The only people I get along with are people as traumatized as I am. I feel like I can't even connect with my family and friends anymore. Can't even go on a date with a girl because even trying not to have ""sad eyes"" or looking around for threats is exhausting. Not to mention trying to ignore all the mental flashbacks and random fight or flight or anxiety attack triggers. Tbh I don't even feel like I can trust mostly anyone. The people I can trust I'm so terrified to even express what I'm feeling because I don't want to be seen as like a monster or like I'm tainted. The only people who understand me are people who were out there in the mix of things too. I mean even recently I saw my mom nearly get killed in a freak misunderstanding, and then almost make a mistake that would have gotten someone else killed while in a concussed and angry state of mind. I can't even speak about that. There is so much I just have to keep inside and I just want it to end. I just wanna be normal! Literally only some months back I had to deal with people a few towns over spreading rumors I was in ""the Mafia,"" my ex lying about me to make her setting me up to die look better, and distant family attempting to ""help"" their ""drug kingpin"" relative by getting me wasted, lying to a hospital and getting me locked in an isolation cell and force fed pills that made me suicidal for a non-existent drug addiction and suicidality. Had I not known what the pills were doing, I would have let that emotional state consume me. 2 days it took for a psychiatrist to actually see me and read my chart, and I'll never forget the confused expression and him saying ""it says you're here for suicidal thoughts and drug addition. You didn't seem to have any drugs in your system, and you don't strike me as suicidal... Why are you here?"" and then after explaining, him saying ""okay, I'll get you out of here as soon as possible. Hang tight.""",1674999178.0

I’m trying to place names or definitions to stuff that happened to me because I feel like if I could know what counts as what it would help me wrap my head around the whole thing. 

Basically I have a cousin who sexually groomed me. He’s a porn addict and he’s got a lot of mental health disorders. The thing is that it never got past the grooming stage into the actual abuse. But the grooming thing, that happened. And he did a lot of unsolicited touching, but it wasn’t necessarily ‘sexual’ per se. he never groped me or anything but he put his arm around me a lot, and he’d brush the hair off my shoulders or out of my face, or he’d lean on me while sitting beside me. The kind of stuff that made me uncomfortable but I didn’t fight against because I’d been conditioned to accept it.

So here’s my question. Does the unsolicited touch count as sexual assault? He touched me without my permission and it made me uncomfortable, but it wasn’t touching in an inappropriate place and I didn’t make any move to stop him. He touched me with sexual intentions but it wasn’t ’sexual touching’. So does it count as SA or does it just fall under grooming?

Further more, what is grooming classified as? Is it classified as something that happens before abuse starts or is it classified as abuse in its own right?",1674980206.0

886,Dealing with low empathy in partner,4,10o0ie2,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/10o0ie2/dealing_with_low_empathy_in_partner/,2,"My (20M) boyfriend (20M) of over two years has CPTSD, and has very low empathy as a result of his trauma. He's very sweet and generous and I feel more comfortable with him than anyone I've ever met and love him so much, but his low empathy is very hard to deal with. 

For example, the other day my roommate cut my hair- and it was very uneven, they're not very skilled. Regardless I was going to get it redone, but I asked my boyfriend what he thought and he told me it was terrible and super uneven. At the time I was set on believing him. Afterwards I had to go to work, and my coworkers- whom I have worked with for almost 2 years now and are very good people- told me they actually liked my hair. When I told this to my boyfriend and said it made me happy, he said ""sometimes people just say that to be polite even when they think it's ugly."" 

This upset me a lot, and I think that is generally very mean to say to someone. I also have very bad trust issues when it comes to believing others, so it kind of fucked with my head to hear that in any context at all, and he knows about my trust issues. But it's come to the point where I'm questioning if I'm right to feel like that or not.

It has been like pulling teeth to explain to him why this is not good to say to someone, especially your boyfriend. He doesn't like to apologize unless he fully understands why he's apologizing, and while I find this admirable, it is often impossible for him to understand my side of things. He hasn't apologized for this instance either.

I love him very much and want to put in the effort to seek out a better way to handle this, and also it's a hard question to Google. Any advice would be extremely appreciated.",1674972096.0

After doing an intake session at a psychiatrist’s office, I reviewed their notes in my online medical file. I was completely shocked how many graphic and unnecessary details were included in their notes. 

For example, instead of just saying “suffered adverse childhood event” they went into detail regarding a painful experience of mine that happened decades ago while also getting many of the details wrong. This happened over and over again for multiple pages of notes. The writing was oddly personal in how specific it was while also not being entirely factually correct. The doctor also included quotes that were attributed to me, when I didn’t actually say those things word for word. 

I was very upset after reading this. I feel like some of the personal details did not need to be included, and I have no idea why the doctor would put sentences in quotations when I didn’t actually say those exact quotes. Additionally the doctor never informed me that they were recording these details and didn’t ask for my consent to document them in this way. 

I’m concerned that this is a part of my medical record that could come back to affect me negatively. For example, I work in a field where the employer can request your medical records and I would be mortified if anyone else read these details.

Not to mention a large part of the notes are factually incorrect or leave out context to the situations. The notes portray some of my family members in a negative way without full context. I understand the need to document but there is a way to do it tactfully and correctly. 

I’m submitting a complaint at the psychiatrists office, and I’m also requesting that the notes be revised. I expect this is going to be an uncomfortable fight where I may have to go line by line through my traumatic experiences and make corrections to them and/or provide justifications for why they don’t need to be in my medical record.

I don’t have any major traumatic experiences that I can think of. Everybody says I had a very good childhood; I was given everything I needed- food, clothes, lots of technology (this will come up later), we always had a roof over our heads, my parents weren’t divorced, my home was stable; nothing happened ever. We would come home from school, go to our bedrooms, and just sit on our laptops until bedtime. We did literally did nothing. No sports, no extra curriculars, we were discouraged from spending time outside (we lived in the city), my family didn’t talk to eachother much.

She said he didn’t know it was me. But she said he would constantly touch his maids back in his home country. 15 is too old for any of my issues to come from that.

Ptsd puts our mind and body into survival mode, but that’s extended so much when basic things like food aren’t a guarantee. 

I’ve talked about it with my therapist. Went over the hierarchy of needs and how often when our most basic needs aren’t met, we struggle to do anything. 

Doing tasks that aren’t basic needs for survival become more difficult. It makes sense really. Our survival instinct is we need food to survive. Why would we care about anything else? 

It’s stressful. It’s draining. I sit and worry about if we will have food in the fridge in the next few days. I worry if I’ll lose the roof over my head again one day. All I do is worry about it. 

It’s also draining because often the body isn’t getting what it needs to function. If you rely on the food bank to feed yourself your meals aren’t what you need them to be. Things like milk, eggs, meat, fresh veggies and fruits often aren’t available. You don’t get enough to make GENUINE home cooked meals.

1. Got abused physically, emotionally, verbally by parents. 

2. Got physically and verbally abused throught childhood that continues even till now that is college. One particular incident comes to mind, a guy told me ""whenever I see your face , I want to beat you"" infront of the entire class.

3. Got physically and verbally bullied by a maths teacher for being very weak at maths. She routinely slapped me in front of the class. If you're shocked, I'm from Asia, where this is unfortunately very common. Off topic, but I went on to become the best guy in maths in my entire college xD.

4. I was sexually abused by a group of seniors in my school bus during middle school, this abuse lasted months. 

5. Got insulted in high school by anither teacher for laughing at a friend's joke during his lecture. This one is pretty interesting, the way he insulted me was, he made me answer a question, but every time I answered he said he couldn't hear me. Since then, my voice has been pretty low to the point people can rarely hear me. Only while reading the effects of trauma , I came to know the reason for this. 

6. Got slapped by college bully for standing up against him.

In the past I have suffered through long term religious trauma and really traumatic severe OCD. This was a super isolating and extremely debilitating time for me. 

I have also gone through a consistent amount of physical, emotional, verbal and spiritual abuse from my father and enabler mother. There have been small traumas and big traumas (where my mind went totally blank) 

Even after recovering from extremely severe OCD, I have other mental illnesses that are still prevalent. The trauma won’t let me function. 

	1.	I’m extremely hyper vigilant (been since I was a kid but it’s extreme now) 
	2.	Exaggerated startle response
	3.	Experience emotional flashbacks in which the feelings that occurred during the traumatic event would reoccur as if it was happening all over again. 
	4.	Have had sleep paralysis all my life from any stress 
	5.	Have had a lot of medical issues with no due cause when I was a kid. (TMJ but they couldn’t find what caused it and frequent intense headaches and they thought those were migraines but they weren’t migraines. As well as small tiny inflamed bumps would appear in my inner eyelid whenever i was extremely stressed. They hurt so bad because it was direct pressure on my eyeballs. Had frequent UTIs too for no reason. Had very random aches in my muscles too which came out of nowhere. Had unexpectedly developed tinnitus too.) 
	6.	My main feeling has been shame and embarrassment since I was a kid. My identity revolved around intense shame.
	7.	I try my hardest and best to avoid reminders of trauma or anything that resembles it since it triggers the emotional flashback or it triggers intense feelings of anger and dread or I get panic attacks. 
	8.	I suffered from a self harm addiction to deal with my emotional dysregulation 
	9.	 I’ve been very emotionally dysregulated for a long long time. Emotions are extremes for me. Guilt feels like death. Happiness is pure bliss. Anger is fury and wrath and rage is just disastrous. I don’t know how to handle my impulses or extreme emotions. My ‘mood swings can easily range from pure bliss to planning to unalive myself and back to pure bliss on the same day.  
	10.	Interpersonal disturbance. I have no relations with anyone my age. I live in absolute isolation. I feel extremely afraid of any relations with others and perceive them as threats. 
	11.	My mind runs on chaos. Chaos is my fuel. That’s the only thing that keeps me alive. I’ve suffered so many consequences (blacklisted from a transportation service/ got the police called on me/ tried jumping out of the window because my mom wouldn’t give me something I wanted/ kicked out of a mental hospital) all because of my lack of fear for consequences and the chaos I cause everywhere I go. 

I do in fact think I resonate with the classic c-ptsd symptoms. Like : Avoidance, Re-experiencing, Sense of threat, negative self image, affected dysregulation, interpersonal disturbance. But I doubt I have c-ptsd. All of these things can just be trauma responses. C-ptsd is caused by consecutive fear of serious or threatened death or extreme violence. Like trafficking, kidnapping, being held hostage….these kinds of things cause it. I mean the abuse I went though was definitely bad I can bring a therapist to tears when I talk about it but I don’t think it was “traditionally horrific” in the traditional sense of cptsd.",1674923149.0
906,Can I have flashbacks without being “transported back”?,8,10n7uep,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/10n7uep/can_i_have_flashbacks_without_being_transported/,10,"I was with my T earlier today and after she asked how I was, I was sharing about how I’d been dealing with an uptick in trauma symptoms lately. I mentioned having trouble with “flashbacks” again, which I described as “not to the point of forgetting where I am, like I’m able to know where I am, but I’m having constant loops of memories of bad things flashing in my head and being able to hear the things being said in / sounds from those memories, and 70% of the time when they are strong, I get physical sensations as well”. 

These tend to send my other symptoms into whack, like hypervigilance, making my suicidal urges become very active again, urge to SH, a lot of anxiety, overwhelmed with senses, lots of crying and being very depressed, depersonalisation / out-of-body type of dissociation. Even words cause me to become very anxious, and certain words cause phantom sensations from the assault. If I’m in bed, I grab myself and curl up sideways in a fetal position because I feel exposed and nothing feels safe, I can’t do that outdoors so I end up rubbing / scratching my arms or thighs, or digging my nails into my palm (most times I feel like just dropping to the ground and plain flopping, but i’m “present” enough to be self-conscious of doing so). These “flashbacks” usually last throughout the day from the point it begins. However, my memories are never / have never been disjointed, they have always been rather full and chronological — it is not as fully vivid as some less traumatic parts of the assault have faded, but I can place in a timeline where most things happened. 

E said something along the lines of “it must be very distressing having these… well not really flashbacks because there’s an aspect of re-experiencing for flashbacks, maybe we can call it intrusive memories? it must be very hard on you”. Since that statement I’ve wondered if I’ve been saying I have “flashbacks” when I don’t… 

I have always been very insecure about not experiencing the typical full-on flashbacks that is always talked about with PTSD. Like it’s more than just being reminded or having memories, I still experience them and go back to feelings of being in danger and feeling violated and afraid and unsafe, but I’m not “transported back” to the point that my room becomes that room again, or that nobody in my room becomes seeing him being in front of me while I’m in my own bed. I’m still “present”, just stuck deep in these images and sounds and sensations where everything is happening, while I stare at the window and feel my own blanket on my face. I don’t know how to explain it.

Are these still considered flashbacks? Maybe I should stop referring to them as flashbacks…",1674885915.0

If any of you seen movie machinist that's exactly what I felt like. I was suffering from depression and anxiety my whole life and always felt as if it was my fault and i was ungrateful. I moved out of my mom's house to a place of my own and started getting ptsd. Now i realize it was due to a lot of stress i was going through. I always liked gory games, watching gore, etc and didn't realize why. I started watching interrogation 2 months ago and it completely changed my life. I started acting more confident and could get whatever i wanted. But then i began to feel as if i was an asshole, weed might have affected this but I tried to quit for 4 days and managed just fine. I couldn't even get high. One day we had a party at my place and got drunk. I didn't feel drunk but now i realize i must have been. I started drinking and didn't even realize, it began as one beer a day and yet i was losing memory. It worsened my depression to the point I decided to go to my psychiatrist, she proceeded to call me a drug addict and ask whether I was under the influence (when obviously I wasn't, i was just really worried about my sanity). My mom always called me a drug addict and it always worsened my depression. So i became even more depressed. Got prescribed benzos and continued smoking weed and drinking on it. I always thought it was one beer a day but it wasn't. I bought a PS5 and started playing the last of us. When that's when I realized everything. I was depressed because I was an adult and was feeling unfulfilled. I realized there was nothing wrong with being who I am and i have achieved everything I ever wanted. I even forgived people in my life, cause now i realize how much of an asshole i was my entire life. I always thought i was a happy child and something must have went wrong with me when my parents divorced. But it turns out i was always right. I was fucked up for a month straight, ruined a lot of great things but realized and got reassurance of this. My friends love me and care about me in these hardest times, my mother always loved me and as i was young and was always alone with her she developed a drinking habit. I forgive her, i still love her. My father must have been terribly depressed because he took all the blame for everything, mainly from me. Now i realize he has slapped me like 5 times in my life. I realized why I'm so into gore, i realized why i was depressed, i realized what do I look for in women. For the first time in my life I feel like a healthy adult person. I always wanted to be an adult, move out of mom's to a city, work security job and I achieved all this at 18 years old! So no wonder I became so depressed. Currently I'm 3 days sober from alcohol and 2 days from benzos. I'm never touching alcohol again, it ruins lives and benzos just melt your brain. Everyone kept telling me I wasn't myself and i didn't hear them. I had to lose my mind to find myself and I'm fucking great and i can finally stop living in the past. I got something from all of my family members, I'm just a fucked up child. But that's not a fault of my parents, they're just people and they make mistakes, as well as i did many mistakes. I survived a suicide attempt, managed to get through school despite terribly suicidal depression, got raped, got locked in a cellar in a kindergarten by the principal. Yet I'm here and i see everything clearly now. For the first time in my life I feel peace and so I'm so fucking proud of myself for not giving up. I sincerely hope you all find peace within yourselves and can live a great life, no illness defines who we are and we can achieve anything. Sending you my love!",1674895721.0

I’ve had an extremely traumatic life. Everyday is a struggle to even concentrate because I’m in constant mental fog or emotional pain.

I just recently finally got a job though where I don’t feel attacked in any way and I can actually feel safer in. But I’m afraid I’m going to self sabotage it because my life continues to disappoint me and my efforts are often in vain. 

I was SAd twice over the past 2 years, once by someone I knew and once by someone in a hospital I was staying at that was supposed to help me mental health. Nothing was done to protect me or assist me after the violations. I went to the police and they said they couldn’t do anything. I pursued about 20 lawyers, not a single one could help me. My family ostracized me emotionally after these things happened to me and blamed me for being victimized. In a last ditch effort I applied for victim compensation from the government. But this week I just found out that got denied to. I’ve had to share my story multiple times and retraumatize myself repeatedly just to be invalidated and shut out. This has been a pattern since I was a kid where I was victimized CONSTANTLY at school and instead of being helped I was shamed by pretty much everyone. 

It hurts that my own mom can’t be bothered to truly love and protect me, she instead would be narcissistic and further shame me. I’m losing strength and instead of being proud of the job, I feel demoralized because I have pretty much almost no friends left, no family support, I can’t trust men enough to find romantic partner, and feel like I have to carry this weight completely on my own and I’m running out of strength. Please send me kind words, resources, anything because I’ve tried everything and this government and system is completely useless at helping me get any kind of justice or emotional support.

basically, i grew up abused and neglected by both my parents. and at some point my dad resorted to chasing me around with a knife for 20 minutes until he eventually tried to stab me but my mother put her body on top of mine, making my dad stop. dont get me wrong, they both almost beat me to death that day, but my mom still yelled at my dad for a while after he tried to stab me. it was quite easy to hate them after that event, my psychological struggles only got worse, landing me in psych wards more than once, and i got diagnosed with ptsd eventually. 

i blamed them for years for ruining my life. i got therapy, tried speech therapy and emdr, both of those were of no use to me since i never showed any emotion in front of the therapists and refused to talk about the events. i eventually quit. ive been on many psychiatric meds for 6-7 years now. im only now slowly quitting them under my doctor’s supervision. and i genuinely tried anything and everything to just be able to move on from this. i still loved them until this event, but this was the drop that overflowed the glass. 

i attempted suicide many times because of my ptsd and flashbacks. i was in foster care for a bit before i got returned back to my parents by the government (thats a whole another story that im not ready to tell yet.) anyways, they stopped the abuse after that, scared that the cps would take me away again. 

ive finally gotten clean from self harm and ive been trying for the past month or so to have a relationship with them again and to forgive them. a week or two ago i sat both of them down and yelled to them about how much they ruined me and blamed them for every bad thing i experienced because of their abuse. it felt relieving. i told my dad specifically “sometimes i just want you to apologize for hurting me! sometimes i just want you to show affection to me and pat my hair without me begging for it!”. 

my mother stayed silent the entire conversation, i could tell she wasnt expecting this from me, who only stayed quiet and accepted whatever was given to me so far. but my dad was genuinely listening to me, i wouldve expected the opposite. 

anyways, since that talk my dad has been calling me over near him whenever he comes home and hugs me and asks me about my day, we talk and talk until midnight. my mom is still the same mom i always knew, no big changes. but at least she lets me hug her now without asking me to let go. 

i began reading a book called “it didnt start with you.” which is about traumas we inherit from our family line. i sent them both different parts of the first chapter about forgiving your parents, over text, telling them i wanted to share that with them. 

my dad responded “thank you darling” and my mother wrote “thanks baby, we love you so much too ❤️ i seems like a great book”. now im going home to them, and i cant wait to talk to them. i wonder what they have to say to me about the things i sent them. (ive never sent my dad a message my whole life. and i never share things that make me seem vulnerable with anyone. so this is a big deal to me haha.)

forgiving them just gets easier when i realize theyre trying their best to help me forgive them too. 

the only reason why i could forgive them is because i believe that even adults are still growing, and that they grow up with their children. and i also dont want to live as an orphan any longer, i want to have a relationship with my parents before they pass away. i dont want them to die with regrets, and i dont want to live with those same regrets myself.

im basically teaching them how to love me. 

i know forgiving the people who traumatized you is not for most people, im just sharing my story in hopes that some of you can be happy for me.

My Father constantly berates me and criticizes any choice I make, even if it is one I do that makes me happier and relieves any stress. But, I’ve come a long way and overcame a lot of that. I’m over all that.

A few years back I dated a bipolar schizophrenic. To be honest, I had low self esteem and ignored many red flags. Like she would break up with me because I got pulled over and she got her weed taken. Or she would break up with me because I got the wrong mints. One time she told me to choose between her and my Mother because they got into an argument and then broke up with me. It’s my fault I kept going back.


But, I stayed as her rock. It wore on my soul and withered my tough surface away. After years her Brother killed himself. She stopped taking her medication and went off the deep end. She tried to kill herself in front of me.

I took both knives out of her hand and got sliced up pretty good myself. But, I went back to her which is a huge mistake. She was pregnant and telling me the kid was mine, so I stayed. Turns out she was cheating and then I left and looked up to heaven and said…. I’m free. I was happy. I was relieved. It was finally over after weighing on me so long.

But I chose to not date and work on my self esteem. I stayed single for two years. Socially isolated myself. Turns out I didn’t recognize sooner how much that changed me.

Anyways, I tried to date again six months ago. That girl was suicidal and had low self esteem. When she threatened suicide it triggered a bout of uncontrollable rage against not her, but someone talking to me while I’m on the phone with her. I’m not proud. I didn’t use any physical violence, but I was very very very mean and instantly regretted doing so.

So that ended that relationship.

Then I tried again. Naive to the damage done and chalked it up to me being protective. Well, I was wrong. A few different girls were showing interest at work, but only one I liked back and was invested in. 

Well she saw the other girls and thought I was two timing her. She screamed at me in the parking lot and all I could see was the bipolar schizophrenics face flashing back in my head. I said no leave me alone we are done here over and over.

Well, I ruined that and pushed her away.

Although I do love myself a lot and I am proud of how far I have come, I recognize work still needs to be done. I am undiagnosed but pushing away someone truly special, the first girl I saw a real future with…. Well it’s opened my eyes.

*TRIGGER WARNING*

Hey everyone-

I was diagnosed with BPD, PTSD, substance abuse disorder and recurrent depressive disorder in 2019.

This was after being sex trafficked and also a very troublesome childhood (I’ll spare the details).

After this transpired I got into a very abusive relationship with someone I met at a DBT therapy group (great idea I know). 


It got very bad and I had frequent blackouts and suicide attempts and serious self harm- none of which I really remember (I was sober during this time apart from occasional weed smoking and my prescribed anti-psychotics).

Things got really really bad and I had to move 5 hours away after the police got involved and since then I have been off my medication but have been abusing substances again (but to a very minimal extent).

I don’t take prescribed medication anymore but have been a lot happier for the most part. 

This time next year in feb would have been a year since my last blackout and serious suicide attempt and hospitalisation.

However today I had a complete blackout in the super market with my current partner. I don’t remember a thing.

I looked at my hands a moment ago and they are bleeding from obvious self inflicted scratches (nothing serious but still confusing).

Apparently I was freaking out the whole time convinced that I was being followed and was shouting and crying. 

Bare in mind I was completely sober at this point.

The last few weeks I have been extremely volatile and reactive which I have been mindful of but no proper blackouts until today….

I don’t want to be on medication but I am scared about this sudden relapse, I forget things a lot but not like this. At least not for a few years.

My volatility and reactiveness in the last few weeks has caused me a lot of trouble within my relationship, work and friendships.

Does anyone have any advice or experienced anything similar?

I am in the most stable situation I’ve been i my life and yet today I don’t remember a thing from my extreme blackout and public (light) self harm.

Does anyone have any advice or has experienced something similar even though life seems to be generally ok now compared to the past?

I don’t have  friends, family, or any support system to talk this out with, hence why I am posting in this sub. I mean no offense to anyone with what I am saying. 

With that out of the way.. how do people do it? I was diagnosed with CPTSD at age 15. I have suffered a LOT of abuse for about 90% of my life (I’m nearly 22, if that helps), which is a partial cause of my PTSD. Due to the nature of how I grew up… alongside having no support system as I mentioned, my PTSD “symptoms” get the best of me. A lot. These feelings have been coming out a lot lately as I recently got a pup who will be my new service dog prospect. Something I have needed since I lost my last SD in 2019 (he isn’t dead don’t worry! He had to retire due to serious hip issues!). Since I lost him, I have had serious trouble managing my anger. I become volatile randomly, and I don’t like how it makes me feel. Especially with having a pup in the house :( I don’t want to snap, and accidentally hurt him, because I get overwhelmed. 

I get frustrated VERY easily. Especially with this puppy, as I am the only one taking care of him (thank you to my lovely bf who advocated for me to get a new SD… and then refused to help take care of him, after saying he would when I need help). It’s worth mentioning, I am autistic. Which adds to why I cant very well control my emotions/feelings. I only get incredibly volatile/angry when I’m super stressed, or around a trigger for my PTSD. 

I just want to know.. how do you control this..? Is there even any way to control it..? I’m on Respiridone and Prazosin to help “manage” this. Yet I don’t feel like its doing anything..

I'm too afraid to bother my friends anymore because I feel like they will distance themselves. 

So I was in the Marines as an aviation ordnanceman. We were deployed and had almost over 1000 confirmed kills and at the time I had some thoughts of regret and worrisome thoughts about where the bombs were going but I guess I never thought too much into it.

Now that its 5 years since being out and 8 years since I was deployed I think about what I did everyday. I often go in circles thinking about the people killed by those bombs and remember the videos they showed us to ""motovate us"". There are a few I think about but one in particular where a bomb that I could have loaded landed in a city circle and once the smoke cleared there was a man that woke up and was frantically trying to put his organs back into his body.

We were always told that there were no civilian casualties and at the time I believed it. I even had some pride in what I was doing because I thought I was doing it for the greater good. 

Since then, my mind has returned to those images, especially since we back out of the Afghanistan and the city was retaken in 10 days. One story in particular haunts me. The last drone strike we sent was supposed to kill a bomber and our goverment confirmed it killed a bomber that killed us troops. 

Come to find out that was entirely a lie and the man they killed was some sort of social worker who was pulling up to his house, his kids were running out to the car when the drone striked landed, killing him, and all of his children in front of his wife. 

Now I think about the sons, fathers brothers that I killed. Not even considering that some were probabaly civilians.

I think how fucken aweful of a person i must have been to find some sort of pride in my accomplishment of ending another person's life. Why should I deserve to live when someone in the taliban probabaly didn't make too dissimilar decisions to me. I join the military out of desperation and how many kids were in the taliban for the same reason.

Now I'm stuck, hating everything, especially our goverment. I feel that because of my service I owe it to the world to try my best to help people so I am trying to train people to get in shape but then I am constantly left with the thought of... what can you actually do to make up for killing a man, someone's brother or father. 

The answer I'm left with is nothing,  and there is nothing I can do to repay the sins I did.

The only semblance I have is that, my only fear of killing myself before was that I would maybe go to hell. But recently I have been thinking I would go to hell anyway for what I've done so now the only reason I have not to is because no one would take care of my cat. Luckily I'm too afraid to actually do it, I guess.

What are some of the most effective techniques partners of those with CPTSD have used to do the following (list below) that didn’t result in igniting the “fight” response? 9 times out of 10, my partner ends up being so cruel, regardless of the words I choose, my body language, using a quiet volume of speaking, holding their hand, etc… when there’s even a hint of criticism involved. Even when there’s not, they still react as if there was. Even if I’m quietly crying due to something not at all related to them, I’ve been told I’m “aggressive” and “yelling”, when I’m not confronting them and not making eye contact. it’s damaging and confusing, as I’m already at a low point, and need the support of my partner.

I’m at a total loss. We know WHY they’re sensitive (abusive parents). We know that my partner struggles with shame, and the guilt of accountability is overwhelming for them. My partner is exceptionally self aware outside of conflict. We’re in talk therapy, personal and couples, but not making progress. If anything, it’s getting worse, as my partner feels increasingly exposed, b/c we’re discussing our issues with a therapist. There’s “fawning” during our sessions (“Yes thank you so much for the advice, that’s very helpful!”) and “fighting”(defensiveness) outside of sessions, when I try to practice the techniques we’ve been recommended. It’s a sad, hopeless catch 22. 😞

1- broach an uncomfortable topic. (Ex: What you said hurt my feelings.)

2- bring them back to reality. (Ex: You are reacting to something that isn’t happening right now. I’m not trying to hurt you.)

3- get them to take accountability for their actions, without it leading to them blame shifting. (Ex: Your lying has made it hard for me to trust you.)

Would appreciate feedback from both perspectives: What are the least triggering ways a partner can approach you (those with CPTSD that are extremely sensitive to criticism)? Is there a more fitting/ intensive therapy, other than trauma-informed talk therapy, we should pursue for them? Thank you.",1674827574.0

They want you to work a little retail job for the rest of your like.  They want you to never go to college.  Be poor forever.  Because they think they own you.

No.

They make you want to kill yourself.  They make you feel like you are worthless.  Like you have to do what they want.  They have hurt you.  Made you feel dirty.  

This person makes you feel like you have to destroy yourself.  You will never ever allow them to touch you again.  Ever.

They are evil.  You will recover from what they did to you.  They do nothing good for anyone.  They will never get you to destroy yourself because they need you to die because you are their victim.

They will make you feel like you have no other choice than to die.

They will try fuck with other peoples lives so they have some sad intresting story to tell their friends.  So they can get pity.  

I would say, I would never help any of them or their family or anyone I met through them.

They are someone who is very sick.  I don't need to deal with them or the problems their other victims have.  I have enough truama from them.  They want me to kill myself.  Then they will feel like they won.

 This is probably going to be a bit ranty, but I'm still in shock by the whole situation.

 Tonight I was at Gigaboks in Bergen, Norway.
When I stood in line.  A guy slipped in right before me.  Blank in his eyes, and he had already tried to pay before the customer in front of me had finished as well.  I saw that the cashier also found it uncomfortable, so I said that there is a queue here!  Answers me with a blank look, looks behind him, and probably nods something that can only be taken as a yes.  So I now came forward and pay for my stuff.  While I'm paying, he pulls out the airpod I had in my right ear that I usually have when I'm on the move, and I think.  Oh well?  Do we have a problem here and he asks straight out what the problem is?  Blank stare, says something to me in Russian or Ukrainian.  And I understand that the guy probably doesn't understand a single word of Norwegian.  Ask again ""What's the problem?""  nothing.  Get paid and realize that this is nothing to get involved in, and get off.  While I'm packing the bag, he catches up with me.  Starts talking to me in one of the above languages, tries to kick my feet and then SPITS RIGHT IN MY FACE!!!
The adrenaline rushes in and I grab the guy, shouting What the hell are you doing?!?  Im going to call the police!  People crowd around and just watch.  No help.  The guy is terrified and shouts HELP HELP!!!  I hold him for a minute, two max until I release him before this gets too bad.  The person runs away and the guards arrive 1-2 minutes later.  We can't find him.  Im just shooked by the whole situation.  It’s reported to the police, I will receive the video recording tomorrow for the report.  This is the strangest day I've had and am still completely in shock. Has anyone experienced anything similar?

Growing up I was never tought about the importance of cleanliness and keeping clean. Brushing teeth, showing things like that.

I never had clean clothes and I had to clean them myself if I wanted to makesure I had them.

I once had a bath with my underwear on to ""clean"" them even telling my mum what I was doing, I told her like I was proud of it and she didn't say anything to me like it was wrong or anything like that

I had to go to bed at 6pm every night even in holidays and weekends. I would see my friends outside playing while I was ment to be in bed

My parents never came into my room ever! The one day they did they found drawings all over the wall and went mental. I thought it was okay as I'd been doing it for best part of a year.

My parents often went to the store to get sweet treats for themselves but never me.

They locked away all the nice treat food so I couldn't have any

If they were eating biscuits or something infront of me and I wanted one, I would be scared to ask for one.

We had dogs and they weren't house trained and I'd be shouted at if I didn't clean up after them yet my dad never would.

They also shit in my room and it would ne left there for days or weeks at a time.

I'd be shouted at for the state the kitchen table got in where I eat. Like if I didn't wipe it down after I used it and months later they would see all the dried up food on it.

I once got shouted at because I wanted to go out with my friends but didn't have clean cloths to go with because u didn't clean any as it was a last minute thing and I wasn't prepared.

My school uniform and pe kit was only cleaned when I did it. As 12 year old I always forgot and always had it dirty.

I don’t even know where to start with this. Basically, I brought up inappropriate comments my (now deceased) father made towards me when I was a child. Yesterday was the first time I ever spoke about those things in detail. My therapist would interject numerous times during the conversation to “play devil’s advocate”. She would ask if my dad was under the influence when he did these things, in an attempt to justify his behavior. He was an alcoholic, but he did a lot of what he did sober. Even then, why does it matter? Nobody gets drunk and decides to do or say the things he did. One of the events was my dad staring at me naked after he abused his medication, then telling me I wasn’t his type after staring for a while. He stared at me in the shower and watched me get dressed that day. I remember, in that moment, feeling unsafe and afraid, like he might touch me. Another one of the events was him joking about being like Woody Allen and marrying me, because I was his adopted child. He was always jealous of my friends and would call them derogatory names. I remember him even commenting on one of my friend’s bodies. I told my therapist all of this. He was sober during these times. 


My therapist also told me since I cannot remember if more ever happened, I cannot make my dad out to be a villain. She told me saying things and acting on them are two totally different things, that my father is not on the level of people that harm children sexually. I reminded her my father was very abusive verbally and emotionally, that doing what he did was inexcusable. She agreed, told me it wasn’t my fault, then went back to playing devil’s advocate. I then brought up my inappropriate sexual behavior as a child, another professional made note of it on forms when I was young. I found them recently. She tried to make excuses for that, saying my behavior might be due to my ASD, when it clearly wasn’t. At that point, my face was turning red. I was holding back tears. I felt dirty, I felt regret for ever even bringing any of that up. When I told her I hated my dad for so much of what he did to me, she accused me of thinking in black and white and brought my BPD into it. I’m not even sure I have BPD or if it’s a misdiagnosis, because my therapist cannot tell the difference between a BPD episode and an anxiety attack. I recorded an anxiety attack one time to show her how severe mine are, for the purpose of showing her only. She said if anxiety attacks like that happen often, it might be BPD. It feels like she’s often weaponizing my diagnosis in sessions. There was one time I had an Autistic meltdown and she said it sounds manipulative and like it was BPD related. I’ve had other conflicts with this therapist, but I don’t want to list them all. She also has helped me a lot, but this, this feels unforgivable. 


I also want to mention that before my dad died, years ago, this therapist worked with him. She also worked with my cousin as one of her coworkers years back. Regardless of knowing my dad, she did not grow up with him as her father. She didn’t go through what I did. She did not know him outside of therapy. It seemed like she was attempting to side with him, calling him “flawed” and not abusive. I love my dad. My grief is complicated. In the beginning, I glorified him. Acknowledging the things he did to harm me has been so hard, after yesterday, even harder. I feel dirty and disgusting, I left the session in shock. I could barely sleep last night because I just kept thinking about how gross I felt. I told my mom what was said and a couple friends. All of them were disgusted and shocked. I’ve had so many traumatic experiences growing up in therapy, but yesterday was the grossest I felt after any session. It was so hard for me to talk about those things, and now I doubt I ever will again. I feel like a fake victim. I had so many people make excuses for my dad to the point where I always felt responsible for him, despite how he’d hurt me. I also went through numerous SA’s at the hands of an ex for years when I was a teen. I do not feel safe going into detail about that with my therapist now.",1674741287.0

I developed 3 addictions and one of them caused me to experience months-long psychosis last year. I stopped using substances as a result of that and have come a long way. My agoraphobic symptoms have largely lifted, my panic attacks have gone from happening a few times a day to a few times a month, I've let go of people who were unhealthy to associate with, and I've started thinking and feeling that I'm an important part of my life again. 

While these anxious symptoms have greatly improved, I find myself to be SO angry on an almost daily basis, mostly because I'm still in a lot of the circumstances I was in while sick.

My partner and I had been together for 5 years at that point and still are together. And honestly I’m surprised we are because, despite enjoying sex perfectly fine before this happened, since then, even cuddles and kissing can get me anxious. Sometimes I lash out at my partner for their sex drive… I feel jealous of them. And every time they want to get intimate and I don’t, I feel guilty. My partner never guilt trips me or makes me feel bad. I just feel bad all on my own.

And even when I do get to enjoy a little arousal, I’m usually too on edge to feel safe being with another person so I usually just masturbate. …but I’ve had partners in the past who felt hurt that I wanted to masturbate instead of having sex with them so I try to hide that I’m doing it. And when my partner finds out I’ve been hiding it then they feel hurt that I wouldn’t feel okay to just tell them that I need time alone.  

My partner has a perfectly healthy libido that unfortunately seems high to me because I was raised religious where even hugging was counted by seconds to avoid angering the lord. And since being assaulted my tolerance for anything sexual is so low. My partner expressed that they’ve started to internalize some of my distaste for sexual things and now their urges make them feel guilty. 

I’ve just messed up everything and I want so badly to either be normal or at least manage my abnormal in a way that doesn’t hurt people I love. I don’t know how to apologize for being paranoid without promising to not be paranoid anymore, but I can’t promise that….

Another examples: I see figures sitting in empty cars but when I look it’s no one. 

Another example: I thought a stick branch hand reached out of my window 

Another example: I was walking and I felt unreal for 5 seconds as if I was seeing myself walk from the outside, as if I didn’t belong in my body. Every shadow I see, i hallucinate and think it’s a demon trying to possess me. Every single shadow. I hallucinate in the corner of my eye as well.

I have left the group but I am struggling with the physical, emotional and psychological pain I am constantly in. Whatever I do feels like its not working. I've tried EMDR but I kept disassociating and felt like the practitioner was a threat as it felt intrusive. I've tried SE, which does help to some degree, but a few hours later I am back in the feeling threatened/pain loop cycle. I am extremely worried about my mind, and about never getting better. The chronic headaches are unbareable. Ive been advised to take amitryptaline by the doctor, but here in Spain, there is little to no mental health support for free, and I felt a total lack of understanding/support from the doctor. Though, I am hoping this could at least help with headaches and pain. I am moving back to the UK, to home, even though it doesn't feel that safe either, I think I will get more professional help there. It broke me down as a person and I feel like I'm trying to hold onto the shreds that are left. It is so so sad. I felt like I had a life before this and now I'm suicidal and losing hope. It particularly gets worse two weeks before my period, I think I have developed PMDD as a result of the PTSD, it seems this fairly common. I also get chronic, chronic anxiety about making decisions as a result of the cult, as we were forced into channelling and threatened of being punished if we were 'Wrong' or choosing from our minds. I was also convinced that I had been sexually abused by my father by other members of the group, and have no idea whether or not if this is true, but I highly suspect not, that it was planted there.

How exactly did you guys get checked/diagnosed? I have never had any therapy or been to a hospital for any mental related issues, so I seriously dont know how exactly I can get help. Could I just call my regular hospital and tell them that I'd like to get a mental evaluation check or something? Or do you specifically have to ask for an evalutation for a specific disorder?

So I went to my aunts wedding in Alabama. I’m from MA, so we had to fly. Airports are one of my worst nightmares, especially now that I have to worry about dissociation and getting confused. We had a really rough flight. The flight attendants weren’t allowed to stand up for the entire flight. I’ve had flights where we weren’t allowed to stand, but never the flight attendants. It was in a church. I always feel super uncomfortable in places of worship. I am an atheist, and having people come over and pray over me loudly because I’m not a “child of god” is super weird. I try to take it in the way it is meant, as they’re trying to help me in the way they know how, but I still hate it. I hate confrontation, but my dad doesn’t. I don’t blame him for not sitting there silently while they were trying to convert him, but him starting an argument about it in a church at a wedding made me so anxious. It was really loud. There were 85 people there, at a small-town church with not enough seating or food. My 18 year old cousin was there with his girlfriend who looked way younger than him. He’s been having some run-ins with the law recently which we had to hear him brag about. It turns out she is 14. I was fully not ok with this. I was hoping there was nothing sexual going on there. After, on our way home, my mom informed us that the 14 year old was pregnant. Way more not ok with this now. This is also Alabama, where abortion is fully banned. My dad wanted to offer a place to stay if they needed to go “camping” but my mom wouldn’t let him in case they got in legal trouble for it. This whole situation is just a mess. Then of course I had a dissociative episode as we were driving into the rental car garage to return it. (If you imagine plopping my 14 year old self into my present body that is essentially what happens). Now my parents are trying explain what is going on, where we are, why we were there, and where we are going, as well as how old I am supposed to say I am, right near the entrance of the airport. Nothing suspicious there. 2018 me didn’t have PTSD, but my symptoms still show up during episodes, and airports are flashback central for me. My parents were trying to explain the flashbacks to her and what was going on while she was clearly panicking. We have a note and video that explains everything as well but it just wasn’t processing. We got home with no real issues, but I hated everything about this trip.  This wasn’t even wedding number one for her, this was number three. Thankfully, no more weddings for a while.",1674673479.0

I was reading something similar, just a theoretical suggestion to someone about something that wasn’t factually happening, but since then my own memory of the topic has been stuck in my head for a while. I’ve always been uncomfortable with it, and it’s one of the more tender thoughts from my assault, but yeah…

When he was r-ping me, this much older man who was a stranger I only got to know for barely a day, he said that I was his sex slave, and that after our “session” he planned to send me to all of his friends to use and r-pe me however they wanted, like the dirty wh-re that I am. Maybe it’s my fault he had that impression, because I was being a wh-re when I agreed to meet him for casual sex, just like how I’d met several people before him.

Well, I mean, he never got around to doing it because I freaked out after and never texted him again after confronting him about what he did to me later that night, and we blocked each other after he was called in to questioning by the police because of my report. But hearing those words in my head in a voice which I’m slowly forgetting how it sounds like, and reading those words “sex slave” / “pimp you out” / “send you my friends to use you” being written anywhere, it brings me right back. There are other words that send me back as well, even just as simple as “cry harder”. 

I hate him. I hate his voice. I hate the words in my own voice, in anyone else’s voice. I hate that even reading words on a screen send me back to that moment. I hate that I can’t look at men anymore and think that one of them will k-dnap and s-x tr-ffic me. All this, on top of thinking that most of them will SA or r-pe me. It fucking sucks. I hate it.

987,I feel like I experience PTSD very different from everyone else,3,10ktda3,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/10ktda3/i_feel_like_i_experience_ptsd_very_different_from/,3,"TW: SA

I should start off by saying that yes, I do have a diagnosis and that I’m also autistic so that might be why the presentation of this disorder is so different in me. 

I’m not gonna go in detail, but I was SAed twice by two different people a few years ago. Anyways, the way I’ve experienced this trauma is not the same as a lot of other people I’ve met or talked to with PTSD by a long a shot.

It is entirely possible that my alexithymia (trouble understanding and communicating my emotions due to autism) may be responsible for this, but I don’t have flashbacks in the typical sense. 

When I think about the trauma, I feel disgusted and a little offset, but I don’t get an immediate panic response or any particularly strong emotions. 

I am affected in other areas of my life, though. I have a very hard time experiencing sexual attraction to women anymore and also for some reason, I find it difficult to be sexually attracted to people I actually have feelings for. 

I’ve also run into one of my abusers quite regularly (when I say run into I really just mean seeing them walking around campus from time to time) and that does make me anxious, but I don’t freak out ever. 

To be honest, I rarely outwardly express any of my emotions, though. I disassociate a lot instead. 

I guess where I’m going with this is asking: does anyone else experience PTSD in this way? 

(I should also mention that I fall more under the category of C-PTSD due to several other ongoing traumatic incidents that happened during my childhood.)",1674633002.0

(Yes I reported it, no nothing happened to him)

I have avoided going out or dating apps or any type of situation where I could be put in a position for sex. I wasn’t just afraid of being sexually assaulted again, I was afraid of any hookups. 

Anyway...I’ve been seeing my almost boyfriend (M 24) for 4 months now. We recently had sex for the first time. For some reason I felt extreme guilt before we did anything sexual, as if I’m not allowed to do it. We just made out and felt each other up, i made the excuse of being dominant so he wouldn’t notice how unready I was to be…

But once we did it, I felt so empowered and I realized how safe he made me feel. Now my sex drive is insane even though we hardly actually do it…(trying to take things slow). He has told me he wants me to be triple sure that I want to do it every time when the opportunity presents itself. 

Now I’m just totally obsessed with him and i feel like I only want to have sexual relations with him. 
I’m starting to question if this is the start of a healthy relationship or I’m just infatuated with this “resurrected high” he gives me. 
I have such a lack of guilt that I almost feel bad for not feeling guilty for doing “it” again.
