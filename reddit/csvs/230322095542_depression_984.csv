If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",1679262278.0

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",1572360722.0

I had to move in with my parents because I don‚Äôt work currently (thank you depression) and for the past year and a half, they have been in a pre-separation mode that they won‚Äôt conclude. I think that both of them are narcissists who ultimately only care about themselves. My mom holds me responsible for her marriage and she has played the victim her whole life. My dad is a narcissistic liar who won‚Äôt deal with the truth. My siblings are pretty toxic and I am the one that they all depend on for emotional support. The thing, no one is really there for me. 

Anyway. This was a rant I needed to let out because I don‚Äôt really have anyone to vent to. I don‚Äôt want to burden my boyfriend with my depression, he doesn‚Äôt deal well with it. I don‚Äôt want to tell my friend about this because they have their own problems and we barely ever get to talk (they all live abroad). I rarely meet people who understand me. 

Can anyone relate to my story?",1679418727.0

  I'm scared 
  I'm scared that one day it will get so bad that I'll actually kill myself. I try to find ways to slap myself out of my depressed states. Calm myself down and try to relax. Maybe go outside for a walk.

Let me give you some background on why I‚Äôm posting here. I ran across a post about a month ago from a young teenager about being depressed and all that (you know, the typical teenage woes). Out of kindness, I replied with some words of comfort, and after a while we started messaging and have kept in touch since. I am by no means an expert (outside of my personal experience dealing with depression and anxiety most of my adult life), but all signs point to him having some sort of mental health issues.

Like everyone, he has had good days and bad days, but lately things have taken a darker turn and I‚Äôm realizing I‚Äôm in over my head. For a while our conversations never involved suicide, and I know I‚Äôm not really equipped to help people struggling with those thoughts, but now it‚Äôs come up a few times and I‚Äôm starting to feel like I could be in danger of inadvertently saying the wrong thing or somehow making the situation worse. My first inclination was to steer him in the direction of talking to parents or another trusted adult, getting therapy, etc., but for several reasons that‚Äôs not an option right now.

At this point, I‚Äôm completely committed to helping this kid get the help he needs and I won‚Äôt abandon him just because this situation has become more complicated than I originally anticipated. I started myself down this road, and I won‚Äôt give up until I know he‚Äôs safe or at least in the right hands. I don‚Äôt want to get into any details in this post, but I could really use some advice from anyone who understands how to talk to a very depressed / suicidal kid who probably has mental health issues and is desperately searching for a reason to keep living.",1679439826.0

I have tried countless times, and failed every single time. The more succesful attempts at recovering never lasted either, and it's always gotten as bad as things had been before.

Even if I do get better, is it even worth it? I'm constantly suffering right now, and my brain feels like a torture prison, that I'm forever stuck inside of. I could end that pain right now, instead of working hard, and regaining a bit of control over my life...

Later down that year I had some pretty shitty moments with my mother (physical violence) as my father abandoned us to go live in another country for half the year, when he came back, they found out about my drug usage, which again ended up in physical abuse and the over infantilization of a 15 yo boy who never had any freedom or power in his life, my parents started walking me to school (it was 2 blocks away from home lmao), once they even punched me infront of my classmates and threatened some random boy about beating him up because they confused him with someone I smoked weed with.
At the end of that year they sent me to love with my grandma in another country.
There I was, all alone in a country that was foreign to me although I was born there, I had family of course, but I can't really be myself around my family, the year was 2020 and I was just starting classes again when the pandemic hit, it was at that point when I abandoned my studies for the first time, tbh I didn't suffer through covid because I lived with my cousin and we played videogames all day, but I ended up drinking a ton of alcohol in secret again, sniffing gas from the stove, stealing pills from my grandma, because I was desperate, life felt like it physically weighted on me,
I stopped eating because sadness did not allow me to, I started getting weaker and weaker untill 10onths later my mother picked me up and we returned to tje country I was raised in.
It did not get better for a long time.
My mother did not trust me at all and didn't allow me to go outside (I was 16 at the time), she even hid the keys from me.
As I realized that she would never trust me again I said fuck it and started smoking weed again, yadda yadda I start studying again and pass the year (yay), but still, I was a 17yo boy who isolated himself for 2 years and didn't talk irl to anyone that wasn't family, I developed a serious internet addiction due to it.
In 2022 stuff got slightly better, but not really, during summer break I met a girl (26yo) online, and we start talking, we like each other, the first time I left my house in years for something that wasn't school was to meet her, which I did, at the cemetery, I was 17.
Later in that year I get into an altercation with my mother and she beats me again and kicked me out of her house, after that I live with my father for a couple weeks before she decided to ask me to come back home again (she never said sorry), I get even more depressive to the point I abandon my studies again.
Then I become 18 years old, and this 26yo girl I talked about before asks to unvirgin me (to which I said yes), she invited me to her brother's bday party.
When everyone went to sleep, we were in bed together, I was sleepy and high, and she was drunk and coked tf up, we had a very awkward kiss, I then say that I forgot to bring condoms and she mounts me anyway before I could say anything.
After that shitty experience we become a couple, my first girlfriend ever yay.
Fuck it was a rollercoaster of shit, she was abusive, she offered me coke after I was clean for 3 years, she insulted me and said I was only useful for sex, she even slapped me a couple of times.
Why does everyone abuses me?
Now, 2023, I have my first job, but I still struggle with my weight, which makes me very self aware of how weak and small I am.. I feel ugly, I feel emasculated.
Now I have to study again and I just can't keep up with study and work (my work shift goes from 4am to 12pm, and my classes go from 6pm to 12am)
I just want to give up, I feel like I don't deserve anything, I just want to sleep and sleep and wake up when everything's allright.

Fear and anxiety rule his every thought , loneliness and despair fill every breath in his lungs. 

Darkness reigns unchallenged, the light is all gone. Feelings of happiness extinguished and drowned, deluge of pain and suffering watered them down. 

Like an ancient warrior facing certain death, wounded , bruised and bleeding he marches on. 

Flashes of memories that are long gone, hints of an era that once had begun. With fire and passion his heart once fought. Stabbed and damaged it won‚Äôt pump blood , only anger rage flow thru the holes. 

For his Queen he swore once that death he would take. Just to protect her from the evils out there. But no one had warned him of the evil within. A festering wound that ends in gangrene . Rotting soul and heart but not too fast. Ensuring he suffers as much as he can.

The dream of a life was just a mirage . Leading the warrior into an inescapable trap. Battle after battle, war after war. Trenches of anguish is where he stands. 

What was the purpose the man thought to himself. Looking around for someone to help. No one in sight to hear his plight, only more darkness and none of the light. 

Hopeless and tired he kneels on his sword. With honor and valor he lets it all go. Plunging the steel makes the flesh cold. Followed by warmth of the pouring hot blood.  

Seconds feel like years as life flashes by. He enjoys every memory with his last ever smile. 

But out of the darkness someone reached out . Returning the light and the life that ran out. 

The warrior perplexed looked almost scared , for he had never encountered no one that cared. 

His story unfinished and with no clear path. But now he‚Äôs determined to let go of the past. 

Wounds that are healing wounds that will come. Master the pain that will never be gone.

No matter how close or how far. He will continue to battle this war.",1679450040.0

 Every day is the same for me. I am tired. I do not have friends. I'm 20 years old, I'm not in college as my exams weren't good enough for any course, I've always had average/below average grades, I'm not smart enough. I'm not working because I quit the job I hated but had thinking about joining the military, the idea of being one of those brave men and women who defend their country, who save lives and help people gave me some motivation and a feeling of purpose, I started working out at a gym and running but still failed the pace test and 4 months later still at parents house doing nothing. I go out 3 times a week to a gym, where each time I go I feel weaker and weaker. I'm a failure. I'm incredibly socially awkward every time I speak something embarrassing comes out. I am tired. I don't have a purpose. I feel different from others, they seem like another species to me. All the people I grew up with are successful now. I'm still in the same place I was years ago, even worse. I feel empty. I have no personality, I am a lifeless body walking around, a postponed corpse. I'm ashamed of myself. I have no place in this world. I wish I hadn't been born. We don't choose to be born, but I believe we can decide to stay or leave when we are able to make that decision and I want to leave. What's the point of all this? The world doesn't care, the world doesn't depend on us, even less on me, so why stay? I don't know anything, I'm not happy, I'm alone, I'm tired of everything and everyone, I've always felt this way, before I was distracted by the friends I had at school but when I was alone, this feeling of being useless has always been with me. 
 No work, no degree, no friends, no joy, no motivation, no will, no patience, no happiness, no reason. No love. The only thing I like is sleeping, it's the closest thing I have to what I think being dead is. I wish every day to not wake up, but I'm still here, being useless. 

 My life is completely fucked up. I screw everything up. I'm a fuck-up.

 There are good days though, the ones where I just don't feel anything, not happiness or sadness, not joy or agony, just numbness, days when my mind is so foggy I can't think and remember who I am.

 It's not that I hate life, I just don't like living being myself.

 I want to leave and be forgotten so that I can really go away. Why should I wait?

 I don't know why I'm writing this and why I feel like showing it to anyone, maybe I'm just an attention seeker. However, if I do, that means I'm still here.",1679448505.0

57,Lifelong monkey on one‚Äôs back.,2,11xvanb,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11xvanb/lifelong_monkey_on_ones_back/,0,"Man, I‚Äôve been living with this feeling since like roughly 11-12 years ago but only got diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety about a year ago now. I mean I‚Äôm only 25 this year. 
Last year was rough. I couldn‚Äôt enjoy anything in life everyday. I mean I still don‚Äôt. I stopped taking my antidepressants and seeing my therapist on a random day. I haven‚Äôt looked back since. 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible to get completely rid of this feeling. Being utterly miserable, unlovable, a waste of space. It stays with you. Hearing a professional tell me I was mentally ill felt like a truck hauling a bus had ran me over, but that acknowledgment was merely confirmation that I wasn‚Äôt crazy. I‚Äôm not like the ordinary person who is able to smile without hiding their true self, the person who can be optimistic, the person who doesn‚Äôt think twice about hanging with friends and loved ones. 

Man. I am at the infancy of this journey, I am terrified. Every day I don‚Äôt want to wake up, but I do, everyday I don‚Äôt want to bathe but I do, I don‚Äôt want to talk but I do, I don‚Äôt want to walk my dogs but i do. Sometimes, all I can do is just wake up. Why won‚Äôt this feeling just leave me be? 

But it‚Äôs fine. If this is my slice of hell, fuck me someone else has it worse out there. At least I have a community (granted not everyone or anyone will read this but it‚Äôs importance is justified), I have a space I can just cry and rant about how much I fucking hate it all and they get it. 

Fuck me man, I mean, I hope I eventually get this monkey off my back but we‚Äôre likely to become friends before such a thing happens.",1679434181.0

Then depression and loneliness destroy my motivation to do much of anything. Loneliness and the fact that I express love and desire through touch makes my libido rage, but awkwardness and introvert tendencies make it hard to connect. But the longing for connections makes me make bad decisions in my wish for connection and intimacy.  It all feels like too much. If I didn't have work I feel like I would just sleep all the time. Even the things that used to help, playing video games, reading, watching movies and shows bring me less and less joy as time moves on. Sometimes I'm even angry that I was born at all. Not that I've never had happy moments but they get lost in the sea of depression. So, here I float on these waters with no land in sight.",1679425898.0

67,Don't know what to do anymore,2,11xu2sd,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11xu2sd/dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/,1,"Back when I was in high school I was struggling to make friends and didn't have the greatest of home lifes either (my parents argued all the time and at times when they had no form of release for their anger and frustration I would end up their verbal punching bag or in extremely rare cases, physical action would be taken as well). Back then I was on a constant mental decline due to loneliness and solitude I constantly found my self in. In order to try and combat it I did theater programs run through my school. The high school I was at is know for their theatre programs as well as their music department. Though run by about 3-4 teachers, the school was known for how much it did within the field. the shows had thousands of dollars spent on them each year, the music students took trips to music competitions, with everyother year taking them to a competition in NYC. I loved theatre, even did quite well in it up until I was about 21, but it wasnt the environment of the school that got me into it. It was the fact that all the students seemed to friends with each other. Casts of the school shows seemed like familys at times and with my home life the way it was, I wanted something like that. So I joined the select choir, that led to me being subtly hinted at to audition for the schools shows (well, as subtle as people in that field could be). I did so hoping to join the family they created and got into the shows and was a part of the cast every year. now long story short I was never accepted fully into their family, it was those teenage years where they had already determined friend groups, but it allowed me time away from home for as many hours as possible. So some days with rehearsals or performances I would be at the school starting at 7 am until 11 pm. So I dedicated myself to the shows, they were the one thing that really kept me going. Cut my senior year, I was known for being a bad student amongst my peers. I never did homework because I would be too depressed at home to do it, so many teachers would yell at me in front of other students in attempts to get me to improve my habits. None of it worked though, mostly due to the fact that test scores could easily out weigh a students homework score to create a passing grade and with me never really getting below a 90 percent on any test, it led me to focus on theatre instead. I loved it at this point, the fall semester I was planning to audition for colleges and try to make a career out of this. Not only that but my school vocal director, who doubled as the musical director, chose a show we were gonna be dumping money into. I mean I think the show spent around 200k, fabrics imported for India, a large bell was made so it could be rung on stage without making a sound, costumes rented from the former professional touring production, it was a lot. I was excited for the year, my fellow seniors were all really talented and it felt like for once I had a piece of the future to look forward to, even if it was only 6 months worth of future. It didn't last long though. before the call back list was posted one day many of us were hanging out in the vocal directors classroom, one girl was sitting behind the desk of the director since it was the most comfortable chair there when she started going though some of the directors things. When pressed about it she said she was looking to see if her boyfriend at the time had made it into the show, if he didn't then she'd have to do her senior show without him. Another guy started to help her out of what I could only assume to be a mixture of bordem and curiosity when they stumbled apon a mock call back list as well as peoples rating for their auditions. the guy realized that they shouldn't be doing this and backed away to talk to others while the girl looked around asking others to look at it all for her. I wanted friends, so I did. I told her that her boyfriend had a good audition and when other students pressed me about out it, we talked about the call back list. The director eventually found out that people were going through her desk and when she asked other students about it, they all said I had done it in search of the call back list. None of them said that anything about the other two students, they didn't tell her how I just read out what they had found, they placed everything on me. I don't know why they all did this, I dont think I ever will, but it led to the director to looking to see if I had done anything else. Apparently at this point other students had claimed that I said that a girl wasn't in the call back list and it saddened her to the point of tears, first off that was wrong because I distinctly remember saying that she had a damn good chance to get the leading role along with everyone else on that list for it. She was and still is extremely talented and I've never claimed anything else. Next these students said I read the transcript of a math class for another student and bullied them for it. Now with this, I did read this transcript, the student had left it out on a table in the vocal classroom for about 2-3 weeks and one day I picked up and read it, made a comment about to to other students in the room, and put it back on the table it was. Unknown to me at the time, that student had dropped out, hence why he never came to retrieve the paper and why itd been there so long. I know the entirety of that situation because I had reached out to him to apologize when people started to blame me for him dropping out. He told me it was fine and didn't know what was happening because he made and followed through on that decision far before any of this happened. Unfortunately for me though the director only heard that the student dropped out, and that I according to others had bullied him. She pulled me aside one day to tell me how disappointed she was in me, she told me how she knew everything I'd done and that there's no reason to attempt to lie about anything. She said I was the reason that kid dropped out and that I robbed her of the chance to save him, she said I violated her trust by going through what must have been all of her things to find the audition information, and she said that she couldn't believe I would lie to people and tell others that a girl wasn't up for a role where she really was. I didn't know what to do, the director what certain in what she knew and I knew she wasn't changing her mind on any of it, so I just through tears said I was sorry, that I didn't mean to hurt anyone. The director was like a mother to me and now she was pinning all these things to me and I didn't know what to do. So as punishment she wanted me to apologize to the girl, I was to never be in her classroom without her being there, and that she couldn't in good faith help me with any college auditions. She finished it all off by saying that because of this all she didn't know if she could ever trust me again. It broke me, I isolated myself for the rest of the school year, she thankfully still let me be in the show that year, but I tried to not talk to many people at rehearsals if I wasn't spoken to first. I applied for other degree fields at colleges. And outside of school I rarely spoke to anyone unless it was online gaming. 
I didn't perform for over year after that, I couldn't get myself to be near a stage. I eventually got the courage to audition for the theatre department at the college I attended and got in. But after a year and a half the anxiety of being around a stage and performing, and the anxiety that I would just be someone's scape goat or disappointment again led to major problems for me. I developed a severe panic attack and anxiety disorder, and my body would start literally breaking down under the stress of it all, leading at points to trips to the ER for internal bleeding. I quit performing for good after that, I haven't been on a real stage since I was 19, and I haven't performed since I was 21. I'm 23 now and I don't know what to do, I had to drop out of college because of my mental health, my father has threatened to kick me out of the house because my choice to leave school and when my mother opposed his idea, threatened to divorce her and list me as the cause.im stuck in a deadend job working 60 hours a week and I've lost all will to do anything. I don't know what to do, I've lost everything and have no one. I just wanted friends and ended up here. I have a therapist but even after sessions I just leave feeling empty.

(m/22, if you care)


First things first, I really need to vent right now and dont know if anyone is even gonna read that but I just need to get this out of my head.
And sorry, if my english isn't good...

So, I've been battling depression for over a decade, I've mostly gotten better after years of therapy and carefully choosing the people around me so I've been pretty stable for a few years with less and less backlashes.

Today marks the first day after about 3 years where I'm getting extremely intense thoughts about self harming, drug abuse and even suicidal thoughts.

I've already been in a pretty bad mood today, overthinking a lot and shit like that and I had to go to social event I didn't really wanna take part in but usually it turns out better than expected. It wasn't like that today. I've felt even worse and useless (despite my friends trying to cheer me up) and realized that I'm not good at anything. I tried to drink those thoughts away with some cocktails (which usually works wonders for me in social events) but that just made it worse.
Since I got home I've just been sitting on my bed and staring at the wall, my thoughts going through a downward spiral. I drank some more and feel better and worse at the same time. I've even got to the point that I noticed another issue I haven't even realized before but makes so much sense comparing it to the events in my life. Then I thought of numbing my pain with a method I used years ago, forced myself not to because the scars have almost faded out. Then I thought about what drugs I could use to distract my mind, even started to research before I stopped myself and decided to rant here.
I'm very aware of my thoughts which makes me instantly feel regretful and even more like a shitty person.

I just want to cry and try to vent through that but that's something I still can't do. Love society for teaching boys that they aren't allowed to cry.

Anyways, I hope I can force myself to focus on something else now that I've written this shit down. My mind does feel a bit clearer now without taking some extreme steps.

Also to everyone reading this: I hope you have a great day tomorrow. And maybe we can all fight our inner demons some day and live a better life. Just trying to survive one day at a time.",1679437864.0

Im a man in my late 30s and I have already seen and done things that very few people on Earth ever have. I have a great career making six figures. Own my own house/property. I have a great relationship with all of my family. I have cultivated so many friends over the years. I‚Äôm a rock in many peoples lives. I‚Äôm the guy people can count on to help them out with anything they need. I love people and helping people. 

I was an idiot in my 20s chasing the one that got away in a toxic on again off again relationship and when I finally thought it was all going to work out I got cheated on by her with a guy twice our age. Years later she wrote me a letter apologizing for it all. I fell into depression and let myself go after this. I came out of it and managed to find purpose in my work and hobbies. I lost 100 lbs to get in shape. And‚Ä¶ nothing. For whatever reason I can‚Äôt find love. I‚Äôve literally traveled to every continent on Earth, made a lot of money, taken care of my physical appearance and for whatever reason I still can‚Äôt find anyone who loves me which makes it all feel so hollow. I don‚Äôt feel like anyone owes me love, I‚Äôm just sad and depressed that halfway through my life I can‚Äôt say that I‚Äôve ever truly received it despite trying pretty hard to find it for a long time.

I loved her with all of my heart and apparently so did she, I treated her like princess, I did all I could've for her and whatever she wanted. I had to reassure her countlessly that I wouldn't leave her and that I wouldn't get bored of her. We had a lot to talk about, a lot of similar or same hobbies, watched a lot of stuff together and basically did everything together. Our intimate life was great, sometimes one-sided in her favour but I didn't mind. We had similar ideas about future, what we want to do and where we want to be. I've got a well paying job during the start of our relationship that gave me a lot of flexibility to be with her.

...and then suddenly she started questioning our relationship, sometimes saying that it doesn't have any meaning, that she isn't sure about it then switching to telling me she loves me and she wants to be only with me in her future. Afterwards it repeated and she broke up with me. She told me it's not my fault and that she is feeling terrible to do this to me after I treated her much better than she deserved during our relationship.

I respected her choice, I respected her not loving me anymore, I told her she is amazing, has nothing to be sorry about cause I loved the time I was able to be with her, I told her I hope she'll find someone she's gonna be happy with, I thanked her for everything and wished her all the best which was my last goodbye to her.

I feel devastated, I feel like I just want to die, I put every single bit of myself into this, I've did my best to be the best boyfriend I could possibly be, fully opened myself to her the way I've never opened to anyone to this day, did everything I could for her and it still wasn't enough.

I just don't feel any hope anymore. If even my best isn't enough, what is? I cannot do this again. I'm so tired of trying, of not being good enough. I battled with my confidence during the relationship, trying so hard not to fall into depression, tried my best to not feel like I'm not enough for her, tried not to feel like a useless trash and just focused on being the best I can be for her and make her happy. And it still wasn't fucking enough. I'm back down to square zero.

I'm tired..I don't have the strength to try again..to build a connection again to not be good enough again.. I just want to die, I just want to end this, but I won't. I promised her not harm myself in any way, but it's so hard not to see it as the only way to feel better. I can just lay in my bed thinking about the loneliness that I haven't felt for the first time in my life during the time I was with her and that I will never see her again, never hear her beautiful laugh, never be able to tell her I love her, never hear her voice again, never kiss her, never hug her never seeing the beautiful brown eyes of hers.

 I haven't achieved anything in life. My thoughts are drowning me. Always too tired even without doing anything. Tired of life, only sleep is my therapy.

Never felt so alone in my life. People are around me everyday but no one seems to care. I've been pretending to be okay for the longest time. I'm no longer my previous self, the confident one, the know it all, the positive guy. I have no ambition, no expectations, all I care now is how to finish the day. This has been my lowest state, my whole body is aching, my soul is hurting, my brain decided to stopped working. 

I miss myself. I miss being happy. I miss being at the moment. I miss celebrating life. I miss being intimate with someone. I miss competing. I miss my family. I miss my friends.

Ever since I turned 21 I started feeling jelous towards my peers: profesionally, academically, relationship wise. I am 27 now and things haven't really improved.

Everytime I try to share these emotions with someone, namely my mother she just brushed them off and made no big deal out of them. Telling me to just ""man up"" basically. When I shared them with friends they either said nothing or told me to get over it.. as such I bottle these feelings because it seems to be a nuisance to other people. Fucking assholes.

I feel envy profesionally because I do not work in the places I wish to work and for positions I want to work at. I am underpaid, working a job I have grown out of for years.

Relationship wise, I barely have any friends anymore after college. No partners due to me not taking the initiative to do so. Not due to lack of confidence but due to constant daydreaming and fantasizing about being in a relationship instead of actually pursuing it.

I do not feel like an independent person, up till recently I was living with my parents and just now am learning to live on my own. I wanted this to be sooner but due to my own lack of initiative and financial struggles I was not able to.

I have been addicted to pornography and videogames ever since I was a teen. Just now I am trying to fix these issues. But its hard man... really hard after 15 years of constant use. Makes me feel disgusting. Full of hatred. But at any inconvinience or struggle, I immediately resort to these two things.

Lately I have been suffering from mood swings from manic anger and anxiety to relative peace serenity and reflection. Within the same hour even. I have also seemed to garner small panic attacks at the most ridiculous and inconsequential things that happen to me. 

I talk to myself. Alot. Alot alot over the years. For about a couple years now this self talk has turnt more negative over time. Insulting my own capability and intelligence at any mistake.

My partner is a fantastic person and the moments I get to spend with him everyday are a blessing. He has similar issues,  but I insisted he kept his computer since that's his lifeline. On top of that, he has numerous social circles who adore him.

I've been having a terrible depression spout just due to the new location and lack of socializing, and it stings when I'm awake at night sad and alone,  and I hear him talking to one of his many friend groups. They play games, have fun, just hang out. He'll do this all night, and I have to sleep and wake up to him having fun.

I asked him to keep his belongings and I love that he has friends, but I just get so upset that he has things that I just cannot have - a loving family, friends who would never replace him, games he can play - it makes me so irrevocably depressed that I just can't have those things for some reason. I have autism, ADHD and social anxiety and I try to communicate my jealousy to him but at the end of the day, it isn't his problem. I want him to be happy but I'm upset that he can do these things, which is shitty of me to even feel.

I've been drinking and smoking so much for the past few weeks, its really starting to hurt me really bad. But, I think I just lost something special. So basically, I was in a relationship with this girl for around 4 months. We hit it off real good, right from the start. We used to hang around uni together, and it felt so perfect. I had to break it off with her, since I wasnt really looking for anything serious, and she insisted on only that. Ever since the beginning, and even during our relationship, she only prioritized friendship over us. It was always friends, friends, friends for her. We said we'd balance both, but somehow she didn't do anything much about us. She also had a lot of guy friends, that made me feel so bad about, but I never got the nerve to tell her about how that made me feel. Seeing her dancing with all those guys post breakup, sparked a different kinda anger in me. I know I ended this, but I was really hoping that we would atleast stay friends. I told her how much she meant to me, and even begged her to stay. 
I just ended up blocking her. Her birthday, is in a months time. Should I even bother wishing her?

Most of this discussion will be off the top of my head and I'll be adding my own experiences.

To start, there are situations in life that we genuinely have absolutely no control over. I myself suffer from MDD and struggle with it on a daily basis. I take medication, I try and get out more, I see a therapist and I'm trying to find a job that would interest me. I'm constantly worried about my future and whether I want to continue or not. One thing that happens quite frequently is that I create non existent situations in my head which cause even more stress and anxiety. Once this cycle begins, it doesn't matter what it is, whether I have control over it or not, it's a nightmare to deal with this constant stress of anything that may happen. Why does this occur? Why are we as humans so unequipped to handle these challange? One could say the society we are surrounded by and what is expected of us causes a drastic change in the way we look, feel and think. To an extent this is true, but why is it so terribly exhausting and anxiety stricken to be able to even begin coping with what is going on around us. It's an obstacle I am incapable of clearing, I worry about anything and everything that involves me and those close to me. I'm consistently tired, in pain, anxious, worried and have had this heavy weight on my chest each and every minute of everyday for over 5 years. Nothing seems to change, I keep telling myself tomorrow will be different, I'll do this and that and it will all be better. But when the time comes.... I fall short, I let myself down, I let others down and most of all I continue the same cycle over and over again. Is this a situation or cycle I've made up to comfort myself as all I know is this feeling of dread and doubt and fear and anxiety, or does it truly exist and hinder me? Am I really my own worst enemy? Why am I constantly at war with myself? It feels like a never ending battle, I fight back, but I don't fight hard enough. Am I even capable of doing so?
Just what exactly is it that I'm waiting for... An idea, a person, an event or situation in my life? These consist of things I can and can't control... I feel as though I have no control over the majority of these things, which further pushes me to feel as though I have control over nothing. Why do we have to suffer the way we do? Why are our minds and body working against us? Is it not the job of our brain to keep us alive and well? It's supposed to keep us alive for as long as possible, and we even have built in ways of surviving dangerous situations, but when it comes down to the core of it, our brains are what control us. Our thoughts, our actions and feelings.... Yet its perfectly happy with the idea of us ending it...",1679409038.0

187,Am I depressed and if yes why?,1,11xhpkq,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11xhpkq/am_i_depressed_and_if_yes_why/,0,"Hello, 

I am male and twenty years old and actually I have a great life: I have great parents and a brother, I was successful in sports until my injury and I finished school very successfully a few years ago. In the meantime I have also almost finished the first part of my studies and I am successful there as well. In addition, I have a great - albeit small but fine - group of friends.

Somehow I have been feeling weak and tired for some time now and can't really motivate myself to do anything. I think a lot, especially about the past.

My school days were difficult at the beginning because I was bullied. I am almost highly gifted and always had difficulties to get into a really casual conversation with other people. Also, I had different interests than kids my age. After I changed schools, the situation was immediately better and I had made real friends for the first time and also developed self-worth. I just went through with school and left all the dating stuff alone, following the motto ""Will come around then, I have time"".

At the same time, it was always difficult in my family, too. My depressed and schizophrenic grandmother hates my parents, even though she lives next door to them. The whole thing goes so far that she says things like she would rather be dead than live next to people like my parents. 

Because I moved out to study, I was able to escape this somewhat, but it still depresses me because I am her only confidant.

Some time ago I tried dating and was only disappointed and hurt. I had not thought that rejection offends me so much. However, I have always been able to pick myself up again after recovery periods and continue. Then, about two and a half months ago, I met a girl - completely unexpectedly and unfortunately online - who completely enchanted me. And vice versa as well. She doesn't live quite nearby, but I have no problem with having to drive and it's not so far that we can't see each other every weekend. We then had together after a few meetings also our respective first kisses and now just look where the journey goes....

This feeling that I can actually be attractive and appealing is indescribable to me. And I have noticed how much I have always missed physical closeness the last few years, although I NEVER wanted to admit it and have always denied. 

The whole thing triggers a total existential crisis for me and throws me off track: Everything I have lived for the last few years now seems useless and disgusts me. I read my resume and am disgusted by the stringing together of courses, successes and professional experiences. I feel bad because for the last few years I've always laughed at couples for not getting the rest of their lives together. I feel bad because I've always tied my self-worth to achievement and now I see and feel that that's not actually what it's worth living for. But that it is love that one should live for.

Am I depressed and do I need professional help? My problem is that as a future civil servant I could then have problems with the medical officer and then no civil service relationship could come about. Do you have similar experiences or tips on how I should best deal with this?",1679407173.0

I have one week of therapy left until i am given the choice to end/contine/intensify therapy, and Ive lately been disheartened by how little they have helped. Something I never discussed with my therapist was that I believe I was sexually assaulted at age 6 by my cousin (11F) back in my home country. As far as I know, no one knows beside me and her, and she seperated from the family a while back as her mother divorced. If they did know, they may have chosen to never tell me in the hope I was too young to remember the event. The memory is so hazy that at times I question if it ever occured. Even then, I like to think of it of had having no effect on my life, but recently the memory has been surfacing more. Ive never looked back on this memory and thought of it as trauma, I have no feelings for the memory at all.

not in the suicidal way (ok maybe a bit). i *LITERALLY* feel like it was against the universe for me to be born and now I'm living a waking nightmare due to going against nature

my dad almost got in a fatal crash years before i was born and my mom had multiple miscarriages before having me

i was born early and when they xrayed me (because i was having trouble breathing) my intestines were tied. i was quickly flown to another hospital and when they xrayed me again i was suddenly fine.

i think this was all a warning sign

here's why i think I'm cursed:

since then i have been sexually abused (exclusively by different family members), emotionally abused, physically abused, neglected, got ptsd from medical malpractice, been abandoned veryvery suddenly by multiple people i have known for years, diagnosed with over 6 different mental disorders (there's probably more waiting to be discovered as well), and lost my stepdad due to a fatal accident on Christmas day 2022. 

since then his entire family has been harrassing us and trying to take his dogs from us out of purely spite. his mom thinks my mom is at fault (he had 100% brain death and my mom gave them the ok to take him off the icu) and she admitted to my mom she's trying to make me more suicidal so that i kill myself not because she has anything against me personally, but because my death would destroy my mom.

all of the stuff i listed has taken place in a span of 9 years. each year i experienced an extreme traumatic event. I'm only 18. i never got to properly experience my teenage years.

other random stuff i need to get off my chest and that also make me feel like I've been cursed:

i have Premenstrual Dymorphic Disorder (PMDD). I consider it the worst out of all the other disorders i have. two weeks out of every month my body and brain torture me. when i was told at 16 im to young to legally have a hysterectomy (the only known cure for most pmdd patients) and i would have to try almost every medication for pmdd before a doctor would consider it i started sobbing. I'm still trying different medications. The current one isn't working well so far.

i also might have to leave the place I've lived for 9 years for another country within the next 2 due to the fact I'm trans and things have been feeling more unsafe in the US as of late. what's especially difficult (and the cherry on top) is that I'm autistic so even minor changes are REALLY really hard. i also have a lot of friends and a community here. it just seems the major life changes have just been ramping up lately. I've been experiencing psychotic episodes lately due to sheer stress.

basically I'm trying to say that whenever something good finally happens and i can rest for a second it gets taken away from me. i can't remember the last time my body wasn't slightly tense actually

i feel like i can't tell my mom or even my friends I've had for years anything. all this trauma has left me not knowing how to emotionally open up. i feel so isolated even in a room of people i love. I've recently become emotionally and mentally unstable with my personality, morals, and behavior completely shifting in a single second. I feel like i can't trust anyone. I feel out of control.

I feel like i have upset the universe with my existence.

(ps don't ask me how my intestines can tie and then untie themselves i genuinely don't know. that's just what I've been told by everyone that was there. also i hope I'm ok to post this here. if not please let me know and I'll take it down. apologies if I'm not very coherent. i hope you all have a good dayüíñ)",1679405617.0

I came home last week and my roommate made a safety plan with their therapist. The names they put down was myself and two of their online friends (not in this country). I got a little bit shocked. I feel very honoured that they feel like I‚Äôm a safe person to come to, but a safety plan is a very serious responsibility and I feel like you should ask someone before just putting their name down.

 Don't wanna bother with details so here's a Quick summary : 

\- I'm 25M and exactly 1 year ago I attempted taking my own life by slitting my wrist from edge to edge with a sharp razor, without going much into details I ended up in coma for 2 days due to blood loss and a very very scary deep 36 stitches scar on my wrist don't ask me how I survived because even doctors think it's a miracle .

\- 3 Months after that I started dating a girl she's a foreign student in my country so she has no family here , we started getting close and spending alot of time together, of course I was always hiding my scar by wearing hoodies and sometimes when it's warm I would wear some sort of bracelets ( a watch wasn't enough to hide it ) let me be more precise I only have that one big scar on my wrist , I don't self Harm .

Abviously one day she noticed and she asked me in the gentile way possible about it and I did not want her to know about my hell living past , I didn't want to bother her with my problems , I cared so much about her feelings n at the same time I was afraid she would leave me after telling her the truth so I had to lie to her and told her it was a car accident ...

&#x200B;

\- Yesterday she found out the truth from a friend of mine and she's not answering my calls or messages , I know I shouldn't hide an event this big from her;  she's the nicest and kindest human being I have ever met in my life she cared so much about me and so do I that's why I didn't want to hurt her feelings ... btw she's reading every message I'm sending her she's just not texting back . I feel so much guilt rn I don't wanna lose such a precious person from my life :\[

\- Any advice would be much appreciated and thank you for reading this far :')",1679353462.0

Just got off call with my gf. Says she hates being on facetime all day with me. You know that feeling when your crush rejects you? yeah that feeling... but way more... maybe 100x more. It's not about facetime, its about the sudden destruction of the foundation of our relationship.

I love listening to her, I'd listen to her until my ashes were one with the earth. I thought she felt the same way, that she just appreciated my presence like she always said, or that she cared. It all came crashing down, of course it did. She doesn't want to be on facetime, okay. She wants a 3 day break, okay. She wants to go hangout with her friends or play one fucking game all day all by herself (i cant play that game).

She can do all that but she tells me that she wants a break. I haven't felt this low in months, just feel like ending it. I'm hooked on some substances, and I'm not proud of it. I'm going to consume them right after I write this post. I was staying clean until just about now, and she has a big part in this.

I cried like a bitch today, never have I felt so stripped of my manhood. I was having a full-blown meltdown, and I admit that it sounds like a small reason, but when you're in a LDR for as long as I am, you don't want the facetime calls to end. It might sound stupid or lame but I'm just depressed about it. Sharing it will help me clear my mind.

In elementary school, I was what you'd call naturally talented. In just about every subject I wouldn't have to even try. Writing? Mathematics? Easy. I would be able to do a difficult writing assignment before recess. Due to this, I thought I'd never have to study, and that knowledge would just simply grapple itself onto me. I'd come home with my report card of just about all A's, and my dad would praise me. My family would do the same, calling me smart, gifted, talented, etc. This, however, was simply untrue. I always thought I'd stay on top, but even as middle school came into reach, I started to realize just how detrimental my situation was. I had started to actually **fail** classes, barely passing math in all three years of middle school. 

This year would prove to be no different. I've been at a constant F all year in math, and I'm on the verge of completely failing my ELA class. Actually having to get used to doing work at home, along with my inhuman feats of procrastination, have been, and are continuing to slowly ruin me. I want to be an engineer, but I've been losing faith in that goal. Everything just seems to be piling up. ""I'll do it in a couple minutes"" turns into thirty minutes, then an hour, then tomorrow, until the deadline hits, plummeting my grades even further. I hate my indecisiveness. On one hand, I just want to give up, just say goodbye and leave. On the other hand, however, I still want to be here, continuing to live. Even so, neither side wants to actually better myself. I want to live and prosper without working for it, and I know that won't work. However, I still want to grow older, and figure out what my life will be like. 

I hate every second of this. I feel like everyone around me at least has some grasp of what they want to do, and they're doing it. Friends that I've thought never did work have been doing so much better than me. I don't want to be left behind, but I don't want to keep dealing with everything around me.",1679377736.0

I tried to get up but I literally could not stand and i immedetly fell over i had to crawl to my bedroom and just layed down wondering what is happening to me I donot know if I should call an ambulanse or somethingifeel so fucking ill Ifeel like Im dying this is the worst I ever felt in my entire life i honestly cant remember what happened but it  probably not a good sign because of my history with a mole i had on my chest a year or so ago it was very black and multi coloured and it bled and clear liquid came out for no reason at times and it was growing fast

this was stupid of me? but i removed it myself and i thought that was it. I used a knife to get rid of the weird bits if you know what I mean. a few months later i then found a large lump ?above my coller bone and it feels lumpy and hard it doesnt, move and it feels like a rock and I just had an idea it is best to just ignore it?i then started having symptoms like loss of appetite and massive weight loss i started getting extreme stomach pain along with really bad back ache i also started throwing up a lot and i couldnt eat anything which caused me to lose even more weight I gagged at the very thought of food i got a very bad cough that still has not gone away along with it being hard to breathe as well and very bad tiredness even when im sat doing nothing recently i got a very bad headache that would not go away even wit the pain killer I started losing my balence  and kept walking into walls and doors it was even hard for me to stand. i was able to hide it at first but it‚Äôs getting dificult and now I cannot hide it anymore i have weakness in the left side of my body not complete weakness but my left side is weak compared to my right I have been having halucintion with voices calling my name constantly And I can see imaginary people but they are sometimes very blury and when I try to approch them or talk to them they disapper your probably wondering why I did not go to the doctors or get it checked well i genuinely thought I succeccfuly removed it and that was that I found that lump but eventually just forgot about it But now Ive realised ive probably fucked up big time because of my adhd  i just kept forgeting and putting it off But now Im probably fucked
i want to get help but whats point It will be far too late by then But then ill just suffer and keep deterierating until i cannot even type words anymore I Have also  noticed I keep getting angry over literally nothing a lot of the times even if someone just looked at me for a second I start screaming at them and insult them.one second im calm and then the next im flipping tables and hitting and scratching myself until I start bleeding and screaming at people I can never remember why I suddenly got so angrybutIt just comes out of nowhere never really thought of cancer before this happened I had my suspicions when I started losing a lot of weight and all of the symptoms I just said. I remembered the mole and then the lump I have but I just thought my immune system, would eventualy get rid of it because im so young it should be able to detect it and get rid of it No big deal but appetemtly that does not seem like the case now, i should call an ambulense i know I should but I feel like its too late now if this is something serious I dont  want to face cancer I am scared of the treatments I‚Äôm scared i will die in hospital with no one around because everyone hates me and wants me dead i was bullied my whole life and my family doesn‚Äôt give two shits about me.andnow I‚Äôm dealing with this fucking bullshit Ive lost so much weight i look like a skeleton But still no one cares i cant eat anything and If I eat I will just throw it back up you know? iwas able to eat a little bit of food a week ago but now i cannot even look or think of food without gagging, I do have to go to my gp tomorow for something I havnt seen the gp for years  i could ask them about my symptoms and if its conserning im just scared I won‚Äôt be able to walk to the gp because I literaly cannot walk now I tried to walk again but I cant do so. i keep falling over i do not want to injure myself further by trying to walk if i tell my parents they will accuse me of being drunk like they have for the past month and when I started losing my balance and stuff and throwing up everywhare but inam literaly am not drunk I hate the drink but they wont believe me why the fuck does everyone assume im drunk? makes me mad so badly i have no idea what to do I do hope this is just a bad dream and I will wake up. is this a dream? It actualy does feel like im dreaming but I can not wake up the world and my surroundings feel strange and not real. I don‚Äôt feel real I might be dreaming but I cant wake up for some reason. i will probably die but im can‚Äôt be caring at this point. im not have a good life to begin with it was just filled with being alone and sadness I just needed to make an account and scream because this is very bad for me coming to this thought? hopefully this is just a big confusion and i have just catched a very bad fever or something  hopefully and it goes away soon. i will probably try and sleep right now hopefully it is gone when i wake up and i feel better

hopefully no one minds my post i just do not have anyone to talk to at the moment and my mind is racing with what has happened

Edit: okay I do feel a lot better now. I slept for most of the day and I went to my doctors appointment and he said because some of my symptoms have gone away, it most likely isn‚Äôt anything very serious. He says he is very concerned about my weight and has told me I need put some weight on. I agreed with him. I‚Äôm just glad it might not be anything very serious.

I have dysthymia, pervasive developmental disorder and social anxiety disorder. As of this moment, I can't see any future in which I can live on my own.

I got out of treatment in 2016 and have been living with my parents since then. Back when I first got out, I had wonderful girlfriend and we'd had plans that involved me eventually moving out across the US to be with her and I get a job as a pizza delivery driver to help save up.

About a year later, I've gotten a new job as a dog walker/pet sitter since it pays better and is a lot more fun. She ends up breaking up with me the day after my 23rd birthday because she hates being apart from one another. This puts a wrench in my plans, but things happen.

In 2018, around 10 months after that, the dog walking company I work for lets me go due to a misunderstanding. I end up self-employed with my first client being a family I worked with before at said company.

I end up meeting this wonderful young lady who I fall absolutely head over heels for. She and I begin dating in the fall of 2018. Work is good, but somewhat inconsistent. Then things start to go downhill.

Two of my clients' pups pass away in the summer of 2019, both of which I absolutely adored. This considerably lowered the amount of work I had as they were the two that needed dogsitting most often. One of them moves away, the other adopt a lovely, adorable pup from a local shelter in November.

Covid then hits. This pretty much screws everything up. I have no work for 6 months straight and my savings dry up. Work slowly trickles back after that point, but it's left a massive scar on both the world and my bank account. My parents are, as always, wonderful throughout this and are paying for my gas and food at this point.

On top of this, my girlfriend broke up with me last spring and a few more of my clients moved away. I'm now down to three clients and it is extremely inconsistent work.

I only have a high school diploma and am unable to focus for more than 30 minutes in any type of learning environment.

I've been in treatment for a long time, trying different medications, therapy, counseling, group sessions etc. I'm one of the lucky people who also got Steven Johnson Syndrome while trying lamotrigine and that was fun. I've been on my new set, Fluoextine and Wellbutrin for about a year (adjusting the dosage little by little) and I have proponasol as an as needed, blood pressure meds that help the physical symptoms of anxiety.

I'm trying, I'm trying real hard but everyday is like higher and higher difficulty. Anyone try out Diablo 3? Know how Nightmare mode just keeps going up and up. I don't feel much relief, I do self medicate with weed and I don't drink at all due to the interactions with my meds and alcohol. I go to the gym 5-6 days a week, 2 hours, as a way to physically force endorphins/dopamine etc into my life. I ""enjoy"" my time at the gym but I also feel that emptiness while doing it.

I work remote, I'm happily married with a supportive partner, I have close friends, and 2 loving pups. Family relationships are a bit rocky but they've always been. I've had depressive episodes and anxiety attacks since I was young, probably before puberty.

Lately my episodes are once a week. And episodes for me are extreme feelings of hopelessness, my agitation and patience get really fragile and every little thing overwhelms me which either makes me panic or try to yell. I feel truly mentally sick lately. Like I have no control whatsoever of normalcy. I'm struggling so hard. I'm not suicidal anymore, a lot of my past therapy focused in on self preservation and the feelings of suicidal ideation. But I also wouldn't care if I ceased to exist.

I need some sort of a relief. Weed is the furthest I'll go in the drug realm. I've tried self-administer programs of rapid eye therapy. I'm not currently with a therapist due to out of pocket costs and the online counselors felt like they were depressing me more.

Every single time I start a conversation with somebody they just seem to be on a whole different planet. They sorta migrate away or make this ‚Äúehh oh‚Äùtype of face. I‚Äôm not interested in anything most seem to be interested in. I realized I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúfun‚Äù person but I love learning new things and book studying day and night.

Sorry for all the extra context I guess‚Ä¶but it will all make sense. 

I was in foster for most of my life before being emancipated and have gone through an absolute roller coaster up to this point. The past three years were the most freedom I‚Äôve had with not having to worry and after meeting my girlfriend she‚Äôs made it all the more better.


Although, recently I moved from my 
basement apartment to stay with my girlfriends family so we could save money and they are super family oriented ( kind of to the point of a wierd complex ya know? ) and love company so I guess at some point her parents just saw me as somebody else in the house. 
 Now her siblings on the other hand and their others just have never really cared for me and with all the family events that go on I feel as though I‚Äôm just stuck with struggling to relate at these everyday constant gatherings while struggling to organize my move the way I want to because it‚Äôs gotten really difficult to save as I have barely anything to my name. Feel as though it‚Äôs me making something happen or nothing will happen so I have been digging my face in my I.T books daily and working part time.



There is A LOT more to it but you get the gist‚Ä¶I feel unrelatable unlikeable and down in the dumps at everything regarding life and my future and don‚Äôt recognize my environment at all. I feel so uncomfortable but can‚Äôt seem to get the means to leave or attempt a short struggle just for relief sigh in the end‚Ä¶just don‚Äôt have anymore energy.

I don‚Äôt know. It gets so stressful here and I hate being so sad all the time. I‚Äôve never wanted a hug so bad.

I'm not getting better. The depression has genuinely only become worse.

I have no desires anymore. I don't want to game, I don't want to write. I don't want -----. I don't want love. I don't want kids. I don't want a future.

I only want to die.

Why won't this pain cease? What horrors did I commit to others that has left my soul so in need of punishment.

When did I become so empty... So devoid of any meaning. I once believed my meaning was for me to craft.

Now I realize I can't craft a thing, I'm useless. Completely incapable of anything other than holding people back or pulling them down into the mud.

This is why nobody likes me. My friends all abandon me, even those who I gave my all for when they were at their lowest. Why should they care though? I'm not worth caring about.

I think the only reason I'm still here is because I'm too scared to hurt someone I care about. But even that is selfish. She'd be better off without me. 

Everyone would be.

I'm such an ugly person inside and out, with no skills. I pretend I'm a good writer, but I'm fucking dogshit. I pretend to write good music, but it's bland and without any fans at all. The proof is in the pudding. 9 views on my last release and I'm pretty certain all of them were me.

I just want to hang myself off a tree that nobody would ever visit, except for maybe a hungry list of animals. At least then I could be of some use to something, as a short term of nourishment.

The only light in this is that with or without my want, one day I'll be gone and then this pointless existence will finally be over.

I go and have fun with friends, and sports, something that has helped me get through the toughest times in my life, helps me now for a certain period of time, but then after the excitement has worn off, I am in this stupid mindset of not wanting to exist in this moment in time again. I just want to be happy again and smile when I look in the mirror. Thoughts like these come in waves, for a week or so, I will be happy I guess, but then I will think myself into feeling like shit again, I don't wanna get out of bed, I don't wanna eat and I don't wanna study, I just want to rest.

This will be quite a long post. No TL;DR. I am totally ok if you don't read my post :)

&#x200B;

I am 23, and will be 24 later that year. I have mental health issues since summer 2021, right after I got my Bachelor of Science. The following  year, I thought it was a burnout issue (the previous uni year was exhausting due to lockdowns and all) and low self-confidence about a very demanding competitive exam I am kind of obliged to attend if I want to get the job of my dreams, notably because there are OBJECTIVELY a consequent amount of participants performing better than me academically. I quickly told some of my family members about my issues. They advised me to see a therapist, and it is what I am doing since then. They all think I am going a lot better for a whole year.

&#x200B;

But in reality, it only got worse over time until just 3 weeks ago. My therapist told me I have symptoms of depressions, but he does not diagnose me with depression because my mood does not stay low long enough. Basically my mood level has become a huge mess: most of the time my mood is lower than neutral but not low bottom, however I have periods of very low mood every 2/3 days that last only few hours, and I have also periods of high mood once a week that also last few hours.

&#x200B;

Maybe you are telling yourself ""you are quite lucky that your very low mood periods last only few hours"", and you are right if I compare myself to a lot of people struggling with depression, but I feel that these few hours are still too much for me. During these hours, I just feel that I am worthless, broken, weak, and that I will no longer achieve anything at life. Until few weeks ago, mad thoughts were even growing inside my brain when I was alone (more precisely, thoughts of screaming and harming people, accompagnied with a sort of feeling of pleasure by thinking about it).

&#x200B;

When I am at my periods of high mood, I have an outburst of self-confidence, I feel like I can lift up mountains and achieve everything, and I am always fooled with the thought that everything is finally solved. Of course, these good moments always end in a matter of hours.

&#x200B;

At least, thanks to my last therapy sessions and some self-reflection, I realized that:

* The job I am aiming at for more than 5 years is still and really the job that makes the most sense to me,
* Even before these mental health issues started to appear, I had a wrong perception of many basic things, and these wrong perceptions were catalyzing the decaying my mental health. For instance, because I started to study seriously at the late age of 16, I thought since then that work was always supposed to be extremely exhausting, hence I thought I was nothing but lazy during days when I did not feel unexhausted (even if I study more than 10 hours almost every day out of vacation since I am 16), and it became a real problem because like every work, I am less and less exhausted by it as I am more and more used to it.
* In order to get better, I really need to move from mother's home and have the job I want for so long (fortunately, this will happen in 4/5 months if everything goes alright in the meantime).

Also, I am still able to think about it in my periods of very low mood.

&#x200B;

About the last point. I still live in my mother's house because I do not have enough money to live on my own. Why not having a temporary job right now? Because I still need to get my Master of Science and this task requires too much time to even keep a part time job. So I have no choice but staying at mom's house until I get my MSc and (then) my job contract next summer. Why is it a problem for my mental health that I still stay at mom's house? Because her overprotective nature prevents me from building basic aspects of life at my age. She always wants to know and control everything about my life at the point it is a struggle to perform most activities (e.g outdoor hobbies, hanging out with people, or even BASIC HOUSEHOLD TASKS) that even a teenager could do if they were living with normal parents. And do not count on anyone to convince my mother to become less intrusive in my life: she is the Queen of Stubornness. Fortunately, I have some sense of resourcefulness when it comes to independancy: I have been able to keep a household clean by myself for 6 months without struggle. So I think the day I will finally move out won't be a problem in the absolute. But OF COURSE I think the exact opposite during my periods of very low mood. I really hate my brain during these moments.

&#x200B;

Nobody but my therapist knows a single thing I wrote above. Especially, I do not want my mom to know it because she went through a 5-year severe depression, when I was a kid, after a terrible event that happened to her (however her overprotective habit is not linked to this event and roots actually from the way her parents educated her), hence I do not want to make her depressed because of my own issues. I also do not want people from my university to know my about my internal struggles because I am scared that it could threaten my future job contract (and thus ruin my last years of hard studying in order to achieve my professional goal).

&#x200B;

But I still needed to share my situation and struggles, so I am here. And thank you for reaching the end of my post.

Most of the anxiety and pain went away as soon as I quit working. But I'm still depressed, with no reason to live. Nothing interests me anymore, and I can't muster the energy even to watch my favorite anime or drama. I can hardly read, so I scan posts on here or on other sites. That's all I could do lately. 

I hate myself. I can't do anything right, and I ruin anything I touch. The ones I care about the most are those that I end up hurting the most. It's a curse, and I want to go away if it means the curse will go away too and everyone else will be better off.

I did not finish college (1st attempt of college we are too poor to pay for my school fees, 2nd attempt I went for a program that doesnt suit well on my aspirations \*reason: relationship,cheaper school fees). That relationship ended when I came to realize I have depression. That did not end well. As for a coping mechanism, I've been playing a lot of games. Hence the typical basement dweller unemployed eldest son. I was like that for 6 years. Then I decided to try fix my life, went to college again for the third time (this time I'm taking a degree on what I've been longing). It was going well, I feel like I'm getting better mentally, also had a girlfriend who's very supportive. Until covid hit, classes were moved online. unluckily my student information wasn't registered by the admin on the system, so i wasn't getting any classes on my end. Was trying to check back on them everyday and demanding them to fix it. Until I got fed up and gave up on it. My mental was about to break, good thing my ex was still there. A year went by, me and my ex were still dating, they recommend me to do a language training course, so I could do vocational training on Germany. I was excited, finally an opportunity, I took the language course. Then the agency I was working with revealed the fees I have to pay (visa fees, processing, ticket, accommodation). I was like holy fuck where do I get this amount of money. I dont have a job. I only live through allowances. 2 years went by. Between those years I tried looking for a job, but there were no takers since I dont have any degree. Tried doing freelancing stuff like transcribing. It pays but only little. Then one day my ex suddenly broke up with me, because I didn't even try to or at least show motivation to go to germany. What can I do, I dont have the funds yet, I was saving so I could pay for the fees. I know it's on me for not trying hard enough, but it seems like everytime I try, an inevitable event that I cant control always happen. Just recently I tried to go back to the language course and finish what I started. Then suddenly a day after I enrolled a transport strike happened and it was for a week + water services are down since they are fixing pipes around my area. I was like wtf GOD WHY ME? And there goes my spiraling down to square one. I tried to beg her to stay, I have lost my dignity. I cant find happiness. I can only cover it with playing games. I have been a burden to her and to my mom. I just want to disappear. And every night I always think of the past, like how I was an achiever back then in High School, and how my life spiraled down. I have suicidal thoughts. I have been searching recently on how I could die. But all I can see were hotlines. I would want to go through therapy. But the nearest psychotherapist in my area is 15km-20km. There's a voice in my head telling me that it's far for a reason, you dont need that, you need to disappear, you are useless, that'll just cost money, you are a burden, you know what will stop you from being a burden, dying.

I‚Äôve never felt so alone in my life. I have had a guy, he messaged me saying how he would be there for me when I was going through tough times. We talked for a while, and I felt like I finally had someone. I shared so much with him. I genuinely had such a fun time talking with him. Just turned out he was 40+ years old and just wanted someone easy and young who could fill out a fantasy his wife couldn‚Äôt . I still talked to him because I am that desperate and sad. 

And I called the hotline, because I know myself. And felt even more like a piece of shit after. There was this one guy, I‚Äôve talked to him around four times. And each time I neared him it was like a relief. He truly knew how to make you feel better, and each time I called and got him I felt safe afterwards. But today, she cut me short and said if I don‚Äôt need emergency services now then call back when I need them. I was talking to her about my plan for today, and yk how it goes.

I still am I guess. And even as I write this in this stupid little Reddit, I know that no one will look at this and genuinely care. I‚Äôve had people who cared about me, but they left. My friends left, my Cresha left. And everyone else doesn‚Äôt care. I just think it‚Äôs so funny how we talk big about mental health, but when you actually are ruining your life because of it. Suddenly your just another piece of shit with a victim complex.

I'm in a rut and have been for the last 3 years.

I was in an awesome job for 12 years and due to a medical illness I was fired at 32 years old (35 now), I was given a pension for the rest of my life. Some may say thats great, but I can't work again or I lose it.

My condition prevents me from driving. I drove once 3 years ago and had a car crash at 80km an hour with my kids in the car hitting a tree and nearly killed us all. This is why I can't drive anymore. 

I have an awesome wife who is succeeding immensely in her job and university, which makes me feel like more of a failure because I'm achieving nothing in her shadow. My kids are straight a students and I'm in their shadow as well.

Everyone tells me to find a hobby etc etc, that does nothing in regards to finding purpose. Purpose is what drives the human experience. A hobby isn't purpose. It's what we do outside of our purpose. 

I'm just stuck and need a vent. Any advice will help. If anyone has been in a shitty spot like this how did you get out of how did you unstick yourself.

I‚Äôve had a few cases of depression in the past which I sought counselling for but only briefly as it didn‚Äôt work out for me but this time feels so much more raw. 

In the last six months my life has kind of been all over the place from graduating university and gaining employment straight out of graduation. This was great and I had an awesome summer surrounded by my friends and partner. However, since entering the autumn my job became unbearable and I felt as if everyday I was just on autopilot. This ‚Äújust getting by‚Äù feeling seemed to be my motto for the next few weeks leading into winter which then became worse due to the unexpected passing of a close relative. I then began to experience extreme anxiety in my life and I second guessed everything I was doing at this time. I turned to alcohol and drugs at the weekend to try and salvage some enjoyment in my life (which really was just a way to numb how horrible I was feeling every week day). I would then wake up on the Monday and the cycle would repeat. 

I decided after the new year to quit my grad job and return to a lower mentally taxing (and paying) job which I did previously during my studies. This was great for the first few weeks however I started suffer economically due to the lower income and higher costs of living (the lovely uk cost of living crisis strikes again). I then started turning back to bad habits at the weekend to forget my main issues during the week and now I feel the lowest mentally that I have ever been. 

I know most of these issues are caused from said bad habits but I fear I have put myself into more of a financial hole than before and that I have a constant dread that I have wasted my life and disappointed my friends and family who were proud of me in the summer and now I fear they may look on me differently.

the problem is: i can't die. not yet.

my parents are getting a divorce right now, and my sister still lives with them. if i died, she'd be all alone. she doesn't tell her friends about what she's going through, and while i'm not at all the role model she needs it seems like i'm the only one she has for this problem. Not to mention if she had to deal with the pain of me dying in addition to my parents grief, she wouldn't be able to handle that.

i feel like i'm dragging myself down further and further the more time i waste but i can't seem to just do the things i need to do to fix my life. the assignments i need to do feel like insurmountable tasks, and the exams i have feel literally impossible. i really don't think i can survive, but i know i have to. that's somehow the cruelest part of this. that i can't even rely on not living as an escape method. i just feel awful and it feels like there's nothing i can do about it.",1679352530.0

334,I hate being disabled and ungrateful,2,11wr3wc,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11wr3wc/i_hate_being_disabled_and_ungrateful/,2,"(EDITED) 

I am disabled but I am lucky. I live in a country where you can get a disability benefit, it is easier to get in some areas than others. 

I live in a easy area. I'm 25 and couldn't keep up with uni or any job because of depression / anxiety / adhd / autism and I swear I tried, I tried so hard that each time I ended in the psychward (3 stays). Since I am not able to work like a normal person I have the right to a) money each month b) workplace amenagements if I choose to ask for them or tell my boss I am disabled. Except for some jobs where you got a privileged access so you have to state it, in other places you have no obligation too. Needless to say that I am very grateful and I know how lucky I am to have that because in most places I just wouldn't have money or help at all. 

But because of that, I am also deeply terrified.

The benefits are given only for a certain amount of time. Since I am young and even if I am neuroaypical I have chances to recover and I'm really trying to. I try everything that is accessible in terms of therapy etc. My stepmother, who works in a place that manages job searching, told me they gave me only two years because ""they don't want young people to get used to be a deadweight for society when they could make their own living"" (thanks stepmom üòä and yes she actually likes me, I hate this mindset. If there is a help system available and people use it, even if there are *some* abuse, I can't believe she sees it this way when she gets to work with disabled people. I find it violent). Since I just dropped of uni that made me really anxious : if I don't look like the perfect disabled person who starts directly to look for a job they're going to cut me off. So I'm searching and sending a few cvs. 

The thing is : I don't feel ready. Going to the post office gives me panic attacks. When I'm outside walking with music I can vividly see me harming myself (which I started doing again and did pretty badly this morning even if I didn't have time), I want to throw up at the idea of going outside (we'll that's not new, I used to have this before going to school or work but not the post office! Damn) and I'm having panic attacks and bursts of sobbing. I said in a manic way that I wanted to off myself because I had to change the bin bag (I scared my cat) and I burst into tears because I failed to roll a cigarette. I take illegal substances to avoid hurting myself to badly because it is unbearable and the ward is pretty useless if I can rest at home, because the psych doesn't take my suffering seriously, verbally abused me and doesn't ""believe"" in na people. I don't see how he could treat me since there aren't any psychologists there and I had to pay for sessions with mine. 

On the other hand, I don't feel I don't have the right to take time for myself because then they're going to think I'm counting on easy money and not help me. Even my mom told me I looked terrible when she came home, and I know the ward is not an option because there are only one when I live, I went there and I was never helped or taking seriously, just miserable. I go to the out-patient facility that this ward depends on and gets therapy that helps me, but that asks a lot of time off work. 

The only job I know with really flexible shifts that is not draining the soul of people doing it I met I could is to be a cleaning lady, which I don't mind to but I don't have a driving licence (covid + meds too heavy to drive that I just stopped) and it's undoable without. I can't give particular classes for that reason (such a shame I was a good student and I'm good at explaining) too. I wanted to help the elderly because I already did so with gardening and computers but I was told I needed to be part of an association that does that *and* have a driving licence. I was told that that requirement was illegal but employers don't care and my area's public transport doesn't allow you to travel between small towns so it's basically undoable, I could ask for things between a biking distance and will give it a try but I was told that as they don't get a lot of funding (obviously) they can't hire a lot of people so were more keen to hire people that can travel in all the department by car which I can't really argue against. 

I tried to open my own online shop and it worked well (between 15 and one time 200e a month, not enough to live on your own but nice to put aside or do something nice) until two months ago. I enjoy creating and discovered I loved making jewellery during my second stay at the ward, and all my friends online and there asked me if I could do pieces for them because they like my style. So I did it. And when I heal enough to manage an activity, I purchased some natural stone buds and made bracelets, I also made cheap ones and earrings and sold them at the fairest price I could. I believe in tarot (you're free not to believe in it) and had 5 years of reading behind me so I did ""donate what you could"" readings to people who also believed in it and got really good feedback as well as some pocket money. 

Two months ago I started being a few days late on shipping because packing stuff and going to the post office was gaving me panic attacks. I tried to push it (and stopped the tarot readings) but the lasts weeks even doing the bracelets was a chore, when wanted to do something jew I would ugly sob amist my beads and do the bracelets trembling. Luckily my last launch was among friends only, because I was so anxious it took me 2 weeks to complete and ship 6 orders I would have nailed in 2/3 days including shipping a few months ago. I almost threw up going to the post office, so I paused the whole thing sobbing has it felt like a failure. A second hand clothing shop with a boss that like me nearby accepted to consider selling some of my creations for me, I have some leftovers and I don't sell for now so I could maybe come with some stuff next time, but it still isn't a lot. 

The only thing I managed to create from scratch and that was giving me a very modest income I made by myself and made me happy was making me miserable. So I took a time off. But I admit it fuels my job hunt related fears. Only my mom and my sister know I've closed temporarily the shop because I know my dad side and especially my step mom would tell me that I would never heal by giving up. But on my experience not doing a break when you need one only led me to very dark places, luckily for them their mental health was always good, or during their low times they never had issues that were not on the spectrum on standard human feelings and reactions so they would just tell me to keep pushing like they always had, or else I was letting the illness win and that I was indulging myself in staying depressed because getting attention because you're sick is comfortable (I wish I was getting attention because I was successful like my brother and to tears, rejection and disappointed faces). I don't think there are win or losses. I think it's something you live with for a given amount of time and you sometimes have to make concessions. I'll reopen on a slower rate, I can't take the speed that is asked of neurotypical persons even by trying my best. 

For this reason I didn't tell them, in fact they didn't call since, I know I should but they don't want to understand at all what I'm feeling (nor by listening to me nor my reading anything about my condition) because they think that will can overcome anything and else you're letting the illness define you, even if you suffer a lot. I know you can't go through life without suffering a bit, but I also know that my amount of suffering over trivial things is not normal. 

They also told me that I was doing myself more harm than good by taking mental health medicine because it was a ""chimical straitjacket"" and that not allowing myself to go through bad events with it for 5 years was not good for me because my brain would not be used to process hard feelings without them after and I needed to train my brain for that. Yeah, I did that for 20 years and I went from straight A student with ambition and one year aboard in one of the best universities of the country I chose to college drop out failing to find a job and not even being able to go out because I've been having issues thing 14yo, has been neuroaypical and struggled socially until my diagnosis at 22yo because I thought I must be able to become ""normal"" (I've improved way more since my diagnose btw) and ended up at the psychward and having to take Valium and cbd through the day to manage them because everything just broke (I wasn't able to handle my days before, it's just no one wanted to listen to me). They also asked me the day my grandma died if I could stop my adhd med that was making me too talkative (I had always been talkative, just not to them because I was too shy) and they hated it while I was happy that I was well enough to share my life with them. So yup. I don't want them involved in my job life or job hunt in anyway. 

I hate being considered disabled because of my depression, anxiety, bpd and being neuroaypical, because even though I am struggling everything and trying hard I know some people can send me back into poverty (I'm already still living at my parents but I help around even if I feel like absolute crap, but they don't want me to pay which makes me feel like a parasite) just because I'm young and they could estimate I am not trying hard enough according to their criteria or want to cut costs. 

I honestly wish I could provide for myself and not be a burden for my loved ones and have them worrying all the time because even though I'm trying and actually working on getting better I always find a new way to feel bad. Like I will improve a bit and get rid of issues and then new issues will pop up or old issues would take a different form. I hate seeing them cry because they feel powerless to help me because I love me and I don't know what to do more. I hate that when I lived alone I would be woken up by the phone ringing if I had gone to bed or stopped being online early at night and had not be present online the next day between 12 and 14 (I am chronically online) because my mom would be worried sick I had harmed myself. I hate when I get shamed for needing rest after doing small things because ""you're in bed all the time"" I am EXHAUSTED hour longs panic attacks are exhausting on the top of outside stimulation that was already a lot to take with the autism. 

Also edit but to clarify I am nevertheless looking for a job or a ""civic service"" (500e/month for a full time position, for young people or less young but disabled people), but it's super hard because my area is, excluding ultramarine territories who are suffering really bad from poverty, the area with the highest unemployment rate and in the top 20 (out of almost 100) areas with the more poor people, which is probably why it's easier to get the help. Job hunting is hard because the positions are really scarce and people wanting them a lot. For position who need no qualification, the unemployment rate and poverty rate are enough to explain. But I'm also looking to be a public servant, which I can access without the test thanks to my disability, and ""concurrents"" are numerous because many people want to work in my area given it's one of the cheapest to live in given the proximity to the sea and Spain. Due to the touristic nature of the area there are also a lot of jobs where insane day lengths are asked during the summer and even thought they are legally obliged to consider my application, if you have to choose between one motivated employee that can do the full days and one who can't it's logical they don't choose me. I asked shops if they were taking people for the summer but they don't, the only people who do are restaurants and when I asked last year some tenants mocked me because I look young and awkward, and now that I have a few friends who tried it I crossed it on the list of potential jobs. I would go crazy. 

I want to be better. At least it's working a bit, my therapists are saying they see I'm invested in getting better and taking the right decisions for it (well, except for the abuse) but I need more time than they leave me... I dropped out but was still studying when I was granted it so they knew one year would be used studying, so it leaves me only one year to find a job with the benefits and they know how hard it is where I live. 

Also to clarify, even if it's great it's a tad unfair. Sometimes if you manage to work they take it off anyway because ""see you can work"". It happened to one of my friends who was doing better than me and after a three months stay for burn out in the ward because he couldn't manage to be out on sick leave he is now deemed ""invalid"" and has to definitely give up on working in the field that interested him and he liked to work in. 
That's also why I am *terrified*, I want to get better, I want to provide for myself, but I need time to heal and I need to be helped so I can have a job and still time to heal and have enough money to pay for the therapy that helps me surviving. Which they don't care about. I know it's a privileged and most people with mental health issues don't have this chance but I have it but the system giving it is so rigged that everyone that I know and benefits from it is scared at each renewal. 
I can't even move in an area with more job opportunities because then they will take it off, I will need to do without (and so look for jobs without accommodations) for at least six months if they decide that I am elegible for it, because with the exact same file you can get it in an area and not the other. It's very stressful and really limits the agency you have on your own life because you are disabled.
 Even people in WHEELCHAIRS have sometimes have been stripped from it, so imagine mental illness. Until last year you weren't even elegible for it if you were legally married and your spouse had a salary, and if the salary was low the amount of your help would be calculated on their salary, making disabled people extremely vulnerable in cases of domestic violence. 

And my dad family side really don't understand how bad it is for me, I never complain to them and just say to them when I hit a mark, but they say I'm waddling in my depression, playing on it with playing at ""being dark"" because I like thanatology and are limiting myself when I choose my health and are letting my illness define me if I speak about a specific struggle I have. I hate how they deliberately leave me suffer while I'm there because my dad thinks that my suicidal thoughts are stupid because I'm at an age when I can become everything and party with friends and have lots of fun and instead I'm just sad, haunting the house like a ghost and guilt trip me about how lucky I am to be privileged because I had an education and can choose my carri√®re. I know that. I was just suffering so much that none of it sounded appealing enough to me!! And now I am afraid because even with my interest back I am still sick and borderline suicidal and I don't wanna go that hell of a loophole again because it's so scary and painful, I think sadly many of you understand. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. Except maybe the leader of my country who keeps cutting solidarity helps and health expenses. 

I also hate it when people say they wish they could be doing in the ward like me when I am there (I admit that some parts of the stay was good if you go over the fact that I was there because I was a danger for myself and couldn't be out there in the society) or wish they could get paid for doing nothing (even though I get the feeling and once again, I know I am privileged, I told them they could tell their psych and a psychologist that they were feeling really bad and not safe for themselves right now with a plan so they could have a psychward holiday and if they keep it for long enough also be paid to do nothing but they didn't responded or gave it a try) because I really wish I could have the head out of the water just for one day. One once seriously told me to have fun in speech therapy before they left for work, I have no idea of what they think therapy is but I think they might slightly be misinformed, it's weird because I've explained to everyone what my therapy consists in. 

I'm sick of the ""if you wanted to you would"" mindset of some people. I am trying. Very hard. I try to eat good. I go out and walk (blessed that my mom understand that I wasn't faking the difficulty it represented so we often go together), I try to do some exercise which wasn't easy because a med made me overweight (I'm not anymore) and I had to start by doing it the physiologist because I couldn't even clean and do the dishes nor walk for more than 30min without pain. I meditate/do sophrology everyday, between 30min to 1 hour. I am very lonely because all my friends are far (we have a lot of discord vocals) so I tried to socialise in my area (I have only 2 friends but it's okay). Everyone suggested a get a boy/girlfriend so I tried (no results except a free gram of weed and trauma lmao). I started hobbies and even managed to monetize one of them for a while. 

I did talk therapy, CBT, EMDR, musicotherapy (that helped, nice to deal with expressing yourself and interacting with a group, helped tremendously), , hypnose, acupuncture, osteopathie (desperation), I even went to church lmao (I am a non believer but my friends healed that way so I was like okay). Now I still do CBT, art therapy (working on the unconscious and non verbal expression) and dramatherapy (confronting yourself to fears, situations and persons that harmed you through theater play. Intense but I don't regret it). The only thing I didn't do yet is see an addictologist. I even started microdosing truffles (to my great surprise, I did see benefits). I still get told that I don't do enough and that taking meds is the lazy way.

I went a long way. Yet I am not functioning yet, not the way society except you too. I still feel I am unable to face the world. I have nothing against working a bit, so I have a good work experience and can manage by resting the rest of day/week but no one is looking for that, time is going incredibly fast and I'm terrified.

I was in a better place mentally when my first job made a shell out of me. I was on the edge like I am now when I was destroyed by very nice internship (a month at 35 office hours), which is why I am very, *very* afraid. I know that in order to move forward you have to let go of the past and of the things that hurt you, but it's really hard not to worry about it and make a parallel when circonstances are the same. In order to have like an excuse paper I would need to explain deeply the issue with my psych (which I'm going to do because I feel really bad) so I can have a paper proving it but again I feel like I am a lazy coward (what if I found something that helped me recover?) and I am also afraid of being sent to the psych emergencies when staying at home and being outpatient has helped me more than any of the two stays in the only accessible ward under the supervision of a psych that I hate and explained each time to me that enough sport would be *the* cure for my depression (it was in 2021, walking and exercising everyday, it's weird but I keep relapsing, even if I had to reckon that it helped me reconnect to my body) 

I tried to see if I could move in a country I live in and love, but mental illnesses are not considered desibilitating there and health care is expensive (well, Europe expensive but too much for someone planing to work part time), and it's hard to stay if your a foreigner asking for disability help. Another kick reminding you that you can't even ""just move out"" of you don't like a place because society considers you like a deadweight. So much work needs to be done. We're so many experiencing mental illness, but people don't care about making treatment better. 

*Because I discovered most of abled people, even some therapists, believe that you're unwilling to work out of laziness or don't work on self improvement if the results aren't fast and don't match their ideal of how a sick person should behave and heal. Yet they are the one with the power of making the workplace hellish again if I find a job, or send me back into depending on others for survival until I find my way into something just with just a stamp on the last piece of paper of a file I took months to make*. 

I hope I can look at this post in some years and tell myself I did it üôè

Sorry for the long post, I wanted it to be more clear about my situation and the cause and intensity of my fear, and why I'm feeling ungrateful.

I know that even if it doesn't last, I am very privileged. Having something to live, even modestly and accessing health care should be an human right (despite what some people think). I wish everyone who is struggling, in any way of form, peace, recovery and a stable life. If you need to talk my dm are a safe place free of judgement, sometimes I take a bit of time to respond but please bear with me.

 Love yall.",1679337223.0

In all honesty I feel these friendships are not permanent, and are actually receding right now. Even the people I considered family are drifting away. This isn‚Äôt their fault of course, I‚Äôm not particularly interesting (I‚Äôm working on that) and taking into account their lives I‚Äôm not worth it really.

I do accounting and finance and totally there are only 6 modules, but i know deep down in my heart that i am going to fail atleast 3 modules.

Please??? I just hurt all the time and it's never gone away in my life, from earliest memories all the way up to this very moment. Im getting married soon and I'm miserable inside and I hate myself. Why won't it go away? Am I always going to hate myself? I don't know what to do. I can't feel better and I'm just broken or something. It's just constant emotional pain. I almost feel like I shouldn't be getting married because I'm not happy and never have been and I shouldn't be weighing down another person with all my bullshit and problems. I've tried to comfort my child self but I can't associate the child me with the real me. Like I just feel like such a worthless piece of shit. Nothing I do changes it. I also still feel like some of my hurt is invalid, idk why because I know it is, but it makes me feel like a weak little bitch. It's crushing.

Also, my dog is going to die in the next couple years... there have been times in my life where the only reason I didn't kill myself is because I wanted to be around him and take care of him. For a while I thought I was just gonna live as long as he did and then I'd kill myself. I've decided that I wanted to live (I guess) a few years ago, but I still feel like I would t mind if I just got shot in the back of the head.

I work, from home, and make just enough to get taxed and not near enough to even think about living off of. Independence? A pipe dream. Fully reliant on parents for everything.

I had a fianc√©. We broke up, and he refuses to come back to my house and patch things up, which is confusing the hell out of me because he also says how much he still loves me and how oh, it just wouldn't work now, it can't be how it was, it was the right relationship at the wrong time, other assorted bullshit. And I'm the idiot that wants him back because we were so damn happy for years and he promised me how he'd be by my side through any and all shit I face on a daily basis, and I still think we could make it work again. Gullible little idiot I am.

About to go to an online college I can't dream of affording. Going into tons of debt. Getting what degree? English. Ah, think of all the opportunities I'll have when my only skills can be replaced by AI.

I want to write, but I just can't. I've tried publishing and I get rejected every time. So I guess my lifelong dream is something I really suck at. Fantastic.

I have siblings, but they're all too busy for me. Used to be so tight with my brothers but they both have jobs, one of them is in school, they just don't have time for lil ol' me anymore. Little brother gave me shit yesterday about constantly paying for my lunch after church, which I didn't ask him to do, he insisted because he wants to be a ""gentleman"" or something. And my sister?

354,No Supports Left - What do I do?,2,11wnfxs,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11wnfxs/no_supports_left_what_do_i_do/,2,"I have Borderline Personality Disorder and high Anxiety and Depression. Since the beginning of January, I have been in a Major Depressive Episode, moderate. I was off some meds but in the past few weeks have restarted taking them and have started seeing a therapist.

I only have 1.25 supports in my life. I know a lot of people and have friends, but I am a VERY private person and do NOT like to be vulnerable. The 1 is my twin sister. She is my best friend and we have always told each other everything and supported each other. I did not always lean on her for support with my mental health, but about 11 years ago I was forcibly hospitalized for suicidal ideation and a severe eating disorder and my whole family was shocked to find out. Since then, she has been my strongest support. The .25 is my husband of 3 years, together for 6. He is Neurotypical and has never had anyone in his life have mental health struggles, that he was aware of. And I am a whole basket of crazy. He does not deal with it well, so I keep my cards close to my chest and only show them strategically. 

Yesterday was a tough day and I was telling my sister about it. She told me that she can't listen to me talk about this anymore. That on one hand, she wants to hear everything because she is afraid of getting a call that I am in the hospital again, or worse, dead. But on the other hand, it is really hard to hear all of these dark things about her favorite person in the whole world. I told her I completely understood and would scale back and talk to my therapist about things and assured her I wasn't going to commit suicide. 

I cried after we got off the phone, because she was my biggest support. My husband then came into the house and I told him about the phone call and he said that he completely gets it, that my mental health is taxing on every person in my life. 

And now I am just sitting here sad. First, I expend SO MUCH ENERGY pretending to be happy and cheerful and neurotypical. People who I have told that I struggle have been SHOCKED because I am so personable and friendly and outgoing. Again, I do not like to be vulnerable, so I hide my mental health problems very well, it is difficult, but I have had to do it since I was a young child, so I have a lot of practice and cry by myself in bathrooms a lot. So for my husband to say that I tax everyone feels so unfair because I almost never put my stuff on him and he almost never has to deal with my problems and I work so hard to be so cheerful around him so as not to tax him. So clearly the tiny amount he has to deal with is too much for him. And the significant amount I unfairly put on my sister is too much for her.

I have only seen my therapist 2 times, so its not like that's a well of support I can lean on right now, that will take time. 

What do I do? Who am I supposed to talk to? How am I supposed to get through this all by myself? It is too much for just me.",1679329599.0

Not even just that, it's also equally as cumbersome to have to do this while I am talking to someone, I don't know how to define this. I just read a lot into every single thing message someone conveys verbal or non verbal. I hate feeling the wait of my presumptions every time I have a conversation. 

Things weren't necessary always like this. I feel like my brain is so traumatized that it finds it hard to recognize when these simple idiosyncracies do not necessarily mean that I have upset a person or someone does not mean well towards me. At the same time, I feel that within society people have this tendency to not be honest and do everything to avoid stating how they actually feel, which then puts you in this sorta limbo of assumptions. Some people are so dishonest that even when you confront them directly about an issue they still will refuse to be transparent about it. Interacting on a whole is just so frustrating because of this, it makes me feel like completely isolating myself from the rest of the world.

I'm just wondering how I could support her, and hopefully open up to me more, as I've realized that this has been happening for a long time.

I have always thought my friend was quite friendly and really lively. Recently, when I was in a voice call with her, I've found when she's  'friendly and lively', it's completely a facade. Her real self is quite the contrary. She's always tired, drinking coffee to make sure she gets through days and really damn quiet compared to how she's like at school. 

Moreover, I've noticed that while her views of the world are the usual pessimistic, ""Life is pointless."" She also has a strange nuance about it. She always relates life to being sort of 'dream-like' and so, 'What does it matter?' Because of this, a mutual friend of ours suspects that she may go through dissociation and derealization.

Feel free to ask for more information, I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to provide.

389,Anxious of my stepdad,1,11wlk81,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11wlk81/anxious_of_my_stepdad/,4,"I am a 19 year old female and currently living with my mother and stepfather. As long as I can remember, I've always been anxious of my stepdad to the point of fucking paranoia that he will scream at me over something. It used to be even worse when I was younger. He would often scream and slam shit around over the smallest incidents like if I forgot to do a chore or if I left a small dirt spot on a dish. He would often call me stupid, lazy and pathetic for it and that I don't do things the way he does it. Like ok I get it I'm mentally slow and a fucking retard no need to rub it in.  Even if I haven't really even done anything he always acts like I'm just a giant scum of the earth and seems annoyed with me. One result of this is that I would always tend to lie and hide things from him in order to protect myself. I have no idea that whatever I do will trigger him or not. I just feel like anything I do will anger him and cause him to yell at me and cuss me out whether it's rational or irrational that he would. As a result, even if I'm not even lying he thinks I am with little evidence I'm lying causing unnecessary drama. Whenever I did lie or hide something he just thinks I lie because he thinks I enjoy lying and getting away with shit but it's not the case I'M FUCKING TERRIFIED OF HOW HE WILL REACT AND YET HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT He thinks and accuses my personality thinking I'm spoiled, lazy and entitled which I can admit I can be a bit lazy, but how the hell am I entitled and spoiled? He apparently likes to think that I think I know everything when I'm not doing things the way he likes it which is not the fucking case. I tend to constantly be in my room when he's home and I barely come out unless I really need to use the bathroom. I don't even eat much since he's almost always sitting in the kitchen table and I'm extremely nervous to even be seen by him. I don't want him to know that I'm home. I feel like every interaction I have with him just turns into a scream show. If I ever make a dumb or clumsy mistake he yells. I even told him how he makes me feel when he yells and he just says ""well if you stop doing stupid shit and lying and hiding all the time I wouldn't have to get mad and yell idot. I don't give a fuck if you're scared this is all on you so stop blaming me because you're """"scared""""!"" He never cares about how I feel and just thinks I need to stop being so sensitive and scared all the time. Whenever I used to cry from him yelling he would scream at me more to ""stop crying. This is all on you"" So for years I had to force suppress all my anger, hatred, and fear around him then he wonders why I never come out of my room and talk to him. He often would complain how I'm always in my room all day and never come out and do anything besides work and school. I just want to be far away from him as possible. I don't want anything to do with him at all. I don't know if this is what parents should do to their kids and I'm just being overly dramatic or if I'm emotionally traumatized by his emotional abuse towards me. He has never touched me in a sexual perverted way, but he has spanked me with a belt multiple times if I accidentally screw up something or lie or hide something. Though I do have a lot of paranoia and anxiety around him, it hasn't affected my close relationships with others. I do have bad social anxiety and tend to be really shy around people and having trouble making friends, but I've always been a shy kid even before I met my stepdad. The difference was I was still pretty happy and expressive around my family back then. Now, I always tend to hide what I feel around them hence my stiff robotic demeanor. If I show any sign of anger or frustration he'll take it as I'm having an ""attitude"" then it always turns it into a damn scold and lecture when it's literally the last thing I fucking want from him. The only people I talked to about this was my boyfriend and my biological father and that's it. I always wasn't sure if I'm just being too sensitive and whiny since I always see parents yelling at their kids about things, and their kids just tolerate it everytime with not much fuss. My mom doesn't really yell at me, but she always agrees with what my stepdad says. She just says ""your stepdad has done many things for us like taking you to Disney world, buying a house for us, paying the bills and food for us. You should still love and appreciate him"" Yeah, well it's hard to do that knowing all he does is terrorize me. I can't stop shaking. I have gotten to where I just don't know how much longer of this I can take. I am just right on the verge of just packing my shit and just live somewhere in the woods until I can find my own place. I have a part time job to help me save money to find my own place. The anxiety and anger only just keeps getting worse the longer I stay here. I even have occasional fucking nightmares about him. Right now, I'm scared to seek help. I feel like something is wrong with me emotionally, but at the same time I sometimes question if this is normal and I just need to grow up and get over it, or if I actually need help. I feel like I don't even know my own mind or myself sometimes. I'm never sure of literally everything. My parents never understand me, and I've been too afraid to even talk about my emotions with them since they aren't the most emotionally supportive so I stay constantly guarded and never open up. Then they always wonder why I hardly ever smile or show much emotion. For one, I stay guarded and two I often feel so jaded I just stop caring about life and many other things. I feel like I'm just sort of chained up with my mouth shut forced to just take any bullshit that comes to me. There's not really any other place I can go besides work and school. When my stepdads home I always try to call into my job and work long extra shifts to get away from him. They're controlling about where I go how long I can be out to places, so I feel like work is my only other effective get away. I'm sorry if this is long and I'm sure you're gonna keep scrolling, but I really just want to know if I may have some sort of mental illness.",1679325604.0

For clarification this was just a flirty friendship,  we don't live close enough to date or meet just online chat friend. 

Well this person knows I suffer from depression and anxiety.  That isn't new. 
I was having a sad day.  And I told a story of how I knew someone a few years ago,  we talked for years that person also suffered from depression.  And how when I was going through a breakup that friend suddenly ghosted me. 

This new friend listened and was sympathetic.  And to be clear,  with both of them,  I did not bother them excessively,  keep texting or complaining. 
Just said I'm feeling a little extra depressed that day and a few sentences about why. 

Now I try to message this person this morning   and just like before,  I'm blocked.

Now I told this new person who I was friend with a few months,  how bad that bothered me before.  So they do the exact same thing. 
Was this meant to hurt me?
Like why would you do the exact same thing someone said traumatized them before?

And like I said the convos were just saying hi everyday and a little about our day. This person had asked me to mention the reason I was sad.  And it was nothing extraordinary.  Just some arguing with family. Didn't go into much detail. 

Why would someone be a friend for months,  then ghost as the previous one , when 1) they already know my mental health diagnosises from the beginning this isn't new
2) they heard the story about being ghosted before and how it affected me

Also it only lasted a day , I went back to normal  texting like hi how are you today :) but didn't get a reply and today I'm blocked. 

Wish type of sick fuck is this?
I really don't want to even try to make friends anymore

Like if they just never answered the message thread ,ghost that would be better

If they just said hey its been nice chatting but I don't think we are compatible that would be fine

And I didn't even over text

What is depression like?

Depression is like...nothing.

&#x200B;

And I mean it.

&#x200B;

The most interesting thing about depression is that you don't get to know you are in the trap unless you come out of it and look back a few months later.

&#x200B;

Depression never hits you, it'll come to you like your loving pet when you're all down and it'll sleep in your lap and it'll stay there until you shoo it away. Most of the time it won't go away no matter how hard you try. It won't leave you!!! For the world it'll look like you're irritated because of something, even better, they call you arrogant for your behavior.

&#x200B;

They don't see the battle you're in. They don't want to see it. They fucking can't see it!

&#x200B;

You won't speak of it because you've tried discussing it with people who were supposed to help you but even they have given up on you. You have given up on yourself. You don't know what to do. What not to do? You know you're in some trouble, sometimes you know what the problem is, you know that issue to the core of it, but that doesn't help. Knowing what the problem is doesn't help!!!

&#x200B;

You've fought the same battle before, but that doesn't help. Nothing helps.

&#x200B;

You skip meals for days yet you don't feel hungry. You don't have the energy to wake up, to engage in anything productive, so you choose to sit on your bed because sleep has left you long back. The only times you get to sleep now is when your body is not able to keep you up when it goes to doze mode, but even that doesn't continue for more than 2-3 hours.

&#x200B;

You are sleep deprived. You are not eating. And you are having nightmares.

&#x200B;

A few weeks into this, people start coming to you, start giving lectures and their fucking advice for what you should've done to avoid that failure. They give advice like some fucking expert. They speak as if they have been through what you're going through. But they don't know a thing about it! It feels like they are accusing you of all your failures.

&#x200B;

They accuse of not trying enough. But they don't know you tried your ass off. You tried whatever you could. You almost killed yourself trying to make it work. But it didn't! It just couldn't work!!!

&#x200B;

Tired of all the people, you start seeking ""the alone"". You start hating people. You make distance from everyone. You want the people who ""understand"" you to call you, to meet you, to talk to you, to help you out of it. But people disappoint. Yeah. They do. Always.

&#x200B;

You realize that ""Don't ever tell anybody anything. If you do, you start missing everybody"" is perhaps the greatest line ever written in any book! You think of suicide but you can't do it. You won't do it! ( and I really wish I could at this point )

&#x200B;

Because depression doesn't let you do anything! Any fucking thing!!

&#x200B;

Retrospection, Introspection, and all other motherfucking inspections don't help you. They never did. They never do. They work in theory. Your situation is not mentioned in any theory. You are not living a life lived by anyone else before. Nobody has any idea about what is inside you.

&#x200B;

You give up. You give up on everything/everyone/anything/anyone.

&#x200B;

Because that makes sense, the only thing that makes sense is ""Giving Up!"".

&#x200B;

And you never know when you are out of it. You don't have any idea when the battle came to an end! It happens one day.

&#x200B;

And then you see someone else fighting the same, and you know telling them that you understand won't help them. You know they have tried.

&#x200B;

And you sit back and think that depression is some mixture of Love and Death.

&#x200B;

Love because you never know when it came to you and when it left you, you are in the trance, and your whole perspective changes. Death because deep down you know what is lost, you know what it means, you know an empty stomach and sleepless nights won't bring it back, but you don't want to believe it so easily. You perhaps loved that lost thing so much! You liked it like anything!

&#x200B;

this is still true, and i can't see myself ever attempting to get my GED or anything of the sort.  but, all my friends are in college and i feel.. guilty for not going to school. i have a job i enjoy that pays the bills and supports my hobbies, but i feel like i'm just doing everything wrong. i feel ashamed that i never graduated, and even more ashamed that i don't have any desire to. i feel like a failure in my family.

it's starting to get hard for me to enjoy my hobbies, and instead i just feel sad and guilty. it's hard and i know none of my friends judge me for it, but i can't help but feel like everyone else does. it's starting to affect me deeply, and all i want to do is stay in bed and rot away, because i don't feel like i am justifying the space i'm filling. i just want to enjoy my personal studies for my own self satisfaction... but i feel so selfish for not contributing to society.

So I've been day drinking and ignoring the doctor's suggestions to cut back on the substances. My body is slowly falling apart, but it was doing that anyway.

I still have plenty of time when I'm sober. And I hate it. If I'm not sleeping, I'm fighting my own mind. And I don't know how to have a conversation about this with anyone. Not my friends, not my psychiatrist, not my therapist, not the volunteers that run all the helplines.

I've been through so much bullshit people don't even believe me anymore. My father abused my mom, and when she ran away, he started beating me. I told the schools when I was six, and they just turned around and told my dad everything I said. He told them I have a vivid imagination, and then proceeded to chuck me off of the roof of our house when, keep in mind, I was six years old. He hit me in the head with a metal bat when I was nine, shot me with a BB gun, tried to stab me, hit me in the head with beer bottles, and coming home from school to see him slouched over with a bottle of pills in his hand thinking he was dead wasn't fun either.

Ultimately became homeless at 12 and worked at a McDonald's on night shift when I did school during the day from 12-18, then stayed at McDonald's until the beginning of 2020 when I finally got a tax job. I could never go to homeless shelters because if the cops find you, they just drop you off at that the border of another state (I won't say which ones). I've seen it to many people I knew during my time on the street.

Now I'm finally away from the worst parts of my life, but the trauma is even worse. I can't sleep. I can barely breathe. I have heart problems and I'm sure I'm just one bad day away from going into a mental breakdown. I've seen murders, assaults, mutilations and everything else. It's shown me the worst parts of humanities and also that the good parts are extremely few and far in between.

Now that I'm relatively stable, about to both work and do college full-time, I wanted to give humanity another chance to prove me wrong, but I think it's finally pushed me to my breaking point. Europe is having the most deadly war since WWII and everybody's looking at it from a numbers and patriotism standpoint instead of a humanity standpoint. I seriously don't think I can do this much longer.

Update: My grandfather passed away two nights ago after being in the hospital for three weeks. My uncle called and told me that he went in for a mild case of pneumonia. Two weeks after he's admitted, my uncle calls me and tells me out of nowhere that my grandpa's lungs and kidneys both have failed and that he's refusing dialysis. Now that he's passed, I found out that they've set his funeral on a day that I can't be there because my job only has two employees - me and my boss, and my boss is going to be halfway across the country, so there's literally no way I can go to it. I really needed some form of closure, because thanks to being in legal trouble with my dad, we had a restraining order, and he went to my grandmother's viewing and funeral, which meant I couldn't be there. Now I can't be there for my grandfather because nobody consulted me when they were planning the date of his stuff.

The slip and slidal moments are back. They've been gone for about a year or so, but they started again some time in late January. I've always resolved that I would only take my own life if I had a handgun capable of instant death (a .9mm or higher), but last night, I impulsive straight up got out of bed and went to find the knife in my utensil drawer (I only have one knife that isn't a butter knife), and it wasn't there, so after I spent five minutes or so looking for it, I finally came back to reality and spent the entire night sobbing my eyes out.

It's too much. I'll leave nothing behind when I pass and I'm completely okay with that. Nobody would even know what happened, because I've told them that I've been considering moving either to Wyoming or Germany, so if I just stopped being responsive they'll assume that I've moved and stopped ghosting everybody. I have the perfect plan to end everything in a place where nobody will find my body, so nobody would be traumatized by seeing a corpse out somewhere, but so far I've been able to resist. I don't know why. I don't want to be here. I don't want things to get better anymore, I just want to be gone.

This time, I‚Äôm too tired to look for another job even though I‚Äôm unable to perform at this one. I need this for health insurance, but feel like I can‚Äôt get through another day. I work at an office job with a really terrible boss and am trying every day not to quit. 

Has anyone experienced a non-functional bout while working? Were you able to keep your job/get back on track? TIA.",1679288346.0

443,I've been feeling like shit lately,2,11w854s,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11w854s/ive_been_feeling_like_shit_lately/,1," I've been feeling like shit lately. It usually stems from how shitty my life is going. I constantly worry about if I look good enough to get with someone or if I'm just an ugly sack of shit that deserves to be alone. I haven't even held someone's hand before, though this could be somewhat excused by not many, if any, gay guys at the school where I went. 

And when I get the smallest amount of self-confidence in my appearance, I get on Instagram or another social media site and see people who look infinitely better than me and think to myself why anyone would want to be with me when they could have someone who looks like them. I'm not some muscle jock or some skinny white twink you see everywhere on Twitter. I'm not obese at all but the stomach fat I do have makes me feel awful, and when I get motivated to try to actually do something about it I start to question myself if I do get my dream body, somewhat lean but still have a little body fat because I like when guys have some jiggle to them, am I interesting enough to justify someone wasting their time with me? I'm I likable? I don't even know. 

I don't even have a car or a fucking driver's license and I'm a 22-year-old man. Never had an actual paying job either, I've only helped at charities to hand out food to people but no actual job. I'm in no way opposed to working I just can't get motivated enough to do anything but lay in my bed and when I do get motivated to get up, the crushing weight of feeling like I'm worthless and just a waste of space overwhelms me. I play video games most of the day to escape that pain, I still enjoy playing video games but it's taking its toll and I'm afraid I'm going to get numb and treat it like a chore to prevent these thoughts from coming into my head. 

In high school, I took up with a group of friends, but after the past 3 years or so, that group is on its last legs. One of my friends just dropped all contact on social media and the group chat, another fucked over someone else in the group and also dropped all contact,  another one turned into an Andrew Tate conspiracy nutcase and I can't stand what he says the majority of the time and kinda wish NOT to be his friend anymore honestly, and the last two are either too busy with their own life which I respect or can't be bothered to do anything when we try to get together or hang out. always some dumb excuse.

 One thing I REALLY love doing is drawing and crafting together fictional worlds. But when I get to thinking about what I'll do next, I get these periods of ""wow, this is shit. No one is going to enjoy this"" and I get severally unmotivated to continue my work for this project. As you can imagine, this isn't helping my already low self-esteem and self-confidence.

I feel like there is a void in me that cannot be filled, even if/when I get a boyfriend I'm afraid I'll still be empty inside. I have no idea what I want to do with the rest of my life. I'm not suicidal at all but I've been thinking about scenarios where if I did take my own life, would anyone really care? I just feel so alone and feeling alone makes me spiral down even more. I've been getting pains in my chest for a few days. They're not heart attacks, but anxiety attacks? I think. so at least. Whatever they are they hurt. Not an ""oh my fucking god I'm dying"" kind of hurt but a ""wow I'm useless and no one loves me"" kind of hurt, you know? I feel like I'm going in circles. wake up, start to overthink in my bed, get on Twitter, play my Xbox to attempt to keep those terrible thoughts at bay, eat some random ass thing, get in bed and watch youtube or something, go to sleep at like 5 am, and then repeat. 

I know browsing social media and looking at all the cute gay couples and guys who look like they were sculpted by fucking gods is probably one of the worst things I could do but \*sometimes\* it helps. at random points, I'm filled with a sense of determination that I WILL have that one day. And like clockwork, I start feeling ugly and useless, etc, etc. I have no idea what to do or who to talk to.",1679285513.0

I was \*TW\* >!sexually abused!<and mentally abused by older friends starting from that age and since then I have never felt truly happy. I was bullied in school or overlooked as I was never physically or conventionally attractive. I went through an eating disorder. I watched one of my friends spiral into suicide. My ex drank herself to death for years while I just sat idly by, I was bullied by my family for my bisexuality, my best friend throughout middle and high school did her best to constantly replace me.

Despite all of this, I really tried. I got straight A's in high school and managed to graduate with a 4.2, having club participation, and what I thought was a decent friend group. Then college hit and shit hit the fucking fan. I lost all of my friends during COVID because I closed myself off. I made an online friend group that I was basically the older sibling to and lost them from my own stupidity. I barely scraped by with Bs and a few As in my college courses.

In 2021, my mental health spiraled so bad my ex cheated on me despite loving me dearly and vice versa. After that occurred, my life just went downhill. I mulled over them for months while I closed myself off from friends. I fought with a friend and ultimately ended a toxic friendship. Things came to a head as my ex popped in and out of my life, until we finally parted in good terms a month before they found a new girlfriend. That same month, 4 friendships of 3+ years ended, I lost my grandmother (first death in the family since i was 12), and a month after, I lost my great aunt (who was my second grandma).

I have seen this community for a while. I have been thinking about taking my life and that. It was a thought that disappeared for a couple of months, like mid august last year. They came back but I believe that stronger. Since 2021 my life has been like in uncertainity. In my house things with my mom have been weird and she has her own stuff going on. I do care for my family but sometimes i like to think about myself and ending this stuff.

My idea of talking over here is to see if I could talk to someone. People! I don't have the possibility of paying a psychologist. I have been attended by a psychiatrist and I believe the pills they prescripted are not functioning thus my next appointment is on august 2023. IDK if you know but psycologist and psychatrist are different stuff so I don't really have help from them. Many people got spiritual help but I feel so so bad that I don't wanna move from bed. If I move, it's because my mom or grandma needs me for anything; besides that, I don't want to do anything.

My mom has her own situation with suicide plus anorexia and she has been going through some stuff from work. If I talk to her I know that I will do anything but help her. I don't want to say anything to my best friend. I study at the University but I have done nothing the past 8 weeks I believe, many would think within my social circle that I am exaggerating or just being a total vagabond.

I don't want to bother my mom with my stuff, I shall be affecting her much more than what she is currently going through. My dad is not even part of this equation, I have his contact and I talked to him maybe an hour ago and he does not care at all. What scares me the most is that in my house there is some medication without usage that if I lose my conscious mind, would drink and lead to a sleepy death with an overdose.

My best friend lives far away from me and I saw her more than a month ago. I love her so much because maybe she is the only one I could talk about. But she can barely do anything for me. Much of our friendship, since we graduated in 2021 has become virtual. Besides that I got no friends to talk, I am crying right now. My grandma has cirrhosis which is a sickness that has no cure and I know that she'll die maybe sooner and I don't want that.

I can't go to church because I feel so lazy that I can barely do anything. I saw about manifestation and started practicing it but I got sort of disappointed idk. I must be by now tidying up and cleaning my room because when I pass away I want everything to be clean but I am lazy to do so. I had so much plans but i feel very bad, broke, and without hope.

You have to make smart decisions to survive. You have to work and you have to give a shit about the people that are around you. You have to force yourself to try to have fun. Having fun is a chore and so is being alive. I don't know how much longer I am going to have to deal with having a family to call and having people from my past that I should probably talk to or reconnect with but I just don't want to put forth the effort. I don't want to be emotionally attached to other people in any way and I get no pleasure from them. I'm tired of having to buy shit to survive and I'm tired of having to pretend to be happy to be studying something or getting into a field that makes more money, because at the end of the day I don't really give a shit about where I am in life in the next five, ten, twenty years. I don't care about owning a home or getting a pet and I don't care about doing anything or accomplishing anything. They say you only live once but I just don't give a shit. When you die everything just goes black and so everything that you experience in this life is ultimately completely meaningless anyways. There's nothing to gain from life whatsoever.

 There is no real reward for living life and there is no way to enjoy it. You have to force yourself to enjoy it and that's too much work. What is the point in caring about anything? I only care about things for superficial reasons and the more I live on my own in this adult life the more I really think I would rather be dead than worry at tall about doing what I have to do in order to take care of myself and survive. I just don't give a shit but I have to in order to avoid suffering. I have to give a shit about brushing my teeth in order to not experience chronic tooth pain, etc. It applies to everything. There is no point to anything and there is no point in trying to help other people because no matter what there will always be someone else in this world who can also help others in a similar way to caring about that is pointless. I would rather isolate myself from everyone else as much as possible because giving a fuck about other people is too heavy. I would rather not be involved in other people's lives because giving a shit about other people is too heavy of a thing and I don't want there to be any weight in my life. Because if you die than everything you lived for is gone forever and you enter the eternal void of darkness, so why bother getting involved with other people in the first place. 

I just don't give a shit about anything man. It's not worth giving a shit about anything. Having interests and being a novice about anything is just humiliating as it is and I don't know. All of this shit is completely pointless and there's really nothing interesting at all about what happens in the world or living life every day. I mean what is the point? I don't give a shit about love. I don't give a shit about sex. I don't feel a thing when I see an attractive woman. That doesn't give me any pleasure. I don't feel a thing when I accomplish a task. That doesn't give me pleasure. I don't want to talk to my family or my ""friends"" who don't really want to talk to me either because I don't feel positive emotions towards other people and I avoid all feelings of love for anything and that includes people. There's not reason to do anything really. 

Literally every little thing about life is a burden and you are expected to pretend to be happy and caring. Well I don't care and that's not really my choice either. Nothing in this world or in life in general is worth caring about and everything you have to do in life is always a burden, something that sucks out all of your energy. And even getting that energy by going to sleep is also a burden. Having to manage your time and go to sleep at an appropriate time so that you both get enough of it and so that you are well rested by the time you need to be for whatever you have to do the next day is just another example of a burden.

Life is all about existence getting worse and worse as time goes on. Every additional responsibility you acquire makes life worse. And that's all life is, is acquiring more and more responsibilities. Why bother with any of it really? What is the point in giving a shit besides the avoidance of suffering? This is why I don't have any empathy for people who suffer in this world. It's usually your own choices that lead to that suffering and I've suffered a fair amount due to my own bad choices. So if I end up homeless and starving sure that sucks but I will man up and do something about it. I don't really give a shit about anyone who doesn't have food because they spent their money on more expensive shit that they wanted to eat rather than on bare necessities that would provide them with enough nutrition to get through the day. I don't know. But that's all life is, is shit getting worse. You lose your hair, you need to work harder to make more money, or you need to learn about stuff to make money in a smarter way, which is further burdensome in and of itself. There's nothing to be proud of in this world either. There is nothing I could do that I could look at potentially and think to myself wow, I am proud of myself. No, I'll never feel pride for anything because non of it matters. If you accomplish a positive thing the only thing that actually matters is if you avoided suffering because of it. There is nothing to be passionate about in life and there is no reason to be grateful that you are subjected to life in general.",1679285188.0

Ive struggled with anxiety and depression since early elementary school. In the last year i started regularly going to therapy, and found some meds that work really well, and entered a new relationship with a very realistic but optimistic person (26, psych major for counseling and therapy, what a duo lol)
Within the last few months i cant help but feel impending doom. On the days where I‚Äôm okay and my medication helps, i am great.
On the bad days its just exhausting. Ive been with my partner for over a year now, this is the healthiest relationship Ive ever had. I see endgame with him. We‚Äôve had little bumps but nothing we cant work through.
We both graduate in may (grad school for him) and i am just feeling major senioritis. I dont know what to do after school. Work until i die? When i was a preteen i didnt think i was going to make it to 18 so, what now?

Again, the days that are good are good, but some days i just feel that I‚Äôve messed up beyond repair. Ive messed my life up, or I‚Äôm too messed up. My bf shows he loves me and is very understanding, but i feel insecure lately because i just love him so much and i feel like my mental problems will bring him down or make him sick of me. He says its not and that we‚Äôre okay and I‚Äôm okay. The joke is; every time im afraid of ‚Äúmessing up‚Äù our relationship I apologize, and every time i apologize and over explain im like ‚Äúthis is the thing thats messing it up‚Äù i feel that I‚Äôm too messed up to fix, and Im not worth being in a relationship with.

He says he loves me and shows it and i have no reason not to believe him, but my brain tells me I‚Äôm not deserving of that love.
I cannot just act confident and ignore these instincts because i feel stupid for being confident that someone loves me, because i am not worth loving.

We will live about an hour apart during summer and that is stressing me out.
I feel that i am existing just to exist. It is so painful to be aware of my impulsive thoughts and overthinking and anxious attachment style because i know its an issue and theres ‚Äúnothing‚Äù i can do about it, and i feel like being aware of it will just manifest it.

Its cyclical and sickening, i have a weight on my chest and it paralyzes me. I am so afraid of letting myself sabotage a relationship bc its going ‚Äútoo smoothly‚Äùthat i fear i am doing just that. Its so exhausting to be self aware. 
I am on meds that help and in therapy, and i WANT to be better, but i just cant make it go away. Now that im in my 20s im convinced it never will. I feel like a Sim doing my tasks every day just to make it to the next day",1679269400.0

My mother had me when she was 20 (single mother) and met another man who she married and had my 3 siblings with. I never met my biological dad and gre up looking different to my peers. This caused me to be bullied by 4 different groups throughout my teens. I drank and used drugs to cope from 13-20 until I got brought to court and it was a wake up call. I went back to university as an adult, even got a scholarship after undergrad to go to another country but I never really felt confident about who I am or that I had any worth. Especially to women. I had one relationship in my 20s that lasted almost 5 years. I dated someone who I wasn‚Äôt really physically attracted to. I did love her, she had a kind heart and took care of me. I always felt guilty though about not really feeling physical attraction for her. I think subconsciously I must have thought that the only type of love I was worthy of was from someone I would not feel attracted to or my perception that she was not what I felt was attractive meant she was less likely to abandon me. I know how narcissistic and awful that sounds trust me. I‚Äôm just trying to be honest. When that relationship ended I decided that if I was going to date anyone again I must be attracted to them physically in some way at least. 

Fast forward 6 years and I haven‚Äôt been on a date since. I could count on one hand the amount of times I‚Äôve even been hugged since then. All my life I‚Äôve felt invisible to women. I really wanted to meet someone and start a family. I thought ‚Äúmost people meet someone eventually and get married, that will probably happen me too‚Äù, well, it hasn‚Äôt

Now my focus is on trying to figure out ways of managing life with no one there to complement me, encourage me, or think of me for the next 20 years. Which is how it‚Äôs been for most of the last 20. Sometimes I feel so down and sad. It‚Äôs really tough trying to reassure yourself when you get so little validation from others. I feel like I will have to explain over and over to people in the future that I‚Äôm not married and don‚Äôt have a family. It makes my eyes fill with tears because I don‚Äôt know why no women seemed to want me that I showed interest in. I don‚Äôt know if it was looks or personality or my anxious standoffishness. 

I feel resentful when I hear about people who screwed people over and treated people badly while I was growing up now having wives and a couple kids, and the feel like I‚Äôm worthless. When I was younger I felt bad because I felt invisible to girls then too. I don‚Äôt think as people we were designed to be alone but I feel such strong rejection now that I have decided to give up on my hopes of having a family and try to find ways to live alone and be happy. I had the idea that I could donate some of my earnings to children in need anonymously as a way to show love to children. I also want to volunteer somewhere as a way to help I. The community. I really feel like the only way to experience less emotional pain in the future is by limiting the amount of interaction I have with people and keep to myself because when I see others with the things I‚Äôm not able to achieve it gives me deep feelings of sadness.

Mom tells me to study till at least 3 am and wake up by 7, then only I will get admission in good college, so i stay up till then just to satisfy my mom so i barely get 3-4 hrs of sleep everyday. And i just feel so tired of this, i just want all this to end. Even if i decide that maybe i should try to study for atleast an hour, my mind just wanders off somewhere else, i have zero concentration for few months. I keep wishing that i wasn't born and hope that something happens with me so i don't have to deal with this anymore. Also i feel really guilty that my mom spent so much for my school, books, etc and i cant even concentrate for 5 min. I feel bad that mom has spent so much money for education on someone like me, im done with my finals and i have passed those, but the entrance exams for college i keep wishing i fail cuz if i get admission in med college then i will be wasting my 5 years but if i fail mom's gonna be so disappointed in me. Idk i just feel guilty for cheating my mom like that, and i feel so pathetic for feeling like this, since I'm not the only one ""preparing"" for medical.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When I was 8yrs old my parents and I immigrated to another country, so I went to primary school there and then secondary school. You know small town, it was nice. Had friends, and we knew everyone. I did well as a student at the start, was great at maths, etc.. but I don't know but somewhere along the way I got a little bit lazy ie. not doing homework and stuff. I quote my maths teacher ""You're a smart boy who enjoys being lazy"". Which looking back was true. It was like a yoyo effect, sometime I'd do it if I felt like it, and other times nah. My parents would always be after me to read books, I'll be honest my attention span couldn't go for more than 5 pages. I was sportive I guess, and played football any chance I got but sometime it would feel like it was hard to breathe chest pains like. Anxiety! Something that I found out about years later. went to y local gp, and she sent me to do scans and stuff but nothing was wrong. and nothing was said about anxiety. I think it was me worrying about my dad's job and the work permit depending on it, so it was like fear in the back of my head ig.

That was in limbo was a good 2 years. By the time I was 16yr old, finished my(o level) decent marks. around that time my dad's job visa was extended to 1yr, so till the end of the 4th year. 4th years always go on holiday but I couldn't go. They went to Italy. Right after the school year finished within a few weeks my dad's visa ended. He didn't an extension or other offers so we had to leave and go back to our home country. My mom had to leave her job as well. I had to leave behind a life with friends.

&#x200B;

So we go back to our home country. We had to live in the family house with my grandmother and my uncle. It was a fairly big house so we all fit in. My dad owned 50% of the house anyway so no one could say we couldn't stay there. A bit of background on my grand and uncle. My grandma didn't like my mom like at all. Hate would be a suitable word, she would tell my dad that my mom would be at other men or steal from her that kind of thing. She knows how to play my dad when her daughters need money which was a frequent thing even when we lived aboard. My uncle is the elders sibling, unmarried, and still looking for his Jennifer anniston or nothing. He was 50 at the time, fat, unlikeable, and a pervy prick. 

&#x200B;

So when we got back to my home country I had to find a school through the ministry of education, We presented my certificates, letters, and grades. I had already done my O level equivalent aboard but the Education board here just look at it and said we are putting me in 3rd year secondary school and that I would have to redo my o level in years(the 5th year). So I would be losing 2 years. My dad agreed to it because of pressure from his brother saying it would be fine, so my dad didn't say anything, returning to his old pattern. So I went back to school as a 3rd year. It was weird and difficult to fit in as I spoke English my whole life and now I had to speak a different language. The jokes and culture were different. I mean I tried, I really truly wanted to fit in but either I began to feel like an outsider in my own country. On top of that in school I got subjects like chemistry, biology, Eco, and Accounting. Subjects I haven't touched since 1 year of secondary school. So I was expected to pick up new subs and get a passing grade within a few months to move up a grade for the next school year. That's when fear/ depression started. Crying alone in my bedroom. Was told multiple times to suck it up. I was stressed, and on top of that, I could hear/see the manipulation around me. My gran kept planting seeds in my dad's head, and naturally, fights began. I remember seeing that bitch smile when my dad started accusing my mom. She properly enjoyed it. She didn't think anyone noticed but I did. She tried the same tactic with me, giving me money, and attention but when she was called out on it, she began telling me she would enjoy me getting a new stepmother. The joy she would have kicking my mom out. So me being the little shit I am, I began recording her knowing my dad would never believe me otherwise. Showed my dad the recording and videos but nothing he said his mother would do that. But after a while, I think he notices her ways. So he stopped being close. At that point, I was a few days from turning 18yrs old. So I decided I wanted to leave school as I had my O-level and do it as a private candidate for my A-Levels. My parents were behind me for it. The other not so much but I didn't care. I signed up for it and left the school system. I did private tutors for my subjects, which I thought was a good idea since at school I was stuck with shitty subjects, whereas I could choose the subs I was good at. At this point, I stopped speaking at all to my uncle as he would start fights. He didn't believe in the private exam paid for a level. He only believed in the school system. So he'd punch my door, turn off the internet, and stuff. I remember him telling my dad that I would be a disappointment in the future, I would make my parents cry. I would never be able to look at myself in the mirror hating myself etc. I was never going to pass, Why even bother with this as I would fail again and again? 

&#x200B;

At the start, I studied full force but as the fights and words kept coming, I think got to me. I studied less and less. Started skipping tuition. Drinking alone. In my head, I was like ""I gonna fail anyway"" so might as well. So by the end of the year, I did the exam and within a month or so, got the result I failed badly(Ungraded) on three subjects and got a pass on maths. My parents didn't shout and rinse me, they just said to take a few weeks off. then study hard for the next year, try again son. It happens, we all fail. But at this point failing got in my head. Was very depressed, though I didn't show it, I was. My hand started shaking in anxiety, I would black out sometimes randomly. I remember I felt my heart beating, a butterfly in my stomach then I blacked out and fell for a few mins in a supermarket. Still failed the 2nd time. and 3rd. At this point, we moved out of that house and into a small rented apartment. Each year I said I will do better and stuff. Exercise and get fit but never do. Every year. I got a job at Techworld for 2yrs then lost it during COVID. Now I'm 26yrs old. Still ever crushed by fear and depression. Stuck. no friends no life. The one or two friends I had during my 18/19 went to uni, and stopped hanging out. Now they have jobs and new friends. I'm honestly embarrassed with myself. I don't look at myself in the mirror. I don't know where to go from here. I feel like I'm still that kid at 16yr. ANY WORDS OF ADVICE? I understand if you judge me, I am a loser.",1679253816.0

I was cycled off by my physician last year. They were doing more harm than good. (Also have body image issues due to life long criticism by family members/recovered from EDs)

-I am coming out of a deep depression spiral where nothing was appealing to me, not interested in people, hobbies, living, etc. 
I'm finally feeling better so we decided to go out as a family, me, husband, and our 10 year old. We're trying on shoes having a hell of a fun time, until I try on shoes and they decide to roast me. 
-The first pair I tried on, my husband said if I buy/wear them he wouldn't be seen in public with me. He was not joking. Look of disgust included, free of charge.
 Our child decided to make gagging noises at them. 
-The second pair I tried on I was told I would never wear them anywhere because they don't fit my ""sad personality"" and I look like a ""depressed stormtrooper.""
Like WTF. I actually liked both pair of shoes and they fit who I truly am when I'm not hiding. 
Mind you the store was very busy and multiple people heard them say this to me and looked at me with absolutely crushing pity. 
-I know it seems silly to be upset over shoes, but that's not it. I was actually genuinely happy and excited by something and haven't been in a long time.
-Needless to say I have been silent since leaving the store. Like if I can't express myself with the people I'm supposed to be safe and supported by, wtf am I supposed to do?
- I'm trying to not let this knock me off the positive path I'm on now, or be too sensitive about it but it's bothering me a lot.

I even called the suicidal hotline, as I am writing this I am starting to feel the symptoms again but this time I know better. To those of you who are struggling at the moment this might not be much help to you but it helped me today you do not need to stop thinking negative thoughts because the more you try the more it‚Äôll be instead focus your thoughts on something I know it‚Äôs hard but even talking to someone at the moment might help you. Please and I mean please get yourself a therapist if you have not done so I am not a professional but today made me realize how important and intense suicidal thought can be. Your mind is one of the strongest weapons to ever exist and sometimes that weapon may turn against you, but it will not prosper. You‚Äôre mind is very powerful and the things that you go through just proves that, your thoughts are not your reality and if you have not done so I advise you to go on YouTube and listen to Sadhguru he has helped me today.

I'm 25 years old and have been living away from home for almost a year. I'm from Ireland but am living in London after following a big career opportunity, and so far it's going ok. A lot of downs, but a few ups so I guess it's all been balancing out.

I guess I don't really have a segue to saying this, but I don't feel like I can live for much longer. I've no health complications/issues, I'm relatively healthy physically, but mentally I'm not ok. I feel sad and lonely a lot of the time. My family and girlfriend are back home and I miss them so much. I've noticed I've been drinking a lot over the last few months (not always getting shitfaced, but having something to get the lightest buzz) and whenever I visit home I smoke weed most nights. These substances make me feel a lot better than I do without.

I've ticked off a number of things on my bucket list such as see my favourite band live, meet said favourite band, work in my desired career field, find a partner I feel happy with, move out of my parents house, etc. I know my bucket list isn't super exciting or long, but I can't think of anything else to add on to it.

I spend most weekends at my flat, browsing the internet aimlessly and trying to find something to do with my couple of days off. Admittedly, a few weeks ago I'd gone out with a friend of mine for a few drinks and when I was waiting for my train to arrive, all I could think about was ending my life. It just came out of nowhere, I wasn't even feeling sad or helpless, it came into my head and took over - clearly I didn't act upon it. Since then I've realised that I don't see myself living much longer. I don't have a plan for ending my life, but I can't see myself living to 30 (that's only five years away). I struggle to plan for things that are less than a year away becasuse I put so little thought into the future, I just try and plan things day-by-day or week-by-week.

If you were to scroll far enough on my account, you would find the post I made the night C died, and how I felt that night. Overall, I felt fine, purely down to shock. I was not very close to C but if I bumped into her while she was at work, I would stop and say hello, or speak to her during parties. It was a rough time for my family, and very challenging for me to work through due to it being the first substantial death in my family, one that really affected me due to the reactions around me, and the utter guilt I felt from not experiencing grief. She died on the 20th of December, 5 days before Christmas, after falling into a sudden coma despite being overall healthy. The immediate news didn't affect me at all, nor the announcement of her death, but the funeral broke me. I had a panic attack as the curtain was drawn to transfer her coffin into the furnace. The next day, I overdosed.

R died yesterday during a car jumpstart by just simply slumping over, and dying (heart attack). He was revived, but soon took another one and that was the end of his life. He was taken as quickly as C was, Many of my family members believe he died of a broken heart, which makes the entire situation so much worse for me to work through. It would be selfish of me to be upset about his death due to maybe speaking to him once or twice in my life, but when we used to talk about the couple, they were always talked about together, never individually, so for example, ""I'm going to C and R's house."". I haven't really managed to grieve C's death, so grieving R's too is going to be so tough. I'm not nearly as mentally unwell as I was at the time of C's death, so this hasn't pushed me over the edge as far as I'm currently aware, but I'm sure I'll be able to figure that out after the initial shock has worn off

To finish, I am not a religious person, so I can't lean back on the idea that they have been reunited in heaven, however much I would love to take comfort in that idea. I wish I was religious to an extent so that I could have an answer or at least a sense of relief that they're together forever, but it's a cold, lonely world that I live in, and I know that this is the final journey. I know that as soon as C's eyes closed to submit to her coma, that was the last time R ever looked into his wife's soul.

I'll try to summarize the story as best as I can. I (27f) have been extremely lonely and struggling with alcoholism & depression these past 2 years. But actually life was getting better for me and I got a friend group and a stable job. Even as things were going well, I was still struggling with substance abuse so I started going to AA meetings with a friend. I was a month sober and things were going great. However, I had a bad weekend and was alone and had no one to talk with, so I reached out to everyone including my friend and was left with no response. I ended up relapsing and self harming. I really needed to talk about it the next day, so I reached out to my friend and told her what happened. I said over text to my friend ""hey, I had a really bad night last night. I relapsed and self harmed. I really need someone to talk to can you please call me?""

She then responded later saying "" hey im really busy, sorry you aren't feeling well, call another lady in aa""... which I understand if someone is busy but I was sad because if one of my friends told me that, id bring them flowers and talk with them. Anyways, at the next aa meeting, I saw her and she was completely ignoring me the whole night. I ended up finally talking with her at the end of the night and she said she didn't want to be friends anymore, and that I remind her of a toxic person from her past. Her boyfriend told me the next day that she's had a traumatic experience with a boyfriend manipulating her through suicide to stay with her. I felt really bad and apologized to her and started to think my actions were indeed manipulative. I then noticed the next week all of my friends were pretty much ignoring all of my texts. I spoke with my therapist and she said that I was not manipulative, and maybe my friends aren't as supportive as I thought.

Anyways, a few weeks went by and I've been coping by drinking really heavy and hanging alone in my room. Last Saturday, I drank a fifth of vodka and was suicidal. I texted my friend (boyfriend of first friend) and told him I was going to commit suicide. I then cut myself really deep and the cops showed up at my house. I was sent to the mental hospital where I spent a week. I asked my friends to watch my dog, however, only one of those friends actually checked on her and I came home to my room full of piss. My dog was only checked on once a day. I then texted my friends telling them they are horrible friends and to not talk to me unless needed (we are coworkers). Anyways I feel so alone, angry, and upset. I never meant to be manipulative I just needed support. I can't stomach the feeling of my friends thinking I was manipulative bc those weren't my intentions. 

I feel the need to thoroughly explain myself but I don't know if it's worth it. I also am really hard on myself and think highly of my friends so it's hard to grasp that maybe they are bad friends. Is there anything of my actions described that seems bad or manipulative?",1679267564.0

It started when a friend told me to just kill myself, out of the blue. I just got sad then shrugged it off. After that another friend that wouldn't even swear next to me, called me douchebag, straight up. I thought it was weirdly out of character, but shrugged it off. 2 days ago I was talking to my sister about my problems, then I got excited and angry at my problems then started yelling because I was angry at my life. My sister then got angry at me because she thought I was yelling at her. She didn't even listen to whatever I was saying.  


I think these are the sign of change. I think the facade is slowly dropping. I think the rest of the world are player characters that have control over their bodies, and I'm working based on a set AI. I think I do everything right, I reach out for help, I try to help others, I try to be as polite as possible, I try not to be a creep, but everyone seems to be bored of playing by the normal ruleset so now the facade is dropped. The others aren't roleplaying anymore, they don't give a fuck anymore.  


My world is no longer grounded in truth. There is no truth anymore. Everything can be, and possibly is, an elaborate ruse, so people can laugh at me. I gaslit myself for years thinking it will get better if I try just a bit harder. I don't know if I want to continue anymore.

If I told enough people maybe one among many would care a little tiny bit so maybe there may be some shred of hope, maybe some way to get out. so I asked my sister for help, then this.

There's been multiple stages of my life, i'm still a young man i'm only 25, where i've felt i would never live to see that age. I don't want to be a person anymore, i don't like other people. Still other people love me, everyone i work with and meet have nothing but good things to say. Still everyones perspective come from idealized version they were raised, taught, or told to believe and often times from a lens of their own past experiences. I can't do it anymore. I'm alone in society and always have been, and by myself I am nothing. I'd rather be nothing. I don't want to be a misanthrope, I don't want to be anything but nothing. I don't like being human. I'm exhausted with life. I can't even express myself. I live to just be, I just am. I can't even want anymore. I don't even know what it means to want.

My parents had a favorite, my brother. He passed away almost 3 years ago and in the time we have celebrated him more than I have ever been celebrated. Mom and I were watching tv the other day and she remarked that she never had birthday parties growing up. I said neither did I. She disagreed telling me about all these parties until I pointed out that those parties were for my brother and sometimes sister. Then it was the same lecture I got after he died: ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that he was the favorite it‚Äôs just that he had a special relationship with my parents that me and my sister could never experience because he saved their marriage/made them parents/he was the only son.‚Äù My birthday is usually forgotten because it‚Äôs right around Thanksgiving. I had a sweet sixteen that wound up being more of a family party with pink decorations. 
Being the one never chosen has effected me forever. I was such a pick me it must have been annoying. I was chosen first once in my life:by my husband, the greatest person I know. And I feel like he‚Äôs lived to regret that choice. I‚Äôve tried to make life what we wanted but it seems to kick us in the ass at every turn because of me: employment issues for both but especially for me, medical issues on my side, two miscarriages in the last 2 years, living with our families the last 8 years of our 11 year marriage. And he‚Äôs broken I think. 
Now he‚Äôs going back to drinking and watching porn/playing pornographic video games constantly lying about it to me. I beg for his touch and attention but who would want a middle aged fat useless barren wife to look forward to coming home to?",1679244007.0

I feel so stuck in the past, thinking about how I used to be, but I know that person can't exist anymore and I need to find a new path, but I'm not sure I can be content with anything less, I used to draw and create art daily, it was my passion and what I'd hoped would be my career,  I have nothing but guilt for not being able to do it now. 
I want to feel better, I want to get my life back on track, I want to be able to do my art and feel good about it, I want to feel like I can do things by myself again and not feel like I have to be in a relationship to guide me, or make me feel better about myself (if I ever told my ex I wanted to do something like catch a train and explore a town he'd come back with something like ""you'll get murdered"" so I'd just not do it... )
I need to be me again, and I'm not sure how to get myself on track, I'm not sure how to align my thoughts on everything... If anyone has any good suggestions I'm all ears! If not at least writing all this out will probably be a little therapeutic.

[What is it like to undergo depression? How does it feel? How does one deal with it? How important is it to be patient when dealing with depression?](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11vjoj4)

Depression affects everyone differently. Sometimes it's been inside the whole time, waiting to strike at the right moment. Other times it's something that will never really go away because of things beyond our control. This is my summary of how I've been feeling over the last couple months after 10+ years of hurt.

---

I wasn't always like this. I used to dream of using technology to improve the world. Used to spend hours beat mixing albums and organizing / editing photos. Used to see value in working for a pittance. Used to be independent. Some people even say I used to smile in photographs. Not anymore. None of that matters when life feels like it's not progressing at all. **What do you do when everything feels pointless?**

The only thing keeping me going is a close group of friends who do stuff on weekends. Nothing else matters more than having people who will support my struggles, who I'd do the same for in return. **The thought or actuality of losing those friends scares the crap out of me.** I know the only constant in life is change, but **Autophobia is real and hurts so much.**

Now, living at home isn't so bad; rent is cheap, we have family meals, and people are around. However, I can't help but feel like doing the same thing with the same people in the same house for 3+ decades is part of the problem. Our worldly socio-economic policies don't help either, but I know I can't change those so I'm trying not to focus on them too much.

Part of me wants to move out, both to grow and live life to its fullest. However, I'm also deathly afraid of moving out without someone who will help keep my mind grounded, remind me to function, and be there when (not if) I have another mental breakdown. It's not my friends responsibility to watch over me, but I need friends around to help qualm my Autophobia.

All we can do is learn to cope with each passing day. I'm still at home, learning to cope as best I can, all while trying to find the motivation to move forward with life, whatever that looks like. I hope you can find peace in your life too, because we all deserve to live a fulfilling life with as little complications as necessary.",1679257504.0

I really don't know anymore.

Lately my mental health has spiralled completely out of control. I feel really depressed and have experienced my first anxiety attack ever. Ever since I finished my degree I've been financially stressed but kept my just above water. Now this is my first time posting ever, and also I'm just so confussed about everything so sorry if this doesn't really makes sense.

Recently though it feels as if my life is falling completely apart. My wife, the love of my life, and I do LARP with our group. Now, last time we went I got really tired, and we ended up having a fight when we got back home from the event. And that fight became the drop that made my glass overflow. My ex and I broke up after a LARP event because we had a fight and she ended up cheating on me, it wasn't very pretty and has left me with a fear of being left behind and loosing people.

During the last event we went to, my wife's character got engaged to one of our very good friends' character. That on top of the fight, have apparently reignited my fears from my former trauma of the way my ex left me. They have been doing forum rp daily ever since the event so that their characters can get to know each other better; something we generally do in the group, but the added romantic relationship between my wife and friends' characters. At the same time, because of my fears I have started growing slightly possessive and am really working with that issue as well as the other issues I have. We've spent some time apart to try and deal with my fear of not being with her, in case she might leave then, and are currently apart again while she's gone to visit some friends.

During these days however, it feels as if she's been withdrawing from me, not really answering me proberly or outright choosing to not engage with me in regards to any forum play we've been doing or in general, while I know she's been continuing with her own forumplay. My mind continues to make all sorts of scenarioes that scares me and just makes me want to have her in front of me and tell me she still loves me.

My depression and anxiety is growing worse, but I'm also afraid that if I keep communicating that to her, she'll grow annoyed and not want to spend time with me.  
I also have an appointment lined up with my doctor, as that might allow me to get financial aid with some therapy, but that is two weeks off and I feel as if I might crack any moment. I really don't know what to do and just need somewhere to vent. I've begun having these thoughts whether I'd just be saving us both a lot of pain by just running off and cutting ties to everything and starting over somewhere.. It's as if no matter what solution I'm thinking of there's no light at the end of the tunnel and I just have this fear that no matter how hard I try it's going to go wrong and she'll end up growing tired with the hardship anyway and end it..

The only thing that keeps me alive is my guitar and music. Specially Nirvana, Pink Floyd and Arctic Monkeys.

Everything I've had has come to a routine of staring at the ceiling asking myself why am I wasting my ""golden years"" and listening to the same songs on repeat. 

I still can't get over some friendships I lost. It's been 3 fucking years and it stills hurst me how bad we did, she was a wonderful person and I managed to fuck it all up.

I really feel like I'd die if someone didn't tell me to sleep or eat. Not like I care though.

I'm tired of this. Everytime I start getting friends they end up leaving me because i fuck something up. It's just a thing I have to do with everyone, it seems.

I don't live. I just exist. This can't be called living. And I'm so fucking tired of it. Is it so hard to have someone to sincerely love you? God I really wish I had someone to hug but instead my pillow has to replace that ""someone"" that I doubt will ever come.

The few people I can talk to, it is too much for them, and so I'm soon to be looking for a therapist (if my insurance through work  can cover it.)

I woke up twice tonight, in a panic. No other reason except I've been very alone and anxious lately. That's all I can guess as to why. I couldn't stop thinking about being gone. I spent my night crying and hitting myself wherever I could so that I can still work in the morning and it not effect me. It's the first time I've done this and out of anger for myself. I hit hard. I don't think it will become a thing I do but I can't deny it feeling something positive. I feel broken.

Sounds like a great thing preventing it but I cannot stop thinking about how terrified and potentially traumatised the witness's were, literally people that most likely havbt ever seen anything like that. I feel guilty that it even got that far, how did the nurses not see the risk before allowing leave  why were we not told about the risk, what could we have done differently. 

I'm struggling so much with the guilt of having thoes people see that. With the guilt of it getting that far (even tho wasn't my choice or decision). I look at the scrapes, bruises and cuts I have from the concrete. The bruises on my jaw amd chest from their kicks and punches and I can't not see how horrific it was for thoes people to witness. Just sucks how somthing that should be good can really get to your own mental health and can impact you. But I guess that's just part of the job.

My sister is currently on medication due to post-partum depression. She is currently on the following regimen:

MORNING: escitalopram 10mg, alprazolam 0.5mg, multivitamins with minerals

LUNCH: ethnyestradiol/levonorgestrel 30mcg/250mcg (oral contraceptive)

BEDTIME: alprazolam 0.5mg, olanzapine 5mg, melatonin 5mg

&#x200B;

We were able to address her sleeping problem when she developed suicidal ideations 3 weeks on her medication. Is this really a part of her response to medication? We did a follow-up check-up, and mentioned her suicidal thoughts and increasing anxiety. However, she was advised to just continue with her medication. I would like to know if any, among these, is aggravating her condition and exacerbating suicidal thoughts. Should she continue taking them as advised by her psychiatrist?

I don't know how to connect with others, so Ive tried to reach out online. But the internet is an awful place - I reached out for help about being abused after my mom died, and the top response was someone telling me to stop playing the victim. Nothing gives me joy. I have no hopes or dreams for myself.  I can't sleep. I can't cry.  There's this unreachable empty feeling in me.  

My family doesn't care, they just want money from me. Constantly, every week or so, a new request for a few hundred dollars, and the lie that I'll get it back. I watched my uncle point a gun at his daughter, and his son body slammed my cousin, and no one did anything. My aunt was raped and drunk herself to death, and all my family had to say was that she was a lying fool.

No one cared when my cheating father snuck off and married a random lady who to this day sees me as a rival for his love.  Instead I was blamed for my mom's death and asked why I let my dad do these things.

I was a kid. I was a fucking child.

And instead of recognizing that I'm traumatized and need a hug, people instead will shrug and label me as weird. My aunts will tell me to stop throwing pity parties and stop whining. That's all my family has ever done.

664,My mom's boyfriend is making me feel more and more miserable (this turned out to be a huge rant about everything),1,11vhurt,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11vhurt/my_moms_boyfriend_is_making_me_feel_more_and_more/,0,"It's building up inside of me each day, I have to live with them every day of my life, and every day is the same, when he came to this house, my mom said it was a friend that had nowhere to stay and was gonna stay for some days, it's been 2 years, and I can't stand him, he thinks he knows it all, everything that I do, although not to my face, he mocks and talks about it, always complaining to my mom, and then she complains to me, never telling me it was him that complained but I hear them talking shit, he doesn't work, hasn't worked for like an year even though my mom has a huge debt, he's just a parasite living here like it's all his, I don't feel comfortable, I don't have my privacy.

He, sometimes, comes into my room and takes stuff whenever I'm at work, at first it was a doubt of mine, then I started to test it, and I was right, he sometimes takes money, cigs, weed, rolling papers, etc. all of that when I'm not home, without asking. And it's not like he's discret, because, even if it's the last of that thing that I have, he'll still take it, no warning, then I get home, I don't have this thing that I was looking forward to have, even though I'm sure I saved it for later.

This comes piling up for months now, I'm getting worse mentally each day, everyone at working is starting to despise me because I'm such in an angry mood all the time, even though I asked them for a lighter schedule because I was not in the right place mentally, this request was completely ignored, they kept giving me the worst shifts possible, their words being ""we can't give you lighter schedules because we need you here"", well, I sucked it up for months, letting it ruin even more my mental state, I asked them again for it, and they say I'm being lazy, that I don't want to work, that other people aren't complaining, etc. I tried to explain to them, without giving much information, because, tbh, they don't need to know, I tried to explain that it was for my mental health, that I started having anxiety attacks every day when I started to work those hours, even though I've never had anxiety attacks before, and I tried to ask them to not have me do those hours, it led to a big argument and them saying no.

I just can't do anything, It's not that I don't want to do stuff, I just can't. Everyone shames me because I don't have my drivers license, and I've been postponing it for years, and that I'm being lazy, and I need to do this, or that, or I won't go anywhere in life, and that hurts, because I want to do those things, and I try to explain that I want to do those things, I just can't. I don't care that I won't go anywhere in life, because, right now, that's exactly what I want, to not go anywhere in life, I don't really want to die, but I feel like I wanna kms, it's not that I don't want to live at all, I just don't want to live this life.

Although it only got worse these last couple years, I might be depressed since I was, like, 15, when my parents separated, and I never really thought about how much of a trauma it might have caused me, because I never talked about it, never even thought about it, I just completely erased it from my memory until recently when I started to think on everything. that's also when I started smoking and doing drugs, started doing bad in school and the only reason I even stayed at school was because of a girl that I really liked and a couple friends, I eventually left school without completing it, which I now regret and it's making me feel even more hopeless. When I left school, I started working, then I met my ex girlfriend from a friend at work, stayed with her for 2 years, might have been one of the happiest moments of my life, eventually, came covid, we lost our jobs, stayed at home together 24/7, it started go downhill where she'd get mad at me and then I'd start crying, she eventually got diagnosed with depression, started taking pills, she wasn't getting mad at everything but she said she felt numb with them, so she stopped taking them, I never gave my thoughts on this, since I didn't want to control her and I wanted her to deal with it how she felt she had to, even though it meant she being mad 24/7, I think it was somewhere around this time that she stopped loving me, I started feeling it, and it was eating me inside that I knew that the best thing that I had in life was going to leave, I was feeling it for months before it happened, and, stupid me, instead of trying to make things right, instead of trying to make her see why she loved me in the first place, I started feeling hopeless, I didn't do anything, then I'd get mad at myself for not doing anything, looking back, I could've done things way better, but oh well, a couple months go by, covid is ""safer"" now, she said she wanted to start going out with her friends again, and I was actually really happy about it and encouraged it, one day she left for a sleep over, I took her to the door, kissed her and said I loved her, she said she loved me too, then she goes 4 days without talking to me, no calls, no texts, nothing. She then texts me saying that she couldn't come back, that she can't keep doing it and she'd be here in some days to take all her stuff, that happened, I cried, she cried, we hugged, I begged her to stay, and then she left, I was destroyed, but deep down I was actually happy(?) for her, because she could find better. Fast forward 1 year (it was around this time that my mom's boyfriend came to the house), I have my job, I'm starting to feel a little bit better, my ex calls me, says that there's some stuff that she forgot and if I could bring it to her, which I said yes, went to meet her, gave her her stuff and she asked if I wanted to go smoke a joint and talk, because she wanted to talk to me, I accepted, we smoked, went for dinner, and then we were talking and that's when she said that she was hospitalized for 2 weeks and that was her second day out, and as soon as she got out, she wanted to call me and talk to me, she was hospitalized because she tried to kill herself, she overdosed but her mom found her in time and she could make it. When I heard that, I didn't say anything, I just didn't know what to say, and I'm not sure if that made her mad, but I just couldn't find the words.. she talked about it, although, while showing no reaction, I listened to everything she said and I still remember all the words she said. And that was it, we went our ways, as soon as I left, I started crying like I never did before, because, I was one of the big factors on her depression, and not a positive factor, and I'm responsible for it to leading to this, and I'm so glad that she didn't die, that haunts me to this day.. I wanted to stay friends, and she said she wanted to, but everytime I tried to make plans with her she'd push me away and she said that she can't actually be friends because it hurts her, so that's the last I've known of her, I know she's alive because of instagram and I talk to her dad frequently. 

That's about it, I'm a mess, my mental health is a mess and this post is a mess, I just wrote everything that was piling up, and I'm so sorry if this is confusing, if you decide to read this, but, that's the best way I can put this..",1679221970.0

I was officially diagnosed around 3 years ago, but I've been showing signs for over 7. My main issue has always been just being lonely, which I know isn't uncommon but it's still something I've always had to deal with. Everything I've gone through, I've gone through alone with no help from anyone. And I'm tired of it.

I've never had a girlfriend, or really even a best friend. I've had some friends that I could rely on. But I've never met that one person that puts me as a priority as well. Even though I know pretty much everyone else has that click with at least one other person.

Recently, I've met this girl though. She's really nice to me for whatever reason, and in most ways she's just as broken as I am, if not more. Which is sad to say, but at least we can help each other. She admitted to me a few weeks ago that she had a crush on me, although it's a very complicated situation.

She already has a boyfriend. And he treats her like shit. He controls her, blackmails her, and even physically forces her to do what he wants. And she's not lying, I've seen it myself. She tells me that she's completely lost interest in him, and that she wants to be with me but she doesn't break up with him and I don't know why. She says she wants to, but she just doesn't. And I get that maybe it'll take time, but at the same time I don't know how to feel when I see them holding hands and cuddling.

I'm not sure what to do. Because I really do have feelings for her, a lot of them. But at the same time, she's with another dude. And I've made it clear to her that her and I aren't a thing until she breaks it off with him and she understood. But she just won't choose and I'm not sure what to do. 

I'm just afraid. Because i know that my whole life I've had no one. And the first time I've finally found someone, it gives me at least a bit of hope. But I know that if I lose this it's going to be really bad for me. I just don't know what to do. Please someone give me some advice. Please.",1679201227.0

They said they like me too, and a couple days ago they told me they wanted to move in with me and that they love me, but just yesterday they announced that they had a crush on this person they met three days ago. We're not dating, but we'd been in that awkward phase for a long time where we're just friends but we acted like a couple. I tried asking them out a year ago but they rejected me, and since then I've been waiting for them to make the move. Since then, they've been ignoring me more and more, and I've tried talking to them about it millions of times, they apologize, and then do the same thing again.

Been suffering something pretty bad mentally since around 2019, and it's just been getting worse and worse.

  
I don't feel comfortable around my family. I can't tell them anything about me, never felt like I could. My parents would always give me the ""You can come to us whenever you don't feel okay"", but whenever I would, I'd get a lecture along the lines of ""Seriously? Do you have any idea of how Me and your other parent feel? Working 40 hours of week, cooking dinner, cleaning, taking care of 8 kids, and paying off this house? What could You possibly have to be Sad about?"" So I gave up trying to confide in my parents, let alone my family. My brothers were the only ones I was able to really hang a round as a kid, and they treated me like shit. (I don't really entirely blame them, I was a fucking stupid and obnoxious kid who was really inconsiderate. Still though, it didn't help that confiding my feelings was seen as ""Gay"" or ""F\*ggy"" to them, and they'd push me around for ""acting like a girl"". They're nicer these days, but the damage is done already. You know?) My sisters weren't too terrible to me as a kid. They were pretty generally polite to me most of the time, but they had their moments where they could be pretty harsh, and even mean. But definitely no where near as bad as my brothers. My late oldest brother never did anything bad to me as a kid and has always been a good older brother, and a good role model. My other brothers were Really bad, though. There's a lot of extremely deep-routed trauma here, but I won't go into that right now..  


They was the stuff I really dealt with as a kid. As an adult, my parents are constantly pressuring me to find a career to stick to that makes good money, and to buy my own car and move out. They've been on me about it since I was 16. I still don't have my license. I have really bad nightmares and anxiety about driving, I'm terrified of dying or killing someone else in a car accident, damaging my parents or someone elses cars/property, etc. Lately getting some driving practice in has alleviated a bit of that anxiety, but I haven't been able to practice driving in a Long while, so the anxiety is starting to come back quite a bit, and I have No confidence in taking a driving test anymore, so I plan to ask my friend to help me learn to drive. The only problem is that he works overtime practically every week, and I feel bad to take him away from his super rare days off, even though I know he'd set aside a day just for me, like the angel he is.

My biggest problem (among many) is that I have a Really hard time asking others for help. I think it comes down to trust, but only to some extent. The aforementioned friend is someone I trust with everything, but I think my reluctance with him is that I don't wanna inconvenience him on his rare off-time. With my family, I just don't trust them, I feel Extremely uncomfortable around them, and I don't like hanging out with them. Don't get me wrong, I love my family, I do, it's really hard to be saying all this about them, but it's true. I don't like being around them, I don't feel like I can be myself, truly. I don't feel like they like me and only try to get me to hang with them out of obligation, and because I isolate myself in my room 24/7. They always say the same shit whenever they have a get together and I spend most of my time in my room. ""We missed you today, don't you like hanging out with us?"" or in the chance I appear downstairs with them, they try to drag me into their convos or beg me to hang out, or even guilt trip me into it. But what's annoying is, even if I do, they don't ever try to really include me or value my opinion on anything. They always wanna do things I'm not interested in, and they'll think I'm selfish for wanting to do my own thing instead of forcing myself to do something I don't enjoy in order to spend time with them.

My mom reluctantly let our dad give me and my brother our own PC in our room. (He is a super tech-guy. Has worked at a tech company for practically my whole life, is super into testing new gaming shit like consoles, peripherals, PC parts, tech in general. He's always made somewhat decent money, so me and my family were fairly fortunate enough to have a lot of PCs and consoles for gaming and school, so I can't really complain there. He was always very absent when I was a kid cause he worked a lot. I held him in high regards when I was younger cause for the most part, he's always been a nice guy. As of late though, I've discovered some unfortunately bigoted things about him. Him joining in on pressuring me hasn't helped my opinion of him, either.) Eventually, when we were teens, my brother and I got our own PCs, but only He could have his in our room, mine had to stay out in the loft, where Everyone could see and hear me. It was scary and I had No privacy, ever. And despite he and I being in the same age range, my moms excuse at the time was ""He's older"", but even when I reached his age, I still couldn't move my pc into there. Eventually she finally told me ""If I let you move your pc into your room, me and your siblings will Never see you."" Which, yes, was, and still is true. It still Frustrates me that she still hasn't ever stopped to think about just why that is, exactly. It's like she thinks that I'm just being unreasonable, and a bad person by wanting to get away from them.. They just can't see how they're pushing me away until I break and finally say something. But I know if I do, it's just gonna make things SO Much harder for me, even more than they already are.

But eventually, she finally let me move my PC into my room. I still had no privacy cause I shared my room with my brother, and he had just started dating a girl (Who's now his wife), and they constantly wrestled and screamed and fucked in the room while I was in there. It was awkward and embarrassing to have to be around it, but I always tried my best to just isolate myself to my PC and ignore them with Music and Games. (This is funny btw, cause I was Never allowed to have Any girls in my room, but he was. She feigned shock when I told her about what they did while I was in the room. God it seriously fucking pisses me off how comically differently she treated me and my brother.)

My brother moved a few years ago and I finally have a bit of privacy these days, and god, even this teeny, Tiny bit of privacy is so heavenly. I don't have to be around any of them, talk to any of them, or worry about them seeing what I'm doing. (I gotta be careful with my volume and what I say tho, I have an EXTREMELY loud voice that carries way too easily, so even if my door is closed, people can still hear me a lot of the time if I'm not careful.)

Lately, I've discovered myself quite a lot while spending time with friends, or even just spending time by myself. In 2018 I discovered that I was attracted to other men, and in general felt a lot more feminine. In 2021, I started to feel like I might want to transition, but only ever just thought about it. Over that year, I built up the courage to confide in my friends about what I was thinking and feeling. They were all very supportive, and encouraging. In 2022, I got Super drunk around my friends, and basically told them how Badly I really wanted to be a girl. How I had even thought of what name I'd go by, the clothes I had bought to wear, the kind of stuff I'd make about it, etc. It was super out of nowhere, but again, they were super nice, and supportive about it. The next day when I was sober, they talked to me about it, and it gave me the courage to finally go through with it. I identify as a trans woman, and I plan to go through with transitioning when I move out this year. I wanna do it as soon as I possibly can, but I absolutely can Not while I live in this house with my parents. I have no idea how they'd react, but based on some things they've expressed in the past, I don't think it would end well..  


As of late, I've been absolutely Aching to escape. I seriously Never leave my room now, unless it's for the bathroom, work, or food. That's it. I really feel out of place, and like I don't belong around my family. I feel like my autism, adhd, and ptsd have gotten Really bad. Almost everything bothers and sets me off, and a Lot of shit just randomly triggers really bad, painful, or uncomfortable memories. It's gotten to a point where I start to feel a ton of anxiety, and like I'm generally overwhelmed around them. It's really bad, and I just wanna get out of here so I can be the person I desperately want to be. It's not going to just magically make me happy with life or anything, but it will make me comfortable. Comfortable with myself, and just generally comfortable living my life. And that's all I want.  


I can't drive, my friend who can is Super mega busy all the time, and I Really want to get help. Mental help, especially. I need to get out of this house, and I feel like the mental issues I'm dealing with right now are a Huge reason as to why I haven't been able to do a Lot of the things I Need to do, like learning to drive, getting a car, etc. The SUPER Rare times I've built up the courage to subtly confess to my mom that I wanna get tested for Autism or Depression, she Always finds a way to downplay it, or change the subject. She doesn't want to accept that there's something wrong with me. That or she just doesn't want to help me unless it's an immediate medical emergency, or work. I need to get help and diagnosed, because I feel like it might help me Finally do the things I NEED to do to live on my own. I just, don't possibly know how I can. I'm lost, and I'm scared.",1679212261.0

I'm a business owner and I sometimes take other jobs when things get slow. I have plenty of hobbies but no interest in them lately. My job usually has me pretty isolated. It's rare that I'm around people let alone anyone I would have anything in common with. Social media and dating apps provide no results. I hate bars and clubs. I mostly just work now. I can fake it... With social interactions but I don't really find myself in those anymore. I noticed the rules changing in my 20s. You couldn't just talk to strangers anymore. Now it's almost taboo to just walk up and start a conversation. I've had some time off lately, 2 weeks here and 2 weeks there. I can't stay in a book, a show, a movie, a game, I have no interest in my guitar or music stuff, I have other things I've picked up and put down. I recently noticed since I've been off work that a few hours or so after waking up and starting my day I have an overwhelming wave of exhaustion come over me. Yesterday I let it take me but I only napped maybe an hour if that. Whether or not I nap I still have to do a ritual to get to sleep. Tea, melatonin, zzzquil, neck pillow, eye mask, ear plugs, the works. When I'm off I'm located in a small TX Town. I'm not from here. I don't really know anyone and people are really weird. I have no viable way to make any acquaintances or friends. Maybe this is it? I am 37. My parents never had much in the way of a social life, but they did have each other, me and my siblings and the rest of the family. I literally have no one aside from a few relatives and old contacts, all of which are pretty toxic people. This comes and goes but it's been a lot more intense lately. Maybe I'm just not distracted enough? Maybe I just need to go back to work? I have this mindset of making up for lost time because I had a pretty shitty start at life. Am I a workaholic? I've heard the word thrown around but I've never really been sure if it applies to me or not. I go to the gym when I can, I try to do things out in the yard and on a ranch property nearby just to... Idk honestly. I just do it. I haven't had sex in over a year and honestly I wasn't satisfied with my last encounter and she was just kind of not a likeable person. I played the game and got in. That's the other part when it comes to the opposite sex... I have the capacity to play the games but I've grown really tired of them. With people in general it's not often that you can be genuine, with women especially. I'm not sure what I hope to learn by posting here. I thought it may be a good idea. I'm open to some advice.

25f, I'm smart, I'm conventionally attractive, I have a lot of different skills and a knack for music. None of that matters. Seriously. None of it.

I have longstanding mental health issues. Started in childhood, and I've lived with them since. I've been through the usual run of the mill trauma. I had 3 abusive partners, 2 of which severely SA'd me as well as physically and mentally abusing me. The other one was just extremely physically violent and mentally abusive. I've been single now for a year, and obviously have no plans on interacting with anyone romantically. 

I've stayed in a psych ward 3 times. I've been to every kind of therapy you could imagine. I also study psychology and have done for a while, so im very aware of the system, treatment, the process of getting help. I've been through this too many times. 

The main thing that has pushed me this deep into a hole is that despite my mental health issues. I am responsible for my 2 young nieces, as well as my sister, their mother, is incapable to say the least. I am responsible for their wellbeing, I am responsible for my sisters wellbeing, I am responsible for my mother's well being. If I don't constantly hold them all up everything crumbles and chaos ensues.They are all aware of my mental health, but they are all so self consumed and so wrapped up drama and negativity to acknowledge that I might struggle too. I know people are going to tell me I'm not responsible and I shouldn't take on that pressure but I'm telling you, if I did not pour my entire self into those kids and keeping them safe, keeping my mum and sister from fighting, acting like im okay so that they don't make it all about themselves and how I am such a burden, even though I help them more than they have ever ever helped me, then everything would fall apart. Those kids emotionally rely on me. And I am not capable of giving them or anyone else what they need. I have no help, no one seems to listen.

My dad is dead, he's the only man I'll ever love. I can't hold this family together. I can't care for 2 kids when I can't care for myself. I've been through everything too many times. I've been here too many times. I wake up and im devastated that I have to face another day. I don't enjoy the human experience. I never have. I don't want to have to live. It's exhausting and I know shit can get better but then bad times come again, and I just can't do it anymore. I really can't. I relapsed in SH which I hadn't done in a year. I enjoyed it. Because I'm done. 

 I don't have anyone to talk to so this post is just things I need to get off my chest I guess. Thanks to anyone who reads this, it means a lot that anyone would take the time to read my words.

She‚Äôs been struggling for a couple of years. I noticed a lot of superficial cuts on her arms and got her in for a psychological evaluation last summer. She was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and OCD and started Zoloft. It noticeably helped with her OCD symtoms, but the rest stayed about the same. Last month she told me she thought a lot about killing herself was really afraid she might actually do it. She said she comes close sometimes then talks herself out of it. We went to her Dr who sent us to urgent care and she was taken to a behavioral health inpatient program 2 hours away. There‚Äôs no inpatient for adolescents here even though it‚Äôs a decent sized city with multiple hospitals. They upped the Zoloft and added seroquil to her meds, hydroxyzine as needed for anxiety.

While she was gone I did my best to set up outpatient care The psychologist told me she needs to be in an intensive outpatient program after discharge, but there‚Äôs nothing like that here. I found an intensive outpatient program online that involves 3 hours of virtual group therapy 3 days a week, one hour of individual therapy and one hour of family therapy once a week for 12 weeks. So 11 hours of virtual therapy for 12 weeks plus I planned on taking her to in person counseling once a week, and just that was nearly impossible to find. All the therapists and and behavioral clinics here have long waiting lists. I bought safes and locked up meds and anything else that could be a danger. She hates the social aspect of school, but her grades are great and I read that adolescent suicide rates drastically increase during the school year so I told her she could finish the year out online. Her absences this year were off the charts and I thought that would help. 

She came home after two weeks and three days later she told me that she lied about how she felt to the drs because she wanted to come home. She said that was a mistake and that she was really scared of hurting herself. She said I‚Äôd forgotten to roll the dial on the combo lock box after I got her meds that morning and she took the her antidepressants out planning to take the whole bottle but when she texted a friend to say goodbye they talked her out of it. She went back to the hospital last night.

I don‚Äôt speak to any friends and I have no bandwidth to be around people. I am constantly exhausted and have no motivation or energy to do anything. Unfortunately this means that a lot of household tasks have fallen on my mum, even to the extent of her cooking meals for me. She makes me food every day and when she doesn‚Äôt I don‚Äôt eat. Today she being short with me and then exploded with me about how I never help her and I‚Äôm selfish which really upset me and has been on repeat in my head all day, she went out after saying it and hasn‚Äôt spoken to me since. She is also struggling to look after my grandma who has early dementia and is in complete denial about it. She says I‚Äôm selfish for not helping her with my grandma. 
Now I completely understand her frustration at having so many things to do and I know that she is struggling too, but I can‚Äôt help her. I tried to help by not changing my clothes as often and only using minimal crockery to ease some of the workload but I am not able to do anything else rn.

I don't understand how people are maintaining happiness when the world is the way it is. To do anything in life you have to play by the game of a system they set up. Follow rules, policies, fees, penalties, processes, etc. Etc. Etc., Especially if it has anything to do with money. And we all know that these rules etc. don't necessarily come from well intentioned places. 

People look out for themselves, for those they care about, not the vast unknown amount of people. It's become a common method of living for some people, who choose a path of walking on others and using them to raise themselves up. Being sus and sketch and making our system beneficial to the few and only the few. But this behaviour has consequences, of which I see and feel every day. From people living paycheck to paycheck, to more and more people going on services such as food banks, income assistance, etc. It's become impossible to afford living, food prices have raised, gas prices are rediculous, you have to pay to get to work then pay to park to work then work and not make enough to pay for anything. You take extra work, but then you get burnt out, your trying to maintain some essence of a standard of living, but due to rental prices can't afford a safer location. Your mental health just keeps taking hits after hits. You move to help with prices, more bad shit happens that is the exact same. Friends die, your pain increases, your health worsens, people are yanked and pulled out of your life, friend no foe, stress, you yourself start getting diagnosed and have to then pivot to try and manage life. Life feels like a constant fight for survival... How can anyone starting out have any hope of owning a home, affording a family, having a yard for children to play in, etc. Not everyone has families that can buy them houses and help them out. Some people are in this world alone, trying to learn it alone, trying to figure it out alone. Living shouldn't be barely surviving to line the pockets of the people we elect to take care of us. Wake up, work, function, sleep, repeat. Don't get anywhere, don't have anything, just suck it up and take it.

But eventually the functioning slows, putters, sometimes stops altogether. Your mental health and depression is so bad. Fighting for help is even worse. Can't get better unless you pay. Can't pay unless you work, can't work unless your better... There is so much unfair shit in the world. Why do parents even try to keep things fair? They're just going to have disappointed children with trauma from realizing how unfair the world is. No one at the top is looking down going let's take money from the wealthy to help make life more equal and fair. They're the ones telling us you need a pen and then selling it to us because they bought all the pens before telling you you needed one. Covid, now a war, of course because they don't care about human lives more than money and being a dominating economic country. Because money is on the top and that's all that matters bull fucking shit. I'm done not making sense now... The world sucks and it's why I'm depressed and I have no hope that things will get better because it's a constant band aid",1679190302.0

I wanted to ask if anybody was in the same situation and how it played out in your experience. 
I'm about to travel solo for a month through South east Asia. I have travelled alone before but not for that long and not backpacking. 
I struggle with what I call depressive episodes. Not sure if it would qualify as full blown depression but when I'm low it's an unbearable low. 
Now, I don't have anybody really. Family does not live in the same country and don't have much contact to them. No real friends as I don't like socialising and just moved to a new country. I recently resigned from my job which was ultimately the right decision but it took the last pillar of routine from me and given that I'm as lonely as it gets I'm afraid that if I spiral down i have nothing really to come back for, if that makes sense.

And I find it really boring and stagnant, so for the past few months I have been dreading going in there and coming back home feeling drained and unmotivated.

 I am 30yo, without a career, in debt, can barely afford to take my GF out for a date (well, can't really). 

I want to change the field, but all of the worthwhile ideas require an investment to get qualified. 

I feel stuck. I used to have a therapist, but right now I can not afford 2 sessions a month with her. And I was not really ever opening up to her well enough to let her help me to begin with. 

I struggle with talking about my own emotions and feelings and accepting help and support. I was raised to ""handle things"" and ""be a man"" ( yeah, I know.... I'm eastern European, we are not great at feelings)

 Last night we had a fight and she told me that she is tired and can't do this anymore. I can't blame her, I know that I'm a nightmare to live with when I am so tired of living and so bitter about the position I ended up in.

 She deserves better, someone who will be a happy and supportive partner, not a sad burden that can not get himself to a visit at the shrink to get the meds that I know I need. I just can't get myself to do this on my own. Which is funny because I am working full time and very rarely fail to turn up to work or hide from my colleagues how poorly I am inside (only 2 that I became friends with know that I am struggling).

 I only know how to put on a mask and pretend that I'm ok but not how to process how I'm feeling and get better.

 Being a good partner for her used to make me proud and happy, but I have been failing at that for quite a while now. 

Nothing made me feel really any better for quite some time. 

I don't want to die, bit I don't want the life I have and I don't feel like I am capable of getting it to the point where it's worth living.

 Today I packed a rope in my bag when I left for work. I don't know if I can handle going home and making eye contact with her. I feel like I failed at life",1679165562.0

I noticed that my only friend from that time hangs out with the people that bullied me, I haven't seen him for almost a year, most of my classmates from that year all hang out with each other, travel, they do a lot of things together.

I spent a couple of mins checking out their FB, they are all having normal social lives and here I am, all my accounts are empty, I have no one to call, no one to hang out with, nobody cares if I disappear or turn my phone off.

Sometimes I wonder, is it normal for a person to be like this? Your average Joe has friends, hangs out with someone atleast once? twice a week maybe? maybe more, depends on how close friendships are, so what, a couple of times a month...?

There's something that i don't really understand about my situation (hence this post) and i feel like i won't be able to explain it properly.

Basically i oscillate between two moods.  


I baptized the first one Dark sasuke:  
It's a permanent state of deep sadness, i easily cry, i do heavy self-depreciation, I feel like i'm an useless/worthless pile of flesh who'll never accomplish anything in his lifetime, it would be better for humanity if i'm dead, if i'm sent to a psych ward it will be a waste of public money and maybe I'll take the place of someone who needs it a lot more than I do,  Etc etc i think you get my point.  


The second :  
Way less self depreciation, no sadness, I'm calm, i'm more optimistic about my future, and i tend to minimize/doubt the sadness and the suicidal thoughts i had when i was previously in """"""""the other mood"""""""".  


I have no clue about what triggers either mood and there are things that don't change no matter my mental state. Loss of interest or pleasure in most or all normal activities (even meeting my family), Sleep disturbance, lack of energy, etc.

Have you ever experienced something similar to my current situation ? Is there a funny scientific word that describes it ?  If you've ever talked to your therapist about it, what did he say ?

My dad moved away to get a job when I was around 11/12 (major recession and my parents were dead broke at this point). I went from seeing him every day to 2 weeks out of the year. We were constantly being told whether we were moving/not moving, leaving me in limbo if I was leaving all my friends/family behind (we never moved despite putting our home for sale). This ultimately strained my parent's marriage and they got divorced.

My mom tried to commit suicide when I was 14, I read her suicide notes that night and said nothing about it (she still doesn't know). If it wasn't for her friends and my brother she would have taken her own life while I sat in a room hoping she was going to be okay. She spent weeks in the hospital and it was just my brother and I trying to keep it together at age 14/17 but he was never home.

A year or so later my grandma was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia that she fought for 2 years before she decided not to go through chemo anymore and passed shortly after.

My brother was a drug addict, who is now clean from hard drugs but has become an alcoholic. He was emotionally unavailable and impossible to talk to without him getting angry.  I used to look up to him so much. I wanted to do everything he did. I started becoming scared to talk to him, let alone try to get his advice or have a serious conversation.

I fell in love at the end of high school. This girl took all the pain away. She distracted me from the fact that my family had fallen apart. I moved away for school and things came crashing down. She lied to me and broke my heart. This caused my first major depressive episode. I was extremely suicidal for 2 months and depressed for 2 years. One night I was really low, I drank a bunch of vodka and took the rest of my Ativan, I still have no memory of what happened the night...I just woke up. I still want to talk to her during my low points.

Every time I get low I look back on my past and always feel like it haunts me. I have so much regret for some of the decisions I made and things I said to the people that mattered to me. There were so many conversations I was too weak and scared to have that could have solved so many issues. I wish I could go back and re-live my high school / early college years since I missed so much trying to isolate myself.

I'm now in a fairly healthy relationship for the past 5 years. But I've slipped again. My depression has crept its way back and I can't get my past out of my head. My brain wants to isolate and burn down the life I've made for myself.

Am I really happy? Should I just end things so I can try to deal with my shit? I burdened my last relationship with my issues and it almost killed me. Why do I have to feel empty all the time? Why can't I let go of my ex?",1679180130.0

I have zero clue why the good times are avoiding me and it's confusing. I would have a date and it's either hurting me or not happening. I got distanced by my friends and I have nothing, but a father who hurts me with every word his mouth leaves. My mother is never around, trying to cope with her divorce and struggles by having fun on her own. I won't judge her, we talked about this a lot and I enable her, because I am beyond grateful for everything she did for me. Like she was my only parent who has actually done some parenting and raising in my life. My dad is rotten to the core abusing me physically and verbally, doing nothing a parent would do, but oppress me, like I am a slave who is a tool to use for pride and glory. Also he hurt my mother and now divorces my mother because he wants to cut her off from any financial benefits just to mess with her. My dating life is going nowhere. I had a girlfriend I didn't even love, I just tried to somehow get the heartbreak shoved away because I have other things going on. What my father says is catching up to me, he is wrong because I already am a better person by not following his footsteps and be a raging alcoholic. But the facts are facts. I am far behind my peers in many ways. My love life is trash, I am envious of them in a way that I am happy for them, but I can't shake off the bitter feeling I have. I just can't get myself a lover who can make me forget all my problems for the moment I am with her, because she is the only thing on my mind then. I never had friends while others are more connected than organized crime families. I always was alone and the only solution I had was solving it myself, because I can never rely on help, I am alone in this and no one will help and it's the way things are. I suffer while others succeed without any trouble. Others just have everything worked out and have a happy life. I just need to embrace that I am a failure, a nobody who maybe will have a decent job and an apartment, but I will end up with no one to actually motivate me to be extreme and awesome. I have so much to give, but no one to give it to. I can't afford a therapist, I can't digest and turn my mind off. I did nothing right. I have no purpose in life, I not only failed as a functioning person in society, by not having a girlfriend, no friend groups to hang out with, nothing but failure after failure. I should have been an Average Joe and have no unique thoughts, be a slave to fashion and trends, I swear to God I would be happier. I just hope I will be dead the next day. I wish I was never born since I was definietly an accident. I had a feeling none of this should have happened, but now I know why. I should have never existed. I am an error in the system. I wonder how better the world would be without me. I don't know how much I can hold on, but I plan to leave this horrible place and spare everyone from my hideous looks, my awfully odd taste and my annoying personality no one wants. I hope I die soon, because I am waste of life, taking the place away from potential doctors, lawyers and other important people who unlike me, are not disappointments",1679177993.0

My family is awesome. They are mostly doing well in life. They are supportive of me in almost everything I do. And they are almost all I have, I like spending time alone and I honestly don't know how to make friends anymore.

But there's times when I just feel so awful around them, it doesn't take much: ""your hair is a mess go fix it"", then correcting my grammar errors when I text them, taking and spending photos of me when I'm on my phone... It's little nothing done with good intention but I'm a mess, I already feel so worthless I don't want to be reminded of it everytime I speak to them...

I do tell them maybe way more emotional than they should, that it hurts me, that their words stay in my mind for hours without leaving me alone...

And they told me to stop taking everything so personally. ""Genius, I never thought of that!""

I know it's not easy for them either, I mean it's a family thing so I can be judgmental as well.

But it hurt so much.

As for the reason for my tears today: my parents decided to adopt a dog, I'm the only child still at home so they ask me to help find a name for him. It's the year of the U so I picked Ursus, I find it cute and my parents do too.

When we annonce it on the family chat, one of my sisters responded by saying that it wasn't lucky to fall on the year of U. The others say that it was true but there were still other options. It's stupid as hell, but I was so happy for this little dog and that my Idea was liked by my parents. Hearing both my sisters implying that it was not a good name made me feel so bad.

So I tell them: ""I chose this name and we like it, don't be a ass about it"" 

Of course I was way to violent about it. And once again I was reply by ""stop caring so much"", ""we have the right to say out mind without being guilt trip or tell at"" 

And they are right.

I want to respond to protect what little self love I have still left but my mom stops me, keep going will just make things worse. And I only have m'y family so I don't want that.

But now I am alone with nobody to listen and I feel stupid to cry over something like that but more than that I feel hurt.

I wish I could care less, I wish I didn't begin to doubt how cute I find the name Ursus after all that, but I do and I h√¢te myself for that.",1679177715.0

829,Feeling numb,3,11uovdd,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11uovdd/feeling_numb/,0,"I have posted this on the advice community too, I hope this is ok. Please delete if not üñ§

I‚Äôm not sure what I hope to gain from writing here, advice, direction maybe, a sense of belonging - I‚Äôm not sure, but I hope that writing it all down helps. Thanks in advance for reading.

My life feels utterly devoid of meaning. I say that not in a bleak, ‚ÄúI want to end things‚Äù way, but in the sense that I‚Äôm just so completely numb and feel like I‚Äôm just existing, going through the motions, putting one foot in front of the other and totally lost in life.

Some backstory about me: I‚Äôm 31, female and gay. I met the person I thought I would be with forever when I was 21, and we were in a relationship for 6 years. We owned a property, she proposed to me, and I lived near her family and friends - eventually drifting apart from the people I knew. She left me for someone else, which devastated me. I had to start all over again. 

About three months later I met someone else and we eventually moved in together. Our relationship lasted three years, was challenging due to the Covid lockdowns, and was very toxic. There was a lot of emotional abuse and manipulation. We broke up last year, and I‚Äôve had to start all over again for the second time. I now live alone in a tiny apartment with my cat, I know no one in the area and I‚Äôm 200 miles away from my family.

I have since started a relationship with someone I met online four years ago. This time I am very protective of myself, I won‚Äôt be moving in with her any time soon and we are taking it slowly, seeing each other only once a week but texting and calling on and off all day, every day. One of the challenges is that she is on the spectrum (no hate towards people with ASD, I am also neurodivergent, but there are many communication difficulties that it brings, which have been very hard for us both).

Despite my current relationship having good parts, 50% of the time we experience big personality clashes, arguments, bickering, and are completely polar opposite in terms of our interests and outlook on life. 

Some other challenges: over the years I have developed OCD (I have been through therapy and take SSRIs for it, it has now settled to a somewhat manageable state), and I was diagnosed with ADHD two years ago (again, I am on medication and have been seeing a psychiatrist every few months, recently discharged from their care but continuing with medication). I have racked up a lot of debt that I am slowly tackling with the support of my father, who is helping me learn to budget and be more responsible, but it does mean that despite earning a good income, I live a very frugal life with not much to show for the time and effort I put into my job, nor the salary I take home. 

I have a good career and I work hard. My job is my outlet. But when 5.30pm rolls around, I have nothing. Nothing but phone calls from my girlfriend and hours spent playing video games online with her. Recently I‚Äôve found those things aren‚Äôt fulfilling me, I‚Äôm not as engaged, I don‚Äôt always look forward to seeing her or speaking to her like I should - which makes me feel guilty - and deep down I have the feeling that there is no future in our relationship. I find that so hard because I am desperate for a family one day, but my biological clock is ticking, and if I step away from it now I only have to start all over again - which I just cannot keep doing. Every time, it‚Äôs like I lose part of myself. My passion and zest for life has dwindled so much over the years and I just feel empty. All the time. 

On the outside, everything seems fine. I have a good job, I‚Äôm quite attractive, I look healthy and I take care of myself. I have friends at work and I smile and laugh, I go to the pub with them sometimes and have fun. But I have no outside friendships - apart from one, however she lives 90 minutes away, and hanging out is difficult. I don‚Äôt know anyone in my area and spend my work-from-home and off days completely alone. 

The only joy in my life is having an alcoholic drink or smoking weed - both of which I do responsibly and moderately, regardless of your beliefs on the matter (I‚Äôm talking a quick vape with a cup of tea in an evening, alone, with my cat. I‚Äôm very low key and I would never want to jeopardise my work or independence - I would stop immediately if I were to have a family, that is my biggest goal in life). My girlfriend is a recovering cocaine addict though, so my lifestyle is a great source of conflict between us. Despite me never, ever doing anything around her, she has a huge problem with it, and I often feel guilty. 

When we argue recently, I have no emotion. For an easy life, I tend to just agree with her and promise to alter my behaviour, which I have, greatly. For example - I stopped smoking weed for three months to demonstrate I do not have an addiction and that it really isn‚Äôt the be all and end all. However I find it fun, that it genuinely helps me with my mental health and well-being, and have imbibed recently. I tell her every time as honesty is imperative to a healthy relationship, but as I said, I‚Äôd never do it around her nor put her in a triggering situation. 

I just don‚Äôt know what I need to do to feel alive again. I fear that if I carry on as I am I will end up feeling continually more numb, and if I break up with my partner - who, on paper, is wonderful, caring, loyal, kind and attentive - I will be alone forever. I have no idea how to make friends as an adult, especially as I‚Äôm quite nomadic, moving around a lot for work etc.

I‚Äôve been through so much therapy for my OCD, I take meds, I read self-development books and practice mindfulness, I try to do crafts and writing, I open up to my limited friends and family - but nothing is helping.

I just turned 41, another birthday spent working or alone with the reminder that I am another year older and with no purpose. I have tried celebrating my birthdays with people, but it never works out. Planned a huge 16th bday party at a hall with a dj and such, 3 people showed and made it clear they came because their parents said to. They left the first chance they could and I was there embarrassed as the dj didnt even know what to do with almost no one there. My graduation and baby shower, no one showed. I tried to plan a 30th bday and reserved a VIP table. No one came, even when I was offering free drinks. Never had a party or get together since.

Now in my 40's I have realized that I still have no friends. I have maybe 5 contacts in my phone. No one calls or texts. And if someonedoes, it is for a favor and then I dont hear from them again.

I have a boyfriend of 12 years. We are not engaged or married and we have no kids together. I have a son in college from a previous relationship. I am taken advantage of and used as a convenience and bank. I pay for all the extras and rv etc. Even the dogs expenses. He splits rent/utilities and even then waits months to pay me. His friends and family hate me. So have not spent holidays or family events with them in years. His friend text him and told him how much the friends disliked me and i was using his phone when the text came through. His brother got married afew years back and planned a destination wedding. I didnt even know about it till 6 months later when we were at another wedding and someone asked if I was excited about going. I didnt know anything about it. So both my SO and his family never told me. I have not gone to a wedding with him since. If Iwas not good enough to go to his brothers then I wont go to his other families or friends weddings because he doesnt know as many people there.

My parents dont bother with me. My dad is okay, but my mother is toxic. She even told me to not ever have more kids(I only have 1)

My coworkers and boss dont like me. The boss now doesnt even assign me classes to teach even though i have workedthere for 12 years. She doesnt even email me back.

I have tried looking for other jobs, but never get passed an interview.

I have always been nice to people and will help people out. But always get stepped on or forgotten. Apparently I am just not likeable or worth it to anyone. I serve no reason or purpose to be here.",1679167997.0

The above sentence may be simple to understand but when it is used to apply, you may find it difficult. We have no control on the things that continue for example you are born as a boy or girl, sometimes we don't have choices to make but rather one's to accept and move forward. Waiting for something you want in the future is not useful because it will become wishful thinking. We mostly want to satisfy ourselves by doing things that we love but rather we should try to do things that help us improve towards success. Some are born in rich families,some are born in poor families, they don't have control over that, but they do have control over what to do for improvement. Whatever position in life we may be, we should always try to make the best of it. Being jealous of someone else, comparing life with others, expecting all the achievements, these thoughts lead us to be not contempt with life. Some people are having the time of their life and some are struggling, some are trying to get their daily bread while some are trying to heal themselves from injuries. Every person has a choice to make the simple steps towards improvement. As I said, some things are not in control, we have to accept that and move forward by improving us by doing kindness. Yes, we may be unlucky with the lives we have but all we have is now, the unlucky part of life where we struggle but we should accept it and should find the small gaps of happiness that we create. Honestly, from the time we are born we start to compete, crave to achievements, attention, acknowledgement but if you don't get that we push back and feel deprived of happiness. Looking at some perspectives might help, you might have a struggling life but comparing to someone else, you might have a better life and can do so much more to improve that and many things. We end up in difficult situations but how we move forward rather than looking back, being jealous or feeling that you are not receiving good parts of life, will always push us down. Some people don't jave fair life, sometimes life is cruel, sometimes people who don'y deserve great things achieve it and sometimes those who deserve it don't get it. As I said, we are not living a satisfying life but satisfying can be different from personal perspectives. A school boy might be hoping for some good luck in exam, but some other person who is not a school student might be looking for food. Making the best out of what we have is life. Life is unfair, you will be demoralized but accepting it and trying improve is life. Life is unfair, someone who deserves the best things might not get it, but should not quit on improving the quality of things we do for satisfaction. Make the best out of your situation is a must because you have no other option, either do something that makes your life a little bit better, don't refrain the situation you are in but rather create something that makes you happy. Whatever is the problem, you are in it and you cannot escape so try to work around it rather than running away from it. The more you are capable to work around problems and make better things out of the problems you have, the more efficient your life will be. Life is about the situation you have and how you will make the best out of it. Don't expect happiness, you have to create it.",1679167049.0

Tried to rob a bank and locked up with 20 years. Which I was told 10 but they lied to me. He wouldn't be getting out until I was 25 years old. I would have waited. And I was. I took it to have consideration that maybe he did that because he didn't have anyone and the last person he had died so I was trying to understand.. all he had was me and my mom.. my mom obviously didn't want to be with him but I talked and helped him as much as I could.. Talking to him when he was in prison he was the only person who has talked to me the nicest and give me advice more than anybody in my family and talked about God to me. At one point I told him I was modeling so hot topic... He got curious and I guess he called my mom and asked her.. she just straight up told him what it actually was.. porn modeling. I was not expecting her to do that... Before all that happened I sent him a picture of me modeling for ink magazine. Sooner or later he called me back asking about it.. and asking me about it.. I'm getting too curious. So like what do you use. I thought it would be fine cuz I was like it's not like we're blood so you can talk like this it's fine.. and then I guess.. I did say at one point I did see your dick when I was younger on your phone. I was just talking. It just got very awkward.. he eventually told me that he finished five times to my picture. And I was just modeling in clothes. Blah blah blah eventually she started telling me to send more pictures and send more pictures and I was doing it to make him happy. But I was not happy myself and I was very uncomfortable. And I do not tell my mom. It was starting to stress me out so I eventually did cuz I had no one else to after I had breakdown to crisis on the phone. Ever since then my stepdad was talking to me sexually, no more advice no more God, ""a man has needs"" blah blah blah blah. Would I be with him when he gets out. I didn't think it would get that far. And I seen him as a father figure. When I told my mom she was like we're changing our numbers I have a tattoo of being my stepdad together when I was around nine. She was like and we're going to get that covered. That just really hurt me cuz that just means I lost all of that childhood. It was nonexistent. Maybe i said too much I don't know what happened I thought it could speak freely, maybe my mom saying I was doing porn. But my mom was like if he was really a father figure that wouldn't happen when I spoke on it so much. Idk. I just don't think about it sometimes. For a while we didn't tell him that my mom knew too. The crisis lady and my mom's we all made a deal and I said and I was going to say I don't want to talk to him like this anymore but if he continues to want to. We wouldn't talk anymore. So yea. We don't talk anymore. I don't know how to feel about a lot. I'm very confused. He was the only person I felt to connected to until they got sexual and been sexual ever since. What the fuck did I do. The tattoo is still on my body. I just feels like that was dead and my mom was like it's already dead. So I basically had nothing. Nothing. Trying to ignore it but I know it's the truth.

Life insurance salesman. What a fucking joke. Of all the jobs I could've have landed, that definitely hits the bottom of the list.

I wanted to be a chemist, or an engineer, or a software developer. Something interesting, impactful, or meaningful. Something I could really put my intellect toward. But I couldn't finish my degree, and if I went back I would definitely end it. Its such an awful, expensive, and dehumanizing system.

So life insurance it is I suppose. I should be happy. Lots of people in my position would be thrilled to enter a well-paid career, but I couldn't give a shit. I dont want money, I want an existence I don't fucking dread.

Maybe it won't be so bad. But all I feel after landing this job is disappointment. At myself, mostly. If I don't feel any better in a year or two, I think I'll finally do it.

I'm stuck at home with an abusive and manipulative parent. She has told me to my face that she doesn't care about my stress or my depression, and that my best isn't good enough. As soon as I get back on my feet I'm burning that bridge faster than a dry field in July.

Anyway, I'm actually making progress despite her. I had given up on applying to jobs because after about 100 applications and zero callbacks I asked myself ""what's the point? I'll probably just be here forever until I die, either by my body failing under depression or by my own hand."" I started applying again, though. I'm getting a little more traction so far. No callbacks just yet, but some emails saying ""you've made it to round 2"" or ""please complete the following assessment to be considered"" you know the type.

I'm working on getting healthier too. I realized that no matter what happens, if I don't lose a lot of weight I'll be doomed. I've got a lot on my plate right now. My mother yells at me or belittles me almost on a daily basis if I don't do things for her, when she does basically nothing herself lol. I mean, I get it, I'm living here so I should pull my weight, but it's hard to do that when all I want to do is just...sleep, because then I'm not in pain. I'm trying to do the bare minimum things like showering, doing laundry, and keeping my room clean. But the stress of it all is too much to handle, especially when I'm constantly being told how lazy and awful I am by my mother. It's hard to do even the basic things I need to do for ME, let alone for her. But she doesn't care. She told me straight-up, multiple times.

Truthfully, almost all of my problems right now would be solved with money. (This next part is political so if that's not your thing stop reading now.) I'm angry at the world for not having a UBI. If we did, I could have taken the time off work that I needed to recover from my depressive episode instead of basically being sucked into it for an entire year due to having to move back home. It's not my fault I'm depressed. At least I recognize that now; that kind of helps I guess.

I'm poor, I literally have no money. In fact I can barely afford to keep open a bank account due to the monthly fees lmfao. What a dystopia. Anyway, I'm just trying to hang on. I hope I can find a job soon. Until then I'm stuck here with my mother, just constantly feeling like shit and wanting to kill myself. I never felt better than when I moved out for the first time. It solved so many of my problems. I just want to be free. It's not fair that I have to suffer because I don't have money. It's hard to keep a positive outlook when you know that you're one bad day away from living on the streets. I guess I should count myself lucky that I have somewhere to live for right now.

So I woke up and texted my dad if we're all ready to talk. They were delaying this like crazy. I had to sit in their room for like an hour. Which made me believe that they're procrastinating the fight that were about to have. 

That's exactly what happened. It started by me apologizing (I still don't believe I should be the one apologizing. But yknow)  my mom instantly started screaming at me again. Saying how I am a lunatic drug addict for fighting about my mail being open. I started screaming back. 

I started explaining to them the pain that I've been going through for years. And these meds actually helped me. They saved my life. They disagreed. Apparently they know how to read my mind for years or something.

I eventually just got sick of it. There's no hope. So I just started demanding my meds back. They refused. Saying that me getting this angry about the mail situation is abnormal. Literally trying to say that I'm the one in the wrong for getting upset after asking them to stop opening my mail for the 12th time. 

They refused to give me my meds. I kept demanding them back. Etc... I got sick of it and threatened to call the police. My mom screamed some more. I said something like ""these meds have saved me from suicide. And your choices are putting me back on that path of self destruction"". 

For some reason, after I said that, she took it as a threat. And something that I can go to jail over? Then she started saying that she is going to call the police now. 

I got my coat, walked outside, and waited for them. Despite my immense pain from withdraw, I stayed calm. I explained everything to the police. 

They somewhat agreed, somewhat didn't. I think they were just trying to keep an open mind. I kept showing them respect. Didn't freak out, etc.. Basically acting how I usually do when someone isn't literally threatening to take away the thing that saved my life. 

The cops told my parents to give my meds back. They left. I walked in my house. Parents wanted to talk. They said ""you're an adult. We can't stop you"". Surprising that they say this, yet they still disagree with the mail argument and the meds I am taking. 

Basically in that talk, they basically kept disagreeing about the mail thing. They still think that the meds are making me a lunatic for not wanting them to open my mail. I told them multiple times to look from my perspective. If you ask someone to stop doing something, and they continue to do it for a year. Obviously they're going to get annoyed and fight about it more. 

But no. Apparently I'm a crazy junkie for this. But luckily I got my medication back. I eventually just left the discussion and went to my room. Tomorrow I am going to get a safe for my meds. I am also getting a PO box.",1679114661.0

A little background - My relationship with my husband is healthy, but I had a rough childhood with abusive significant others alomg with other things that I'm fairly certain f*cked me up beyond repair. I work in a lab and primarily work independently. We have quadrants of lab benches and the other benches in my quadrant belong to scientists who are in meetings often so I'm alone with my head the majority of the day. I've been in this job for a while now, and listen to music/podcasts all day to keep my mind at bay and up until last week-ish, it's been working great. 

But now I get to work and it's like my anxiety and depression kick into overdrive. As soon as I get home, though, I feel fine. But every day it has progressively gotten worse to the point of an anxiety attack yesterday (thankfully I had my emergency anxiety meds with me so no one at work seemed to notice). I don't know if it's my separation anxiety finding a new route of torment, or something else, but the overdrive is to the point of bringing up every traumatic event I've lived through, every mistake I've made, and situations I've realized I haven't made closure with.

I don't know what I'm even looking for with this post. People with similar situations? What others are doing to cope with daily depression? It hasn't been this bad in years, probably since middle or high school. But all those times something had triggered it. That's not the case here. I can't pinpoint anything. I feel content with life other than the sh*t economy. I can't adequately provide to the extent I had promised to (on what used to be considered median income even 4-5 years ago) while my husband finishes college. He has offered to get an all-season job among other things but I've made it clear that I want him to finish out these last two semesters enjoying his college life and coacing as much as possible. It's just me. I had this idea of buying a home for us to build on and to buy him a truck before his car runs into the ground and whatnot, but this economy has sunk to absolute sh*t to where I can't do that.

Okay I guess I can pinpoint the sh*tty economic situation we're in despite me having a stable income. I guess you just can't live in a one-income household comfortably anymore. I mean, I knew that, but to experience it right out of college isn't something I anticipated. But is financial instability really triggering my depression to this extent??

i am almost fucking 17 and I am still nothing. 

by now, most ppl met so many important milestones by now.  

i torture myself every single day seeing the way everyone around my age is thriving. everyone in my classes seem to be happy. everyone has people that cares about them. 

everyone seems to at least know what their purpose is here. 

 all of my peers seem  to have some sort of freedom.

I've been struggling with depression for a long time, but recently I feel it's taking all I have to just to survive. Midway through last year, I accepted that I'd have to leave a job I loved in an area I enjoyed living in because I couldn't find anything to feasibly rent. I had to move back to the Midwest, back in with my mother. While I'm grateful, I've been struggling with a lot of shame being here. I've been on my own since 18, so moving back in at 27 was never the plan. My girlfriend stayed with her parents halfway across the country due to medical issues preventing her from leaving the state. The only solace I had was in my dog, a 6 year old blue heeler who I adored. He was absolutely my best friend, the closest companion I've ever had. After about a month of being in the Midwest, he started having trouble pooping. I took him to the vet, assuming there was an obstruction, only to find that his body was riddled with tumors. The vet said it was the worst case they had ever seen. I was advised to put him down immediately, but I couldn't. I kept him alive for two more weeks before he stopped being able to function, and I had to put my best friend to sleep. It's been 4 months, I haven't been the same since. I can't do anything. My girlfriend and I split up tonight, after a rocky three year relationship. It's always been a struggle, but since losing my dog, I haven't had the energy to try to sustain it anymore. She was my best friend though, and really the only person I feel like I can relate to. We had similar interests and morals, but we fought frequently. I never wanted to lose her, but there was really no way to continue the relationship at this point. It ended in flames, so there's no way to salvage a friendship. All my friends are different people than they were when I left, I'm a different person. I'm not good at maintaining friendships, and since my dog died I've hardly spoken to anyone. I start my new job Monday, I've run my savings dry while wallowing. Its a labor intensive job, but the only thing I could really get in the small town I grew up in. I'm already dreading it. I'm telling myself that it's just to save up to do something else, but I don't even have a goal at this point. I feel like everything I've been striving for is just completely out of reach. I wanted to be a tattoo artist, I'm decent at art. But before I moved back to the Midwest, I lost my ipad that had my entire art portfolio on it, and since I've been back I just haven't done any art. Thinking about trying to find an apprenticeship just seems pointless. There aren't any good parlors around, and I don't think I'd be able to balance an apprenticeship while also having a job. I don't feel like I can do anything. I wanted to travel. I wanted to live outside of the midwest, outside of the US. I wanted to live near mountains. I got a degree in geology just so I could work in a mountain related field, but I was never able to find a job with it. It's too expensive everywhere to just start over somewhere else. I just feel like there's no where to go. I feel trapped. I feel sick. I just have no drive, no motivation. I don't want to kill myself, but I want to die. I just don't want to be here anymore. I'm so tired. I'm not taking care of myself. My body hurts. I'm always sad, anxious, stressed, and so, so tired.

I didn't mean for the lengthy post. I feel like I didn't even express myself properly. My entire body feels like every nerve has been on fire for months. I miss my dog. I can't express how much I miss my dog. He was my reason for being alive. Every day that goes by, I feel like I'm leaving him further and further behind. There's no future where I'll get to see him again, and that reality is constantly on my mind. Getting a different dog would never be the same, but it would also be financially irresponsible with how difficult it is to find housing that allows pets. I just want to reach out for to my now ex, to do anything to make it work, but the relationship has drained me so much that I know thats not the right decision. I miss my dog. I already miss my best friend. I miss living next to the ocean, and I miss my old job. I miss having a drive. The area I'm in now is incredibly religious, to the point of bigotry, and I feel so out of place. I just don't know what to do. I feel so isolated. I don't know what to do, I don't want to do anything. I just need to know that it will get better, but I can't see how it could. I'm trying to tell myself to just work, save some money, and go from there. But without an achievable goal in mind, it feels pointless. I've always sustained myself with grand dreams of the future, but I don't even have those anymore. I'm just hollow.

I should be grateful and I hate that sometimes I feel like the opposite. But The thing is I don‚Äôt miss home as much as I thought I would. The problem that I have is I don‚Äôt really know how to open up to people. I never tell anyone my problems or what‚Äôs bothering me.

Everyone has moved out of this town that I'm back in, except for one, but he has his own house and an illustrious past.  And here I am...same room I grew up in, no career, no illustrious past, many failures, emotionally immature, agoraphobic, uninteresting, afraid, bored, alone, not much to show for anything, aimless, bitter, tired, no hobbies, forgot what joy feels like, passions are dead or dying, disconnected from life...just, wow.

I know how bad depression hurts. It sucks, it‚Äôs unfair, but so is life. But for the longest time, I‚Äôve felt so much shame and embarrassment about my depression that I‚Äôm terrified to express myself to others. I don‚Äôt want people to know that I do experience depression regularly. I fear being judged and ridiculed for it. 
Maybe it‚Äôs a generational thing, but when I was a kid, depression or sadness was not considered ‚Äúcool‚Äù or glamorized in any way. You were told you were broken and should feel bad about yourself. That what society said anyway. But here‚Äôs what I have to say about that: society can go fuck itself. It‚Äôs okay to be sad. It‚Äôs only human. It doesn‚Äôt make you less of a person. When you consider all the pain and suffering in the world, I think you‚Äôd have to be crazy not to be depressed. Sometimes I‚Äôm convinced that hell is real, and we‚Äôre living in it. Sure, there‚Äôs some silver linings, and when I‚Äôm feeling happy, I‚Äôll enjoy the moment. But I‚Äôve come to accept that my depression may never go away for good. And that‚Äôs okay. What‚Äôs more important is learning how to manage my depression. It doesn‚Äôt make me a broken person that needs to be fixed. It doesn‚Äôt mean I should feel bad about myself for experiencing a very human emotion. Maybe I am too emotional and sensitive. But I‚Äôm human. Why the hell should I not be emotional? We‚Äôre not robots. It‚Äôs okay to feel depressed. Anybody that judges you for that can royally fuck themselves. Honestly, anyone who never gets depressed is either lying, stupid, crazy, or all of the above. Depression shouldn‚Äôt be stigmatized like it is. You shouldn‚Äôt have to feel ashamed or embarrassed about it. If you‚Äôre feeling depressed, you shouldn‚Äôt have to be afraid to say it. Depression makes us human. It‚Äôs a part of human life, a part of the human condition. There‚Äôs no reason to be ashamed of it.

I was away from home, which made it worse as I am an international student; I went fully self-loathing for so long that it caused me depression. I'm slowly getting back on my feet with therapy and meds, and so far, I have improved.  I workout, but I lost so much muscle and weight during that time that I felt weak. I'm exercising again, but I still have a long way to go. I decided to tell my friends that I was going through a tough time, and maybe they would understand that I was struggling with life. To be honest, they are great friends, except something happened today.

We decided to try rock climbing, and I was excited to try it out. After all, exercise helps against depression. I was easily the worst when we began climbing and trying to challenge ourselves. I was fatigued and could barely climb, and I kept losing my grip. I was trembling, and the man I felt exhausted mentally and physically. Now I used to do five pull-ups, and now I can barely do one. They kept teasing me, and I wasn't upset, you know, it's just jokes between friends, but it got to a point where they continued laughing on and on. They said that I was weak and were like, ""yeah, we all had fun except you know who."" one of them was like, you got issues and should check the doctor because you might have diabetes as I was shaking while barely holding on.

Only one of them was supportive and kept cheering me on that I could do it. They all could do it except me. They said that I came here and wasted my money because I could not climb. All of them knew I was going through depression. I just came back, and my self-esteem is lower than before. I thought they'd have my back and support me. Now I feel terrible and honestly hurt. I don't think they're bad people, but I'm not sure what to say or do. Any advice?",1679117922.0

I've been around with toxic people , who treated me like trash, laugh at me for my depression, everything I do goes unappreciated, mentally abusive etc etc. 
but the thing I believe which is super cringy is forgiveness. ""it's not their true self, it was my fault"" i forgive em and just go on like everything's normal coz that's what everyone says, to move on. 

it's been taking a toll on my mental health and i feel it's not normal that it affects me so much to the point where I cry everyday. I'll be going to therapy in a few months but idk how long I'll be able to hold it in for.. I cry super hard hours at night then I'm talking to everyone like it's fine. funny thing is nobody seems to care or even ask how I am. it just hurts when I think about it. I'm scared to open up to anyone rn to tell the truth of how I've been feeling. they've always shamed me for crying, it makes me feel weak and terrible. I don't know why I care too much about these people, trying to check in if they're doing okay n all that, initiating everything. it just comes off as desperate.

 the truth is I'm so lonely and sad inside that even if it's someone who has hurt me a dozen times, I'd still care about them n talk to them or do whatever with them. because they're like the only people around me. I know online advices say you gotta enjoy your own company, but idk how to do that. I've been made to feel stupid, unappreciated and worthless by both family and friends. I'm scared of someone new being nice to me because it reminds me of how my friends were at first until they revealed themselves. plus being locked up in the house most of the time isn't helping.

I just wanna disappear from everyone's lives. is this like a curse or somethin? to be depressed. sometimes I feel like my life and relationships with people were long dead and I've just been clinging on  for too long. my brain is so foggy rn sorry if this doesn't make any sense.",1679109365.0
901,Acne,5,11u9397,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11u9397/acne/,0,"i'll be turning twenty six next week. it occurred to me this morning that I've had fairly severe acne for a decade now. i've been depressed about a relatively mild skin condition for close to half of my life. it's stupid, and i feel stupid saying it, but it's true.

the acne manifests as swollen red cysts on my face that i can never quite keep myself from messing with. when you flare up, before you can get upset about the social ramifications, there's the immediate and intense discomfort of having clusters of malignant fluid sitting under your skin. i don't know whether i have a worse psychological reaction to this than most people, but it has never gotten easier. i remember being particularly freaked out by the scarabs in Brendan Frasier's The Mummy as a kid, and have come to learn that cystic acne sort of feels like that. like some invasive species has carved itself into you to lie dormant in your face.

i have a cyst on the underside of my jaw as I type this. it's the worst place to get them because the deformation is most noticeable. it completely changes the silhouette of your face. it juts out more when I smile, so I haven't smiled much this week.

i look like this about half the time, if I'm lucky. i can handle not feeling attractive, but i feel disgusting. people are perfectly polite and sympathetic, but they are disgusted by it. why wouldn't they be? i've cancelled or delayed half the dates i was ever supposed to go on purely because my face looked bad on a particular day. i avoid my friends when it gets like this, it's impossible to forget yourself when you know your face is being observed. well-lit rooms become excruciating. i see my partner for a few days every fortnight because we live in different cities and, though she has never said anything to imply this, i'm sure she finds it disappointing when i show up with worse skin than usual. i feel like i'm somehow responsible for it, like i'm doing it *to* her.

i've used retinoid creams, i've had chemical skin peels, i've had a doctor electrocute the comedones in my face after numbing it poorly, i've done rounds of lymecycline and accutane. accutane was the only thing that worked, but it only kept the acne at bay for a year or so. the hoops you have to jump through to get it are maddening and expensive. i was lucky not to suffer many of its possible side effects, but the ones i did get were still life-altering and uncomfortable.

i realize that this all sounds melodramatic, but it's been 10 years of this now. most people don't conceive of it as a particularly disruptive condition, so there aren't really any avenues to call it anything more than 'annoying'. bad haircuts are annoying, this consistently sucks the joy out of my life.

She finally referred me to a psychiatrist, and as of today there is only one week until my first appointment.

It has been very ambivalent, because on one hand it brings me relief and confirmation that something is wrong (we have public health care, so there are rules for getting a referral to a psychiatrist). On the other hand, I'm very anxious about what the future will bring and having to open up to a new stranger.

But it also means I've been able to open up to some of my other friends who I haven't opened up to before. I thought they would be understanding now that I have my doctors words for something being up, but most of my friends have responded with some variation of ""don't you think it's just normal sadness?"" or ""everyone have tough periods in their life"".

I‚Äôm totally new here and I just wanted to be heard and lowkey, maybe ask for help. I don‚Äôt really know at this point. I just want to apologize in advance if this post will be long or it will be difficult for some of you to read. Maybe i just wanted for someone to listen to to me. Maybe someone out there who‚Äôs in the same position as me.

I‚Äôm (27F) in love with this person (28FTM) for almost 3 years now and we have our fair share of down moments in our relationship. He‚Äôs been struggling with depression and used to go to therapy and had recently discovered that he also has PTSD. Even before we were official, he was very honest about his situation and despite all of that, I stayed and promised to love him no matter what. I knew all of his struggles, his demons, his awful past and how he would triumph over these and would sometimes spiral back down. I never left his side even at first, I don‚Äôt know how to help and  it seems that everything I do to help him makes it even worse. And it pains me so much. So I try to learn ‚Äî I listen to him and he helps me understand his situation. But there are just instances that our fights would get really bad. Simple arguments that would escalate to him hurting himself and blaming everything on him. Saying hurtful stuff that I should just leave him and I‚Äôm too good for him ‚Äî that he doesn‚Äôt deserve me. These are the times that are most difficult to me. He would himself away from me to a point that I can‚Äôt bring him back up. 

I‚Äôm so scared that I don‚Äôt even know what to respond because even if I do try to calm him down, he would find a way to twist my words and say things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôm being such a burden for you‚Äù ‚ÄúF*ck me i should k*** myself‚Äù ‚ÄúPlease hate me‚Äù back at me. He wanted me to lash out at him too but I don‚Äôt want to. I know that he didn‚Äôt mean saying those things and I shouldn‚Äôt take it personally. But during these breakdowns, I would find myself breaking down alongside with him, but I don‚Äôt usually show it. I would always have to be the strong one which is not the case all of the time. I don‚Äôt want to admit it to anyone but I‚Äôm also slowly losing myself. I‚Äôm trying my best not to blame myself for not being good enough or not knowing how to help. It got worse to a point that i‚Äôm considering going to therapy too. But that‚Äôs a different topic altogether. 

For now, I‚Äôm giving more time to calm down. I try my best not to give in to his hateful words. I would usually drop everything and go to him immediately but now, I have to also think of my well-being too. 

Thank you to anyone who listened to me. I really appreciate your time.",1679123979.0

Or more generally, how much is too much to burden your friends?",1,11uhbbx,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11uhbbx/is_it_too_much_of_a_burden_to_tell_close_friends/,1,"Some real quick context here. I've had some pretty severe anxiety and depression for a while, but very luckily I have a close knit friend group that is very supportive and offers to listen to me rant/vent and tries to help. They've told me numerous times that if I ever feel deep in the trenches that I should reach out to them and talk.

Unfortunately due to various circumstances my mental state has really deteriorated and I've been plagued with thoughts of ""wanting to die"". It's never been to a point of ""wanting to commit suicide"" but rather at the level of ""I wish someone would hit me with a car"".

I recognize that these are pretty severe thoughts and I'm also slightly worried they may further expand in scope. That being said I've never vocalize these thoughts to anyone, but now I feel like I need to tell someone to feel less isolated inside of my thoughts.

That being said I'm worried about telling my friends, not that they won't worry or won't try and help, but because I don't want to burden them with something that, realistically, they cannot help fix. I don't want to become some sort of mental burden for these people that I care about.

Realistically I should contact therapists and psychiatrists but due to my location, and timezone, getting in contact with them is unreliable, and the ones I can get in contact with may be not ideal either.

So is this something I should talk to my friend group about? Or should I instead just hold out for a bit longer and try and find a good mental health support later/when I can?",1679123900.0

Couldn‚Äôt sleep the other night and kept thinking of ways I could end my life. Everything just seems so meaningless, we all suffer so much and some days I just wish it all would end.

I‚Äôve been going to therapy which has been helping temporarily, I think in the next session I need to be honest with him about how bad this is really getting. I thought about maybe trying anti-depressants to see if those would help. unfortunately I‚Äôm also bipolar which if I‚Äôm not mistaken can complicate the situation with taking medication. I was going to the gym and working out almost every day a few months ago, that seemed to help my mental health a lot and I know I need to get back into it.

The reason I haven‚Äôt gone through with this is I know it will be devastating to my family and the few friends I still have. When I really think about it rationally, I know it‚Äôs not worth it. This is hard to talk about but this community seems understanding, even to that level of depression. 

For those of you who had suicidal thoughts but were able to overcome them and live a generally happy life, how did you do it? Any advice on how to get out of this mindset would be greatly appreciated",1679122405.0

I feel so incredibly sad and hopeless.",23,11tq9sh,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11tq9sh/im_so_incredibly_tired_i_dont_want_to_do_anything/,3,"Hi, I (17F) am not doing the best right now. I'm a senior at high school, and right now I am incredibly burnt out.  It's not just senioritis, and I know this. I've been struggling with depression or depressive thoughts for a long time, and for the most part, I just powered my way through it. For context, my parents are very traditionalist and think therapy is scandalous. 

Right now, I feel like I'm at a tipping point. I really want to leave state but can only leave under my parents' conditions. Which is, I can leave if I am admitted to an ivy league or Stanford. It's so stressful because I'm also fighting a really complicated immigration status which leaves me as international for most college apps, making it so much more competitive for me esp since I'm asking for financial aid. I'm so scared and I don't want to stay in state anymore. I feel so depressed because they have crippling expectations on me, and believe me, I worked my butt off. 

Over the years, I did so much and always aimed to be the best for them. And now, after all these years, I can feel it coming crashing down. Right now I just feel so sad and unmotivated. My parents are overwhelmingly overprotective and won't really let me do anything unless they're hovering over me. They care a lot about reputation and always want me to speak or show off. For instance, we had a shouting match because I decided to NOT speak at the school open house (I didn't want to stay at school 'till 8 pm). They said that the school didn't pick me because I'm not smart enough, 

Why? Well this freshman's parent spreads misinformation saying girls with 5.0 GPAS are picked to speak, even though getting a 5.0 overall is impossible at my school unless you took ALL AP/IB since 9th grade. I have a 5.0 for semester, but they don't believe that. Apparently someone from my school got admitted to MIT as well, according to the parent. Even though everyone would've known by now. This is causing me a lot of stress. My parents don't think I'm smart enough, and I know my dad ""joked"" multiple times that I'm not smart enough to get into any of the ivies. They won't even let me go to this program in Alaska even though they are covering all the fees (including travel) because it's too far, I'm a girl, and they're scared for some dumb reason (that I'm a girl and I'm oh-so fragile). 

They always say that I'll feel the same when I become a parent. This is absolutely not true. I know I'll do the exact opposite. The amount of pressure they put on me turned into crippling depression and other hosts of mental health issues. A medical professional I managed to talk to said that I display neurotic behaviors and even my school administration is worried for me. I'm the resident ""crazy girl"" who's obsessed with colleges and doing the best and over-achieving who only drinks redbull and nearly faints. I'm so tired. I just feel worthless and dumb and I KNOW the ivies won't take me anyway. I  just don't know what to do besides rest. And I mean rest for a long long long long time.",1679057607.0

So, this is my third week being a barista at a boba shop, minimum wage with no tips. 

Yes, I understand getting paid low isn‚Äôt a reason to do bad. 

But at first, no proper training was provided. They just threw me out there and expect I will just look at the recipes or ask other colleagues when have questions.
But this method doesn‚Äôt work when it gets really busy. I felt that I am annoying everyone when I constantly ask question when they are busy. 
I really tried to learn. But I just couldn‚Äôt be familiar with all the drinks like my coworkers. 

My boss is pretty rude and has poor communication skill. Instructions are so unclear. 70% of the time I cannot understand what he is saying. One time, I put wrong thing in the drink, and I asked what should I do. He mumbles I thought he said just toss that. Then he said, ‚Äúthats money! I said just keep it like that why you threw that‚Äù and makes me feel so dumb at that moment. 

He is so unsatisfied with my performances. Constantly pointing out how bad I did. When I was washing utensils, he is like taping on my shoulders ‚Äúoh can you just do faster‚Äù. 

When I am just sorta taking a break and chit chat with my coworkers, he‚Äôs like taping my shoulder again ‚Äúhey did you clean up that trash?‚Äù. 

Honestly I hate people touching me. Being my boss doesn‚Äôt grant him rights to touch me without consent, right? But at that moment, I really don‚Äôt have the energy to fight back for myself.

Today I saw him for the first time in two months. I've been feeling really bad all week, and the two weeks before, and I stopped texting him and the other person I trusted. I thought today he'd ask me if I was okay or comment on my disappearance, but he didn't talk to me. Not because he was avoiding me or ignoring me, he just talked to the other people who were there.

951,Penny for your thoughts,1,11udex1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11udex1/penny_for_your_thoughts/,0,"I used to have a lot of friends in my early 20s. Over the years, as is common, they have dissipated and off doing their own things. The thing is, the people from my past, friends I've had for a very long time, well, they can't stand me. This isn't without reason.

I'm turning 34 in June, and for years I battled drug and alcohol addiction. Until about the age of 25 it was all fun and games. I didn't realise how bad it was until I reached that age and knew how dependent I was. I have past traumas which I suppose made reality harder to cope with. But, to put it simply, over time I lost the love in my heart and became a vile, destructive, hateful alcoholic. Drug use was intermittent but drank most days a week. A lot, a sprinter, trying to reach loss of consciousness.

This continued and over the years people would have less and less interest in talking with me, being my friend. I just wasn't a very nice guy. I get it. 

Around the age of 30, a long time gf broke it off with me for my drinking. 6 or so years down the drain. Met some other bloke. Lied about it though, and I knew, exacerbating the hate and the angry feelings brewing inside. 

Moved back to my home city (gf and I lived in a country town together) and it wasn't until then that I realised how alone I was. Old friends, I'd felt abandoned. They weren't interested in me, and I talk this personally. When sober I could see that it was my behaviour when intoxicated however when intoxicated those angry feelings and feelings of abandonment caused me to destroy what remained of old connections. You can guess how this was done. Rude messages/phone calls etc. I had lost control. 

Now, 34 in the June as stated, and I'm sober. Looking back, I can see how sick I was. I never, ever felt happy. Not until I had a drink in my hand or was under the influence of something. Nothing but hate in my heart for everyone, Selfishly, feeling abandoned by the people I thought would always be there, despite realising just how bad I was.

Nowadays, sober, and i have a beautiful girl that loves me for who I am, and what I became when I changed my life, but I still have an extensive list of old friends that remember me for the person I was when I was unwell. I have tried time and time again to message and get my messages across that I am sorry, pleading my case, not expecting friendship but just acknowledgement that who I was, wasn't who I wanted to be. 

Well, despite heartfelt apologies, I haven't received a response and desperation has made me feel like I have become a big joke to all of them. In fact, some are connected, so I already know through a source they feel I'm that 'crazy guy'. 

I know that if the tables were reversed, if my mate abused me once while intoxicated, which he has before, I would give him 2 minutes to say his peace. Well, that's not the case here. And it isn't one. There are about 5 people from that time that simply won't respond or even check a message. 

It feels rough, but i know it's a lesson I have had to learn the hard way. At times I feel paranoid that they all conspire and joke behind my back about how I'm a lunatic, which I know im not. 

I just find it saddening to know how people you think will always be there respond to you when you have a mental breakdown. This is what you get for years of friendship. I acknowledge that I was awful to be around, but is this fair?

What do you think? Honestly, am I wrong for feeling that I deserved a bit more than total ignorance? It always hits more when you feel you don't even deserve acknowledgement on their behalf. Sigh. Anyway lol thanks to anyone willing to get through this novel.",1679110888.0

On Monday I decided to take a chance and start my own business. I‚Äôve been out of work for a couple months (long story), and a job opportunity I thought I had fell through. 

So I told my closest friends about it, since they‚Äôre aware of my struggles with mental health and now my financial struggles.   

Out of like 8 people I consider friends, only 1 offered any words of encouragement. Most either ignored my texts (I‚Äôm in a few group chats), one ‚Äúemphasized‚Äù my text, and my best friend since high school (we‚Äôre in our 40s now, so we go way back), said ‚Äúcool‚Äù. 

This is kind of a big deal. I‚Äôve never tried to do this before. I‚Äôm terrified, but since Monday night when I made up my mind, I‚Äôve been excited! For the 1st time in years I‚Äôm excited for something. I‚Äôve been studying all week. Looking at the market, watching YouTube videos trying to learn the ins and outs, and figuring out what equipment and materials I need. 

But today, the lack of encouragement from these people I‚Äôve been friends with for years or decades in some cases, just wrecked my confidence. I‚Äôm second guessing everything. I keep breaking down crying wondering what a fucking idiot like me is thinking about‚Ä¶there‚Äôs no way I can create and run a successful business. Just who do I think I am?! I‚Äôm a fucking loser. Always have been, always will be. 

And I know that shits not even true, but my brain keeps telling me anyway.

Man, I hope tomorrow is better. 

Take care, everyone! Please be kind to each other. Thanks for listening to me vent.",1679110488.0

A week after that my aunt who I was close to died before I got to visit her. All of this in such a short time was hard to accept.

Part of me feels like I definitely should for clarity, but another part of me feels awkward about it. It‚Äôs not something easy for me to speak up about so I‚Äôm always putting it off. However until I find the courage to go, I thought I‚Äôd make this post and ask for opinions. 

I have always struggled with issues regarding my mental health. I have a bad case of social anxiety. It gets so bad where I even feel weird about answering my front door for things like pizza deliveries. I do things like chewing the inside of my cheeks until they bleed or biting my fingernails. 
    Overtime I‚Äôve noticed a lot of changes to myself physically and mentally. I have a hard time having the energy to do anything besides lay in bed most days. Daily tasks are nearly impossible and my own hygiene is neglected most of the time. Some days I won‚Äôt brush my hair or teeth. Showering feels like a mission. It makes me feel so disgusted with myself but everyday it‚Äôs still hard. My body is always heavy and lethargic. My mom says it‚Äôs just laziness and because I don‚Äôt do much so my body has no energy out of habit. It makes me feel overwhelmed because there‚Äôs things I want to do but it‚Äôs hard with how tired I am most of the time. I can‚Äôt keep a regular sleep schedule. Some days I can‚Äôt sleep more than 5 hours. Some days I sleep for 12 hrs straight. I‚Äôm always zoning out and when I do my thoughts is full of negative thoughts about my life and myself. In a sense I feel like my life has no meaning to it. I always believed I should have accomplished more in life. I‚Äôm always disappointed in the way I am and how I live. There‚Äôs hardly a good thing I can say about myself. In other words my self love is nonexistent.

I overthink a lot and would tell myself things like ‚Äúyour parents probably aren‚Äôt proud of you the way you are now.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou should be trying harder to accomplish more things‚Äù ‚ÄúYou are a failure.‚Äù Etc.

959,Life in purgatory,2,11u7gbd,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11u7gbd/life_in_purgatory/,0,"It's so exhausting to be a person. I'm a big introvert, like top 10% of introversion. I don't hate people they just exhaust me. It makes maintaining relationships a chore rather than natural. I kind of take my friends for granted in a practical sense. I never reach out, they reach out to me. I'm fortunate for that but I have no urge to talk to people. I came to the realization that most of life is relationships with people and I'm forced to do it. I want to meet people in real life but there doesn't seem to be a place in the real world for people to be...people. Everyone is chronically online and of they're not they stay with their friends and not branch out. There's no place for loners to meet each other.

I don't like to work. If I work a job for too long I get depressed. I don't hate money or people who have it. I don't think people who work are suckers. I have little desire for material wealth, but if I had the choice between rich and poor I would choose rich every time. But money as a motivator? Meh. Right now I'm unemployed after I left a shitty job and I am much happier unemployed than working. My parents help me out a bit and I find ways to get money here and there. I only want money for necessity's sake. 

I have ADHD. I have trouble focusing on making and executing goals. Compounded with my low work ethic, I don't get anything done. I hop from goal to goal and complete nothing or forget. I'm a creative person but sticking to a skill to get good at feels impossible. When I do work on my creative work I criticize it to hell. I criticize the utility of it. I criticize everything.

I'm prone to depression. I'm not even sure I experience happiness as much as others. For example, I like to draw. I know I do. But when I draw it feels like there is one molecule of dopamine and that's it. I have no urge to do it, I have to choose to do it. It often feels painful to do it and I often wonder if it's even worth doing.
Am I missing something? Artists are drawn to their craft and even if they have problems too the work still gets done.

I don't use drugs or drink anymore and that has helped. I eat better and take care of myself. But I still am in a pit.

I often wonder if my brain is broken. I feel like I don't receive reward the same. I just live and suffer.

I do love to laugh and joke around and play video games (video games are getting boring). I do feel happiness and enjoyment sometimes but day to day hobbies and such is a chore. It feels like I have to do them just to stay sane and not because I enjoy it.

My parents and friends say. ""Don't worry, everything will work out and you'll figure it out."" Really? Will I? What if I don't? I haven't made many improvements and life is fast and short. I'm scared.

I want to feel alive.

I am standing at the base, looking up the height, circling the width for an opening to start chipping away. when I find a place that looks like I might be able to start, I notice that all it does is loosen debris that may begin an avalanche to inevitably crush me. I thought maybe I could find a way to climb atop and work down, but each path just slid me backwards again. I know the longer it takes to make progress.. the higher the mountain gets, more expectations drop into it, sturdier inadequacies build barriers around it. with the mounting impossibility that it is becoming I am just falling apart inside. the task is too large alone, but my voice had been muted centuries ago when I was  flatly denied access to love and support. my hands have frozen in isolation from a mixture of being abandoned and from cracking at the false hopes of ever being taken again in the smallest gesture of comfort.

I‚Äôve been fighting depression ever since I was 3 years old. 2 decades of just.. carrying all of this. It really feels like I just have.. the weight of the whole world on my shoulders every day.
I didn‚Äôt have a great childhood. I was depressed once my mom left me, so I was adopted and raised by my grandparents. 
My mother was a little abuse towards me as a child, and she had me at the age of 16.
Because of my sudden becoming, I didn‚Äôt really have anyone to take care of me so I would have to go to daycares. 
I hated it. It was one of the first times my grandmother would write about my anxiety as a child. It‚Äôs something I ignored growing up because I didn‚Äôt get why I felt this way or what it was. 
Unfortunately.. in my experience with daycare I was exposed to sexual abuse at such a young age. Physical abuse, and sexual abuse was also present. As a child I didn‚Äôt talk much, so I guess that‚Äôs what made me an easy target. 
I feel like that‚Äôs what was just stuck with me for years. It really has messed me up. Only recently it came to my attention once I was diagnosed with ptsd recently. I always really never understood why people made me so anxious, or why I was always hyper vigilant. 
It‚Äôs something I started doing to not get hurt again. I never told my grandmother about the stuff that happened to me in daycare, because at a young age.. I knew it would absolutely break her heart. I didn‚Äôt want her to blame herself for it. It‚Äôs not her faults anyways.  
In addition, I didn‚Äôt have it any easier in school. I got bullied a lot. It didn‚Äôt feel like I fit in all the time. I didn‚Äôt talk much but I did have a tiny group of friends. 
It was also in highschool that I really had felt the start of the full force  of my depression. 
Unfortunately- during first semester of college, my ex girlfriend of a couple years cheated on me, and in addition sexually assaulted me. This is something I hid from alot of people. It really really drove me deeper into depression. That plus I was having a rough time my senior year of high school with depression and not knowing what I want to do in life. Or- well I thought I did. 
As a kid I really loved art. I always had a thing for art. My grandmother was someone that would always encourage me to do whatever the hell I felt like, and she would support me through it. I would do gymnastics and rock climbing back then, but this all suddenly stopped for me one day. I just - didn‚Äôt feel like anything anymore. I started to realize that I don‚Äôt understand what it felt like to be happy. Or enjoy my life. Art.. was one of the few things that was always there for me. Along with video games. I‚Äôm an only child so, being by myself was normal. I didn‚Äôt talk really. But it isn‚Äôt as if I don‚Äôt have social skills. I just always feel so exhausted being in peoples presence. It just stresses me out, and I always felt uncomfortable around people. I just have body aches after just being around peoples, it‚Äôs exhausting. So it didn‚Äôt feel unusual. 
My grandma was the one that started to notice, when I would just not eat. She would come talk to me and she would always make me some spaghetti. (Pasta is always a safe fav food of mine) my grandma just got me as a person. She was always kind to me and others. Everyone loved her, and I guess I looked up to her Ofc. She made me feel like a human being . Both her and my aunt. They were.. 2 sisters from different mothers basically. And they.. both died to cancer 3 and a half years ago. 
They would make me feel.. like I was seen. It felt like they were real people. They always gave me warm hugs, that.. I feel like I don‚Äôt remember the last  time I have been hugged. I‚Äôve been lonely without them. My entire life .. hasn‚Äôt been the same since. That day I was looking at my aunt, dead in her coffin. 
I think.. when my grandma told me that she was diagnosed with cancer. I didn‚Äôt want to believe it. I mean.. I didn‚Äôt want to believe that she would be gone just like that. I watched both my grandma and my aunt just.. slowly wither away from cancer. Their smiles just.. slowly got weaker. They both got very skinny. 
Their hair fell out. I watched as my grandma tried to not freak out infront of me as she noticed some clumps of hair were coming out this one particular day. She knew. She knew how much it hurt me  to see her like this. She just smiled and said, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll be healthy again‚Äù I Knew she knew. I knew that she knew she wasn‚Äôt going to make it, and she didn‚Äôt want me to worry. But she knew that.. I‚Äôm just like her. When she was near the end of her life.. she would ask my grandfather if I ate each day. 
Till.. that one Saturday afternoon. I went to wake her up. And I noticed that she didn‚Äôt respond at all. I just.. stood there. It‚Äôs as if the world just went completely silent. The house felt bigger. One less person really does.. make a house feel bigger somehow. I don‚Äôt even remember the date she died. It was really traumatic for me I guess because.. I just barely remember  the funeral. It was just strange to me that all of her co workers would recognize me and tell me that she talked about me every day. I was just shocked because all I could think was .. me? I‚Äôm not anything special ..it was my grandma who was the special one. 
She was liked by everyone and they liked her cooking. But my grandma would always be there for me no matter what. She meant everything to me. I dropped out of college to help take care of her, and I couldn‚Äôt even focus on school once my aunt died the year before. 
Both my aunt and grandma were really supportive of me in school. They always praised me when I did good, and always told me to keep doing my best. They were at every single graduation, and important event. And they just.. both withered away from cancer. Ever since then I really and truly lost motivation for everything. I stopped taking care of myself even more when they both died. My eating habits haven‚Äôt really gotten any better. The week after my grandmas funeral I just had so many nights, where I would just get drunk to try and numb the pain. One day I felt even worse than before so I made myself stop drinking lol.
My grandfather got diagnosed with cancer a year after my grandma died. So.. I‚Äôm stuck taking care of him. Honestly.. it really does take a mental toll on me. My grandfather is a really difficult person to be around. He constantly talks about my grandmother, and it‚Äôs really difficult for me to deal with the stress of just always having to relive her death. Some nights I get nightmares of finding her dead, or other old memories of losing her in dreams. 
It just makes the pain feel heavier. I really do miss her. I always wished that I could have got cancer rather than either of them. They didn‚Äôt need to die. And it‚Äôs been hard dealing with my grandfather ever since. He changed  once she died, and his health has been deteriorating. I‚Äôm always cleaning up messes after him, and he makes fun of my mental health at times. He always criticizes me for not finishing college, and he doesn‚Äôt realize how I‚Äôve been doing throughout all this, and how difficult my mental health has been all my life. 
Depression really has been forever eating me up, and it‚Äôs been at my neck for years. It took the things I enjoyed away from me. It feels like it has taken away my humanity, or my soul? I really and truly don‚Äôt understand what it feels like to be happy. I feels strange that I don‚Äôt understand this basic feeling. I would typically feel extremely low or just flat throughout my life. I always feel like I don‚Äôt belong here, and I don‚Äôt know how else to describe it. 
I often feel like I was born too early. My mom having me at 16 made me feel like I shouldn‚Äôt be here, a mistake I guess. 
Depression took art away from me for so many years. It didn‚Äôt really help that when I was growing up , my grandfather would always shit on me for being into art, and would always tell me that ‚Äúthese drawings  will get you nowhere.‚Äù 
Depression, social anxiety, and  ptsd feel like they have been choking me to death all this time, and I don‚Äôt know how much I have left in me. 
I feel like a failure. I dropped out of college, and I never had a job. I didn‚Äôt understand my mental health as I grew up. I didn‚Äôt realize that I‚Äôm so .. incredibly damaged. I‚Äôve experienced so much evil in the world at such a young age, it has made me very hyper vigilant. I wish I could just be normal. 
I feel like my therapy and my medication just can‚Äôt fix me. Every time I feel that my antidepressants wear off and I just feel that familiar feeling of my mood dropping heavily, it makes me lose hope. After trying a couple different medications it just worries me, that maybe I‚Äôm so mentally ill there is no hope for me. I won‚Äôt even be able to afford therapy after this month, and insurance doesn‚Äôt help me with any of that. It just feels like everything just goes wrong for me my uncle won‚Äôt be able to help me out with it anymore. I‚Äôve been doing therapy for a year now. I just don‚Äôt even know what to do anymore. I just feel like I don‚Äôt want to live, but I don‚Äôt want to die. I don‚Äôt want it to hurt, since it just feels like that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve been feeling  my entire life. Just that pain and empty. I just really feel like I don‚Äôt belong here. Maybe I‚Äôm really not supposed to be here. 
Idk anymore. I just don‚Äôt feel human I guess. I don‚Äôt have any support or .. anyone that cares. I don‚Äôt feel like I exist at all, or even feel like I should exist. Nobody listens to me. Every day is really hard to live. 
I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.",1679106045.0
971,Any Online Retail Advice? I need all the help I can get.,0,11ubri8,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11ubri8/any_online_retail_advice_i_need_all_the_help_i/,0,"I‚Äôm attempting to start an online business selling (don‚Äôt laugh) slime.

I know I‚Äôm putting a lot more on the success of this than I should and I‚Äôm hoping there are some words of advice out there that could help me avoid some of the more obvious mistakes I may miss.

Some ideas I‚Äôve had were to send free samples in return for honest reviews ‚Äî though I do not have any friends at the moment or network or family (coming out of a depressive state) and I‚Äôm not sure how to find people that would be interested in this. I‚Äôm also going to attempt social media posts‚Äî but it‚Äôs not my forte. I have ordered some basic recording equipment and I hoping the quality of the equipment outshines my lack of perspective ü§£. Any general rules to follow here would be great‚Äîthis part seems to be the most overwhelming. 

A question I‚Äôve been wondering:
What are SEOs? I‚Äôve tried researching but I cannot seem to wrap my head around it. 

Overall, I have a huge fear of failure I need to work through and I‚Äôm hoping to gain any insight I can to hopefully propel me through the slower more discouraging days. 

It‚Äôs my first day logging into my Reddit account and I‚Äôm not even sure I‚Äôm posting this right or in the correct place. If I seem to need help there as well, I‚Äôm all ears.

Them asking me to pretend about this life, as they do, feels like a stab in the heart and an insult to my intelligence.

Depression doesn't bother me much, it is the lack of empathy the people close to me exhibit that really kills me inside. How can you call yourself my family and be that far away from my feelings, how can you not see what I see? How can you not put in at least some effort to see me?

Worse is understanding exactly what I mean and dismissing it cause the truth is too uncomfortable.

All this means I have no one to talk to and when I do talk, it is the same old, gaslighting me into believing that I am ungrateful. I am not ungrateful, I am just brutally logical. I only want you to see me. I am not asking for anything more or anything less.",1679023868.0
