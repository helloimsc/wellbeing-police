8,Hair loss ruined my life + I never knew I had an eating disorder. Here’s how big of an idiot I am…,13,11v3mpx,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11v3mpx/hair_loss_ruined_my_life_i_never_knew_i_had_an/,0,"Hi friends. 30 yr old female here. About 11 years ago when I was 19 I started experiencing sudden and drastic hairloss. I lost roughly 70% of my normal volume in a matter of months. I was completely devastated and it sent me mentally spiraling. This was my first year away from home after high school. I was in such a terrible mental state that I decided I needed to go back home for a year and allow myself to rid my mind of stress and maybe that would bring my hair back. 

Well sure enough, a year of being back home DID bring my hair back. It wasn’t as full as it was before it fell out but at least my scalp was no longer showing. I felt like my old self again. So now with my new little hairs and a glimmer of confidence, I decided to leave home again. Things were great for about 7 months… until they weren’t. One day I was taking a shower and I was horrified to find handfuls of diffuse hair falling out again. At this point, I was a young person trying to make it in the world and knew I couldn’t take another year off to go sit in my hometown. 

For the next 8 years I would experience consistent diffuse hairloss. I couldn’t understand it. I felt cursed. It stripped me of all of my confidence. It ruined friendships because I felt too ugly to be seen. It kept me trapped in a loveless relationship because even though he was toxic, at least he accepted me with hideously thin hair. It ruined so many career opportunities because with zero confidence behind my words I became a timid shell that couldn’t speak her mind or add value anywhere. I didn’t think it could get much worse… until it did.

6 years ago I started having chronic digestive issues. I was told I had SIBO, Gastroparesis etc… This news sent me spiraling once again. I decided to make my health my full focus, so I began implementing many different healing modalities and diets. I did the elemental diet, FODmaps, And supplements out the wazoo. I’ve tried everything from paleo to vegan to raw vegan to fruitarian. I became highly orthorexic and obsessed with clean eating. I told myself that not eating was better than eating something that was “not clean”. And even though I was taking all of these steps that seemed like they were healing, As time went on I was feeling worse and worse. Aside from the digestion, I was always so exhausted, I had extremely bad brain fog, chronic tension was building up in all of my muscles, I was always cold to the bone, completely disassociated, had difficulty breathing, wounds took ages to heal. It seemed like there was always a new symptom popping up. 

It wasn’t until recently that I realized I HAVE A FUCKING EATING DISORDER.
 
This revelation blew my mind. It was like my whole life flashes before my eyes and I could finally connect the dots. When my hair first started falling out 11 years ago after I left home, It wasn’t because I was too stressed, it was because I wasn’t eating enough. And then when I returned home for a year and my hair grew back, it was because my mom was cooking 3 means a day for me again. And when I left after that year of being home, I stopped eating again so the hair fell out again! 

I’ve realized that I never learned how to properly take care of myself. My eating disorder was never intentional. I never wanted to lose weight or be stick thin. I genuinely thought eating the way I did was okay. I thought not eating breakfast was okay. I thought forgetting to eat was okay. I thought not eating when you’re sad or heartbroken was okay. I didn’t realize that each individual person is meant to hit a daily caloric intake for a very important reason. Those 2000 calories a day are what literally fuels every single function of your body. And when you don’t properly fuel yourself things start shutting down. It’s worth mentioning that I’ve recently also made the connection that I may have undiagnosed adult ADHD Which would explain my unintentional disordered eating patterns.

I have to laugh at myself (otherwise I’ll cry) because I can’t believe as a 30 year old person, I never realized this before. For years I searched high and low for a reason for my hair loss. A reason for all of my chronic mystery symptoms.
I feel like the biggest idiot on the planet. I feel like I destroyed myself. So many precious years I’ll never get back. So many missed moments because I’ve been subconsciously sabotaging myself. 

It’s been three months since I’ve been in recovery. I’ve been eating all in and have gained 25 pounds. I’m still bald headed and experiencing hairloss, but I’m hoping that in a years time that will change. Any inspirational stories or words about hair regrowth in ED recovery would be greatly appreciated. I know it sounds shallow, but having suffered with this confidence killer for so long, I just want to feel like myself again and see myself as beautiful for the first time in a long time. Thanks for being her. You are loved and appreciated.",1679180201.0

It goes against out very nature. Like it or not, we do need food to survive and more importantly thrive. When the honeymoon period ends, the body is ready to eat again. That’s literally why it only feels good for a short period of time.

I didn’t think of eating disorders at being toxic and sickly until recently. I thought they were glamorous, funny, blah blah. I lied to myself that I didn’t have an eating disorder cuz I have ibs. I said I didn’t eat cuz I have ibs. Which I do struggle with ibs, but it doesn’t mean I don’t ALSO have anorexia/an Ed.

It’s awkward to see the stark reality of what I did to myself now. Some time in therapy and development I’m other areas of my life have shown me I actually could not move forward or live a life worth living without giving up starving myself. It was my number one coping mechanism for a long time. It did a lot of damage to how I look. I never got the hot body I was after. I look sick, like I have cancer. My hair line receded from the stress. My face is gaunt but greasy. I look like a little rat who got trapped in the sewer with no food and became anxious and skeletal

I’ve realized through therapy and journaling/CBT that I live in chronic stress. That I live in chronic anxiety and self hatred. That I have a massive people pleasing and low self esteem problem.

Guess what I thought a few months or a year ago? That starving would SOLVE these problems. Instead it’s just made me incredibly dizzy and weak and the anxiety is just as bad. The self hatred is worse cuz now I’ve been punishing myself so long it’s the only thing i know. Every time u starve urself out of punishment ur body is listening to u. Ur reinforcing that belief and habit. The belief that ur not good enough for even the most basic of human needs. Not to mention things like love, peace and thriving.

I know the whole “would u starve the child you” is not helpful. It just hurts. But what im seeing is this goes against our nature. Do kids who have not been mistreated abstain from and hate food? No. Everyone is obsessed with food. As someone who’s worked as a server before, every table is obsessed with food and all secretly feel like they’re weird and that other people are less obsessed with food.

One of the nicest tables I ever had was a group of what looked like anorexic teen girls. They didn’t harass me for more chips, pushed around and ate 1/3 of their little meals. Were so polite and present. But at what cost to themselves?

This will either take over ur life or put u in a position to need therapy and the painful grueling process of HAVING to eat. And having to face every feeling u pushed away like u pushed food away. So not only are u in a whirlwind of painful feelings in recovery, ur forced to stare at the damage uve done. See that u never met ur goals, u were never even close. :(  Seeing that ur body is storing fat in an awkward manner cuz it doesn’t trust u.

I still get extremely anxious around food, I get a loud message that tells me I shouldn’t eat dinner cuz I ate a meal already. But really u can do whatever u want. At this point I just copy what other people do cuz clearly I struggle to feel worthy of being alive. If thriving in any way. Other people eat all day every day so I guess I’ll try it too.

On a side note, I haven't been diagnosed with an ED but honestly it feels like I'm developing one. :( Throughout this week I've been doing jump rope and exercising instead of studying for my finals for uni. Tracking everything rigorously from exercise minutes, spreadsheets and app. I've been spitting and chewing everything to get a taste. My mom bought these huge boxes of packaged cookies and goldish crackers. I didn't swallow an entire package  of either and would just spit back into the bags.

Lately I've been obsessed with sour cream and onion pringles so I'd buy a can everyday and spit and chew it all and it's really convenient because there's a lid for the can.  Also coke zero for lunch instead of food ;-; RIP my wallet honestly. I deadass have been spitting and chewing everyday for a good 30 minutes to 1 hour everyday + working out 1-2 hours it's ridiculous.

The spit and chew sessions have slowly just getting more and more. I first started like once a week with something small but now it's 3-5 things. I got so nervous when I almost got caught. My sister and mom walked into my room just as I was tying up my garbage bags and they said it smelt so bad. I just lied and said I bought some really stinky food and my mom said to go throw it out.

I'll be sitting in lecture taking notes but then my mind wanders to what am I gonna eat or not gonna eat. I wanna be skinny, etc. I've been heavily restricting lately and it's been working and I've lost some weight. But I finally binged today on an entire box of crackers from costco + pancakes + banana bread + oranges + bananas + boy bawang + cheese because I thought it would get my mind off food so I could finally focus on school but nope. I feel immensely guilty.

Arghhh I just can't with myself anymore. I just want to be skinny. I'm so close to my gw. Don't get me started on youtube and instagram as well. I've been watching AFMG, kpop videos, korean diet vlogs, weight loss journeys and all my time is gone there.

I get so annoyed when my mom also offers to make food even though I know she's just trying to help. My mind is so unfocused. I keep checking my body in the mirror and I keep taking pictures of myself.

It can also cause stomach ulcers and rectal bleeding, just fyi.

I have compassion for her in the sense that I know she is also a victim of diet culture and it must fucking suck to live this way for decades and have it be encouraged or normalized but my god… like, I know I have an eating disorder but I would never for a SECOND promote my “diet” or lifestyle habits to impressionable fans the same way she does in the off chance I were to ever get famous like her.

I'm anorexic, but I have common binge/purge episodes on foods that I don't restrict, which are mostly fruits and veggies.

Those things are my only source of protein and well anything thats not fiber, if I start restricting those again Ill probably get worse, so Ive been thinking of fully take fruits out of my menu. Its definitely hard, since its my main source of calories. I eat more calories in fruit then I do actual food, which is a problem I cant seem to get over. If I restrict fruit, Ill probably start starving again, since I dont think I can currently eat a larger amount of other things I mentioned without feeling guilty and purging, but if I keep going like this Ill probably go insane, I'm soo tired of these constant episodes of binges and purges, it also makes me feel like shit after, gives me stomach pains etc. I cant eat that shit in moderation, Ive tried but it being my favourite food that I have access to, I tend to go batshit and eat it like I've never seen food before. I think taking fruit out of my menu and working on eating more of other shit is the best decision and my anorexia seems to agree, but thats why I want more rational and non-biased opinions on this.

Before I left for res this past Christmas I (f20) tried to break up with my bf (m24) at the time because (1) I felt like I’d be a burden to him and (2) I kind of wanted to do treatment independently. He cried and bargained with me in person the next day and said that he was so in love with me and wanted to be that support person for me and really wanted to watch me grow and recover. Throughout my stay he was really helpful… always a phone call or message away. He visited me at one point and brought me some extra stuff I needed though I was 3-4 hrs away. He would message me and mention on the phone how much he missed holding me, laying beside me, etc. When I moved to an apt to do php, he visited me a couple of times. I was having a lot of difficulty in in-person php due to a combo of financials, loneliness, and roommate tensions. My bf gently encouraged me to come home if I was truly that homesick, especially after I SH’d one night. I began to feel that it would be wisest for me to come home where I could be closest to my support system (him). He’s the only person throughout this journey (apart from my treatment team, of course) who truly understood the process of recovery. He promised to be my support system which was very important since my mom and I have a historically toxic and rocky relationship, so returning to such an environment was imaginable risky. She has blatant intolerance towards certain aspects of my mental illness which has negatively impacted my self worth over the years. Last weekend, he made the drive to pick me up. We went to his, celebrated, and then celebrated our 10 month anniversary a couple of days later. I was so excited to be more present in the relationship. The following evening, after leaving a therapy session, he called me and broke up with me. He expressed that he was continuing to feel a disconnect since we are inherently such different people. I’ve always known that we are very different people and have acknowledged that I wouldn’t plan on building a life with him… but I was incredibly content with what the relationship was for me at the present moment: supportive, healthy, loving, validating, and fun. He was my first serious relationship and the first guy to respect my boundaries. Since he is a bit older, I think he is beginning to consider the long term more. I think the milestone of our 10 months brought about his “spiritual awakening” which is great for him, but I really feel fucked over. I’m still so in love with him and I’m devastated. I can hardly hold onto any bitterness towards him without internalizing it. He inserted himself into such an integral position within my support system that recovery  itself reminds me of him, and I want nothing to do with any of it. My SH urges are higher than ever and I loathe this body I’m in. When we talked in person he assured me that the breakup had nothing to do with my ED, my mental health, etc. but my mind tells me it’s because I gained weight or because I exhausted him and my self-worth is at an all time low. My bf was also my primary source of support when my father passed in the fall, so now that he, too, has left, I feel utterly abandoned in this tombstone of a house, left with my mom who has only fleeting sensitivity toward my ED struggles. I don’t know why he couldn’t have figured his shit out before I left. Losing him has been like losing a major security blanket and my anxiety has skyrocketed, generating a state of near-constant nausea which has impacted my meal completion every day now since the breakup (I am emetophobic). It hurts so much. I miss the numbness of my ED. I’m not exactly challenging the nausea either… restriction has felt so comforting in the past. I’m not sure if I still have motivation toward recovery, or if I fear SI if I relapse again, especially if I fall into the kind of cycle that preceded res. I feel betrayed. I feel heartbroken. I hate every aspect of my body. I can’t sleep. I want to SH so badly and my resistance to it wanes by the hour. I will accept advice, though this was mainly for me to vent.",1679161832.0

I haven’t been able to go due to my health and ED, I’m not in any better place with any of it really but I don’t have services on my back or involved and I’m sick of holding off on progressing in my life because of my ED. 

Essentially I want to know what others experiences have been with attending university with an active ED and/or at a low weight. I’ve been maintain a BMI in the >!13s!< for almost a year now, I am functional, have a job, travel, have hobbies etc. Although I’m not confident that I will be able to manage my ED so we’ll when I’m alone and without the direct   support that I have from my family. 

I know there are things I could do to put myself in a better position. But I don’t feel like I’m in the position to challenge and confront my ED right now. Honestly my game plan is to just go and see how things turn out.

I’d be grateful for any advice or experiences. I worry I’m making a mistake by going and that things are going to nose dive and that even going in the first place is a stupid decision.",1679160635.0

I was continuously gaslight by my therapist, was not communicated major things about my care, had to cry and beg to go to the hospital for 2 hours for a toothache, dealt with violent patients who would run away and destroy property as well as stash drugs and have no repercussions, no communication to my home team when they continuously tried to get in touch w my Monte team, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.

I saw so much happen in my time there. A week before I was supposed to step down to PHP I was sent to a locked ward on a 5150. Upon my return I was almost kicked out right there but they let me stay. My insurance informed them I had 3 remaining days of coverage at the end of the week.

You always talk about step down with your team bc you never know when insurance is going to cut you. I had planned to step down with them, even though I saw 8 people step back up within a 2 week period, I was going to try and live in their duplexes. 

When my insurance cut me, my therapist brought in the head director and they told me that I was unable to live in the duplex. If I wanted to continue treatment I would have to find my own housing. In 3 days. In San Diego county. Lol. I told them I would leave. 

The day I was leaving they sent a team in for a psych eval which was my 4th in a week. Just for 1 bad day out of 12 weeks, ridiculous. They called my home team for the first time since I had been there and told them when I get home to send me to a locked ward, they of course refused. 

Since I’ve left 4 PCT’s left, 2 were directly because of me and the way I was treated, my dietitian left- she also told me she was so sorry for how they dropped the ball with me, and the head of nutrition left. 

I have so much more to say, if anyone is interested feel free to message me. But don’t walk away from this place, run.",1679083505.0
69,Sick enough :/ TW: talk of behaviors and treatment,6,11ul8rj,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11ul8rj/sick_enough_tw_talk_of_behaviors_and_treatment/,2,"Hey, so I’m really struggling right now in PHP. I do a lot, especially on weekends, with restriction/fasting and exercise, even purging recently. For reference, I’m a “”normal”” BMI but have amenorrhea, lanugo, brittle hair and blacking out. My friend who is in hyper-metabolism isn’t allowed to make a single mistake or they threaten res, but I’m allowed to use every single behavior I’ve ever used and not get threatened. I fasted all weekend a while back and yeah I got a treatment agreement, but the caveat to messing up that bad again was discharge. And all it made me feel like was that it was all in my head and I’m not really hurting my body. 

basically I got the courage to ask my team why my threat when I’m doing badly is discharge but other people get threatened with residential. it makes me feel like I’m just not as sick as everyone else — that I’m just dumb and unwilling. My therapist said that I have all the tools and knowledge and I’m not 13 so I just have to want it/be motivated to do it and that residential would just prove my ED right that there’s a sick enough and that it’d never be enough. She said she was scared it’d never be enough and if she didn’t care she’d tell me to go to Res but she does care and is scared there won’t ever be a turning point so PHP is the right fit. And she’s fighting insurance but only thinks I’ll get two more weeks. 

It’s just like. Idk. I feel so not sick enough and like it’s all in my head and if I was just a better person I could recover and the session didn’t really contradict that. It’s like they’re saying “okay, it’s all on you, and you aren’t as skinny as the others so you don’t get more care” 

Please tell me what you think. I just feel like I’m being overdramatic about how bad my ED is because if I wasn’t I’d be sent to Res/threatened with it.",1679137406.0

73,"Medical trauma from ED ""treatment""",4,11umt6t,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11umt6t/medical_trauma_from_ed_treatment/,0,"I'm 23. Diagnosed anorexia at 13. Up until last year I was in & out of outpatient treatment and had been to residential once. I believe my trauma began when I was threatened to be sent to another state's inpatient facility if I didn't gain weight within days (this was after my very first visit with my doctor). I was weighed multiple times a week by both my dietitian, doctor, and therapist. Even if I ate exactly what my dietitian said, if I lost weight, she'd assume I was lying and not praise any of my accomplishments. Then, if I gained weight, she'd assume everything was fine even if I wasn't doing well mentally.

After residential treatment I saw a psychiatrist who wanted to weigh me every session. COVID hit and he suggested I buy a scale to send my weight to him...absolutely not. I relapsed and started seeing my previous dietitian & therapist who told me it was my fault that residential didn't work for me & they wanted to send me back. I stopped seeing them & reached out to another dietitian, but she said she'd have to weigh me each time. I didn't see her bc it is SO UNHELPFUL for me and not an indicator of my intake or health. I stopped seeing anyone for my ED & that is when I got better.

I didn't realize I had medical trauma until recently, though. I see various doctors for unrelated issues and every time I go I am so scared of being accused of something or misunderstood. I try to speak up and say if I don't want to try a certain medication but if they try to push it on me anyway I will say ""yes"" because I feel panicky -- similar to a trauma response I have with sexual trauma. Being weighed is always triggering & I will actually eat more than I want in order to comfort my mental state before appointments...I am so terrified of being accused of being sick or lying or being taken off meds because of my weight just from my 10 years of, well, trauma. I actually gained weight due to depression & was told I was ""healthy"" but that weight was from sadness...I lost it after getting better & instead of being happy that I feel better, I am worried because my brain is going ""they're gonna think it's your ed, they're gonna only focus on your weight, they're gonna take you off this med, etc."" I want to just let my body be but how can I do that if it's automatically judged my doctors? I am 5'1"" so I am small & I'm not that active. I maintained a slightly ""underweight"" (fuck BMI charts) weight for years so clearly my body wasn't having any issues with it.

I recently started seeing a new PMHNP & mentioned my ED history (didn't plan to but it slipped out). That has resulted in trauma symptoms coming up and intense worrying about seeing her in-person. I plan to message beforehand or bring a note that I do not want to be weighed & have trauma, which I posted about on here before, but I am still terrified that she will analyze my body and become suspicious. It is so depressing because **I KNOW** whether or not ""it's my ED"" but I was not believed for so long and it's really harmed me.

I truly do not consider myself anorexic anymore but I have lasting negative effects from ""treatment."" I was unaware trauma all of this could happen so I'm wondering if anyone else can relate.",1679141582.0

Restrictive eating tends to expose you to a lot of low-cal versions foods and some of them are just as good, if not better than the normal versions. I'd rather save calories on certain foods and leave more room for other foods than have empty calories on the normal versions, especially if there isn't that big of a difference in taste (I'm not talking about bread vs rice cakes, but comparisons like regular energy drinks vs sugar-free ones) It just doesn't seem like it's worth it. Also, some low-cal foods tend to be healthier and I'm not overly concerned with taste, so for me it's a win either way, not a compromise. Does anyone else think the same?

When it comes to start eating more for weight restoration, getting your period back etc; would you say it feels easier for you to “go slow”, like keep eating the way you have for most part but add another meal a day etc 

Or have/would you prefer to just go all in and start following a weight gain meal plan immediately?

I’m trying to figure out my approach; I’ve read that a quick weight gain early on increases your chances of recovery as well as decreases the depressive thoughts that come with starvation, and so I thought my psychologist would want me to do just that, but she seems to be completely okay with me “hurrying slowly”. Part of me is like, it’s all or nothing at this point but I’m scared I’ll be discouraged if I go to quick and “fail”

So the other option is adding things slowly, a meal here, few more calories there etc. But I’m kinda starting to feel really poorly, weak and tired all the time, low RHR etc and so I feel like, maybe I don’t really have the luxury of time to be so careful

Isn’t that ironic? Well I do like eating actual food, but because I have an eating disorder, I hate it too. I swear, I’m CRAZY about cooking. Always watching cooking videos, cooking recipes to get better at the hobby, yet seldom actually eating. I’ve got quite a bit of knowledge about cooking techniques, secret ingredients, nutrition, and how to get quality food for a low price.

But… well, you know how EDs are. The tug of war, between the irrational ED voice trying to gaslight me into starvation, the actual reasonable voice who knows how destructive (potentially deadly) that is.

Often I cook/bake and give it to others, instead of eating it myself. Apparently this is a common ED behavior, it’s allegedly a way of vicariously eating? But I like doing that because food brings people joy (unless you have an ED duh). Combined with the negative self-view that people with depression/social anxiety/EDs/CPTSD have, feeding people and getting a positive response is one of the few positive traits I can even begin to find about myself. Oh and I‘m diagnosed with all 4 of the mental illnesses mentioned above, isn’t that nice 🤡

When I was in the early stages of my ED, it was awful because I think I hadn’t adapted to it yet. The hunger, exhaustion, and nearly passing out when I stood up was all too much, and I thought I’d have to spend the rest of my life this way if I didn’t want to look ugly af. I was suicidal to start with, so this compounded that, and I thought, “Spending the rest of my life this way is horrible… I can’t eat, I struggle to sleep, I want to be dead, I’m suffering 24/7, nobody would even miss me if I died”.

It’s been some time now and I’ve gotten totally used to this starvation lifestyle, which seems nice on the surface, but is actually terrible. Oh and yes, I do have professional help.

Enough about me, what about you?",1679101547.0
101,I made Shepherds pie with my brother,9,11ud9br,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11ud9br/i_made_shepherds_pie_with_my_brother/,1,"I’m not kidding when I say I listened to the recipe, didn’t micromanage any of the ingredients or try to healthify it. I put the whole stick of butter in the potatoes, plenty of cheese on top, even heavy cream as my brother suggested. I didn’t count calories. I was panicking, but I faced my fears. 

I’ve avoided staying around him past a certain time of day for MONTHS just so I wouldn’t have to eat food he cooked. I didn’t realize just how many restrictions I had until I rebelled against them and cooked with my brother. I didn’t realize how, despite making small changes (eating closer to maintenance, buying real bread and not keto bread, etc) I still had so many rules in place. I acted like a healthy person who could enjoy family time, honor their cravings, and just live freely. Even though my mind was (and is) in distress, I got a taste of the life I’ve been missing for so long. And the best part is, despite my fears, I didn’t binge, I gave myself permission to eat it and actually felt my fullness! I didn’t feel out of control while eating it. That was the biggest shock of all.

I’m still mad at myself for eating snacks while cooking, including too many cookies (I never let myself have treats so it makes sense). And it’s still scary to rebel against my ED who so badly wants to view this entire experience as a failure. But I wanted to take a moment to recognize it as a victory. 🤍😭",1679110418.0
102,trans woman seeking help from this community as it seems like y’all are the only ones who take the things i’ve been going thru seriously…,7,11udxfo,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11udxfo/trans_woman_seeking_help_from_this_community_as/,5,"tw: discussion of weight loss, and unhealthy thought patterns 

Hi all, this is a long and wordy post so i do apologize in advance but i need to get it all out of my system

i’m a trans woman in her early 20’s and have been transitioning for almost a year now.

i was a naturally skinny boy growing up but throughout college i really repressed my identity and doubled down on my masculinity to fit in.

in this pursuit i was extremely dedicated to working out and putting on muscle and by the end of school i had developed a really muscular upper body and my legs lagged behind but still had some muscle. (this is relavent later)

once i did a lot of internal work and acceptance, i was ready to begin my transition

at this point i HATED the way i look bc i was quite literally the opposite of what i wanted to be physically

so i knew i had to go all in on losing the muscle. i had seen a few others on a similar journey and took inspiration from them

my plan was simple, stop weight training and lose weight and be on hormones

hating my body to such an extreme extent made it easier than i imagine it would be for the average person losing weight

however after about a month or so i realized this was going to be a much harder and longer journey than i initially expected

correct me if i’m wrong, but it seems like your body really doesn’t want to lose weight if your body fat is low and my body fat has always been really low naturally regardless of my weight and this added to the difficulty

unfortunately a consequence of that seems to be that what muscle mass i do have really sticks out visually more than it would be otherwise which only adds to my discomfort 

without giving any specific numbers or anything i’ve been able to go from looking from abercrombie and fitch male model to ripped cis women over the course of the past 10 months

this has been a severely difficult process with me basically developing many unhealthy thoughts and patterns that ppl in this community have but did so completely independent of any ed related material or media i simply did what it took and only recently stumbled upon this broader community for lack of a term.

anyways i’m really not sure what to do now that i’m basically at the bottom of what a “healthy” bmi is.

i still have lots of upper body mass and my legs are uncomfortably thin looking bc of where my starting point was

my goal physique is actually something that is very healthy genuinely but i don’t think i can get there healthily 

ideally i would have thic legs big butt and low muscle mass on my upper body and with a healthy good amount of body fat

my issue is that in order to really truly get where i want i would have to lose weight for another 6 months bc my upper body still has wayyyy more muscle than i’d like and if i just start bulking and gain leg mass then my upper body may never atrophy to the point where i’m comfortable

so it seems like i can either start trying to gain weight in my legs and risk NEVER getting where i want OR damage my body to the point where i’m extremely thin and build back up from there

also what sucks is i start a real job soon and i have no idea how i’m gonna be able to be in a deficit at a relatively low body weight while in an office environment

really truly a shitty situation i’m in and i don’t think my mental health has been worse than it is rn bc of all this

i don’t really know what i want ppl to say but if i ever ask the trans community abt any of this i will either be told some bs abt beauty standards and what i define as feminine or to “let hrt do it’s magic🤗” or some fucking stupid bitch that’s like oh i just waited 10 years and now i look better….

all i truly truly want is to be able to not have this mass on me that makes me look even more like a man :/

I have fainted 4 times and had dizziness numerous other times. Both my psychiatrist and GP have stated the moment I have a dizzy spell or chest pain, that I should be sending myself to the hospital.

Today I fainted and really struggled to come around & have had chest pain for most of the day. As soon as I felt well enough to stand, I grabbed something to eat just in case it's low BSL's, I feel slightly better but still not great.

My Vital Obs are starting to change & are considered low compared to my usual readings.

My psychiatrist wants me to see the dietitian & her consultant at her clinic next week. She said I will probably need a step up Residential Treatment such as PARC (Prevention And Recovery Centre).

My question is; what does medical treatment or medical intervention for Atypical Anorexia look like?

SECONDARY EDIT: I called the nurse & they want me to go to Emergency urgently. They were going to call an ambulance but I don't feel comfortable going by myself so I'm getting a worker to take me. They should be here within the next 40 minutes.

People are saying she’s an “almond mom” and “promoting disordered eating” for answering someone’s question about what she eats every day. Like….he asked her and she answered…she didn’t say what she feeds her kids, she answered a question about herself, honestly…. Personally I don’t see how that’s promotion or trying to push restriction or disordered eating on anyone else, but people are in an uproar about it because it’s clear restriction and that people who want to look like her will eat like this in order to look like her. Still not literally “promotion” imo

That being said……I have no interest in Gwyneth Paltrow nor do I want to look like her, but if you were to revise the argument into something like “people who already dabble in or previously struggled with disordered eating may see this eating routine and do it”, then I would agree with that because I’m gonna do it lmao 😭 I’ve been off the wagon for a while (aka not restricting like I used to) and ima do this. Thanks Gwyneth ✌🏼

My main point is that it’s an interesting argument. Is she promoting it or not? She answered a question honestly about herself and what people do with it is their own decision and she didn’t tell anyone to copy her, did she?

My gf of 1 1/2 years has anorexia and I can tell it's getting worse. Not just physically but through her posts on her private twt account and through things she has said to me. She restricts what she eats some but the main thing she does is at the end of every day, she walks around her room until she burns off pretty much all the calories she's eaten that day. She also measures her body with a measuring tape often. She has bad dysmorphia too and has told me before that it's the not knowing that stresses her out the most, thats why she measures + wants to get a scale. But she also wants to be skinnier even though she is already underweight. She gets excited about eating yummy food and it makes me so happy but then she will feel bad about it later. Some days or weeks will be good and we will eat good meals and stuff but then a bad day will come around and she will start restricting again because she is mad at herself for eating ""so much"" lately. She also checks calories of pretty much anything we get at the store and I can tell pretty much every day there is anxiety about ""what am I going to eat tomorrow?""

She has BPD as well and her parents are not understanding at all, I don't think they're even aware she has anxiety, so she is nervous about going to therapy or something and them getting a bill bc she is under their insurance.

She also does want to recover! Like sometimes she will say she wants to recover and then on bad days she will say she doesnt care about recovery. But she knows it's bad. She's like aware of how bad it is but also still unable to do anything to stop the anxiety. She wants to be on anxiety medicine but most of the ones suggested by her doctor have the side effect of weight gain, so it's like what is another affordable way to get treatment in college. She also kind of thinks treatment like therapy is pointless but acknowledges that it could help.

So basically what I am coming to reddit for is two things:

One, what are ways I can help her? I want to reassure her but I don't always know how to reassure her. I can usually help her with stress or comfort but I feel at a loss a lot of times when stuff about her ED comes up. And is there a way I can encourage her? If its okay to do so I don't want to just be a source of comfort and reassurance but also an encouragement when she does make progress in getting better.

Also, is stuff like her measuring herself okay? It scares me but it kinda seems like a way for her to help her dysmorphia by reassuring her that she is not gaining. I feel like it is only worsening her fear of gaining but I am not sure if that reassurance is there also. Is it okay for me to cross out calories on stuff I buy for her or is that kind of thing triggering? And what are some other ways I could help her outside of those mentioned?

And two, What are some accessible ways to get treatment? Esp. for a college student on a budget and with limited access to health insurance because her parents would not understand the need for therapy.

I go to the grocery store almost every day. I spent a lot of money getting the “right” foods once I decided I was gonna restrict, but even though I have most of what I need for recipes, I keep going back. I keep a rolling grocery list on my phone, and any time I see a recipe I like or an ingredient I wanna use I write it down, then usually go buy it.

Once I decide I want something it’s extremely difficult to convince myself not to buy it because I’ve got something just as good at home. It’s also hard to wait until I have a big enough list for a large trip, because I’d rather just buy it and make it today, immediately.
Simultaneously, I never ever want to throw away food. It fills me with incredible guilt to not eat leftovers if they don’t fit within my macros or cals. Even buying “diet” versions of food fills me with shame when we already have the regular version, but I hate eating normal food now.

I’ve probably spent upwards of $1000 in the past month or two alone on groceries, and I’m not the primary provider of the house. It’s not my responsibility, so everything I buy is just extra. Low cal yogurt, skinny pasta, cauliflower rice, fat free cheese, sugar free sauces, protein bars, low carb bread, I’ve bought it all and more.

TW for numbers about my stats. I added the full context but my question basically is:

**TL;DR: My resting heart rate went up a lot after binging, and it's taking almost 3 weeks to get it back to normal. Why is that?**

Context: I am M26, 5'7'' and >!150lbs!<. I am generally in great shape and decently muscular. I've had an ED for over a decade now, and recently I have been doing a lot better, recovery wise.

I used to restrict at >!1200 !<calories and excercise a lot, and when I couldn't keep that up I would binge like crazy. My weight would fluctuate a lot, basically always gaining and losing the same >!15lbs !<over and over. 

I'm recently trying this new thing where I increased my intake gradually. In january I did >!1500!<, in february I did >!1700!<, and I am now aiming for >!2000!<. It's going well and I feel so much better and I am progressing a lot more at the gym as well, which is great.

I had a slip up about 2 weeks ago where I binged for 3 days. I didn't count but usually my binges ranged anywhere between >!5000-7000!< calories, if I had to guess. I have since been back on track and doing well again. But since I recently got a new fitbit that registers heart rate, I've noticed something that I don't entirely understand.

Normally, my resting heart rate would be around 42 bpm. After my binge, it went up to 57, and now over 2 weeks later, it's slowly gone back down to 44. I had no idea it would take that long! I'm not concerned since it is obviously still low, but I am trying to understand it. Before you say it's salt/sodium: I don't think it's that, since I always eat a large amount of salt. I did eat a lot more fatty and processed food though, when normally I eat very clean. Or is it simply due to the huge amount of food?

Again, I'm not super concerned and just striving to do better from here on out, but I would love to understand what exactly is happening in my body. Maybe one of you will have the answers!",1679050949.0

I usually walk 30k steps three days out of the week, and have been trying to allow myself extra calories on the weekends to make up for the exercise, which has just led to purging tbh because I get to triggered.

Ofc it's just an opinion. Nothing evidence-based as far as I know. And because someone is fatphobic in the first place doesn't mean their ED is related to this fatphobia.

- was talking about how I can sit on the bottom of the pool bc I don't automatically float, he goes ""ah you're just too skinny, not buoyant enough"" 

- was joking about going cold-water swimming but also that I'd freeze, he goes ""right, there's some correlation between mass and heat production, the more mass you have the more heat you produce? We gotta work on that"" 

- meeting up to hang out, I'm like ""how's life been for ya"" and he's like ""oh, yknow, just getting by, making sure I eat, the usual"" 

- I got coffee instead of food after a run bc I was broke once and my friend's just like ""what are you making when I get home? Do you have eggs?"" Later followed up to asked if I'd cooked food yet

- said I was gonna make food at home after an evening run, she asks what I'm making. Hanging out after a morning run, she asks what I'm cooking later. Hanging out at the bar with friends, she and another friend disappear, reappear with food, I wasn't super interested in it but she's like ""hey eat food"" 

Do normies just talk about food and whether people are skinny all the time or am I not as subtle as I think? I don't think I'm THAT lean but I'm also pretty tall and swim what runners consider outrageous distances (I was a swimmer so they're pretty standard for me)

i was trying quasi-recovery with running thinking i could maintain my weight (which is not even underweight) and stop losing so i wouldn't get injured. i even challenged myself to stop counting calories so strictly, and maybe that accounts for some of the weight, but I've still been eating the same things and haven't changed my habits. and I exercise kind of a lot.

It's gotten really bad ever since the beginning/middle of 2020. I also gained 10kgs in two months in quarantine in the beginning of 2020 after my grandpa died (8 of those even in 1 month) while not moving at all. Even after those few months I rarely moved much because I was so depressed and then started sitting a lot (probably up to 14 hours a day) when the new school year started since it was the most important one and I had to study & go to my classes. Even the years before that I didn't move a lot due to my severe depression. I lost a lot of weight really fast when I was 15/16 and then gained a lot back again (in a few months). So I've basically been weight cycling for 6/7 seven years (often losing & gaining more than those 10kgs at a time...). So in 2021 I began losing those kilos I've gained 2020 again (still not exactly in a healthy way but ""healthier"") and did daily exercises & stretches until I fell in March of that year. I didn't go to a doctor for a month like a clown even though I had to pop multiple pain killers a pain to function because I had to study for my final exams. I went to an orthopedist but he couldn't find anything wrong with my spine. So I was basically inactive for months again (minus walking) because of the pain and being burned out from studying & stressing over my finals. I then started university but my first semester was an online semester and I couldn't bring myself to move a lot and exercise because I was so depressed and anxious and there wasn't exactly a reason to leave my house. So the only exercise I really got was walking in a past years (minus some time in the gym but I also only trained my legs...💀) and lifting a lot of heavy things last year while I was moving. I was in pain every day when we moved things and that was going on for MONTHS because we had to get rid of all the furniture from the new apartment... 
Now I get pain in my arms and hands from simply holding my phone or lifting my arm too long. I also have a lot of water retention in my body and feel just as tired and cold as I did when I was actively restricting and purging even though I eat more now. I always thought I had enough muscle mass & fat just because bmi wise I'm still categorized as obese (just slightly but still) but I've always been chubby since I was born. Even at my lowest weight I was the high end of the ""normal weight"" category and that wasn't sustainable at all for me. Do you think I could lack adequate muscle mass even if I'm obese? I thought about it since I've always been losing weight fast and unhealthy, I can basically feel nearly every bone in my body quite well, to the point that I can't lay down certain ways because my bones hurt, I got bruises from the wires of my corset before (I bruise easily in general though) & my ass is nonexistent, so there's no way I didn't lose muscle mass during my ED but I guess I also wanted to hear others opinions & experiences with this topic.",1679060797.0

I relapsed into my ed last year. I was restricting for months, idek how long. Not super low res, but like >!800!< cals a day usually. I had no problems maintaining that many calories a day. Around Christmas time, I visited with my family and ate normally the whole time I was there, convinced I could just try harder later after the holidays to lose any weight I gained. 

Ever since then, though, I've been eating normally with occasional binges. I feel so guilty about it all the time, but I can't stop. I've completely lost control. I wake up every day with every intention to restrict, but by the end of the night, I've eaten my maintenance calories or more. I can try to restrict, but the hunger gets so bad. It was never so bad before. I immediately go from not hungry to feeling like I haven't eaten in days, even when I just ate a few hours ago. If I try to ignore the horrible hunger pangs, it just turns to nausea, and that's even worse.

I've haven't gained weight, just maintained, so I guess that's a plus, but I feel like I'm going insane. It's like I've been forced into physical recovery, but I haven't recovered mentally at all. I'm nowhere near my goal weight, and I just want to lose some more, but I can't.  Why can't I get an ounce of self-control? I've been trying really hard not to purge anymore, but it's getting to the point where idk what else to do.

Thanks for reading if you made it this far. I just don't have anyone in my life who knows about my struggles with eating, but I really needed to vent about it.

like before i met him my extreme hunger was CRAZY, and i’d credit him for me finally getting into a restrictive phase 😭 my c/s episodes lowered, and he genuinely, unintentionally gave me a positive light in my life. something to focus on other then my eating disorder and how much i was hating what my body became.

however, past month i’ve went back to b/ping and c/sing. especially this week it was even worse, bc i took something [well-intentioned] that he said and twisted it in my brain and overthought things, and i definitely think bc of that my behaviors worsened and the fact that things felt awkward after that (+ he wasn’t hitting me up near daily like he was after that incident). i was honestly feeling horrible and even more self conscious, and binging obviously didn’t help that feeling one bit. but i was already trapped in a binge phase, so continuing that was my only way to cope 💀

BUT UHH this morning early into my b/p sesh, he DID hit me up. and after that, it was as if a switch flipped in my brain. any thoughts of continuing my b/p into tomorrow have completely died down, it’s like the restrictive part of my disorder is sweeping down from the sky above to save my ass just bc he messaged me 😭 but obviously, as “punishment” for binging and having the scale go up i told myself i couldn’t actually have a full convo with him until tomorrow.

obviously, even if he wasn’t in my life my eating disorder would find other reasons other then him to restrict. but it seems like he’s the main motivator behind me to keep myself fueled, like two years ago it was that mf kate moss quote but now it’s like ..

246,BED Leading to AN,3,11swezt,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11swezt/bed_leading_to_an/,0,"I started out as a kid with BED, I didn't binge all the time because we were broke and often didn't have food, but when we did, it was the only thing that made anyone in my house lighten up. Long lonely hours sitting in silence in my lonely room, ""homeschooled"" while my parents either went at it incessantly or were to high on drugs to do anything. That room was a prison, but one I refused to leave, when I did, it was on the rare occasion that we finally had food. Mom and dad couldn't eat while high, so they were mostly sober for dinner. Sitting at the kitchen eating with them made me feel some semblance of normal. Food became my life, food represented something beyond my hopeless existence. It became everything,  my everything, it was a drug. 

As time went by, I started to gain, I was a kid, I didn't notice, but inevitably others did. Comments from relatives, the few friends I had, random strangers even forced the idea into my head early on that there was something wrong with me. I never hard-core restricted until my late teens, and I struggled with BED until I hit 14. 

Now, my skinny little body is subject for praise.  Every compliment I receive relates to it. People care. But I guess the  isn't about how my life improved after I forced myself to develop AN. Its actually about how I still struggle with BED to this day. Unfortunately I will never be one of the interlex that hate food it just isn't in my history years of deeply ingrained positive associations with food as created an addiction that lies deep within me one that no one takes seriously. Even now, being thin, it feels like everyday I could binge. It's a never ending hopeless existence with an Ed. No matter what ED it is.

I don't think it will ever leave me, and I am terrified of relapsing into BED.",1678978525.0

I guess it's common to have a poor appetite after this kind of surgery for a few days, then it returns to normal after a week or two.

That night I managed to eat a pretty big meal and dessert >!about 1,100 cal for both!<. My appetite over the past few days hasn't really been dulled at all, I've still managed my usual weekday calorie allowance. And today, I've been RAVENOUS, and am finding myself having to talk myself out of eating a ton because for me, when I eat a ton it spirals into binging which spirals into purging (along with the fact that I can't mentally let myself have above maintenance calories). And I definitely do not want to purge while recovering. I usually take 30k steps on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays too, but I'm not doing that this week because I'm recovering, so exercise isn't making my appetite increase (I'm also feeling very guilty for not burning the calories I usually do).

Could I just be really hungry today because of low protein? The past few days I've had a lot more protein but have been skimpy on it today (fixing for tomorrow).

253,I'm being ridiculous,3,11ssy3m,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11ssy3m/im_being_ridiculous/,0,"Yesterday was pretty rough. Basically I had planned to not eat anything else for the day after lunch besides a coffee. But I was just so hungry and lethargic and anxious. My plan for the remainder of the day was to go to the gym for 2 hours, go to starbucks, and then go to the arcade for the rest of the night. I just didn't know how I was going to make it through all of this.  
  
I started thinking maybe I'll get that wrap from starbucks... no I didn't plan to do that. Maybe a lower calorie item? Nope still too much. Maybe I'll stop at the store and grab a yogurt? No, not even that, because I had already planned not to. I couldn't help but thinking that eating anything outside of what I already planned was going to make it that much harder to lose weight. I was already in such a large deficit for the day that realistically eating any of these things would not have put me anywhere near maintenence.  
  
So in the end, I went to the gym, could only stand to do 1 hour instead of 2. Walked to the grocery store, caved and bought a lb of baby carrots, depressingly scarfed down about a third of it in my car, got my coffee, and just went home to lay in bed for 12 hours instead of going to the arcade, something I look forward to every week. I just did not have the energy or mental capacity to go anymore. And I felt like such a failure for giving up on the gym and ""caving"" and eating literal freaking carrots. Like that's literally nothing, but I felt like a failure anyway.  
  
Yesterday I think I realized just how stuck I am in this way of thinking. Despite coming up with reasons why I want to eat more and gain weight, I can't convince myself to actually do it. There's always a reason to just hold out a little longer. Just the thought of eating a yogurt in this instance was somehow too much for me. It's not right.

254,Genuine question: Is it fair that my mom is making me pay for a missed treatment appointment?,0,11t4n9s,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11t4n9s/genuine_question_is_it_fair_that_my_mom_is_making/,11,"*Context: I'm newly 18F, still in HS, and getting treatment mainly for ARFID regarding my fear of certain foods due to GI issues. I have recently been pushing getting testing and revisiting my GI doctor, but I have been getting questioning and pushback from the ED team. I was going to bring it up in a dietician appointment today, but I got too anxious.*

Last night I had a panic attack because of the idea of not ""people pleasing"" my dietcian & also the fact that she might not believe me about my I going GI issues that I have had since being a child. A lot of it is also super embarrassing and hard to talk about because I have never told anyone about it before.

I talked to my mom about it, and she asked if we should cancel. I reminded her that even if we cancel, we still have to pay for it, but she said it was fine.

The next morning, I tried getting ready for my half day of school (I half day due to severe anxiety, major depressive disorder, & very bad IBS). I did not make it because I had a panic attack on my way to school. I went home, regrouped, and proceeded to have another panic attack and extreme >!self harm!< urges. I was so scared that I would hurt myself that I locked myself in my dad's car for 3 hours (it has windows and live on a quiet bush street) to stop myself. 

I had 5 more panic attacks (more like consistent off and on panic that would reach peaks 😅), and every time I went inside, I wanted to hurt myself, so I stayed outside. I was so scared that my dietcian wouldn't believe me about my chronic bloating, constipation, and reactions to certain food since my past ones have not. I was also scared of the fact that they wouldn't believe my parents either because in my past treatment center my dietician stopped talking to my parents because she didn't believe them and thought they were manipulating me into making up symptoms so I could be at a lower BMI for *their sake*.

My mom came home. I finally felt safe to go inside, and I was going to let her know that I don't know if it would be ""safe"" for me to go considering how my morning went. When I get too escalated, I will even end up being harming in front of others, or I will completely shut down. I didn't want that to happen at my appointment.

She started yelling at me, which kind of set me off, so I had a panic attack again. ""Get it together right now. we are going, or else you're paying for the appointment!""

Obviously, I saw this as a way out. I started telling her I'd pay her right there, but then she starts yelling that she's calling my dietician right now and I'm talking to her. By then, I was full out shut down, so I don't know if that was the best idea, but yeah.

TLDR;

***Basically, am I wrong for being mad at my mom for this?***

**I understand that a) it's frustrating because she had to call out from work**

**b) treatment isn't cheap.**

 At the same time, though, on my end, I was getting extreme self-harm issues and am also currently getting treatment for medical and treatment related PTSD due to gaslighting  and misdiagnosis at previous treatment centers. I think it makes sense that I'm afraid to challenge my dietcian on some things.

I guess the reason it annoys me so much is because I have actually PTSD from previous treatment & also I know that if this happened 3 months ago when I was 17 she wouldn't have made me pay for the appointment. And also I'm *her child*. Idk it just feels a little backward to me? Frankly, I'd rather not attend treatment if it means it's coming from my bank account.

~~She also made me call my dietcian after that. I was home alone at the time, but I got so scared I became dizzy and nauseous and almost blacked out??? I was still conscious, but I could  not see it. It was really scary. I guess my fear feels so real that it manifests physically, and I wish she understood that even tho i still get why she made me pay.~~",1678997016.0

I'm 20 and living in a flat w 5 other 19/20 year olds. We all moved in together after we lived together first year, and I am at a loss. It was established in October? of last year that 5/6 of us have had eating disorders/disordered eating. One with ARFID, two with AN, one with BN, and I have EDNOS (i have had disordered behavior for so long, the binging, purging, restricting, etc just kinda culminates into what I feel comfortable calling EDNOS).

Last year, before my relapse, I was recovered and doing so well. I got into a shitty relationship, however, and I felt like the only way I was able to control my life was through my finances/eating habits. I stopped buying food to save money, and it ultimately became an ED relapse--the more I lost and happier I felt. The control in the midst of instability was addictive.

I know my flatmates noticed, but I never really cared. It is my life and my body, it's my way of seeking control in the least harmful way possible atp, I didn't really care. Now, !40 lbs! down and bordering on underweight, I'm realizing how much my ED has affected my relationships and the people around me. One of my flatmates (20F, AN) started restricting again, not necessarily because of me (she's going through it in general), and I can't help but be upset with myself for possibly triggering something in her with my behaviors. Another part of me is envious of her, in some twisted sense. She !doesn't eat for days at a time! because she doesn't have a job or go to her classes, meanwhile I have to work to survive the month by the skin of my teeth, whilst juggling a hard degree program. I've felt myself get so distanced from her as I turn to more of the B/P aspects of my ED, in a mixture of life and the fact that I'm upset with myself for having EDNOS rather than AN.

I have been using laxatives (dulcolax) almost daily for half a year now and for a while I was fine physically but now the side effects are starting to catch up with me and I'm paying the price. 
I feel constantly bloated and there's lots of gas, it doesn't matter if I've taken a pill or not. On days when I skip my dose, the bloatedness gets so much worse and I have trouble eating anything because food only seems to make it worse... 
Another issue is that when I do take it, the next day my stomach and insides hurt so so much for the WHOLE DAY. And yet I keep taking it. 
I need to stop. I know that now. 
I was wondering whether anyone has undergone the same or a similar experience? And if so, how did you stop using? Would I need to reduce the dose and the frequency at which I'm taking the pills or do I just stop altogether, cold turkey?

I appreciate that she still honors my perspective, preferences, and the fact that my primary diagnosis is ARFID. I appreciate that I can be open and real with with her. Hell, she doesn't even raise her brows at certain ""ED stereotypes"" because sometimes those don't even apply!!

But man, I'm annoyed at the lack of helping my body function. So far, I've been told to add whole grains (which I had recently cut out, other than oats because they give me problems). Originally, we cut out *oats* because they were ""too safe,"" when in reality they were the only things *not* giving me issues. Well now the other stuff gives me issues, great!

My actual *preference* to low fat dairy & alternative has been challenged. We've learned when I eat full fat dairy I actually lose weight because I won't stop shitting!! Amazing A+ 👏 

Like please, I'm not a liar.

I stop movement, I don't use the restroom.

I eat red meat & white carbs, I don't use the restroom for a week.

I eat a high fat item, I cramp up into pain.

I take supplement, I lose weight because I'm not digesting food. I will pass an entire meal in minutes.

When I need to use the restroom, I take so long that I cannot even attend class.

This has been my *whole fucking life.* It totally makes sense that I have an eating  disorder

But how about instead of addressing the **eating disorder** we address **the actual fucking problem.**

I know I have IBS, but sometimes I wonder if there's other underlying issues. I've already had a gluten sensitivity tested, an endoscopy, an ultrasound, and an MRI with contrast. What did we find? Absolutely fucking nothing. 

I've tried supplements, prebiotic, low fodmap, gluten free, exersize, going vegetarian, only liquids, sugar free, yoga, meditation, 3 different anti depressants, an anxiety medication, and basically everything I could think of to solve my gut issues. 

And to be honest I've kind of given up. I'll go out to eat with my family and I'll deal with the pain later. I'll ""challenge"" myself to a family meal and experience symptoms because of a trigger food in a recipe. I binge because I restrict, because I'm absolutely fucking terrified that the food won't come out. I won't use the bathroom for a week and then I sneak into my mother's room to use her laxatives. I've already damaged my insides more than they already are

Tonight at dinner we had stir fry with rice. I would usually eat like 1/2 cup of rice. Tonight I measured out a full cup of rice for myself along with the stir fry. By the time I had eaten half the bowl I felt full and it still looked like so much food left. My parents were eating with me and they gently encouraged me to keep eating but take my time if I needed to, which was nice. My stomach was already kind of hurting at that point but I ended up finishing the whole bowl. 

Now it's over an hour later and I still physically feel uncomfortably full, plus I'm experiencing the mental stress & fear of feeling full. A cup of rice seems like way too much and now I'm scared to ever eat that much rice again. It's so hard to force myself to follow the recovery plan. Especially when I'm so used to lurking in these online ED spaces where eating more than like 1/4 cup of rice would be seen as heinous. I haven't unlearned that way of thinking that pro-ana people have burned in my brain. It's like I can just hear them telling me ""nobody needs that much food."" 

Luckily I have therapy tomorrow but.... I just really need support right now and confirmation that I did not in fact eat too much and 1 cup of rice is normal. I hate this. I almost want to fall back into not trying because it's easier and more comfortable.",1678931045.0

For my thesis, I am analyzing the role of different household dynamics (single versus double parent) in the development of eating disorders and/or disordered eating behavior. My research consists of 26 questions regarding personal/family medical history, family dynamics and feelings related to weight/body. The survey will take approximately 10 minutes to complete. ​​The survey poses psychological risks for participants due to the topic of eating disorders and other psychiatric disorders. The survey also includes discussion of eating disorder behaviors including restriction, inappropriate compensatory behaviors, and binging and purging episodes which can be triggering. An “I decline to answer” option will be available for all multiple choice questions, and can be stated for the free response answers if needed. Additionally, there will be behavioral health resources listed at the end of the survey. Due to the sensitive nature of this survey, no identifying information (such as participant name and internet protocol address) will be collected, and survey responses will be kept anonymous. 

This is project #1551 and has been approved by the Viterbo University IRB. 

I am requesting responses from individuals who meet the following criteria: 

1. At least 18 years old
2. Grew up under their parent(s) care until at least 18 years of age. 
3. History of or currently engage in an eating disorder/disordered eating behavior
   1. Disordered eating can be defined as but is not limited to: frequent dieting, anxiety associated with specific foods, skipping meals, chronic weight fluctuations, strict rituals/routines surrounding food and exercise, feelings of guilt/shame with eating or a feeling of loss of control around food including compulsive eating habits. 

If you meet this criteria and are comfortable completing this survey, please click on the link below:

She tells me honestly how fat I look compared to her. Before I turned into “bigger than her” she would remark on how I was thinner than her. Now she tells me to accept that I’m bigger than her and tells me I should know that I’m fatter than her. 

She gets mad when I make her compare my thigh to hers because she hates telling me the truth that I look fatter. Well this was before I lost weight again. When she commented that I was thinner that her at 15 I had a waist around 28 inches, 39 inch hips, and 21 inch thighs. I ended up losing weight until I had a 26 inch waist, 37.5 inch hips, and 20.5-21 inch thighs. I am 5’11 and reached my adult height at 15.

I was scared to let her see my body at first so I wore very oversized clothes. But then we went clothes shopping and I worse jeans that didn’t hide my legs but weren’t skin tight either. 

My mom implied I couldn’t fit into size medium shorts. She told “those are a size medium you might want the large”. (She never did this before I got fat with a 29 inch waist, 41 inch hips, and 23 inch thighs). Then came the jean section. She has remarked that I am probably size 10 now and gained 5 pounds. (I had a 28.5 inch waist, 39.5 inch hips and 22.5 inch thighs then). This was 6 months ago. 

Yet she directed me to the size 10s in the store. I just said “no mom” and went to the 8s. She respected that but still tried to get me to take the 10s in jeans “for length”. I cried when we got home because she clearly still thinks I’m not back to normal.

I just feel so defeated. I lost so many inches everywhere. Yet I still look like a size 10 to her. I’m trying so hard to get the wow you lost all the weight comment. She knows better than me. I didn’t even fit in the size 8 as it was baggy. Most of my jeans from when I was skinny are baggy now. (I’m probably fabricating this to feel better.) I let her see me in tighter pants. Which she remarked that I look really good. (Probably just because they were new ones I got that she didn’t see yet). I don’t have the nerve to ask about weight now.

When I was in high school, I had what I think is an ED (I'm still not too sure it was because my hair fell out and I lost my period, but I also didn't look freakishly anorexic). I have never been one to stress eat or eat a lot of food (when I get stressed I actually lose my appetite), but last semester I had a binge eating scare. I was constantly craving everything and my stomach felt like a bottomless pit. I was relieved that it turned out to be just PMSing (and also hella stress because finals season was kicking my ass), but before I knew that I felt so, so ashamed. I used laxatives and went for walks to burn everything off--even though I didn't gain much weight in the end. 

I thought that was just a rough patch and I went back to normal for awhile, but starting this week my appetite has increased (like to the point where I'm eating little snacks at night when I normally do not). I also stepped on the scale when I went home because I think I looked fat and I weigh >!125!< lbs now. I'm 5'7 and normally weigh around >!120!< since being weight restored. I'm devastated. My sister kept assuring me I'm not fat, but I think she might lying since she also suggested I try pilates because it really tones your body (translation: go lose some weight you fucking fatass). I kinda want to go on a diet and exercise plan, but it's harder to eat healthy at school. I'm also afraid the diet is gonna give me flashbacks so I'll end up losing control and eating a lot, which will lead to weight gain. I'm already starting to feel like I'm losing control.

Im trying to gain some weight to be healthier after years of disordered eating and she thinks I now how a weight gain ‘obsession’ and actively discourages me. I don’t even track my food, just aim for the recommended amount of meals and snacks for recovery.

Anyway, she NEVER keeps desserts in the house other than dates or very dark chocolate and always buys half fat products making it hard for me to eat high calorie foods if I forget to shop myself or am too tired. 

I’ve expressed to my mum before that I get bloated from whole grains and find lower fibre things easier to eat. I’m pretty sure I have slow gastric emptying from my ED or something. So what does she do, only buys brown bread, brown pasta and brown rice…

i mean, i know how. i know i could technically do it again if i pushed myself but like. this is legit painful and it's somehow such a foreign feeling now? like i don't remember this feeling. i KNOW i've felt it but i think I'm just realizing how little i remember from my low res/fasting periods. 

my boyfriend once told me how worried he was about me and how weak i was back then. i don't remember him being worried. i don't remember him noticing anything, or asking me to eat and stuff like that. but he did that. and i don't remember.

so essentially I’m moving in with a good friend of mine and we were having an adult conversation about what our needs are from each other as roommates. she mentioned that she just started the recovery process for her BED, and that she wants my support. naturally I’m down, EDs fuckin suck and she deserves to feel better, so I told her I’m all in to help her make more conscious snacking/dinner choices and keeping accountability for eating responsibly. 

here’s why I’m asking y’all abt it: I’ve got a nasty little case of ednos myself and admittedly I’ve been eating like shit. I recognize that my eating habits and patterns are still very, yknow.. disordered. I actively desire recovery but I feel like I lack the necessary constitution to follow through with it (I’ve been talking to my therapist about it but I’ve also got a laundry list of other things to cover) so I’m scared for what’s going to happen and whether or not I’ll hardcore relapse like I did last time I tried recovery. I’m extra conscious of it because I don’t want my attempts at recovery to impact my friend’s progress in any way (unless god willing it’s for the better) and I’m inherently afraid of the competition aspects of restrictive EDs because that’s gotten me in trouble before. I’ve told my friend that I also want to recover with her, but I didn’t mention that last part. I’m aware that that’s out of her control and that it’s entirely my responsibility to get over that mindset. I’m telling y’all so that you have a better understanding of where I’m at mentally. 

here’s some of the recovery ideas that we’ve come up with so far:

- planning recipes a week ahead and becoming an ingredients household rather than just a snack household (my concern is that ADHD executive dysfunction will kick in and I won’t eat because it requires Time and Effort)

- opting for more nutritious snack options like carrots and hummus rather than exclusively junk food (my reservations on this one stem from me already worrying about ‘good food’ vs ‘bad food.’ conceptually I understand the purpose but I sometimes rely on midnight snacks of junk food for calories because they don’t require prep or clean up - my logic is that /something is better than /nothing, even if it’s not the healthiest) 

-clear stackable storage containers for the fridge that are labeled and dated (big fan of this one)

- having at least one meal a day together (idk how feasible this will be with my school and work schedule because I’m out of the house at most ‘normal eating hours’ which has also been a major contributor to my issues) I threw the idea at her for regular text check-ins to make sure that we were following through, but it reminds me a little too much of early 2010s tumblr ED chats iykwim

I feel lukewarm on a lot of the ideas we’d talked about, but I appreciate the intention and I don’t want to quell that momentum and possibly fuck up my friend’s recovery. what are y’all’s thoughts on the current game plan? what do you recommend we add or remove?",1678898210.0

I have just started eating animal products (for health reasons) after over a decade of being vegan. I went into the vegan lifestyle with bulimia, but recovered in my second year of being vegan. At least I thought I did. In the past year, I've come to terms with the fact that my ED just turned into a new one over time.

Essentially, I have developed orthorexic tendencies (as well as OCD relating to food and eating). I am now committed to finally recovering from disordered eating and have stopped tracking and measuring everything, trying to take a more intuitive approach. But I'm finding the adjustment to now eating animal products difficult and I'm very anxious about not knowing how to structure my meals as an omni. 

To add to my stress, I am in my 30s and trying to conceive. As a vegan, I gained a lot of weight and have become clinically obese. My dilemma is, I need to lose weight in order to improve my fertility. But I don't know how to achieve that whilst also recovering from my apparent lingering ED. I don't have a lot of time left before it becomes even more difficult to conceive, so I am feeling incredibly overwhelmed.

Today is pi day, and at my job (a school) our math teacher brings pies. Delicious homemade pies. I've been going through a more restrictive phase than usual for \[reasons\] and so I have literally spent a week preparing myself to eat a slice of pie. She made a key lime pie because she knew I loved it and she knows that I've been ""sick"" (I was in ED treatment for 6 weeks last year, but didn't tell anyone why), so she even asked me if I needed different ingredients or anything. She is so kind and I love this pie.

I get to the lunchroom and prepare myself. I've got this. I've talked myself into it for a week. I take a slice (which I honestly cannot even tell anymore whether it was gigantic or tiny; I have no concept of portions). I sneak back to my classroom to eat this pie by myself and pace around my classroom because I cannot be seen eating. It tastes like sugar and butter and graham crackers. I am briefly happy. I go back downstairs and tell the math teacher thank you, etc. and she says, but wait, nobody ate the key lime yet. 

I have apparently restricted and brain fogged myself into not being able to tell the difference between cheesecake and key lime pie.

 I immediately lose whatever brain cell had not given in yet to the madness and go FULL mental illness for the rest of the day. To be clear, I was already planning on eating a slice of pie, but because it wasn't the \*right one,\* now it was my last straw. As a full adult, I faked sick and left work early >!so that I could exercise for one million years!< and I had to use every single tool I learned in recovery to get myself to eat dinner. I googled ""calories in cheesecake"" MORE THAN ONCE as if I would magically know and the results would change.>!Every glance in my bathroom mirror, every time I felt the waistband of my pants,!< I have been crawling out of my skin. >!I have never purged in my life and I have never felt so tempted.!< For one slice of pie that I was so excited about. And to top it all off, I can't get myself to talk to anyone about this because I ""don't look sick."" Mental illness. Absolute mental illness. I know it, but I can't stop it.

I’ve not lost a significant amount of weight almost a year, I’m medically “stable”, most of the time I can’t restrict under xxxx kcals, I walk a lot but really it’s not that excessive, I eat several times a day and relatively normal looking meals too. 


All of my friends with EDs are struggling and it’s so triggering, I love each and everyone of them. It I hate their EDs. I have a really healthy relationship with these friends, we met in hospital a few years ago and we have really clear and well respected boundaries when it comes to talking about mental health and our EDs. Although it’s inevitable that sometimes it’s triggering regardless. 

On one hand it’s hard to see them losing more weight, especially when they are already UW and it’s difficult to watch them being in and out of hospital/inpatient. Or to hear they’ve been struggling and professionals are beginning to worry because I deeply care about all of them. 
Yet it’s also hard because I feel some jealousy toward them too. 

I’ve been struggling a lot recently, but I’ve got nothing to show for it physically which makes me question if my ED is even real or a problem. I feel like I’m a failed anorexic. I’m functional (barely but I manage) and because of that no one seems to care or think that my ED is a problem. 

I know this is literally a symptom of my ED but I’m so sick of never feeling sick enough. And feeling triggered by ever tiny thing. I want nothing more right now that validation and for someone to acknowledge that I’m not okay, and not making it all up. I feel like I’ve got no right to say that I’m struggling when I’m not low restricting, or really losing any weight at all. My compulsive walking is pretty out of control but I am always praised for how healthy and active I am because of the amount of steps I do so it doesn’t even feel like a problem or something I should complain about.

I couldn’t stop crying and hyperventilating.

So in my mind, if I eat little enough, and I happen to end up getting sick later on, it'll be akin to spit up, and it won't really freak me out too badly. Also, it would probably be over with much quicker. Whereas anytime I feel nauseous after a binge, my anxiety spikes. 

TLDR: my brain is broken 🫠 also, the bulimia part is probably confusing. I thought that I would overcome my emetophobia during my bulimic days, but I didn't.

She also calls me the f slur. She knows I'm gay and have a boyfriend. She also knows how hard it'll be for me to seek treatment for AN because I'm man. She's constantly tearing me down, making it practically impossible for me to recover.

These past 10 months have been very interesting. I've lost more than half of my entire body weight in exchange for heaviness in new medical issues. I was in extreme denial about my issues until I got diagnosed with anorexia within this past month. I've always had issues with my health, but didn't realize how bad they've really gotten until uhh.. the title of my post 😅 

I was dealing with obvious signs of vitamin deficiencies but didn't stress too much until I began getting weird bruises overnight on my legs. Then eventually my both of my legs were almost completely bruised upto my knees and it progressed into excruciating pain felt in my bones. Got it checked out, yep you got scurvy which is extremely uncommon. I haven't had any sugar or fruit during these months, so shouldn't be too surprising - but yet I was surprised lol

During the discovery of scurvy, I've learned that I've actually gotten shorter in height by 1.5 inches. I've been the same height since middle school and am in early 20s
Wtf? It isn't just in my head either, it's noted in my medical history. Don't know why. Tried not to stress over it.

The icing on the cake at the same time as all of this transpiring is the massive amounts of hair that are falling out of my head daily. I used to have such beautiful healthy thick blonde hair and now it's so ridiculously thin and I can tell I've lost a significant amount of hair. I try to take extremely good care of my hair and don't cheap out ever, but it seems to be falling out now faster than I can save it. 

These issues have me at a loss for words. I never expected any of this. Yes I'm finally that size 0 but at the expense of everything else I've noted and many more unnoted. I thought I'd love myself now coming this far, and that's far from the reality.

Any advice on how to cope with these issues? The guilt of feeling like a burden to others around me dealing with these issues has impacted motivation for wanting to recover. I just want to hide in a hole and not bother anybody ever again. I can't believe I did this to myself unknowingly and forced it onto the others around me.

Am I alone? I feel so alone

Difficulty breathing, pressure on my heart if I walked for more than a minute, inability to focus on anything and more.
I had to leave school early because of it and the people where I’m staying at made a doctors appointment for that evening.

I told him about my eating issues. I felt like I had to because he was talking about maybe doing a test to get like a picture of my heart or something? I’m not sure what it’s called. 
I felt that if I didn’t tell him I’d just be wasting his time with a bunch of tests when I knew exactly why I was feeling like this.

I have a new appointment scheduled for this morning to draw some blood to check if any nutrients and vitamins are missing which tbf there probably are.
I’m not sure how this can go further though.

He expressed genuine concern and noted that my bmi was pretty low after having measured my height and weight but the problem is that I really don’t want to eat because I’m genuinely terrified of gaining any weight and I want to lose more.

He said he wants to keep an eye on me that nothing gets worse but if I refuse to eat then obviously things will get worse which I’m fully aware of so I’m just really confused what could happen next. I don’t think I’m unwell or sick enough to get hospitalised or admitted into a facility so idk what else that doctor can do.

When other doctors expressed concerns for my weight in the past I always came up with some sort of excuse and they always believed me and did no other check ups but this time I straight up told him about my eating issues. The things I’m scared of the most is that I’ll be forced to eat and be heavily monitored by someone because I just really don’t want to eat at all.",1678778078.0

The trip came and for three days I had to eat like a regular person, I didn't binge on greasy food, I ate a well balanced plant-based meals and the portions that were too big I shared with my family, I even drank a bit of alcohol (I don't drink anything that isn't tea or coffee due to calories). So yes, for three days I was able to remember what it was like to be a normal person, to not think about food all the time, about the calories, or about exercise. I was able to enjoy my trip, to have fun, I ate delicious food and it felt like waking up from a coma. And yet, when on the ride back home I was again thinking of going back to my old habits, but when I looked at myself in the mirror while changing I realized how f up I looked.... ( I ''knew'' before my body was a pile of disgusting bones but it's like my mind hadn't really realized how bad it was until today) Must be because now that my brain is working on something else besides caffeine and nicotine I'm able to recognize what I've gotten myself into.

I want to be happy again, I know this illness is comforting, it feels so good to hurt yourself like this, to watch the numbers on the scale go down, the dizziness and the constant cold you feel, it doesn't make sense why it feels so good but it does. And yet I know if I don't put a stop to this I'm going to get hospitalized soon either by my parents or my doctor soon. And worst of all I'll just keep going through life like a mindless zombie.

Idk if ill stay in the sub or not, I just hope someone reading this might relate or might want to give recovery a go too.

I had known at the start of the year after the holiday period that I had gained a little just because of overeating which I didn't restrict to counteract like I usually do. Then after that I've just been eating ""normally"" but fucking hell I thought it was just water weight fluctuations and etc. I haven't weighed myself much this past month just due to time constraints due to a packed study schedule. I've been buying lunch and breakfast every day (with unknown cals. didn't think they would be high cal but i guess my scale is telling me otherwise) but am still restricting most days of the week and yet I've STILL managed to gain weight. Last week was especially the worst because one of my coworkers made a vegan cake specifically for me and I was eating a lot of that throughout the week but holy shit I didn't think I'd done that much damage. 

It took me so much time, effort and suffering to lose this weight originally I just can't believe how much I've managed to gain back and how easy it was. I want to cry, this is so frustrating. What hurts the most is that I legitimately couldn't even tell that I had gained that much, I thought I looked the exact same but I measured myself and I've managed to gain >!3 inches!< on my waist since November and I want to SCREAM. I had put myself through the hell of relapsing to look amazing before my partner's graduation in November and was finally actually starting to feel confident in my skin and for once in my life happy with my body after losing that weight but here I am, back at square one. I'm so disappointed in myself. I'm hoping that some of this weight is just fluid retention from eating a lot of high sodium foods (which I have been lately) as well as just food weight. I really am hoping some of this weight drops off after getting back on track with restriction because otherwise idk how I'm gonna freakin cope.

Mind you I am not underweight or anywhere near underweight. The weight I was happy with was smack bang in the middle of the healthy BMI range for me as well, and this weight gain is pushing me towards overweight. I hate myself so much right now. I wish the world would just open up and swallow me whole right now. I even changed the batteries in my scale thinking maybe, just MAYBE, the number I was seeing was a bit funky because I was just a tad bit heavier than my current weight prior to my relapse and looked notably bigger but NOPE.

She says she can't get help because she's ""not ill anymore"" just because she has an easier (but not at all easy) time eating and gained some of her restriction weight back and i just don't know what to do anymore. 

On top of that because i don't encourage her on restricting and refuse to do the things she asked such as ""not letting her eat"" and ""do not offer food"" she has begun to resent and feel deep anger at me and it's just so hard and heartbreaking.

annnnnyway like a week ago i got all my wisdom teeth out (not wise anymore i guess), and could only eat soup if anything, and was told to use laxatives for the painkiller constipation side effect, so its bringing me back to a time i guess.

ofc im a dumb person on tiktok, where most my time was spent in surgery recovery, and my fyp has coincidentally shown me the most triggering content, and my mom who has an ed most likely has been doing a cleanse for way too long and im just sitting here like okay. cool. watching someone suffer is so cool. plus, since i cant have solid foods and my dad has been buying me loads of soup im finding comfort in my favorite safe food again.....

now i'm going back to class and catching up beforehand, and uh... apparently we are doing ✨calorimetry✨ in my lab class and oh boy am i excited (not)

its funny, because in chemistry theres ""-kcal"" which is just giving off heat instead of adding it, but maaaan seeing these labs about ""lets calculate the kcal of this (food, metal, element) in a calorimeter!"" have me feeling a bit funny right now !

it does NOT help that the lab is titled ""counting calories"" 😭 AND not to mention one of the questions is about bmr??? and food? like WHAT IS THIS 🤭 also not to mention how ridiculously thin college kids are because man. in that class im already like teetering but now im like wow what an appropriate experiment for me huh

She says she isn't and that it is other medical conditions like Orthostatic Hypotension (OH) and chronic pain. I feel that it might be inaccurate. 

By week 2 of her 1st ED program, I remember her remarking that her pain was down substantially. I reminded her of this last week. She was surprised and glad I remembered. 

What makes me think she's relapsing? This comment is from a different thread, especially the last paragraph:

https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/101ix2p/has_anyone_else_just_had_a_period_of_eating/j2p3852?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3

Also, she has SO MUCH FOOD. OMG. An unbelievable amount in the pantry and freezer. Most perishable food goes bad before she eats it. It's the same process every week or two. And 95% of it doesn't get eaten. Ever.

She orders takeout frequently because she's convinced she ""has nothing to eat."" There is SO much junk in her diet in between 15-hour sleeping spells and candy for dinner.  But then I thin, ""Well, it's way better than not eating!"" But it has to be something she is in the mood for. Always. And if she doesn't feel like eating anything, she'll just go back to sleep, despite knowing that not eating is causing pain.

I've told her I am worried about her relationship with food. She said she is, too. She keeps putting it on her health, which may have some truth to it. But we live together, and she is refusing my help at times and breaking promises that she will look at her ED program binder. 

My son and I live with Orthostatic Hypotension. It really sucks, but we graze on food and manage it as a beat we can. With pain, we treat it and try to stand up to feed ourselves.  Everyone is different and deserves care. I feel like she may be placing unnecessary blame on medical issues that are treated instead of a deeper problem. 

Could this be relapse? Thank you in advance for your thoughts.",1678767249.0

I need advice. First some backstory, i am 19 years old and i have anorexia. I used to be pretty overweight last year and i have lost a significant amount of weight in only a year. Im very happy with that, however i cant eat normally now. I either have to track everything to make sure i eat enough not to lose weight but also not gain any. Or i dont track my calories and i eat the entire day long.   


My question is, why am i always so hungry? I read somewhere its because i have been restricting for so long and im underweight so my body is trying to make me eat a ton of food to gain back some weight asap? Or is my binge eating coming back?   


I have been feeling like maybe i should honour this hunger and just eat even tho it will make me feel very sick physically, i will gain weight and that is what i want. I wanna be healthy again, so is honouring the hunger the right way to do it? Will i ever stop and start eating normally? I feel like i dont have any feeling of ''hunger'' or being ''satisfied'' with food anymore, i wonder if i will ever get that back?

I know there is no sure way to tell and it’s best to ask my doctor or something (kinda hard to do in the UK lol). But I was wondering if suffering from an ED/Exercise-related bulimia for just under a year is enough to stunt growth? 

I suffered my worst period from 14-15 (peak puberty lol) before recovering by 15-16! I still ate fairly nutritiously, but nowhere near enough for my age/activity levels (was playing sports/running 2+ hrs daily). I ended up cutting lots of fats/calories from my diet too. 

Here’s the caveat, I kinda grew around 3 inches after recovery (and gained a few cm at 20…). But I’m still pretty short and am hoping to gain a little more. I’m also male for context! 

Is my growth stunted for good, or is there a chance I can catchup where I left of?

I feel like a prisoner within my own body, I just want to tear my flesh off of my skin until only my ""real"" body is back. 

I feel so repulsed, so ashamed to live in a larger body. I had more energy, a beautiful personality, a glowing smile and robust laugh. My hair was full and shiny, my skin was radiant. I was gorgeous in ways that were not defined by my weight. But I just cannot do it. I can't go back. I never felt good enough. I was constantly comparing myself to other women and feeling inferior. I've lost a lot of happiness alongside the weight but I've gained peace of mind. I feel worthy of eating, worthy of being loved, worthy of taking up space. I feel good enough. Nothing else in my life has ever given me the same peace that controlling my appearance has.

I know recovery isn't easy, nor is it supposed to be. It's so uncomfortable and scary, and I applaud everyone that can muster up the strength and fight tooth and nail to free themselves from the grasp of this illness. But, personally, I'm exhausted from fighting. I'm worn out. I have no interest in being underweight but I also have no interest in sitting at the weight that aligns with my natural eating habits. Everybody has a vice and I suppose this is mine. Appeasing the ED voice gives me some peace, I cannot deal with the noise and fear in my mind when I am living in a body that feels foreign to me.",1678680147.0

520,Does anyone else feel like people with Ed’s are not allowed to have a community?,59,11prnth,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11prnth/does_anyone_else_feel_like_people_with_eds_are/,9,"My feelings on this are complicated. Before I start, I want everyone to know I do not say anything as pro ed, I am in full support of recovery, not harming yourself in any way, this is mainly just a way to vent. 

Basically, I’ve noticed the only forms of ED community that are allowed on the internet, seem to be ones where every individual is either recovering or FULLY recovered. In these communities you often have the people within demonizing those who still suffer from the disorder. I have seen the most innocent of ED accounts on tumblr (ones that aren’t even sharing tips, etc. literally just. Documenting living with their disorder) being taken down. You could argue that them simply documenting their disorder is harmful, but this is the same website that allows racism, transphobia, homophobia, full blown nazis. And other eating disorder focused accounts (such as BED, which I am not saying is any less serious or important of a disorder) are allowed to remain. Unfortunately, I think this results in communities like ed twt, which is such a vile place… 

Specifically, if you go on TikTok, (I know it’s a cesspool) it is hard as FUCK to find any accounts that are focused on having an ED. You can find pro recovery ones, where they often demonize people with eds. I notice people with anorexia are often villainized on TikTok. However, BED focused accounts where the user is not actively recovering are permitted to stay.

I’m not saying I want pro Ana content up. I’m not saying I want a “safe space” for unhealthy habits and behaviors to flourish, along with self harm, but I WOULD like there to be more permitted spaces online where people struggling with an ED are allowed to be open and honest about their struggles. That’s one reason I love this subreddit so much.

If anything I have said here is harmful or offensive, I deeply apologize. I mean no harm. I greatly appreciate this community for promoting safety, and caring about each other.",1678659390.0

I wasn't anything impressive but I felt better about myself. I felt confident. Skinny guys would ask me how to gain muscle, I'd get asked to do physically demanding tasks. I felt strong and like I looked better than how I looked when I was deathly sick despite being at a much higher weight. I feel like I looked better when I was bulking and fatter than how I look now. 

Like I definitely had bad bdd blues but I at least had moments in the day that I felt confident and good. I can't even feel good now about not eating, since I know I'm wasting all the progress I made. I cant lift half of what I used to, I feel fragile and small and weak but it makes no sense. I'm such a fucking contradiction since this is exactly what I wanted.

Like I really feel like I have no redeeming qualities in my physique now. Even if I was fatter back then, I at least had muscles and now I just have fucking nothing. 

I stopped going to the gym after I restricted my calories too low intentionally. For some reason, I thought that if I lost enough weight, I'd feel less dysmorphia once I got skinnier, and then I'd be able to go back to the gym. For some reason, I thought I'd be able to set a goal weight and start eating again once I hit it. I have, and I can't. 

I've tried to go back to the gym, but I've lost so much of my strength and mass that it feels pointless. I feel like I'd just end up spinning my wheels again, and I'd inevitably fall into a gain-relapse loop over and over if I don't get sickly ill again. And it's also like. I've fucked myself over this far, why not get worse? In for a penny in for a pound. It's so contradicting and I feel stuck. I know nothings going to change either. I've been feeling like this for months and I can't do anything about it but rage about about losing mass, seethe about not losing fast enough. Either way I just find new ways to feel like shit.

Day 2: binge (but smaller)
Day 3: even smaller binge, but the bloat was killing me and I ran to the bathroom and locked the door to stop myself from eating more. Still had one piece of food left though, so I chewed on it while crying at my reflection. It turned into a REALLY loud and ugly cry, so loud that my mother forced open the door, and I broke down telling her about my binges. It took a while to explain to her that this wasn’t just overeating, but she was still comforting me and stuff. She admitted that she didn’t really understand me much on this, but she suggested that maybe I should talk to someone who might, like a therapist. I refused for now, but agreed to think about it. After this conversation I binged on a pack of cookies, but instead of getting more food, I told my mom what I did and just cried lol.
Day 4: Binge free, but I still felt so guilty and shitty because of bloating, so I had some unhealthy coping mechanisms 😬
Day 5: I ate a bit more than I’d planned in the morning, and on top of that I was bloated as FUCK, AGAIN. I took 3 lax, but I didn’t binge or vomit.
Day 6: Lax hit, and I stopped being in denial about some of the weight gain being bloating… most of it was, yes, but I had a few extra pounds of fat on me too. My mood was terrible as a result, but I still didn’t binge today either, I just distracted myself with my phone. 

My face is less puffy now but when does the bloat go away ☹️☹️☹️ As you can tell it’s driving me crazy, I may end up killing myself or something I feel so disgusting. I regret purging, why why why why did I start I can’t take thisssssss",1678673503.0

I am binging for years, but just recently I realised that I am doing this. Before I wouldn t thought about food, because I would eat every second of the afternoon. Now I try to tell myself I am not hungry, but I feel like losing my mind. I eat until I feel sick, then tell myself why am I doing this and that is harming me, but then the 2nd day I binge again...
I never ate in the morning and don t feel hungry, but since I found out about what is occuring to me, I can t stop thinking about my meal. I even tried to eat in the morning so I don t binge anymore, but doesn t help...once I feel the taste in my mouth I can t stop. So I don t force myself to eat in morning anymore. Then I thought eating healthy as I really like healthy food actually would help, but it didn t help at all so I quit that as well. All I am craving is sweets, sweets, sweets. Not fast food, not chips, no soda...only stuff like chocolate, sugars.Even if I stop enjoying the food, the binge continues. The binge happens after lunch time, at about 3pm and lasts until around 7pm when the hunger suddenly dissapears. The only times I forget about my cravings is when something bad happens or I am playing sports or I am in a social situation/or with family. The worst is when I watch tv like i really get bored and try to pay attention to movie but I feel like I have to move, but if I go for a walk all I think about is sweets again and when I try to study like I really can t focus. Then I binge and my head and stomach hurt really bad so my study is ruined.
Sorry for the long post, didn t knew where to share my struggle as no one is taking me seriously as it didn t affect me physically(looks) and my mom is scared that i may have diabetes. At this point I am not worried about my weight which shockingly wasn t affected by my binging habbit(may be that I walk a lot), but about my health.

I was doing all-in recovery from late November to up about a week ago, and was doing alright. My weight had evened out, I was less stressed around food, and was happier and more clear-head in general. My only problem was the fact that I couldn't shake calorie counting. I always knew how much I had consumed in a day. Although I felt pretty neutrally towards the amount of calories I ate, It was exhausting to tally it all throughout the day. 

My solution was to split my eating into 3 larger meals and try to eat very similar things (if not the same thing) everyday to make things less stressful for myself. This quickly devolved into me downloading MyFitnessPal again and restricting calories. It's not even to lose weight, I just like the feeling of being in this routine again.

So far I actually feel great. I feel more confident, less stressed, ans even more healthy. But part of me knows this is how this whole thing started. I know that this isn't good for me, no matter how much I'm convinced it is.",1678668019.0

I got gastroparesis when I was severely underweight (my lowest BMI was >!15.2!< which I maintained for a year or so) and although it got much better in recovery, it never went away completely. It's been almost seven years since my last bout with anorexia.

Now that I've relapsed and been eating very little for a few months, I feel the symptoms are coming back and it's making it even harder to eat at all. I'm not even underweight yet and I've taken care to eat solid food every day (I suspect my gastroparesis was caused by being on a liquid diet the last time around) so I don't understand why it would become a problem again. Lots of fiber and vegetables as well, and I drink plenty of water.

I feel full after just a bite or two, get pretty severe nausea (no vomiting, thankfully) 20-30 minutes after eating, and no matter what I eat, it makes me so bloated I might as well be six months pregnant. Obviously that doesn't help my ED issues.

So we've been watching it together as i run but mostly walk on the treadmill.
I completely forgot that the whole reason why I watched it in the first place was bc one of the episodes focuses on a girl with an ed.

So I awkwardly watched it with my mom. Running at high sped the entire time to avoid awkward silence.

She did ofc ask ""so do you still throw up your food?""
ive been doing it minimum 4 times a week for a little while now. I was ""recovered"" about a year ago when I quit for 50 days in the beginning of 2022.

My mom found out the day I decided to quit completely coincidentally. So I didn't mind going into detail as a ""person in recovery"".

But yeah that only lasted 50 days and ive been bulimic on and off ever since.

So when she asked that question I lied and said ""nope! i quit, im exercising instead dont you see?"" as if i didnt purge an hour beofore.

I also added ""its not like im losing weight anyways, how could i be bulimic"" and she went on about how im maintaining my ""lean"" figure. My immediate response was ""mom im literally overweight according ti my bmi"" but she said stuff like ""no way youre overweight""

To be fair i am close to being a healthy weight, but i havent been losing rapidly.

So because of the stress of the situation I managed to run fast for a whole hour with only 1 water break.
I wouldn't have done that since im still not used to running for that long but bc of the anxiety i did it!!!

I had heart palpitations and sometimes dull chest/left arm pains when restricting or after b/p sessions, but those generally went away once I got my shit together and began recovery. I also stopped being light-headed and those kinds of things. 

I've always had issues with insomnia, but recently went through a period of pretty intense stress. I wasn't sleeping well, but I was eating well, and earlier this week, I took an advil PM on Monday and woke up with a sore throat and fatigue on Tuesday. I felt really tired Tuesday, had a killer headache, but slept 10 hours that night and by Wednesday my headache and sore throat were gone. I was feeling fine, just mostly tired, but didn't actually rest well that night. On Thursday, I felt decent in the morning, then decided to make the half hour walk to my college campus carrying my heavy backpack so I could go to class. During class, I began to feel quite light-headed and dizzy, almost like I was about to pass out. My heart fluttered a bit in my chest, so I figured I maybe needed more calories because I was sick and just starting recovery, so I ate a granola bar. Went straight home after class, but kept feeling very tired and suddenly began fearing that I was having heart issues, because of the heart palpitation I experienced earlier in class. Before bed, I began to feel nauseous (though I'd already been feeling a bit nauseous the past few days; I chalked it up to being sick) and like my chest felt heavy/I couldn't breathe well. I didn't sleep well at all that night, just tossing and turning. Friday I felt god awful.... I kept feeling like my chest was heavy/I was short of breath, I was incredibly tired and lightheaded. I ate proper meals throughout the day but after eating two bananas at night I suddenly felt a lot better, so I thought it may have been my potassium levels? I was also nauseous, especially at night. But I'm not sure. Tossed and turned the whole night as well. Today I felt a bit better in the morning, but my hands began tingling and I had some minor chest/arm pains. Now I feel nauseous again, and lightheaded/dizzy when I stand up. I can't tell if I'm imagining or exaggerating these dull chest and arm pains, but sometimes my hands will tingle. I don't know what to do. I can't tell if this is sickness affecting my heart, signs of a heart problem, just sleep deprivation.... or some sort of combination? What should I do? I'm honestly super worried to go to sleep because it's my biggest fear that something will happen to my heart in my sleep, which is probably why my sleep quality has been so poor lately (and is also probably exacerbating my symptoms). I told my mom and she didn't seem that worried, but it's freaking me out a bit, especially now that it's nighttime. I always get this feeling of impending doom at night when I'm sleep-deprived, so I can't tell if I'm being unreasonable or what I should do?

685,"my ed has been a very personal, extremely selfish, highly guarded, very real, ever present, issue with simply : ""not wanting to be how I was made"".",3,11orwj1,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11orwj1/my_ed_has_been_a_very_personal_extremely_selfish/,0,"I know that this is a wildly unpopular opinion, but I hate the focus on body diversity. I hate celebrating weight. In general. Why are we doing this at any size? 

It is so triggering. I hate that I even typed that word out, but it just is. This bothers me so much and it obviously shouldn't because all shapes sizes colors should feel welcome to do and be whatever the fuck they want in their own space. All sizes and shapes, ALL sizes and shapes should be free to feel whatever they want. 

Sometimes it's hard not to feel personally targeted by these in your face models that do not fit the typical model stereotype. I feel like these body diversity campaigns are attacking the way I personally like my body to look and feel. I feel like my existence at a certain size is not acceptable. So I don't feel like I can decline an invite to lunch without feeling judged for ""NoT eAtInG"". I feel like I've been personally called out in my own skin when it is made so abundantly clear that being thin is not only unacceptable but is unattainable. Its weird how ""energy drink is life"" is not accepted the same way as ""leg day is life"". 

My struggle with ED is about me, and perfecting the pile of flesh I'm navigating the world in. 

This daily personal drama with the skinny mirror angled on the floor vs the mirror hanging on the back of the door is fucking ri-dic-ulous. I'm WELL aware of how stupid this whole number is, but it has nothing to do with anyone else. It has always been solely, 100%, painstakingly felt in every single fiber of my being  that this battle has always been a very solitary one. It has nothing to do with how anyone else looks or how anyone else feels about the way I look. An ED doesn't care, there is no brain space left over for that. 

When a person stands in front of the mirror and takes immediate issue with who they see, or even with the amount of space they occupy that's an internal battle. When they are disgusted at the most fundamental shape of their bone structure , that's so completely unquestionably obvious to me (and the rest of the quiet body diversity hating population) that I have a ME problem. 

Its a very personal, extremely selfish, highly guarded, very real, ever present, issue with simply wanting to be not what you are. 

It's an inability to accept a lack of control and or a lack of perfection. I don't see other people the way I see myself. I don't care what other people look like in a sense I'm not judging them. In fact, I know the pain of this disease. 

What I don't understand is this idea that there exist some kind of secret members only plus size people hating club?  

The fact that people (judging me) think I have time in my day to spare after spending approximately 37 minutes obsessing over how my left arm will look in a long sleeve shirt if I sit down is absolutely insanity because I so clearly dedicate 1000% of all available extra minutes to  hating my own reflection. 

I feel like that is what the world does not understand. This awareness of my size is never too far from what I am doing, what I am thinking, or wher I am. I am very much a  suffer alone, in the dark, in silence type. But with the health craze, Instagram influencers, and muscles for days as far as the eye can see.....I feel like people are so in my face telling me it's not okay to feel the way I feel and that there is something wrong with me.

Unfortunately for me, I am wired this way. There is no cure from me. Whether I was born a little ball of self hate or I learned to allow the scale a maddening power over my life is irrelevant at this point because once infected this feels like a forever thing. 

I've been lucky enough to remain living, and I've tried to accept the things I cannot change. I've found a way to live around it. 

Do I wish I could change it? 

Honestly....? 

Yes. But sometimes only from a sense of : I wish I was naturally something I liked more. 

I simply do not like who I am, how I appear, or how I FEEL when I am over or under a certain weight. I never asked anyone else to like it, or even accept it because coincidentally, i am also the only one who has got to wake up every day and like how I look & feel well enough to make the conscious choice keep participating in my own life. Its so frustrating that the way I like to look or want to look is not acceptable or deemed  toxic by someone else. 

My recoil with this super positivity movement is rooted in how those things make me feel about myself.  Seeing bodies and exposed skin stretched to the limit displayed as this thing to be desired just doesnt jive with my brain. It actually gives me mind numbing anxiety to imagine myself at weights that are now being celebrated. It's like a contradictory image to the way I personally want to look and feel. 

I just feel like this whole movement picked a fight with me when I was minding my own business strolling through target sipping my extra dirty chai tea latte. This unconventional bikini model seemingly staring straight into my soul telling me that it doesn't matter what I look like as long as I like who I am. 

Flooding the world with ""I am beautiful, I am enough+, I <3 big beautiful women"" doesnt change the fact that I have a body I haven't always enjoyed living in. But unfortunately, these affirmations do not change my aversion to curves or calories. 

An ED is deeper than a movement.  

Hi it's me, attempting to control this bag of bones makes me feel closer to the pretty that I think is beautiful. 

If a few inspirational quotes could have saved this generation from size 0, an entire decade of youth would have been cured when Radiohead released Creep.

When I was 12, I lost a few pounds (trying not to put numbers!) because I was slightly overweight, and I decided to eat healthier and start exercising more. Once I lose the few pounds, and am a healthy weight (still on the higher end) she freaks out, tells me I have an eating disorder, and takes me to a therapist. They say I’m in denial when I say I don’t have an eating disorder and my mom pushes this narrative relentlessly. Even so putting me in outpatient forcing me to gain these pounds back. I’m in outpatient and cooperating and doing good (but they still say I’m in denial because I don’t admit to ever having an Ed) but also pissed because she is forcing me to gain weight when not necessary), she ends up somehow getting me put in inpatient in another state, and I gain even more weight. (I’m gone for months btw) (and I didn’t cooperate because I was confused, and the food tasted so bad I opted for ensure A LOT) anyways when I got out, that’s when the real ED started!! Because I was uncomfortable with being force fed and I picked up these habits being around others, I learned a lot and ended up getting very ill because at this point it was like an F you to my mom for putting me through all of that unnecessary trauma. Even after recovery the second time, if I was weight restored she still wanted me to be a specific weight and would threaten to put me back inpatient if I didn’t gain x lbs in a month. Because she had this ideal of what she wanted me to be at, even though my eating habits were normal and healthy. Even after turning 18 she would threaten to take me to court and get rights over me to claim I wasn’t mentally stable and force me inpatient again. She would threaten to kick me out at least once a month if she thought I was losing weight. 

It just irritates me so much to think about. My mom is incredibly controlling but she never took it out on my sister this way. She pokes at both of our weights constantly, to me it’s always that I look like I’m losing my butt (I’m 25 now) to my sister she gives her dieting advice and ideas because she wants to help her lose weight.

I hold so much contempt towards my mom and I wish I could cut her out completely, maybe one day I will. It’s so hard to explain this to people too, because it’s a shitstorm of an experience obviously. And I feel like it’s not that common this way, it’s more common for it to be the other way around.

I kind of feel like I don’t have the right or don’t fit in here or something. Like my issue isn’t nearly as severe as others. And I’m sorry in advance for taking up time and space.

When someone thinks of ED, I don’t feel like I’m who comes to mind. I’m a middle aged man. I haven’t been diagnosed with anything. But I have thoughts that are starting to scare me, and I want to get them out into the universe.

Some background. I was always undersized as a child. Small boned, malnourished, and kind of neglected. As a guy growing up when I did, small was the last thing you wanted to be. So I ate like a garbage truck to make up for it. Even into my 30’s and 40’s. 

Then my metabolism slowed down and I started filling out. Which was fine, but I felt misshaped and odd. Like Mister Burns from *The Simpsons*, thin arms and legs, larger belly. Freaking gross, honestly.

Fast forward to 2020. I got COVID just before vaccines were available. It didn’t hit me as bad as some, but it certainly wasn’t “just a cold”. Symptoms lasted for a few months - particularly my breathing.

Sometime in 2021, I decided to cut gluten and dairy. My breathing got better. I started walking. Then I progressed to free weights. COVID scared the hell out of me, and I was determined to get healthy going into my later years.

Sounds like a win, right? But wait.

So like I said before, I was a small kid. No matter how much I worked out, I couldn’t gain weight or mass. In middle age, that’s changed. My shoulders and chest have progressed nicely, better than I could have ever hoped in my 20’s.

But now that that has happened, my gut freaks me out more than ever. It’s not going away. So I started intermittent fasting, then progressed to restriction. 

I find myself paranoid to eat bread. I find myself panicking during the morning waiting to eat. I mentally beat the hell out of myself when I finally do eat.

I feel like that’s how ED starts, and I’m kind of freaked out by it. I was never someone who cared about aesthetics, yet here I am.

And I know, I know…it’s ridiculous. I read some of the other posts here, and it’s like “dude, get over yourself, other people have real problems”.

I had a mastectomy, my chest is flat. It’s about 80% of why I developed an ED in the first place; I didn’t want to be curvy with a flat chest, it made me feel deformed and like a monster. The thing is, I’m finally happy with my body. My BMI is >!18!<, so I’m 100% sure they will want me to gain weight, BUT. The mastectomy got rid of >!13!< lbs of fat and breast tissue, so technically I would weigh that much more, and my BMI would then be >!20.4!<, which is healthy. Is there any chance they would take that into account for treatment or should I stop hoping and reconsider everything? I want help for the behaviors but I have no idea what to expect of ED recovery programs, I’m just so scared they’ll want me to gain anyway. I’m considering canceling the referral now that this has crossed my mind. I just want therapy, not to gain weight, I’m happy with my body now and I really don’t want to lose more, because I don’t want to look or be sickly thin. If they make me gain more, I’m already thinking of either leaving or going through with it and then losing everything again and to maintain on my own. 

I don’t expect many answers because this is a very fucking weird situation, but I’m terrified. I’m really considering calling my psychiatrist’s nurse to just cancel the tests for the referral. I’m really, really considering it. They would be annoyed, but I was the one to ask for them, treatment wasn’t pushed on me and I think I’m gonna change my mind. What do I do? I have no idea.

All the meals are timed with lunch being at 30 mins, but if you were like  close to being done at the end point, you could usually ask for like an extra minute to finish, otherwise you'd be supplemented. So at the end of the 30 mins, I'd finished my burrito (which tbh at that point was a miracle for me) and had a handful of chips left, so I asked to be allowed to finish but then the diet tech said no, I had to throw the food out, and be fully supplemented because the rule now was that no one can get even one extra second to complete unless specifically said in their meal plan. I just need to rant and say that how in the world is that even remotely close to real life?? I get the whole timed meals thing at ED programs but no one would ever say you can't take even two seconds to finish your food because the timer said so?? And it's honestly bizarre to me that you would outright deny someone with a restrictive eating disorder and known tendency to not complete to finish their food.

I know my mom knows that it got to this point because she's been making me eat treats even when I decline (she also helped me eat more because I needed to for my health ), but every time I eat something like that I can't escape the guilt.

I feel it's a ""damned-if-you-do-damned-if-you-don't"" issue. Say ""Yes, you should!"", and you may be answering incorrectly if the original poster is likely going to B/P the food later, if they have a health issue that means they should not eat the food (e.g, hypotension, IBS, lactose intolerance/celiac, etc.), or that they have BED and you are actually perpetuating disordered behavior. Say ""No, you shouldn't"", and then you're ""curating a pro-ana space"".   


I can never answer these posts, because all the comments are something akin to ""YASSS QUEEN EAT THE TWINKIES"", and it becomes clear that OP is looking for reassurance to eat junk food. Which is fine if that's what's asked. If OP were to say, ""Hey, I'm really struggling with disordered thoughts around eating x. Can someone give me some reassurance that it's ok to eat it and not feel bad?"" rather than asking us if they *should* eat it, I'd be more apt to answer them honestly and with more empathy.

I am a massive hypocrite here, but I'm really worried that my step-dad especially might've developed an ED himself because of me. He doesn't eat anything for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. If he eats bread, he will only eat the low calorie one, which I buy. He's been so irritated recently and especially protective of the kitchen. He decided he even wanted to have his own shelf in our fridge that no one cat eat from and started keeping food in his room, even the food for our cat. 

It's so worrying, honestly. I know it's all my fault and I have no clue what to do. He's been so picky recently as well and was not able to try any new foods. He used to eat rice, now he 'hates it'. He says he eats at work but I think he might just be lying to get away with starving himself. 

I don't know what to do. He's showing so many signs but beacause EDs tend to be attributed to only women, especially in their teens, telling a 50 year old conservative man who doesn't believe that mental illnesses exist, I feel like I really can't tell him that.

Recovery ruined my life, my life didn't get bigger or better as I got bigger.

I don't see anyone, i don't wear clothes i want. Fuck those stupid youtuber that I stupidly took advice from. All i didn't work, intuitive eating didn't work. Maybe if I was younger and knew i had a life ahead of me, but now Im old and have nothing. No boyfriend, no friends, no dating life, no sex. all because of this stupid body. 

I've tried body positivity, and neutrality. I've cringed my way through these dumb podcast about ""You are more than a body, soft bellys deserve love, speak to your body kindly, you still deserve love even in a larger body"" stfu. I'm tired of it. I just wanted to be fucking thin.

My advice to you young people on here, I want you to recover NOW. Don't go into your 30s thinking that life will get better by being the thinnest and trying to recover. Society sadly will not treat you well when you get my age. You have your whole life ahead of you. Don't be me. please. 

Probably no one will read. I dont have any one to talk to. Another problems of being 30 and having an eating disorder, people stop caring (for me anyways) bc its a young person problem. 

I miss my sick body, i mourn for it everyday. Even though i was exhausted. i atleast felt a little good about myself. I knew my clothes would fit me well. i got attention from men. I wore a bikini. now i just want to hide and never see the world again.",1678481705.0

Of course every eating disorder is awful for many varying reasons, but developing bulimia so early on as a kid has made me so unreasonably envious of people with anorexia, for the longest time I felt so fucking jealous of people who had the kind of self control it took to keep going. binges for me felt like I just completely blacked out and couldn't stop no matter what I did, not even to mention the permanent sore throat and scars I have on my hand from my teeth scraping against it so often. Late last year after actually managing to restrict properly, I felt so relieved that I had that kind of control and didn't have to worry about my teeth or throat anymore. Logically I know this isnt better by any means, I've already completely lost my vision twice at work in the past month, but this disorder genuinely does not compute with any logic whatsoever for me. I've been on low res >!(around 0-280 cals a day, and right now im 5'8 & 187lbs if that matters)!< for around a month and a half now, and I know that the more you restrict the more likely you are to binge, but I absolutely cannot stand the thought of eating any more than that. it's been going fine for me until this past week, where I've b/p'd every single night after work so far. This is scaring me so bad, I feel like all control is slipping from me and I'm so fucking scared I'm gonna gain everything back. I know that one binge wont change much but it's every night again and I can't stop it. I really don't know why it's so hard. I don't understand why I can't just... not eat. it sounds so simple. God I feel so awful, I just need to get this out and then probably delete it later. I can't risk going back to bulimia— I'm so desperate I may try mid-res for a little bit to see if anything helps. I'm just so scared watching this happen again and I need to figure out how to get out of this. please, if anyone has any tips on how to feel full besides filling up on water, or any tips on how to avoid binges better in general, that would be so lovely.

“

i’m gross. i disgust my self. i’m an object of pity, a thing to be sneered at and stepped on. you’ve seen me naked, bloody, bruised, but never half-clothed, cupping my vomit like a diamond dug from the dirt. 

my mascara is streaky. black, wet strips of something lost. it drips down my face, hanging off my lips and my dampened chin. there’s a chocolate chip hanging from my lip. something that might’ve been yummy, once. 

my body is shaking. my face is puffy and uncoordinated. i try to smile. it’s half hearted, fake, and you can tell. my eyes are red. i sniff once, twice. how sad i must seem. 

there’s brown dripping onto my clothes. this once nice top you thought i looked sort of pretty in. it can be washed, right? spun around to look new. do the strands of cotton retain what they once held? are they ever brand-new again?

the pool of bile doesn’t gross me out. i dig through the pieces to see what layer i’m on. no strawberry bits, it seems, my most second most recent victim still hidden inside of me, screaming at me, begging for release. to sit in my hands, destroyed and unwhole, but  uneaten once again. 

my hands fall to the floor. they barely support my weight. my hair slowly falls from its ponytail, strands clinging to my sticky face— i push them aside, but they fall back out of place. 


“i’m all right,” i say, unconvincingly but with full conviction. “Really. I am.”

look at this smile. this laugh. this shaky attempt to stand. don’t i look whole, normal, happy? tell me i’m all right. tell i’m fine. tell me i look pretty, please. please. 

i wipe the remains still lingering on my hands on the floor.

i pretend it’s not happening, it’s not real, it’s just a phase. this? just something i do sometimes. go back to watching tv. 

you can’t save me. this vomit has stained me. i can’t be pretty, again. please understand. please.

I gained a little weight only to realise that if I bent down, I now had a little stomach pouch for the first time in ages. Never been so disgusted with myself ☠️ went back to restriction instantly and got rid of of the small pouch.

everything that i do— all of it— feels so good that i never considered it to be a form of self-harm. the delusion was so deep, the coping skill so entrenched.

while harm reduction is incredibly important, i realized i’m tired of harming myself. period. all i see now is the 10 year old trying a bikini on for the first time and crying. a middle schooler hiding in the bathroom to change so no-one, including herself, had to see her body. a teenager taking her food into her room to secretly binge and forget the sexual abuse. a young woman restricting to cope with remembering. those girls were me, are me, and they don’t deserve harm. they deserve health. i’ll never be perfect, but i can’t keep living like this. moving from one harmful act to another. if not for me, for those versions of myself that were just trying to survive.

i don’t dismiss my ED as evil or wrong, but as something that helped me survive (in its own weird way). but the inherent health risks now outweigh any “benefits” they provide. there are other ways to exist, where i can actually live.

it hurts to realize that i could never have reached this conclusion before because i felt i didn’t deserve to heal, that i deserved harm and hurt, that i needed to not exist to find peace. but finding even the pinch of peace i sweat, cried, bled for the past year has felt sweeter than any “victory” i had with my ED.

i’m not naive to the fact that just because i want to be done with her doesn’t mean she is done with me yet. she’ll always be here, she’ll always be a part of me and my story. but i deserve physical health and wellness as i age. 

the goal now isn’t, “how far can i push it?” but, “what does beginning to heal look like for me?”. it starts today.

The last time I had to take time off work to go to treatment, I was talking to my manager about it and she asked “are you ok?” I responded “no, but I will be.” I knew I was sick, hence why I was voluntarily entering PHP, but once I went through treatment, weight restored, got healthy, I look back and I’m “shit, I was consumed with food/weight thoughts 24/7, couldn’t concentrate, was  __ lbs underweight, b/ping. I was so damn sick!” 

You don’t realize how ill you were until you’re healthy. You think you’re functioning just fine but you don’t realize how much you couldn’t do until you have energy to do things, go places, have conversations, etc. 

It’s eye opening, realizing how this illness fucks with your insight into your disease. How it convinces you you’re not sick, people who are telling you you are don’t know what they’re talking about and they need to fuck off. 

That being said, that knowledge didn’t keep me from relapsing since then and though I ended up weight restoring and getting back in recovery with a dietician and therapist, it was before I hit rock bottom and I look back on Spring/Summer 2021 and I’m like “I wasn’t even that sick!” 🙃",1678379462.0

Im conflicted because I think there should be support for underage ppl wt ED‘s, my own ED started when I was like 15, recovered at 17, then relapsed at 19, am now 20, but I worry that this forum may encourage these kid‘s ED‘s. Also 13 is too fucking young. That makes me so sad and upset. It’s an „i failed you“ feeling.

It’s weird because i can’t be a role model, like, I am sick. But I do not wish this on anyone else, ever.

In any case, I don’t think 13 year olds should be on this forum. That’s not ok. I mean yes the abortion and gun argument if not here they’ll find somewhere else blablabla, but as a principle, it doesn’t seem right.

At the same time, children and teens are often denied autonomy over their bodies,  for example my mom didn’t let 17 year old me go on birth control, and as a result, I got a bunch of pregnancy scares. Similarly, if you tell a Child they cant receive treatment for an eating disorder because they are too young to have an eating disorder, it does not eliminate the eating disorder. It only eliminates the access to treatment. 

But that’s neither here nor there, because this subreddit is not treatment for ED‘s, because you can’t treat an ED with a subreddit. Then what is it? „Emotional support and harm reduction“? It seems like lots of people are just expressing how they feel and experience their ED’s, but it’s so easy for others to internalize those experiences, especially young children.

876,Tall Girl Triggers,61,11mga3w,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11mga3w/tall_girl_triggers/,17,"I’ve always been a tall woman and I believe that to some extent this ties in with the origins of my ed. One of my earliest core memories is being kicked off of a ride at Disney that was for ages 5 and under when I was 4 because I was too tall for it. I still remember the feeling of shame and humiliation of being escorted off while all of the other ✨petite✨girls sat and stared dangling their legs (it was a swing thing and my legs touched the ground and didn’t dangle). I felt enormous and I hated it.

Flash forward to now. I’m in my early 30’s. I’ve come to terms with being 5’11 but still engage in disordered eating on and off. I’ve been feeling especially triggered this week and frustrated by the amount of dinners I’ve had to go to and it’s making me spiral a bit.

Well. Tonight at my Mom’s birthday dinner someone approached the table and started going on about how she remembered me because “I’m like a model!” I’ll accept that - I personally find it to be the most flattering of the cliché tall girl comments. Certainly better than being asked if I play basketball imo. But then my Mom’s other friend has to butt in and say “oh yeah, kitkat is giant! Yup, she’s GIANT!” She literally said the word “giant” twice. 

I present as pretty stoic in demeanour and just said “giant?” and let it go, but in that moment I wanted to melt into the ground and/or die. I know it wasn’t meant as an insult but it’s a horrible way to describe someone and I know that I will probably never be able to un-hear that comment. “She’s giant!” Fuck. OFF. Why do people say such thoughtless things?",1678329443.0

I've been in ""recovery"" (maintenance but not gaining, only sort of tracking calories) for about half a year now, but today I finally decided to actually go for it for real. Over the past few days, I guess it finally hit me that I really need to start working on getting better. I went to two separate doctors (for non-ED-related reasons), and they both asked me when my last period was, and I had to lie about it because I haven't had one for a long time now. For some reason this has really just made it sink in how bad I've gotten, and it made me want to get better. So tonight, I decided that for dessert, I was going to have as *much* chocolate as I wanted, eating until I was satisfied, even if that was >!10,000!< entire calories of just chocolate (although I didn't actually count the calories either!). I had what was left of a *big* chocolate bunny from last Easter that I had basically never eaten out of fear besides a few nibbles, and a whole bunch more from other things I've been saving, and I **didn't feel guilty.** I just felt extremely happy, both over the taste of the chocolate itself and over the fact that I was able to accomplish this. That dang bunny has been sitting in my closet for almost a year now, and it's finally no longer haunting/tormenting me. I conquered the bunny!

I know this isn't a ""healthy"" way to gain weight for most people, and I'm not planning on gaining most of my weight through pure sugar, but for me, this *is* healthy. Being okay with ""overeating"" on candy is a big step towards recovery.

I'm trying to find ways to overcome this dismorphia but I have no idea how to. I even resorted to getting filler /botox the other week as I thought it would help me feel less insecure. But I've already booked an appointment to go back in two weeks because I feel like it didn't correct the 'areas' to my satisfaction. I'm not going overboard don't worry. I also don't have the funds to get much more done anyway haha, so in a way my low income is stopping me from changing everything.

There have been times I dreamed of being rich enough that I could afford surgery, to change my body and face. But alas I'm too poor to do said things.
Also side note: I watched a video once which was good, where they were like 'you're not ugly, you're just poor' because most the celebrities we compare our selves too, have had a lot of work done to get to that unrealistic level of beauty or image. Anyway I digress.

Does anyone have advice or tips on how to improve body dismorphia?

At times in the past it's been so bad it legitimately makes me long for death, just so I could escape this discomfort I feel in my own body and face.

Maybe everyone just saw me at my highest weight and decided that no matter how much weight I lost, I was still the ""fat kid""? Maybe it's because my puberty decided to start at a ridiculously young age? Maybe I literally just have big bones, idfk. Either way all of it was fucking bullshit and I wish I had punched everyone in their faces when they said that shit. There was nothing wrong with me, never fucking was and even if I was OW I shouldn't have had to hear about it everytime I was perceived by other people.

I buy so much just to throw it away. I have been grocery shopping almost daily and it's freaking me out

I had a phase a couple years ago where i would hit up like 3 restaurants a day and it was bad but i wasn't paying rent. Now i am paying rent. And generally just want to be more conservative with money. But i cannot stop compulsively buying food.

What makes it worse is that when i am trying to lose weight, i am also spending a lot of money for high protein/low sugar foods. So either way I'm spending money. But i wish i could at least stop buying the binge food.

Has anyone successfully stopped overspending?",1678330289.0

I'm in recovery from anorexia, I've never had an exercise addiction or used exercise as a way of compensating for eating *but* I've always been a very energetic person even when my eating disorder was really bad and a lot of my preferred activities are very active. Some of them are really difficult to balance with recovery because they're quite intensive (eg boxing and kickboxing) but I tried out climbing (bouldering specifically) a few years back and I got really into it. 

Climbing was something I was able to do even when I was ill which I really appreciated, even though I was just doing baby climbs. It's pretty good for strength and fitness but it's possible to take it easy and still have fun. With bouldering, it's kinda like solving a puzzle which is satisfying without focusing on lifting x weight or burning y calories or running z distance or whatever. It can be social or you can go to climbing centres on your own. It can also be outdoorsy (not for me because I'm a city boy and I'm broke af, but it's an option!) 

I was a little concerned that maybe the reason I was good at climbing was because I was so skinny but I'm a healthier weight now and I'm WAAAAY better. I can do pretty advanced climbs now and I definitely couldn't when I wasn't eating enough. 

If anyone is looking for a new activity I'd recommend giving it a go! (Obviously be very cautious if you have a history of over exercising or things like that). I personally have a very strong policy against exercising for the sake of exercising and I'll really only do activities if I find them fun but I know not everyone feels that way obviously!

i was super lucky to score my dream job almost a decade ago (as a touring musician in a rock band) and we just had three weeks off for everyone to go see their families, but my toxic ass shut myself in my apartment alone and binged my face off on sugar for three unending hellish weeks. (my family is super triggering, but even NOT going to see them messed me up). literally i was waking up in a cold sweat panicked and eating at all hours of the night too. i've never had such an intense binge cycle in my life.  


now we go back on the road in two days, i'm still painfully bloated, dizzy, my face is a zitty mess, and none of my ""stage clothes"" fit, even the backup clothes i keep for exactly this reason. i'm the only gal in the band so people always look at me on stage, and there's a (toxic but unfortunately pretty true) saying in the music industry that people ""listen with their eyes."" fans have commented on my weight/body more times than i can count, and on two different occasions over the years i've been asked if i was pregnant. there'll be photos of me on the internet in a few days, which my mom will see, and will almost certainly have some ""advice"" for me because she feels embarrassed by my size.  


i'm lucky that my bandmates are super supportive, but they're all (healthy) dudes who've never struggled with food, don't get the body comments from fans, and don't really understand. they're also all attractive, great musicians, and more charismatic than me, so i already have a lot of insecurity about dragging the band down.

But it's been on my mind for the last year since I ""left"" treatment.

&nbsp;


I started my bulimia when my grandmother died and I realized I was stuck financially in an abusive relationship. I love her more than anyone and I miss her every day.

I kept binging uncontrollably and purging more and more often. Afterwards I would be filled with shame and call into work the next day and just cry. 

&nbsp;

During COVID I started going to treatment. Very typical ED recovery. They were a big big fan of Jenny Schafer or whatever her name is. 

They made me eat so so much. I came into treatment ashamed of how my eating disorder made me look. Even if I was full I had to eat more. They had me count things like hummus as my protein exchange. 

I also learned so much dbt skills. 

I was in and out of there for about a year to 18 months. I went into treatment with money saved up for a down payment on a house. I left in debt and broke, having not worked full time in months. 

&nbsp;

I love fashion and they had me get rid of my old clothes because it was unhealthy to keep my low weight clothes. But they weren't my low weight clothes. I had gained about >!20!< lbs from my eating disorder by the time I went into treatment. 

I knew I was gaining a ton of weight. I would get questioned if I lost a lb or so one week. But I kept buying more clothes because I was desperate not to throw up. In those last 6 months there, I gained enough weight to be firmly ""extremely obese"" I could no longer do mountain bike tricks. I couldn't skateboard. They encouraged joyful movement, and hyped me up to go back to the skatepark. So I did after work one day, and changed into my normal comfortable skate jeans. 2 months prior they had been comfortable to do tricks in. Suddenly I couldn't pull them all the way up my leg. 

&nbsp;

But they kept telling me it was internalized fat phobia to hate looking at myself and how my body was changing

&nbsp;

I started doubting all of my meals. If I saw something at the check-out that looked good, I felt like I HAD to buy it to honor my ""emotional"" hunger. 3 meals and 3 snacks no matter how full I was. If I didn't I would binge and purge again. 

I either didn't show my emotions. Or if I did I was being combative. 

The person I was/am dating is a personal trainer  and a model. I know they worried that he would cause me to relapse. Though his job is a job and my job is a job. Very separate. 

&nbsp;

Eventually I got told to leave. The next time I went to therapy they had told her I chose to leave and I must have misunderstood when I said I was told to go. 

I still owe them another 3000$

&nbsp;


It's been about 10 months. They emailed and texted me asking how I am.

How can I say I've probably had maybe 10 episodes the entire time I've been gone, and 8 of them were within the first week of leaving treatment. That I feel like they ruined my life. 

&nbsp;

The majority of clients are in and out. It's been 10 months and I'm cynical that they just see me as it's time to come back. 

&nbsp;

I'm unlearning so many weird food habits I picked up in treatment. I don't have to feel guilty about wanting a salad with spinach and tofu for dinner because I had a heavy lunch. I don't have to feel guilty about not using certain ingredients. 

I still cry over the clothes I lost. I have nightmares every time I hear from someone I went to treatment with. 

&nbsp;

I hate HAES. I hate intuitive eating and their stupid book. 

I was treated one way before my eating disorder when I was conventionally attractive. I'm not pissed at the patriarchy for it. Why not use it to my advantage. 


&nbsp;


Reasons I feel it's a cult

1)The group suppresses skepticism:

Any article about HAES or weight that didn't fit with the narrative we are told to ignore. I was even told to delete Reddit a few times

&nbsp;

2) The group delegitimizes former members

Anyone who left HAES was just considered deep in their eating disorder and very sick

&nbsp;

3) getting rid of my old clothes

Self explanatory

&nbsp;

4) money

Between me and my insurance they got an insane amount of money. Every treatment center does

&nbsp;

5) They make extensive use of cult-generated information and propaganda 

We were encouraged to spend our free time listening to intuitive eating and HAES podcasts. Or read books such as xxxxxxx

&nbsp;

6) instilling fear

If you leave intuitive eating/ HAES. If you ever diet or skip meals, you will fall into your bulimia again and you will be killing yourself.

Then day 3-4 comes and all of a sudden I have more energy and a feeling or need to go do things and get back into a fear of eating all day again. I'm not sure why this is, could part of it be due to an increase in fake energy, the body wanting to move again because it thinks we are no longer safe (migration theory)? am I overthinking it all?  does anyone have advice/tips on how to push past this, and has anyone experienced anything similar?",1678315254.0
984,(TW) how long would it actually take to die if you just stopped eating anything?,2,11m4att,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11m4att/tw_how_long_would_it_actually_take_to_die_if_you/,5,"This question plagues my mind, and I just really want to know out of curiosity. Let’s say for someone with >!a BMI of like 17-20 (so not deathly thin or overweight)!<, how long would it actually take you to die if you stopped eating anything at all, but still drank plain water? Would the length of time differ significantly depending on your initial weight, and would you just die from malnutrition before you got very thin?

Idk if i should say anything about maybe having an ed or just body dysmorphia. On the nhs website it says there's a thing where you can self-refer for the dysmorphia, so i could try that.

992,Living Alone.,6,11lud5p,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11lud5p/living_alone/,0,"As stated above, I live alone. My support worker, support coordinator, GP/PCP & my psychologist have said they are concerned about my well-being at home & stated I should go to hospital. In the 4 years of seeing my psychologist, she's never been concerned enough to say that she wanted me to go in.

I'm starting to have complications but that's another topic. My ED has triggered off a flare with another health issue & receiving treatment for that.

In the interim I have seen one of the consultant psychiatrists & they were going to speak with one of the most senior doctors of this particular catchment. I do not live in this particular area, however my GP/PCP & psychology are. The Psychiatry team of the catchment I live in has refused to treat me due to the fact that I'm not amaciated. I'm quite the opposite although I have had rapid change in weight in recent times.

I'm quite concerned that I won't receive any treatment & will be discharged. 
I have already fainted on multiple occasions at home & do not leave home unless I have support with me. The amount of time I need is not covered by my plan. I've already been told, that if I say I feel unwell, my worker is physically not allowed to leave me unless I'm admitted to hospital.

I'm really hoping that the psychiatrist can get me some treatment, whether that is in an ED unit, the psychiatric unit or on a medical unit for a adequate treatment to stabilise for both medical & mental health purposes.
I don't feel well & if I tell any of my healthcare professionals, 

Most of the nurses & doctors on the current ward I'm on are ignorant or oblivious to my ED & most of the other ones don't care. I know the minority that do understand & care will fight tooth & nails.
I've been advocating for myself but I don't really know what an admission for an ED entails. 

Please help me out here. I've never been this scared for my health due to this ED.

I'm sorry for the extremely long post & I thank those of you who have gotten to the end.",1678276238.0
