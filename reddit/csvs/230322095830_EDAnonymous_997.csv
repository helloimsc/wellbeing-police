Please help.",16,11xou0t,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11xou0t/this_is_so_dumb_but_this_disease_actually_has/,4,"I'm already prepared to be crucified for this so please just give it to me straight lol.  Apologies in advance for a long and potentially very triggering post (TW ed and racism)

&#x200B;

So CRT in this context refers to Critical Race Theory, and it has been a hot-button issue in the last few election cycles in the US because some parents are convinced that it is being taught to their elementary school aged children and they don't want that.  

The school that I received my certification from for my career offers an online portal with continuing education classes.  These are self-guided and not graded; you receive credits for completing the course.  It consists of 6-10 two hour long video lectures with optional assignments to complete after each.  My school recently started offering a course called ""Dismantling Racism in (Our Profession).""  The description said it contextualizes the issues using CRT framework to help us confront our biases and avoid things like microaggressions in the workplace.  That sounded perfect to me-I get to learn how to be a better ally AND learn what the heck CRT actually is, as opposed to whatever Ron DeSantis says it is this week.  So I downloaded the course.

To give some background for me, I am in my 30s, and, as indicated in the title a White Person^(TM).  I have an anxiety disorder and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, for which I take medication.  I have also dealt with disordered eating since puberty.  I went to therapy for it as a teenager but had to stop at 18 when I was bumped off my parents' insurance.  It was ok though because I had officially ""recovered,"" meaning I had started menstruating again after years of having no period.  I am happy to say that I have been menstruating ever since, but I unfortunately never really recovered in my mind.  A habit that I started on purpose as a teen but has become second nature is that I essentially take every little thing as a sign from the universe that I should lose weight.  My reflection is distorted in a storefront window?  Time to restrict!  Someone walks around me on the sidewalk?  They clearly gave me a wide berth because I am a wide person and therefor it's a sign to diet.  That kind of thing.  I never realized I was still unconsciously doing it or how destructive that kind of thinking was until now.

I downloaded the Dismantling Racism course and am having a lot of trouble getting through the third lecture.  First lesson was ""Intro to CRT"" and it was great, very informative.  The problem is that four times in these first two and a half lectures, the instructor has looked straight at the camera and said some variation of ""You white women are taking up too much space.  Yes, you.  You who are sitting there watching me now, you take up too much room.""  Now obviously she doesn't mean taking up physical space but rather metaphorical space (things like talking over/for marginalized people), but my disordered ass is hearing this loud and clear as a call to start restricting more.  We are currently in Lent and I'm fasting for religious reasons, and unfortunately once I start restricting it becomes addictive and I think I'm looking for any excuse to restrict more.

If the instructor only said this once I could get past it, but it comes up every few minutes and she really does her best to make it feel personal.  And the assignment for lecture 2 was literally to ""examine all the ways you are taking up too much room.""  The language in general is also vaguely fatphobic, which is weird because while the overall course is about racism, one of the later lectures is on LGBTQA issues, ableism, and fatphobia.  I'm honestly interested to hear what she says about fatphobia after the way she speaks about larger bodies in general (it's never disparaging to them, more of using them as a comparison to POC but it feels weird because she doesn't acknowledge that one can be both).  But to get to that lecture I have to figure out a way to stop taking this personally and letting it trigger me.  I'm of three minds about the whole thing.  

Mind 1 is my rational brain, which is saying to me You are not the main character, bitch.  How DARE you turn actual issues into something about your Fragile White Feelings?  You've literally turned into the kind of person you hate the most.

Mind 2 is my eating disorder brain, which is saying Watch the lectures for the free meanspo.  Embrace the self-hatred.  Transcend and grow \*\~\*SKiNnI\*\~\*

Mind 3 is the part of me that doesn't WANT this damn ED.  I don't *like* spending my every waking moment thinking about food or my body.  The reason I like doing these continuing ed lectures in the first place is that they offer distraction from all that.  I downloaded this course to learn how to be more compassionate to others; surely it's not too much to ask that the course instructor show compassion to those with larger bodies and/or eating disorders?

If you've read this far, thank you.  I could really use some advice.  Ideally about how to stop taking things personally and finish the course.  I've tried imagining the instructor saying something else when she talks about how much space I take up, but it isn't working out so well.  I also considered that I could wait until after Lent to continue it so I can avoid compounding my triggers, but then after Easter comes Summer Body season, which is triggering in its own way, so I could wait until fall.  Which is the most privileged shit ever!  Billions of people deal with racism every day and I have the option of waiting a few months to think about it???  That's fucked up and I don't like it.  I expected this course to make me uncomfortable but not for this reason.   I can't afford therapy and I also can't afford a full-blown relapse that will send me to the hospital.

Every day i have been eating (probably) around 5000 to 10000 calories, i already gained a little bit of (visible) weight which i dont mind since i know i am underweight and to be healthy i need to gain weight, but my stomach hurts so bad every day. I feel so out of control around food while at the same time i feel really in control and finally i feel free around food. I just hate the stomach aches so much and i just want to feel normal with food, tracking all my calories wasnt normal but neither is eating all day long.   


I think its a good thing im okay with the weight gain and ive been receiving compliments especially from my bf saying i look better and my body looks sexier, which feels great. So im definitely not feeling guilty about the calories, more just shitty that i dont have any control over what im eating and i dont feel like im eating intuitively at all, more just stuffing my face for no reason other than boredom.   


Saying all this, before i got anorexia i had severe binging every day and i was pretty overweight (hence why i wanted to lose weight resulting in my anorexia) so im scared that all of this is just my binging coming back.   


Ive been thinking of going back to tracking calories not to lose weight or to stop myself from gaining weight, but more just to be more concious about what im eating.   


Anyways, sorry for this long rant its currently 11:06 pm i just finished a long episode of eating and im stuffed as fuck. Had a good ass pizza tho which was nice and i also had energy drink which was probably not a good idea but whatever.

I used to be offended when people would talk about misogyny being a large factor in the development of eating disorders because obviously it's too complex to just be the result of beauty standards, but after reading more Feminist literature I have realised that the effects of misogyny are a lot wider than I thought. 

Maybe this was already obvious to everyone else, but I didn't recognise that the factors that went into the development of my eating disorder weren't just personal, but were also cultural - things like emotional abuse and sexual harrassment from a young age. Obviously these things happen to men too, but not close to the same rate they happen to women.

As women, we are also taught from a young age that our bodies are our greatest asset - it doesn't matter how smart or capable you are if you are a fat woman. Attributing women's feelings of hatred towards their own bodies as vain ignores the difficulties we face socially if we don't look a certain way.

Essentially my thoughts are this: a big reason why eating disorders develop in women more often than men is because women feel more disempowered as a result of misogyny, and our bodies are one of the only thing that we not only have power over but grant us power.

I don't know. I just wanted to rant a bit. What are everyone else's thoughts about this? I know that I haven't addressed the impact of intersecting identities such as being a person of colour (I am mixed race but look entirely white so I don't have the qualifications to talk about this), being LGBT (which I am but feel only adds to the feelings of disempowerment) and class (which again, adds to being disempowered).

I understand that early in recovery seeing the numbers can be triggering but isn't the goal of recovery to not be bothered by the number? Seeing the calories is not supposed to be triggering, you can hopefully see it and move on if you are recovered. Some people need to know the cals for health reasons and listing it on the menu or making it easily accessible helps them make informed choices. In general I think it's good for people to be conscious of the fact that their Cheesecake is 1500 cals (ahem Cheesecake Factory). Not saying they shouldn't eat it, but be mindful of how much and how often they eat it. I guess what I'm saying is that we can't avoid our triggers forever and can't expect to be accommodated for. Initially I understand not wanting to see calories or weight in recovery but in the end if the number doesn't matter why do people avoid it at all costs?

Twitter will rave about how much they care about mental illness but the moment the mental illness is something worst than depression, anxiety or ADHD, they go 180 and start making fun of mentally ill people.

1) j would be served 3 meals and 3 snacks. i have 15-30 minutes for each one. every day the meals get progressively bigger. if meals weren’t finished, Ensure would replace them based on what i ate. if ensure isn’t finished, a feeding tube would be put through my nose and into my stomach to feed me the nutrients. calories were not mentioned, weight gain was not mentioned. all my nurse said was that I was here to “get my heart healthy again” and “food was my medicine”. I obviously didn’t, and still don’t, really give a shit, but oh well. 

2) a sitter would be present with me at all times in the room, even when family is present, and even when I’m asleep all throughout the night. they would need to listen to me use the bathroom and everything. when it’s meal time they usually don’t push me to eat. i just eat what i can and they don’t really take action. it’s the nurse that does. 

3) the hospital is restless. people come in almost every hour or so to check my vitals. I am awaken at 6am for my purse to be taken and my first blood work. sometimes I’m awoken at midnight if my heart rate goes down too low, there’s an alarm that goes off. 

4) I can’t get off my bed. I need to ask for permission to do anything out of my bed, and I must wait an hour after meals to go to the bathroom. 

I hate it here. I just want to go home and be normal again. The meals just leave me uncomfortably full and it ends up in chronic constipation. I need to hold in gas because someone is always in the room with me, which makes it even more excruciating. I wasn’t allowed to shower because they claim I may “get dizzy from standing for too long” so I need to sit on a stool and shower. Even if I’m incredibly full to the point of nausea, in 2 hours I’m fed again. I feel like every day I am getting fatter and fatter. It’s terrible, im just getting depressed here. The hospital says their goal is to get my heart healthy but I know they just want to see me gain weight. I’ll update more soon. Xoxo",1679359728.0
88,I’m not “sick enough” to get help.

Counting calories, restricting, chewing and spitting. I’m getting ready to graduate college and I’m still sick. I think I’m sick but at the same time, I don’t.

Whenever I reached out for help, I was never taken seriously. My BMI has always been healthy and I’ve never lost a concerning amount of weight. It’s a cycle, you see. I starve, loose (censored) pounds, feel happy about the weight loss and start to eat again. Of course once I start eating, the weight and then some comes back.

I’ve gone to doctors, school counselors, asking for help. In 6th grade I wrote a story for English class about a girl named Ana who would starve herself to feel beautiful. The feedback my teacher gave: “Great work tackling such a sensitive topic!” How the hell did she not send me to the councilor’s office? How did she not hear my cry for help.

When I asked my guidance counselor in school for resources on eating disorders, she gave me some pamphlet and asked if it was for a friend. I told her it was for me. She said, “Hon you look as healthy as can be.” 

I’ve gone to doctors to ask for help. They would tell me I was fine. My vitals were fine, my blood work was fine, my weight was fine. “There’s nothing that indicates you have an eating disorder. As a matter of fact, you’re perfectly healthy.” Everything was fine, right? It felt so invalidating. No healthy person would obsess over calories. No healthy person would search up the calories of toothpaste, mouthwash, lip balm, chapstick. No healthy person would scroll through ED and thinspo content for hours on end. I’m sick, but not sick enough to get help.

I guess you can’t get help unless you need a feeding tube and barely have the strength to stand. I’m done asking for help seeing that I’m clearly not sick.",1679377860.0

nervous because i’ll be alone at home the next few days and feel like i’ll either >!restrict!< or >!binge and purge!< which obviously doesn’t help me to gain any weight. also, when i was a higher weight i had a lot muscle and fat and so my arms looked big and i got made fun of a lot and i’m so scared cause that’s a big insecurity of mine.

I started ""recovery"" at the beginning of 2022 and it was fine the first few months. I had less joint & bone pain during these months even though I was extremely stressed and I only gained like 4kg but I'm already at a higher weight so it wasn't exactly a pleasant number to look at. I also started moving so much suddenly since uni was finally offline again but I think it was too much for my body. My period suddenly started to get closer each time and I bled less heavy (which I first thought was a good thing because I'm pretty sure it only became heavier once I became vegetarian and got an ed). After six months I wasn't as hungry anymore, so I thought ""well, my hunger cues are back so I don't have to eat that much anymore"" and I then started to do even more cardio (paired with moving lots of heavy stuff) & stopped going to the gym (where I did some weight training to build muscle). So from June to August it was basically just me laying down, walking a ton & lifting heavy stuff (because I had to, I could feel every bone & muscle hurt everytime afterwards, I would've stopped if I didn't have to do it). Then in August I had an internship in an elementary school and I got so triggered so bad because all the children in my class were so skinny😭 I also had to walk even more during that since I couldn't take the car and the school was still within walking distance. I still ate ""enough"" though, at least always as much as my BMR (usually even more since I burned so much). I only lost like 7kgs going from 92 to 85 (though I also saw some lower numbers before when I was dehydrated lol) from June to December last year and I'm nearly at the weight again where I was actively throwing up and restricting. Even back then (and with 5kg less at 80kg) I didn't have that much pain in my bones/muscles, neither at my lowest (but that was when I  was 16 before I realized that I had an ed) at 69/70kg did I ever really have that kind of pain even though I've lost like 52/53kg.

I think all those years of starvation, constant weight loss & gain, probably many deficiencies & not enough muscle mass finally caught up with me🤡 I barely have any muscles it's actually somewhat embarrassing, I can't even stand up straight because I don't have enough upper body muscles but sitting, standing laying down also hurts either my bones, my muscles or both. I feel like the only way my body still functions is due to the painful muscle tension I have from the weak muscles I have...
I think it's genuinely time to work on building muscles even if it means I gain weight because I can't take this pain anymore. Did anyone's bone/joint/muscle pain get better in recovery? How do you relieve this kind of pain, like any kind of exercises that can help?",1679386369.0

Seriously, it's been MONTHS since the last time I remember having a piece of fruit or a vegetable. My diet has been this way, especially as an adult.

I'm 5'9, and weigh >!220 pounds,!< which is the highest I've ever weighed. My current BMI is >!32.5 (obese)!<. I really don't look my weight, though I've always been on the larger side as I come from a bigger German family. When I've told people in the past that I don't eat any fruits or vegetables, I've gotten comments like ""what? how are you not HUGE??"" and stuff.

Now, as I get older, the weight gain is getting more obvious. I feel it more, too. I've always fluctuated between >!190-210,!< as I sometimes go through periods of time where I avoid food for most of the day when it starts to stress me out. It isn't intentional, but it happens. 

My mental health, my motivation, and my energy levels have ALWAYS been lower than everyone else. I'm almost positive it's because I get almost no nutrition. My diet literally only consists of: a quad latte in the mornings with oatmilk and a TON of nutella, smuckers uncrustables, general tso's frozen chicken entrees but with no sauce (just plain), string cheese, sister schuberts dinner yeast rolls, rotini pasta either plain with butter or vodka sauce, and occasionally fried rice with soy sauce, oil, and eggs. I eat almost nothing else, and eat these things in various large quantities throughout the day. I order EVERYTHING without veggies. No peas or carrots in the fried rice, no chunks of tomato/veggies in the Vodka sauce (i strain it before putting it on my pasta), etc.

I've tried ""sneaking"" veggies into my food. I can ALWAYS taste the difference. I've tried the Nurture Life meal kit that is supposed to sneak nutrition into meals for children. Nothing works. I lose my entire appetite any time I try to eat something healthier, my mouth gets dry, and I'd literally rather not eat at all. When I try to eat something different than normal, it just tastes awful and feels like pure suffering. I end up eating nothing (not even on purpose, I just continuously ""push off"" eating) until I cave and buy something from the above list. 

I'm going to therapy already, but we mainly focus on other aspects of my life (trust me, I know food is a priority, but there are other priorities too and we HAVE talked about it). I know I should probably go to a nutritionist, but I don't have enough faith in myself to trust that I'd actually eat what they suggest. I've looked at other reddit posts from people asking ""how to start eating fruits and veggies?"" and ""how to get fruit and vegetable nutrients without eating fruits or vegetables"" but the replies are always the same; that there's no other real options other than to just eat them. I know that's the truth, but it's just so discouraging.

I don't know, I came here hoping to get some advice and maybe even to hear some success stories from other adults who have conquered this, but I really think I just need to vent in a space where hopefully there are others who understand. It's a basic necessity that is a constant struggle, and I just wish I didn't have to spend so much of my energy towards worrying about food.

Am I the only one that has a strange relationship with food due to their career choice?

Sometimes, I feel like I don't have ""typical"" ED thoughts with food. There are a lot of ""bad"" foods that don't appeal to me because simply don't even see them as something edible? 

I can explain. I work at a bakery & am currently working with developing recipes for some smaller, women owned brands. I have to be adventurous with my ingredient choices because often time these brands fit dietary restrictions that I don’t  follow. I might buy vegan, paleo, or other foods that I would not purchase otherwise. So to me these foods naturally aren't super appealing and have more of a functional  use than to eat. I also practice photography, so leftover foods may become props instead of snacks.

Additionally I work at a bakery & have been a hobby baker my entire life. I am very used to using ""actual foods"" in my baking such as pre-made cookies, spreads, etc. So whenever I have the chance to eat them I don't want to. It's like if someone asked me go eat flour, I wouldn't eat it, so why would I  eat an oreo?

It didn't really occur to me as weird until I was working the other day and asked my colleagues what I should make with the leftover biscoff cookies & oreos I have.

Lastly, could I request a dietitian at my appointment? My family hasn't really been supportive so I'm trying to take the steps on my own. Appreciate any feedback:)))

I used to eat whatever I wanted whenever I wanted it. I used to drink and vape and smoke weed and take pills. I used to choose my soap based on how it smelled. Now I'm too obsessed with trying to look as good as possible and too scared of health problems to be that version of myself.

158,Ranting about my mom,2,11wujxw,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11wujxw/ranting_about_my_mom/,0,"I made a post a few minutes ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11wtuol/talking_about_how_im_recovering/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1) with my backstory basically, but the tldr is that I’ve been recovering from an ED for a year that my mom never knew about, and I’m my healthiest ever mentally, and healthier than I’ve been in years physically.

My mom is very open about trying to lose weight. Especially with me. Like, excessively open. For weeks to even months at a time she becomes obsessed with her weight, and then stops, and is normal. She’s not particularly large either, but that’s neither here nor there.

She’s currently in the midst of a health kick, and it’s even worse than normal. For the past few days she’s been talking about MY health, and it just hurts. Yesterday I was looking in the kitchen for something to eat for dinner (she doesn’t buy much I can eat for dinner honestly) and from the living room (visibly from the kitchen) she asks me what I’m doing. I told her I was looking for dinner, omitting the fact that I felt absolutely ravenous and this would have been the first time I ate dinner in days (again, she doesn’t buy much I can eat during these health kicks, and I’ve made this very clear).

“You had a lot of pasta for lunch earlier, so you should probably eat something light.” Fuck. That shouldn’t hurt so much but it does. I was so hungry, but in that moment all I could feel was sick. I basically just walked away and went to my room without saying anything at that point, and I vaguely remember while I was walking into my room she said something about looking after my health.

I had some ravioli for lunch (the pasta she mentioned). For breakfast I had eaten more but not SO much, I had some mini eclair type things which I think added up to maybe 1-2 donuts worth of food, and sometime between those and the ravioli I’d eaten some peach yogurt and apple slices with caramel. I’d also had an arizona ice tea someone gave to me as a gift a few weeks ago. Not the healthiest food ever, but honestly pretty good, especially considering how I’d normally eat. I’m hoping my point comes across in that, yeah, I didn’t eat the most nutritional food yesterday, but honestly better than normal, and nothing bad enough to warrant saying I should eat a light dinner, a full 9 hours after I had eaten last.

That made me feel shitty and I went to bed hungry, my stomach actually rumbling, but by this morning I felt pretty okay about it. After school I came home, and my mom called me from her work not long after to ask if I’d taken care of my chores yet. I told her I hadn’t yet, which she was fine with because I’d only been home for a bit. Then she asked if something was wrong, and I explained that I was just tired, which I have been a lot lately considering senioritis has been hitting hard and she doesn’t know but I’m secretly taking a second math class that she told me she didn’t want me taking yet (complicated situation but I’ve got an A so 🤷🤷🤷). 

She responded my telling me I needed to take a walk, something she does regularly when I’m tired or mad or anything. Annoying but whatever. I, annoyed, just said okay (knowing full well I will not be taking a walk because I don’t want to, don’t have the energy, and don’t really care), but this time it turned into a spiel about taking care of my heart, and my health, and how I need to be healthier, and how starting next week she’s going to start telling me to do this way more. I basically grunted in response to get off the phone as quickly as possible because I just felt awful about all of what had just happened.

I don’t know, I just feel like shit. I’ve been doing better than ever, I mean EVER, but my mom is suddenly treating me like I’m in awful shape and it’s making me feel shitty. The worst part is I cannot in any way tell her to stop (just believe me, it’s just not possible to get her to stop while maintaining a lick of privacy or without suddenly everyone in the world knowing) so I just have to hope that this phase ends soon and that she doesn’t go through another one until after I’ve left for college.",1679343688.0

I’m fed up of living in fear. I want to recover and actually DO SHIT with my life instead of just plan my funeral (what I was actually doing) I want a life. Not a body.

That being said I’m currently in hospital for physical health (eating disorder) I’m trying to slowly increase what I’m eating. It really hard. Like, crying over every meal and looking like a pleb because there are people with real problems, kind of hard. Because I haven’t been eating enough (the meal plan what was aimed to get me from >!100!<calories to >!2000!<calories over 14 days )and accidentally lost more weight, they want to fit an NG tube.

I will work with them but it’s almost like they are trying to make it harder for me. I’m 18 years old and yes I may be sectioned but if I’m making choices (like eating) that are going against my Ed voice, they shouldn’t be allowed to tube me. It’s literally making me NOT want to recover. I want to eat WITHOUT threats of tubes. This is not how recovering is supposed to be. 
Currently I have increased what I’m eating by >!400!< calories and am on bed rest. This is in the course of a week. I wanted to reverse diet my way out of this but that didn’t work.

Sorry for grammar mistakes and weird thought flow. 



I wish I was born pretty and skinny. I can workout until I pass out, and restrict my eating until I don’t feel hungry anymore but it doesn’t matter because even though I’m starving myself half to death I’ll never be as skinny as someone who just exists without thinking about the calories in their food or the amount of exercise they need to do. I can put on my silly little makeup but it can’t cover how ugly I am. Even if I look good with makeup and expensive clothing and I’m all dolled up it doesn’t matter because the truly pretty, popular, and skinny people don’t like me they see me as beneath and I’ll never be them. 

I know this girl who has been with so many successful and smart men simply because she’s gorgeous while I’ll never experience feeling loved and valued. I had a “boyfriend” for a couple months my junior year of high school, but I initiated it and I don’t think he ever truly loved me back. He told me he was too busy and immediately asked out a girl the next day. What’s wrong with me. Am I undeserving of love? 

I don’t think I’m atrociously ugly or have severe personality issues but I seriously start doubting it when I get 0 male attention. I post my self all dolled up on the internet to get validation. I just want people to tell me I’m gorgeous and I’m hot. But as soon as I take off my makeup and log off the internet I’m faced with the reality that I’m fat and ugly and nothing will change that. I feel like a poser like I’m just trying to be fun, cool, pretty and skinny but I’ll never be because I wasn’t born that way and I’ll never get to live that life.

I’ve lost weight before but gained it all back and more because I’m a disgusting pig who can’t control myself from not inhaling everything in my sight. 

I’ve never been called pretty in real life by a male. 

I keep thinking that if I just become underweight again I will be finally seen as beautiful. Logically it won’t happen because I did it before and nothing happened but I just want to be skinny so instead of being fat and ugly im just ugly.",1679304566.0

She used to be blatantly bulimic(apparently not anymore), now she is just disordered. We are in our 20s btw. 

Jana had a myriad of random health problems that don't make sense, like random kidney infections, acid reflux, severe facial bloating even though she isn't overweight, random muscle pain, idk. Chronic issues. She's unhealthy.

Here is what she does not eat: 

1. Gluten (at all), so no bread or pasta
2. Soy (she is ""allergic"" but this means she will get a pimple) 
3. Any kind of meat because it's ""too heavy"" 
4. Chickpeas/beans 
5. Most dairy, until recently
6. Bananas/avocados (for a time period)

I will say, Jana definitely binges in secret, because while she isn't overweight, she's not underweight. What that food is, I don't know. 

Jana won't notify events of her dietary restrictions and gets upset when when they don't have food catered towards her, she gets upset that a restaurant ""doesnt have options for her"" before she even looks at the menu. Jana talks about her dietary restrictions/mostly-made up allergies once every other hour, it's almost an obsessive topic of conversation for her.  I say mostly made up because it may be an intolerance, but definitely nothing more. She doesn't have an EpiPen, coeliacs, or any other kind of serious disease.  

It's extremely annoying to travel or go anywhere with Jana to a degree, because she self-restricts and gets upset that she's hungry and can't eat. I don't know what to do. It's also just really unfortunate because her body keeps malfunctioning, in my opinion, to tell her she's grossly unhealthy, and she's blatantly ignoring it",1679348234.0

eventually i ended up getting into weightlifting and was able to eat somewhat like a normal person and semi recover with some lingering behaviours. right now my body is around the size it used to be but now a higher muscle percentage although i still have a decant layer of fat overtop but sometimes i can see abs when i flex. i wouldn’t say i’m super muscular or anything although i’ve been told by strangers that i look like i lift weights. 

recently i’ve gained this ‘reputation’ of being really big/strong and friends make comments about my ability to win a fight or comparing me to others saying i’m bigger. this has really started to grind away at my confidence as my goal was always to become lean and not big although i understand that it’s a big part of gym culture deep down i just wanna be small and fragile.

i’m really at a loss because weightlifting used to be the only thing which kept me sane but because of the comments i have started doing exclusively cardio and only training legs once a week. i wish i was just able to eat in moderation so that i could become a little smaller but i’m just too obsessed with food and my all it nothing mindset is causing me to go back to my old ways.

I know it’s not my fault I constantly get ghosted on dating apps but I can’t help but to feel that it’s because I’m this hideous blob of fat. 
My shortest relationship (and only) was 4 years, I have to be a somewhat decent person if I’m able to date someone for that long (and he was dating me before my ED hit the fan for the 2nd time at my hw and I dropped weight, but I gained all of my weight back bc recovery during our relationship so all I see is the hideous person I used to be). 

All of his friends and everyone around me (besides my family) complimented my weight loss. My family saw how sick I looked but I was suddenly seen as “average” for once in my god damn life and I noticed a change in his behavior of getting more protective of me and jealous around men when I was at my lw. 


I mean, it sucks joking around about “life be like that sometimes” and being ghosted = free restriction bc I’m trying to hide the pain of never being good enough. I’m so tired of hating myself more than I ever have before because of fucking tinder and bumble (thank god I was banned from tinder recently or else I’d probably go further down a spiral).   Im so tired of KNOWING anyone I’m talking to is seeing someone better, thinner and more attractive. I’m tired of being good at nothing. 


I quit drinking and made it 5 months before I said “fuck it” and got blacked out alone on my birthday (in my apartment, so the addict in me just said “at least it’s safer” and drinking alone on Saint Patrick’s day in my apartment. I find any excuse to drink to numb out the pain of never being enough for anyone.)",1679330259.0

178,Talking about how I’m recovering,0,11wtuol,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11wtuol/talking_about_how_im_recovering/,0,"I (17 years) have dealt with some form of eating disorder since 7th grade, maybe earlier. It’s always been some weird amalgamation, losing a bunch of weight over the course of 1-3 weeks, gaining it all back, maybe repeat the cycle up to 2 more times, and then 1-6 months of eating pretty normally, and ending up within about 5-10 pounds of my weight, on either side.

Anyways, for the past year I’ve slowly been healing without realizing it, both mentally and physically. My weight is still not somewhere I’d like it to be but I’m still feeling more confident in my body, and I’ve decided to focus more on building healthy habits until college, when I can put more energy into actually losing the weight, because I will have more control over my surroundings, what I eat, and no more guilt from family barring seeing them in person, plus quick and easy access to a gym where I plan on working on my weight, as well as building my strength, as I participate in color guard so I believe it would be beneficial to me personally. Usually I’m not a major fan of the “wait until this to start improving” mindset, like new years resolutions and such, but I’ve begun to recognize the role my environment plays in my health and that any attempt to lose weight will just not be successful.

See, my issues started as a kid. On top of insane amounts of other trauma from my family and such, my father and his family brutally fat shamed me as a kid, and even up through some family therapy sessions over a year after putting my foot down and moving out. It was basically the cause of my eating issues overall. But my mother has a habit of triggering and amplifying those issues by a million, both by purchasing super sugary snacks and basically encouraging overeating, but then talking about health and fitness and encouraging me to lose weight, and pointing out my weight whenever she “notices it’s gone down” (which always happens to be after a gain in weight?)

Like I said, over the past year I’ve been healing. A lot of that has been due to my boyfriend over the last 8 months, even before we were dating I started to feel better about myself just talking to them. And after seeing them in person for the first time, as well as purchasing a binder so I can bind when my chest feels like a nuisance (sometimes I just wanna be flat 🤷) my confidence has been really up! It’s not exactly amazing but sometimes I look at my body in the mirror and smile without crying. It’s nice to feel good sometimes.

As I said, I’m also working on healthy habits, like brushing my teeth, showering more consistently, doing my homework, beginning to work on my obsession with sugar overload my replacing sweets, energy drinks, and artificial things with fruit, tea, and higher quality versions of the things I like for when I do crave them, so at least I know I’m still treating my body with the respect it deserves. I’ve been drinking energy drinks since 5th grade, so after 7 years I finally decided to switch to tea to save my taste buds, and while I’ll still treat myself with good old fast food sometimes, I want to raise the quality of what I’m consuming in a realistic and comfortable way, and admitting that I am not going to start eating salads and broccoli, but maybe replacing my nerds clusters with some chunks of pineapple or pomegranate(which are just as, if not more, sweet and acidic in my opinion, and genuinely leave me even happier than eating the candy) or drinking some fruity green tea instead of monster ultra (a much harder adjustment considering the fact that I don’t really like tea, but I think I need to work on learning how to prepare it and what to add to make it suit my tastes while trying to get myself more used to subtlety in taste rather than sugar explosion).

I’m excited to move forward with these things, and while I’m struggling to consistently maintain these habits I know I’ll improve as long as I keep trying. I think I’m on the right path, and once I have the power to better control what I do and eat, I’ll have built the habits to make losing weight safely and comfortably significantly easier, and healed my relationship with food enough to be able to feel happy about what I’m doing without feeling that constant anxious, crazed feeling that used to come with my crashes.

She’s always be skinnier than me (27F) and always is trying to feed me. 

Unfortunately when the pandemic hit, I had to move back home. I was depressed and eating everything. My mom was doing the same. Jan 2021 hit, and I finally was fed up with my peak weight of 190 (highest I’ve ever been) at 5’3, and started OMAD. It was the best thing I’ve ever done. I was single, journaling every day, sober and I felt like my best self. I got down to 128lbs and was so happy. 

I started dating my bf December 2021, and had a huge wave of depression hit that same month - it has never left. I stopped playing video games, I don’t feel like myself at all. He’s skinny af, counts his calories (pretty sure he has an ed but will never admit it) and goes to the gym almost every day, otherwise he actually will have a panic attack. 

I have lost control of my diet. We have a long distance relationship where we see each other probably once a month. I think I’m really unhappy and have been. He’s a great guy but he stresses me out so much and he exhausts me. Whenever we’re together he always wants to match, bite for bite, with food. I don’t want to do that. He’s 6ft and mostly lean muscle, he has a faster metabolism, I tell him all of the time I can’t eat as much as him. He says he “feels bad if I don’t eat” as much as him, and I have to explain to him that I’m simply full - normal portion not restricting.

Now I’m back up to 160lbs and I want to scream and cry and I’m so much unhappier than I’ve been in such a long time. I feel like I have no control of my life while in a relationship, and living at my mom’s. 

My mom encourages bad eating habits when I’m feeling depressed and she sort of gets way too hype to tell me to eat something unhealthy and then goes to eat a salad herself. Then I sit in guilt.

Yes, I absolutely have control over my own eating habits - I shouldn’t let them effect me but I’m so depressed to begin with all I want to do is eat for the dopamine rush or whatever it is. I don’t feel like I’m blaming them for my lack of control, maybe my boyfriend - but my mom is absolutely sabotaging me.

Two and a half years later and I still can’t get over the fact that I was an asshole to my ex-boyfriend due to my ED.

This is a rant.

Had a dinner date last night with this guy I am (was) seeing. For my own peace of mind, ordered a caesar salad. When our food came, he jokingly said: “You’re not one of those girls who order just a plain salad and a water, right? That’s fucked up! (hahaha)”.

I’ve been spiraling into disorders thoughts ever since. I cannot stop thinking about what I had and what I missed. 

I can't get out of it, but I admit that I failed as a person. I was dating this wonderful man who was good to me but whose affection I took for granted because I was too damn preoccupied with food and physical appearance. Here are some silly examples:

ROMANTIC TRIP

Him: “Babe, let’s take some pictures, save this moment!”

Me: “No, I’m fat!” (bodychecks!)

SUNDAY AFTERNOON

Him: “Sweetie, my mom invited us to lunch… do you want to go?”

Me: “I would rather not, but thank you” (looks up >!thinspo to cope with fasting!<!)

RANDOM TUESDAY

Him: Honey, I bought you \[insert expensive chocolate here\]! Have some! I hope you like them!”

Me: “Oh, that’s so nice!” (proceeds to >!throw AWAY in order not to throw UP!<!)

But I’m focusing too much on myself. He was the one who was neglected. There was a time I did not care about him whatsoever. I was too busy putting all my efforts and thoughts on the “perfect body” that I absolutely forgot he was there. This realization kills me now.

He left.

Well, long story short:

Count calories, restrict, weigh everything down to the gram, restrict successfully for weeks but then get thrown off one day (usually because of some restaurant meal or my family trying to feed me homecooked meals and not having the heart to refuse like a loser) and that kickstarts my body trying to actively fight me by making me eat spontaneously.

My Dad said I'm starting to look ""frighteningly thin"" and I don't even believe him. I ate over my limit, I ate over my sedentary maintenance calories (even though every logical part of my brain knows that I'm not actually sedentary I still can't bear myself to accept my maintenance as anything more than the sedentary number), I'm scared and I wanna set myself on fire.

I literally went through a period of barely eating anything with added sugar, at most only once a week so it naturally just decreased my craving for anything sweet other than fruit at this point, but they still buy or make baked goods for me and say I have to eat it. I'm trying not to lash out but I still get extremely mad and irritated when I am forced to eat empty calories like this especially when it contains sugar. Before I lost any weight my parents always warned us never to eat too much sugar and that it has no nutritional value so it makes me angry that they're acting like it's no big deal that I'm having it multiple times a week now. To make matters worse, I used to be on the other extreme because I used to binge on candy or packaged snacks that igot from school all the time because I never had time to eat breakfast. I would try to get food from other people whenever I could and I wasn't overweight but I still gained weight from overeating. When I finally started saying no to dessert more often  I actually stopped liking a lot of things I used to like, or at least started being able to resist them and just avoided them altogether. I don't get why I can't just eat more of the healthy foods we eat instead of adding unnecessary sugar to my diet. Even after I gain back the weight I need, I'm going to avoid processed sugar in many ways because I know it's unhealthy, so why feed it to me now? Today they bought $15 macarons and they didn't even taste that good.

237,How do you objectively judge appearance?,6,11vr20m,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11vr20m/how_do_you_objectively_judge_appearance/,0,"How do you know if the way you see yourself is disordered or not?    
I previously have body dysmorphia but that went away when I reached a healthy weight. On my last appointment with ED clinic they asked me to guess my weight and I guessed correctly within 1kg of the actual number.    

But I’m not sure if I still see things objectively or not. Last time I weighed myself I was the same weight as that. But recently I’ve felt I was getting bigger, but when I measured with tape measure I was a little bit smaller in some places and a little bigger on the waist.   

I’m just really curious what others see when they look at me. Does anyone know if there’s some kind of database of typical measurements based on height and things? So I can work out if I appear slim or not?   

The weight I’ve been maintaining is a BMI >!19!< so I suppose that’s my “set point”. It’s same as my twin sister. But might have changed muscle mass. I haven’t weighed in a little while though.",1679246214.0
238,in a weird situation with a friend who’s probably ED’d,7,11vpqlh,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11vpqlh/in_a_weird_situation_with_a_friend_whos_probably/,0,"I (who am also ED’d) have a friend of 8 years whom I’ve been very close with, but see rarely in person because we live in different cities.

There were times she would send me photos of herself where she would be stressed out from work and appear suddenly kinda thin, but I felt commenting on that would be rude.  In an Instagram post on the very last slide, she posted a note she wrote that ended with, “I WILL DO THIS.  I WILL GAIN WEIGHT.”

I was surprised because that was the first time I saw she ever had thoughts like that.  She’s never told me about anything related to weight or dieting during our whole friendship.

Then I visited her later that month.  She seemed to have gained weight and was beaming and healthy.  We went to the beach and had another friend take photos of us in bikinis.  Afterwards, she asked if she could have all 45 photos (she was adamant on having ALL of them, they were just bursts taken at the same spot and really just 3 different poses) that were taken.

Later on, she asked, “I wonder if I should start working out more! My booty looks kinda flat… do you think I should go to the gym?” I answered, “Well if you like the feeling of working out sure, but you don’t need to go just to change the way your butt looks.  You already look great the way you are.”

A couple days after that, we were hanging out with a male mutual friend, and he was joking about picking me up, saying I must be X lbs (which was a weight that was quite far lower than my actual weight.)

Then my friend (who is about exactly my height) asked me, “You must be Y lbs, right?!  I’m certain about this, because I also used to be that weight!”  I was like… “ummm… roughly?” (Honestly I was a bit caught off guard.) She said, “Yeah, I’m Z lbs right now.  I was once X lbs and I doooo not recommend.”

X lbs is a pretty low weight and I was kind of surprised!…. I don’t know when this occurred exactly and I was also not sure how to react because for one, I’ve told her I’ve had EDs before and two, she mentioned it so casually that it felt like she was expecting some casual responses back.

The following month I visited it did appear she lost some weight which made me sad that I triggered her somehow.

I’m not sure what to do.  I also feel unsettled by not knowing how long she’s struggled with this and if she’s always felt like she was competing with me.  I also feel bad for being a trigger by just… existing??  idk.  I was a healthy bmi at the time.",1679243311.0

I hate it. I’d like to give in and just accept that some weeks I’ll gain more and maybe some weeks I’ll maintain or lose. Really I want to stop weighing myself but I feel like if someone else sees my weight I have to see it too.

I know blind weighing is an option but if someone else sees it I want to as well.

I’m on the cusp of being a healthy weight which makes it harder too.

How do you cope?",1679256303.0

272,Hair loss ruined my life + I never knew I had an eating disorder. Here’s how big of an idiot I am…,44,11v3mpx,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11v3mpx/hair_loss_ruined_my_life_i_never_knew_i_had_an/,0,"Hi friends. 30 yr old female here. About 11 years ago when I was 19 I started experiencing sudden and drastic hairloss. I lost roughly 70% of my normal volume in a matter of months. I was completely devastated and it sent me mentally spiraling. This was my first year away from home after high school. I was in such a terrible mental state that I decided I needed to go back home for a year and allow myself to rid my mind of stress and maybe that would bring my hair back. 

Well sure enough, a year of being back home DID bring my hair back. It wasn’t as full as it was before it fell out but at least my scalp was no longer showing. I felt like my old self again. So now with my new little hairs and a glimmer of confidence, I decided to leave home again. Things were great for about 7 months… until they weren’t. One day I was taking a shower and I was horrified to find handfuls of diffuse hair falling out again. At this point, I was a young person trying to make it in the world and knew I couldn’t take another year off to go sit in my hometown. 

For the next 8 years I would experience consistent diffuse hairloss. I couldn’t understand it. I felt cursed. It stripped me of all of my confidence. It ruined friendships because I felt too ugly to be seen. It kept me trapped in a loveless relationship because even though he was toxic, at least he accepted me with hideously thin hair. It ruined so many career opportunities because with zero confidence behind my words I became a timid shell that couldn’t speak her mind or add value anywhere. I didn’t think it could get much worse… until it did.

6 years ago I started having chronic digestive issues. I was told I had SIBO, Gastroparesis etc… This news sent me spiraling once again. I decided to make my health my full focus, so I began implementing many different healing modalities and diets. I did the elemental diet, FODmaps, And supplements out the wazoo. I’ve tried everything from paleo to vegan to raw vegan to fruitarian. I became highly orthorexic and obsessed with clean eating. I told myself that not eating was better than eating something that was “not clean”. And even though I was taking all of these steps that seemed like they were healing, As time went on I was feeling worse and worse. Aside from the digestion, I was always so exhausted, I had extremely bad brain fog, chronic tension was building up in all of my muscles, I was always cold to the bone, completely disassociated, had difficulty breathing, wounds took ages to heal. It seemed like there was always a new symptom popping up. 

It wasn’t until recently that I realized I HAVE A FUCKING EATING DISORDER.
 
This revelation blew my mind. It was like my whole life flashes before my eyes and I could finally connect the dots. When my hair first started falling out 11 years ago after I left home, It wasn’t because I was too stressed, it was because I wasn’t eating enough. And then when I returned home for a year and my hair grew back, it was because my mom was cooking 3 means a day for me again. And when I left after that year of being home, I stopped eating again so the hair fell out again! 

I’ve realized that I never learned how to properly take care of myself. My eating disorder was never intentional. I never wanted to lose weight or be stick thin. I genuinely thought eating the way I did was okay. I thought not eating breakfast was okay. I thought forgetting to eat was okay. I thought not eating when you’re sad or heartbroken was okay. I didn’t realize that each individual person is meant to hit a daily caloric intake for a very important reason. Those 2000 calories a day are what literally fuels every single function of your body. And when you don’t properly fuel yourself things start shutting down. It’s worth mentioning that I’ve recently also made the connection that I may have undiagnosed adult ADHD Which would explain my unintentional disordered eating patterns.

I have to laugh at myself (otherwise I’ll cry) because I can’t believe as a 30 year old person, I never realized this before. For years I searched high and low for a reason for my hair loss. A reason for all of my chronic mystery symptoms.
I feel like the biggest idiot on the planet. I feel like I destroyed myself. So many precious years I’ll never get back. So many missed moments because I’ve been subconsciously sabotaging myself. 

It’s been three months since I’ve been in recovery. I’ve been eating all in and have gained 25 pounds. I’m still bald headed and experiencing hairloss, but I’m hoping that in a years time that will change. Any inspirational stories or words about hair regrowth in ED recovery would be greatly appreciated. I know it sounds shallow, but having suffered with this confidence killer for so long, I just want to feel like myself again and see myself as beautiful for the first time in a long time. Thanks for being her. You are loved and appreciated.",1679180201.0

My husband told me just to try it, maybe it will be a good way to ease into it, and if I hate it I can see if I can take pause until a spot is open.


What is PHP virtual like? Is it still successful? Is it still somewhat enjoyable? Do you guys think I will get a spot sooner? What do you do in virtual?

It goes against out very nature. Like it or not, we do need food to survive and more importantly thrive. When the honeymoon period ends, the body is ready to eat again. That’s literally why it only feels good for a short period of time.

I didn’t think of eating disorders at being toxic and sickly until recently. I thought they were glamorous, funny, blah blah. I lied to myself that I didn’t have an eating disorder cuz I have ibs. I said I didn’t eat cuz I have ibs. Which I do struggle with ibs, but it doesn’t mean I don’t ALSO have anorexia/an Ed.

It’s awkward to see the stark reality of what I did to myself now. Some time in therapy and development I’m other areas of my life have shown me I actually could not move forward or live a life worth living without giving up starving myself. It was my number one coping mechanism for a long time. It did a lot of damage to how I look. I never got the hot body I was after. I look sick, like I have cancer. My hair line receded from the stress. My face is gaunt but greasy. I look like a little rat who got trapped in the sewer with no food and became anxious and skeletal

I’ve realized through therapy and journaling/CBT that I live in chronic stress. That I live in chronic anxiety and self hatred. That I have a massive people pleasing and low self esteem problem.

Guess what I thought a few months or a year ago? That starving would SOLVE these problems. Instead it’s just made me incredibly dizzy and weak and the anxiety is just as bad. The self hatred is worse cuz now I’ve been punishing myself so long it’s the only thing i know. Every time u starve urself out of punishment ur body is listening to u. Ur reinforcing that belief and habit. The belief that ur not good enough for even the most basic of human needs. Not to mention things like love, peace and thriving.

I know the whole “would u starve the child you” is not helpful. It just hurts. But what im seeing is this goes against our nature. Do kids who have not been mistreated abstain from and hate food? No. Everyone is obsessed with food. As someone who’s worked as a server before, every table is obsessed with food and all secretly feel like they’re weird and that other people are less obsessed with food.

One of the nicest tables I ever had was a group of what looked like anorexic teen girls. They didn’t harass me for more chips, pushed around and ate 1/3 of their little meals. Were so polite and present. But at what cost to themselves?

This will either take over ur life or put u in a position to need therapy and the painful grueling process of HAVING to eat. And having to face every feeling u pushed away like u pushed food away. So not only are u in a whirlwind of painful feelings in recovery, ur forced to stare at the damage uve done. See that u never met ur goals, u were never even close. :(  Seeing that ur body is storing fat in an awkward manner cuz it doesn’t trust u.

I still get extremely anxious around food, I get a loud message that tells me I shouldn’t eat dinner cuz I ate a meal already. But really u can do whatever u want. At this point I just copy what other people do cuz clearly I struggle to feel worthy of being alive. If thriving in any way. Other people eat all day every day so I guess I’ll try it too.

If u think ur beating the system somehow, ur not.",1679184725.0

On a side note, I haven't been diagnosed with an ED but honestly it feels like I'm developing one. :( Throughout this week I've been doing jump rope and exercising instead of studying for my finals for uni. Tracking everything rigorously from exercise minutes, spreadsheets and app. I've been spitting and chewing everything to get a taste. My mom bought these huge boxes of packaged cookies and goldish crackers. I didn't swallow an entire package  of either and would just spit back into the bags.

Lately I've been obsessed with sour cream and onion pringles so I'd buy a can everyday and spit and chew it all and it's really convenient because there's a lid for the can.  Also coke zero for lunch instead of food ;-; RIP my wallet honestly. I deadass have been spitting and chewing everyday for a good 30 minutes to 1 hour everyday + working out 1-2 hours it's ridiculous.

The spit and chew sessions have slowly just getting more and more. I first started like once a week with something small but now it's 3-5 things. I got so nervous when I almost got caught. My sister and mom walked into my room just as I was tying up my garbage bags and they said it smelt so bad. I just lied and said I bought some really stinky food and my mom said to go throw it out.

I'll be sitting in lecture taking notes but then my mind wanders to what am I gonna eat or not gonna eat. I wanna be skinny, etc. I've been heavily restricting lately and it's been working and I've lost some weight. But I finally binged today on an entire box of crackers from costco + pancakes + banana bread + oranges + bananas + boy bawang + cheese because I thought it would get my mind off food so I could finally focus on school but nope. I feel immensely guilty.

Arghhh I just can't with myself anymore. I just want to be skinny. I'm so close to my gw. Don't get me started on youtube and instagram as well. I've been watching AFMG, kpop videos, korean diet vlogs, weight loss journeys and all my time is gone there.

I get so annoyed when my mom also offers to make food even though I know she's just trying to help. My mind is so unfocused.

Its definitely hard, since its my main source of calories. I eat more calories in fruit then I do actual food, which is a problem I cant seem to get over. If I restrict fruit, Ill probably start starving again, since I dont think I can currently eat a larger amount of other things I mentioned without feeling guilty and purging, but if I keep going like this Ill probably go insane, I'm soo tired of these constant episodes of binges and purges, it also makes me feel like shit after, gives me stomach pains etc. I cant eat that shit in moderation, Ive tried but it being my favourite food that I have access to, I tend to go batshit and eat it like I've never seen food before. I think taking fruit out of my menu and working on eating more of other shit is the best decision and my anorexia seems to agree, but thats why I want more rational and non-biased opinions on this. Please help I'm boutta go nuts, these binge episodes make me feel like Ive gained a shit ton of weight, even tho I know I'm probably still eating in a caloric deficit, and I might start full on starving again or Ill lose my sanity.",1679184114.0

So I’m planing to move away to attend university later this year. I’ll be moving a few hours away from  my family home and living in shared accommodation.

I haven’t been able to go due to my health and ED, I’m not in any better place with any of it really but I don’t have services on my back or involved and I’m sick of holding off on progressing in my life because of my ED. 

Essentially I want to know what others experiences have been with attending university with an active ED and/or at a low weight. I’ve been maintain a BMI in the >!13s!< for almost a year now, I am functional, have a job, travel, have hobbies etc. Although I’m not confident that I will be able to manage my ED so we’ll when I’m alone and without the direct   support that I have from my family. 

I know there are things I could do to put myself in a better position. But I don’t feel like I’m in the position to challenge and confront my ED right now. Honestly my game plan is to just go and see how things turn out.

I’d be grateful for any advice or experiences. I worry I’m making a mistake by going and that things are going to nose dive and that even going in the first place is a stupid decision.",1679160635.0

Up until last year I was in & out of outpatient treatment and had been to residential once. I believe my trauma began when I was threatened to be sent to another state's inpatient facility if I didn't gain weight within days (this was after my very first visit with my doctor). I was weighed multiple times a week by both my dietitian, doctor, and therapist. Even if I ate exactly what my dietitian said, if I lost weight, she'd assume I was lying and not praise any of my accomplishments. Then, if I gained weight, she'd assume everything was fine even if I wasn't doing well mentally.

After residential treatment I saw a psychiatrist who wanted to weigh me every session. COVID hit and he suggested I buy a scale to send my weight to him...absolutely not. I relapsed and started seeing my previous dietitian & therapist who told me it was my fault that residential didn't work for me & they wanted to send me back. I stopped seeing them & reached out to another dietitian, but she said she'd have to weigh me each time. I didn't see her bc it is SO UNHELPFUL for me and not an indicator of my intake or health. I stopped seeing anyone for my ED & that is when I got better.

I didn't realize I had medical trauma until recently, though. I see various doctors for unrelated issues and every time I go I am so scared of being accused of something or misunderstood. I try to speak up and say if I don't want to try a certain medication but if they try to push it on me anyway I will say ""yes"" because I feel panicky -- similar to a trauma response I have with sexual trauma. Being weighed is always triggering & I will actually eat more than I want in order to comfort my mental state before appointments...I am so terrified of being accused of being sick or lying or being taken off meds because of my weight just from my 10 years of, well, trauma. I actually gained weight due to depression & was told I was ""healthy"" but that weight was from sadness...I lost it after getting better & instead of being happy that I feel better, I am worried because my brain is going ""they're gonna think it's your ed, they're gonna only focus on your weight, they're gonna take you off this med, etc."" I want to just let my body be but how can I do that if it's automatically judged my doctors? I am 5'1"" so I am small & I'm not that active. I maintained a slightly ""underweight"" (fuck BMI charts) weight for years so clearly my body wasn't having any issues with it.

I recently started seeing a new PMHNP & mentioned my ED history (didn't plan to but it slipped out). That has resulted in trauma symptoms coming up and intense worrying about seeing her in-person. I plan to message beforehand or bring a note that I do not want to be weighed & have trauma, which I posted about on here before, but I am still terrified that she will analyze my body and become suspicious. It is so depressing because **I KNOW** whether or not ""it's my ED"" but I was not believed for so long and it's really harmed me.

I do a lot, especially on weekends, with restriction/fasting and exercise, even purging recently. For reference, I’m a “”normal”” BMI but have amenorrhea, lanugo, brittle hair and blacking out. My friend who is in hyper-metabolism isn’t allowed to make a single mistake or they threaten res, but I’m allowed to use every single behavior I’ve ever used and not get threatened. I fasted all weekend a while back and yeah I got a treatment agreement, but the caveat to messing up that bad again was discharge. And all it made me feel like was that it was all in my head and I’m not really hurting my body. 

basically I got the courage to ask my team why my threat when I’m doing badly is discharge but other people get threatened with residential. it makes me feel like I’m just not as sick as everyone else — that I’m just dumb and unwilling. My therapist said that I have all the tools and knowledge and I’m not 13 so I just have to want it/be motivated to do it and that residential would just prove my ED right that there’s a sick enough and that it’d never be enough. She said she was scared it’d never be enough and if she didn’t care she’d tell me to go to Res but she does care and is scared there won’t ever be a turning point so PHP is the right fit. And she’s fighting insurance but only thinks I’ll get two more weeks. 

It’s just like. Idk. I feel so not sick enough and like it’s all in my head and if I was just a better person I could recover and the session didn’t really contradict that. It’s like they’re saying “okay, it’s all on you, and you aren’t as skinny as the others so you don’t get more care”

I saw so much happen in my time there. A week before I was supposed to step down to PHP I was sent to a locked ward on a 5150. Upon my return I was almost kicked out right there but they let me stay. My insurance informed them I had 3 remaining days of coverage at the end of the week.

You always talk about step down with your team bc you never know when insurance is going to cut you. I had planned to step down with them, even though I saw 8 people step back up within a 2 week period, I was going to try and live in their duplexes. 

When my insurance cut me, my therapist brought in the head director and they told me that I was unable to live in the duplex. If I wanted to continue treatment I would have to find my own housing. In 3 days. In San Diego county. Lol. I told them I would leave. 

The day I was leaving they sent a team in for a psych eval which was my 4th in a week. Just for 1 bad day out of 12 weeks, ridiculous. They called my home team for the first time since I had been there and told them when I get home to send me to a locked ward, they of course refused.

When it comes to start eating more for weight restoration, getting your period back etc; would you say it feels easier for you to “go slow”, like keep eating the way you have for most part but add another meal a day etc 

Or have/would you prefer to just go all in and start following a weight gain meal plan immediately?

I’m trying to figure out my approach; I’ve read that a quick weight gain early on increases your chances of recovery as well as decreases the depressive thoughts that come with starvation, and so I thought my psychologist would want me to do just that, but she seems to be completely okay with me “hurrying slowly”. Part of me is like, it’s all or nothing at this point but I’m scared I’ll be discouraged if I go to quick and “fail”

So the other option is adding things slowly, a meal here, few more calories there etc. But I’m kinda starting to feel really poorly, weak and tired all the time, low RHR etc and so I feel like, maybe I don’t really have the luxury of time to be so careful

I'd rather save calories on certain foods and leave more room for other foods than have empty calories on the normal versions, especially if there isn't that big of a difference in taste (I'm not talking about bread vs rice cakes, but comparisons like regular energy drinks vs sugar-free ones) It just doesn't seem like it's worth it.

I am a massive foodie, with a catch: I don’t really like eating the actual food.

Isn’t that ironic? Well I do like eating actual food, but because I have an eating disorder, I hate it too. I swear, I’m CRAZY about cooking. Always watching cooking videos, cooking recipes to get better at the hobby, yet seldom actually eating. I’ve got quite a bit of knowledge about cooking techniques, secret ingredients, nutrition, and how to get quality food for a low price.

But… well, you know how EDs are. The tug of war, between the irrational ED voice trying to gaslight me into starvation, the actual reasonable voice who knows how destructive (potentially deadly) that is.

Often I cook/bake and give it to others, instead of eating it myself. Apparently this is a common ED behavior, it’s allegedly a way of vicariously eating? But I like doing that because food brings people joy (unless you have an ED duh). Combined with the negative self-view that people with depression/social anxiety/EDs/CPTSD have, feeding people and getting a positive response is one of the few positive traits I can even begin to find about myself. Oh and I‘m diagnosed with all 4 of the mental illnesses mentioned above, isn’t that nice 🤡

When I was in the early stages of my ED, it was awful because I think I hadn’t adapted to it yet. The hunger, exhaustion, and nearly passing out when I stood up was all too much, and I thought I’d have to spend the rest of my life this way if I didn’t want to look ugly af. I was suicidal to start with, so this compounded that, and I thought, “Spending the rest of my life this way is horrible… I can’t eat, I struggle to sleep, I want to be dead, I’m suffering 24/7, nobody would even miss me if I died”.

It’s been some time now and I’ve gotten totally used to this starvation lifestyle, which seems nice on the surface, but is actually terrible. Oh and yes, I do have professional help.

I’ve avoided staying around him past a certain time of day for MONTHS just so I wouldn’t have to eat food he cooked. I didn’t realize just how many restrictions I had until I rebelled against them and cooked with my brother. I didn’t realize how, despite making small changes (eating closer to maintenance, buying real bread and not keto bread, etc) I still had so many rules in place. I acted like a healthy person who could enjoy family time, honor their cravings, and just live freely. Even though my mind was (and is) in distress, I got a taste of the life I’ve been missing for so long. And the best part is, despite my fears, I didn’t binge, I gave myself permission to eat it and actually felt my fullness! I didn’t feel out of control while eating it. That was the biggest shock of all.

I’m still mad at myself for eating snacks while cooking, including too many cookies (I never let myself have treats so it makes sense).

377,trans woman seeking help from this community as it seems like y’all are the only ones who take the things i’ve been going thru seriously…,6,11udxfo,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11udxfo/trans_woman_seeking_help_from_this_community_as/,5,"tw: discussion of weight loss, and unhealthy thought patterns 

Hi all, this is a long and wordy post so i do apologize in advance but i need to get it all out of my system

i’m a trans woman in her early 20’s and have been transitioning for almost a year now.

i was a naturally skinny boy growing up but throughout college i really repressed my identity and doubled down on my masculinity to fit in.

in this pursuit i was extremely dedicated to working out and putting on muscle and by the end of school i had developed a really muscular upper body and my legs lagged behind but still had some muscle. (this is relavent later)

once i did a lot of internal work and acceptance, i was ready to begin my transition

at this point i HATED the way i look bc i was quite literally the opposite of what i wanted to be physically

so i knew i had to go all in on losing the muscle. i had seen a few others on a similar journey and took inspiration from them

my plan was simple, stop weight training and lose weight and be on hormones

hating my body to such an extreme extent made it easier than i imagine it would be for the average person losing weight

however after about a month or so i realized this was going to be a much harder and longer journey than i initially expected

correct me if i’m wrong, but it seems like your body really doesn’t want to lose weight if your body fat is low and my body fat has always been really low naturally regardless of my weight and this added to the difficulty

unfortunately a consequence of that seems to be that what muscle mass i do have really sticks out visually more than it would be otherwise which only adds to my discomfort 

without giving any specific numbers or anything i’ve been able to go from looking from abercrombie and fitch male model to ripped cis women over the course of the past 10 months

this has been a severely difficult process with me basically developing many unhealthy thoughts and patterns that ppl in this community have but did so completely independent of any ed related material or media i simply did what it took and only recently stumbled upon this broader community for lack of a term.

anyways i’m really not sure what to do now that i’m basically at the bottom of what a “healthy” bmi is.

i still have lots of upper body mass and my legs are uncomfortably thin looking bc of where my starting point was

my goal physique is actually something that is very healthy genuinely but i don’t think i can get there healthily 

ideally i would have thic legs big butt and low muscle mass on my upper body and with a healthy good amount of body fat

my issue is that in order to really truly get where i want i would have to lose weight for another 6 months bc my upper body still has wayyyy more muscle than i’d like and if i just start bulking and gain leg mass then my upper body may never atrophy to the point where i’m comfortable

so it seems like i can either start trying to gain weight in my legs and risk NEVER getting where i want OR damage my body to the point where i’m extremely thin and build back up from there

also what sucks is i start a real job soon and i have no idea how i’m gonna be able to be in a deficit at a relatively low body weight while in an office environment

really truly a shitty situation i’m in and i don’t think my mental health has been worse than it is rn bc of all this

i don’t really know what i want ppl to say but if i ever ask the trans community abt any of this i will either be told some bs abt beauty standards and what i define as feminine or to “let hrt do it’s magic🤗” or some fucking stupid bitch that’s like oh i just waited 10 years and now i look better….

all i truly truly want is to be able to not have this mass on me that makes me look even more like a man :/

I have Atypical Anorexia Nervosa.

I have fainted 4 times and had dizziness numerous other times. Both my psychiatrist and GP have stated the moment I have a dizzy spell or chest pain, that I should be sending myself to the hospital.

Today I fainted and really struggled to come around & have had chest pain for most of the day. As soon as I felt well enough to stand, I grabbed something to eat just in case it's low BSL's, I feel slightly better but still not great.

My Vital Obs are starting to change & are considered low compared to my usual readings.

My psychiatrist wants me to see the dietitian & her consultant at her clinic next week. She said I will probably need a step up Residential Treatment such as PARC (Prevention And Recovery Centre).

My question is; what does medical treatment or medical intervention for Atypical Anorexia look like?

SECONDARY EDIT: I called the nurse & they want me to go to Emergency urgently. They were going to call an ambulance but I don't feel comfortable going by myself so I'm getting a worker to take me. They should be here within the next 40 minutes.

All of that stuff about binging being connected to emotions isn’t relevant to me in the slightest, I just end up extremely physically hungry even if I’ve already eaten enough to maintain that day, and genuinely can’t stop myself, then I have to purge or restrict more or whatever to deal with it. I shouldn’t even be hungry if I’ve already eaten maintenance, when I used to be fine eating way less.

I know people are gonna say to stop restricting and purging and all that, but I’m sure I’d just binge anyway (eating anything more than I’m comfortable with seems to trigger it). It shouldn’t have to be this way for me. I just want to go back to how I used to be in the past, when I used to restrict to the same amount every day, lose weight, never binge or even feel the urge, and was pretty much scared to eat anything more than I usually would in a day. I never had to actually try to stop myself from eating too much or anything, I just did it.

What do I have to do to get that mindset back where I had so much control over myself? I don’t get it, I keep trying to just lose weight like before but it’s like something’s changed in me. I just need that level of control back over myself, I don’t wanna live if it’s gonna be like this. It’s just ruining everything for me",1679109554.0

People are saying she’s an “almond mom” and “promoting disordered eating” for answering someone’s question about what she eats every day. Like….he asked her and she answered…she didn’t say what she feeds her kids, she answered a question about herself, honestly…. Personally I don’t see how that’s promotion or trying to push restriction or disordered eating on anyone else, but people are in an uproar about it because it’s clear restriction and that people who want to look like her will eat like this in order to look like her. Still not literally “promotion” imo

That being said……I have no interest in Gwyneth Paltrow nor do I want to look like her, but if you were to revise the argument into something like “people who already dabble in or previously struggled with disordered eating may see this eating routine and do it”, then I would agree with that because I’m gonna do it lmao 😭 I’ve been off the wagon for a while (aka not restricting like I used to) and ima do this. Thanks Gwyneth ✌🏼

My main point is that it’s an interesting argument. Is she promoting it or not? She answered a question honestly about herself and what people do with it is their own decision and she didn’t tell anyone to copy her, did she? But does it trigger “dormant” eating disorders to share restrictive diets? In my case yes but like is that her fault? Idk! Interesting discussion",1679082766.0

I go to the grocery store almost every day. I spent a lot of money getting the “right” foods once I decided I was gonna restrict, but even though I have most of what I need for recipes, I keep going back. I keep a rolling grocery list on my phone, and any time I see a recipe I like or an ingredient I wanna use I write it down, then usually go buy it.

Once I decide I want something it’s extremely difficult to convince myself not to buy it because I’ve got something just as good at home. It’s also hard to wait until I have a big enough list for a large trip, because I’d rather just buy it and make it today, immediately.
Simultaneously, I never ever want to throw away food. It fills me with incredible guilt to not eat leftovers if they don’t fit within my macros or cals. Even buying “diet” versions of food fills me with shame when we already have the regular version, but I hate eating normal food now.

I’ve probably spent upwards of $1000 in the past month or two alone on groceries, and I’m not the primary provider of the house. It’s not my responsibility, so everything I buy is just extra. Low cal yogurt, skinny pasta, cauliflower rice, fat free cheese, sugar free sauces, protein bars, low carb bread, I’ve bought it all and more.

My gf of 1 1/2 years has anorexia and I can tell it's getting worse. Not just physically but through her posts on her private twt account and through things she has said to me. She restricts what she eats some but the main thing she does is at the end of every day, she walks around her room until she burns off pretty much all the calories she's eaten that day. She also measures her body with a measuring tape often. She has bad dysmorphia too and has told me before that it's the not knowing that stresses her out the most, thats why she measures + wants to get a scale. But she also wants to be skinnier even though she is already underweight. She gets excited about eating yummy food and it makes me so happy but then she will feel bad about it later. Some days or weeks will be good and we will eat good meals and stuff but then a bad day will come around and she will start restricting again because she is mad at herself for eating ""so much"" lately. She also checks calories of pretty much anything we get at the store and I can tell pretty much every day there is anxiety about ""what am I going to eat tomorrow?""

She has BPD as well and her parents are not understanding at all, I don't think they're even aware she has anxiety, so she is nervous about going to therapy or something and them getting a bill bc she is under their insurance.

She also does want to recover! Like sometimes she will say she wants to recover and then on bad days she will say she doesnt care about recovery. But she knows it's bad. She's like aware of how bad it is but also still unable to do anything to stop the anxiety. She wants to be on anxiety medicine but most of the ones suggested by her doctor have the side effect of weight gain, so it's like what is another affordable way to get treatment in college. She also kind of thinks treatment like therapy is pointless but acknowledges that it could help.

So basically what I am coming to reddit for is two things:

One, what are ways I can help her? I want to reassure her but I don't always know how to reassure her. I can usually help her with stress or comfort but I feel at a loss a lot of times when stuff about her ED comes up. And is there a way I can encourage her? If its okay to do so I don't want to just be a source of comfort and reassurance but also an encouragement when she does make progress in getting better.

Also, is stuff like her measuring herself okay? It scares me but it kinda seems like a way for her to help her dysmorphia by reassuring her that she is not gaining. I feel like it is only worsening her fear of gaining but I am not sure if that reassurance is there also. Is it okay for me to cross out calories on stuff I buy for her or is that kind of thing triggering? And what are some other ways I could help her outside of those mentioned?

And two, What are some accessible ways to get treatment? Esp. for a college student on a budget and with limited access to health insurance because her parents would not understand the need for therapy.

TW for numbers about my stats. I added the full context but my question basically is:

**TL;DR: My resting heart rate went up a lot after binging, and it's taking almost 3 weeks to get it back to normal. Why is that?**

Context: I am M26, 5'7'' and >!150lbs!<. I am generally in great shape and decently muscular. I've had an ED for over a decade now, and recently I have been doing a lot better, recovery wise.

I used to restrict at >!1200 !<calories and excercise a lot, and when I couldn't keep that up I would binge like crazy. My weight would fluctuate a lot, basically always gaining and losing the same >!15lbs !<over and over. 

I'm recently trying this new thing where I increased my intake gradually. In january I did >!1500!<, in february I did >!1700!<, and I am now aiming for >!2000!<. It's going well and I feel so much better and I am progressing a lot more at the gym as well, which is great.

I had a slip up about 2 weeks ago where I binged for 3 days. I didn't count but usually my binges ranged anywhere between >!5000-7000!< calories, if I had to guess. I have since been back on track and doing well again. But since I recently got a new fitbit that registers heart rate, I've noticed something that I don't entirely understand.

Normally, my resting heart rate would be around 42 bpm. After my binge, it went up to 57, and now over 2 weeks later, it's slowly gone back down to 44. I had no idea it would take that long! I'm not concerned since it is obviously still low, but I am trying to understand it. Before you say it's salt/sodium: I don't think it's that, since I always eat a large amount of salt. I did eat a lot more fatty and processed food though, when normally I eat very clean. Or is it simply due to the huge amount of food?

Again, I'm not super concerned and just striving to do better from here on out, but I would love to understand what exactly is happening in my body. Maybe one of you will have the answers!",1679050949.0

Ofc it's just an opinion. Nothing evidence-based as far as I know. And because someone is fatphobic in the first place doesn't mean their ED is related to this fatphobia.

- was talking about how I can sit on the bottom of the pool bc I don't automatically float, he goes ""ah you're just too skinny, not buoyant enough"" 

- was joking about going cold-water swimming but also that I'd freeze, he goes ""right, there's some correlation between mass and heat production, the more mass you have the more heat you produce? We gotta work on that"" 

- meeting up to hang out, I'm like ""how's life been for ya"" and he's like ""oh, yknow, just getting by, making sure I eat, the usual"" 

- I got coffee instead of food after a run bc I was broke once and my friend's just like ""what are you making when I get home? Do you have eggs?"" Later followed up to asked if I'd cooked food yet

- said I was gonna make food at home after an evening run, she asks what I'm making. Hanging out after a morning run, she asks what I'm cooking later.

It's gotten really bad ever since the beginning/middle of 2020. I also gained 10kgs in two months in quarantine in the beginning of 2020 after my grandpa died (8 of those even in 1 month) while not moving at all. Even after those few months I rarely moved much because I was so depressed and then started sitting a lot (probably up to 14 hours a day) when the new school year started since it was the most important one and I had to study & go to my classes. Even the years before that I didn't move a lot due to my severe depression. I lost a lot of weight really fast when I was 15/16 and then gained a lot back again (in a few months). So I've basically been weight cycling for 6/7 seven years (often losing & gaining more than those 10kgs at a time...). So in 2021 I began losing those kilos I've gained 2020 again (still not exactly in a healthy way but ""healthier"") and did daily exercises & stretches until I fell in March of that year. I didn't go to a doctor for a month like a clown even though I had to pop multiple pain killers a pain to function because I had to study for my final exams. I went to an orthopedist but he couldn't find anything wrong with my spine. So I was basically inactive for months again (minus walking) because of the pain and being burned out from studying & stressing over my finals. I then started university but my first semester was an online semester and I couldn't bring myself to move a lot and exercise because I was so depressed and anxious and there wasn't exactly a reason to leave my house. So the only exercise I really got was walking in a past years (minus some time in the gym but I also only trained my legs...💀) and lifting a lot of heavy things last year while I was moving. I was in pain every day when we moved things and that was going on for MONTHS because we had to get rid of all the furniture from the new apartment... 
Now I get pain in my arms and hands from simply holding my phone or lifting my arm too long. I also have a lot of water retention in my body and feel just as tired and cold as I did when I was actively restricting and purging even though I eat more now. I always thought I had enough muscle mass & fat just because bmi wise I'm still categorized as obese (just slightly but still) but I've always been chubby since I was born. Even at my lowest weight I was the high end of the ""normal weight"" category and that wasn't sustainable at all for me. Do you think I could lack adequate muscle mass even if I'm obese? I thought about it since I've always been losing weight fast and unhealthy, I can basically feel nearly every bone in my body quite well, to the point that I can't lay down certain ways because my bones hurt, I got bruises from the wires of my corset before (I bruise easily in general though) & my ass is nonexistent, so there's no way I didn't lose muscle mass during my ED but I guess I also wanted to hear others opinions & experiences with this topic.",1679060797.0

I relapsed into my ed last year. I was restricting for months, idek how long. Not super low res, but like >!800!< cals a day usually. I had no problems maintaining that many calories a day. Around Christmas time, I visited with my family and ate normally the whole time I was there, convinced I could just try harder later after the holidays to lose any weight I gained. 

Ever since then, though, I've been eating normally with occasional binges. I feel so guilty about it all the time, but I can't stop. I've completely lost control. I wake up every day with every intention to restrict, but by the end of the night, I've eaten my maintenance calories or more. I can try to restrict, but the hunger gets so bad. It was never so bad before. I immediately go from not hungry to feeling like I haven't eaten in days, even when I just ate a few hours ago. If I try to ignore the horrible hunger pangs, it just turns to nausea, and that's even worse.

I've haven't gained weight, just maintained, so I guess that's a plus, but I feel like I'm going insane. It's like I've been forced into physical recovery, but I haven't recovered mentally at all. I'm nowhere near my goal weight, and I just want to lose some more, but I can't.  Why can't I get an ounce of self-control? I've been trying really hard not to purge anymore, but it's getting to the point where idk what else to do.

Thanks for reading if you made it this far. I just don't have anyone in my life who knows about my struggles with eating, but I really needed to vent about it.

like before i met him my extreme hunger was CRAZY, and i’d credit him for me finally getting into a restrictive phase 😭 my c/s episodes lowered, and he genuinely, unintentionally gave me a positive light in my life. something to focus on other then my eating disorder and how much i was hating what my body became.

however, past month i’ve went back to b/ping and c/sing. especially this week it was even worse, bc i took something [well-intentioned] that he said and twisted it in my brain and overthought things, and i definitely think bc of that my behaviors worsened and the fact that things felt awkward after that (+ he wasn’t hitting me up near daily like he was after that incident). i was honestly feeling horrible and even more self conscious, and binging obviously didn’t help that feeling one bit. but i was already trapped in a binge phase, so continuing that was my only way to cope 💀

BUT UHH this morning early into my b/p sesh, he DID hit me up. and after that, it was as if a switch flipped in my brain. any thoughts of continuing my b/p into tomorrow have completely died down, it’s like the restrictive part of my disorder is sweeping down from the sky above to save my ass just bc he messaged me 😭 but obviously, as “punishment” for binging and having the scale go up i told myself i couldn’t actually have a full convo with him until tomorrow.

obviously, even if he wasn’t in my life my eating disorder would find other reasons other then him to restrict. but it seems like he’s the main motivator behind me to keep myself fueled, like two years ago it was that mf kate moss quote but now it’s like .. DO IT FOR THIS GUY!! 😭‼️ this is so not healthy and tbh it’s so embarrassing, but i just need to know i’m not alone w thinking this way and get it off my chest. the first social connection i make in YEARS and this is how i’m reacting 😔 maybe it’s bc he’s the opposite gender but idk",1679014183.0

Long lonely hours sitting in silence in my lonely room, ""homeschooled"" while my parents either went at it incessantly or were to high on drugs to do anything. That room was a prison, but one I refused to leave, when I did, it was on the rare occasion that we finally had food. Mom and dad couldn't eat while high, so they were mostly sober for dinner. Sitting at the kitchen eating with them made me feel some semblance of normal. Food became my life, food represented something beyond my hopeless existence. It became everything,  my everything, it was a drug. 

As time went by, I started to gain, I was a kid, I didn't notice, but inevitably others did. Comments from relatives, the few friends I had, random strangers even forced the idea into my head early on that there was something wrong with me. I never hard-core restricted until my late teens, and I struggled with BED until I hit 14. 

Now, my skinny little body is subject for praise.  Every compliment I receive relates to it. People care. But I guess the  isn't about how my life improved after I forced myself to develop AN. Its actually about how I still struggle with BED to this day. Unfortunately I will never be one of the interlex that hate food it just isn't in my history years of deeply ingrained positive associations with food as created an addiction that lies deep within me one that no one takes seriously. Even now, being thin, it feels like everyday I could binge. It's a never ending hopeless existence with an Ed. No matter what ED it is.

bf: 😟
me: “it’s okay i’m just wondering”
bf: “i…i didn’t think you would notice. i can’t believe you could tell”
me: *nervous laughter*

and now i’m wondering if he’s ever sabotaged my food before and how far he would go to add calories if he didn’t think i’d notice. did he not think i’d notice bc he’s done it before? i know it’s not the end of the world. i know he was doing it out of care bc i haven’t been eating well lately. but i wanted to *scream* at him for messing with my food. i didn’t, and i told him it was fine and laughed it off, but then i ended up eating less rice than i probably would have if he hadn’t messed with it bc i was scared of eating too much. i hate my brain

I guess it's common to have a poor appetite after this kind of surgery for a few days, then it returns to normal after a week or two. On Monday I had to fast until I got back home around 3pm, and I wasn't really hungry but had a granola bar to eat with my meds. That night I managed to eat a pretty big meal and dessert >!about 1,100 cal for both!<. My appetite over the past few days hasn't really been dulled at all, I've still managed my usual weekday calorie allowance. And today, I've been RAVENOUS, and am finding myself having to talk myself out of eating a ton because for me, when I eat a ton it spirals into binging which spirals into purging (along with the fact that I can't mentally let myself have above maintenance calories). And I definitely do not want to purge while recovering. I usually take 30k steps on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays too, but I'm not doing that this week because I'm recovering, so exercise isn't making my appetite increase (I'm also feeling very guilty for not burning the calories I usually do).

Could I just be really hungry today because of low protein? The past few days I've had a lot more protein but have been skimpy on it today (fixing for tomorrow).

520,I'm being ridiculous,4,11ssy3m,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11ssy3m/im_being_ridiculous/,0,"Yesterday was pretty rough. Basically I had planned to not eat anything else for the day after lunch besides a coffee. But I was just so hungry and lethargic and anxious. My plan for the remainder of the day was to go to the gym for 2 hours, go to starbucks, and then go to the arcade for the rest of the night. I just didn't know how I was going to make it through all of this.  
  
I started thinking maybe I'll get that wrap from starbucks... no I didn't plan to do that. Maybe a lower calorie item? Nope still too much. Maybe I'll stop at the store and grab a yogurt? No, not even that, because I had already planned not to. I couldn't help but thinking that eating anything outside of what I already planned was going to make it that much harder to lose weight. I was already in such a large deficit for the day that realistically eating any of these things would not have put me anywhere near maintenence.  
  
So in the end, I went to the gym, could only stand to do 1 hour instead of 2. Walked to the grocery store, caved and bought a lb of baby carrots, depressingly scarfed down about a third of it in my car, got my coffee, and just went home to lay in bed for 12 hours instead of going to the arcade, something I look forward to every week. I just did not have the energy or mental capacity to go anymore. And I felt like such a failure for giving up on the gym and ""caving"" and eating literal freaking carrots. Like that's literally nothing, but I felt like a failure anyway.  
  
Yesterday I think I realized just how stuck I am in this way of thinking. Despite coming up with reasons why I want to eat more and gain weight, I can't convince myself to actually do it. There's always a reason to just hold out a little longer. Just the thought of eating a yogurt in this instance was somehow too much for me. It's not right. I need help and I'm not doing what I need to do to get it.",1678970225.0
521,Genuine question: Is it fair that my mom is making me pay for a missed treatment appointment?,1,11t4n9s,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11t4n9s/genuine_question_is_it_fair_that_my_mom_is_making/,11,"*Context: I'm newly 18F, still in HS, and getting treatment mainly for ARFID regarding my fear of certain foods due to GI issues. I have recently been pushing getting testing and revisiting my GI doctor, but I have been getting questioning and pushback from the ED team. I was going to bring it up in a dietician appointment today, but I got too anxious.*

Last night I had a panic attack because of the idea of not ""people pleasing"" my dietcian & also the fact that she might not believe me about my I going GI issues that I have had since being a child. A lot of it is also super embarrassing and hard to talk about because I have never told anyone about it before.

I talked to my mom about it, and she asked if we should cancel. I reminded her that even if we cancel, we still have to pay for it, but she said it was fine.

The next morning, I tried getting ready for my half day of school (I half day due to severe anxiety, major depressive disorder, & very bad IBS). I did not make it because I had a panic attack on my way to school. I went home, regrouped, and proceeded to have another panic attack and extreme >!self harm!< urges. I was so scared that I would hurt myself that I locked myself in my dad's car for 3 hours (it has windows and live on a quiet bush street) to stop myself. 

I had 5 more panic attacks (more like consistent off and on panic that would reach peaks 😅), and every time I went inside, I wanted to hurt myself, so I stayed outside. I was so scared that my dietcian wouldn't believe me about my chronic bloating, constipation, and reactions to certain food since my past ones have not. I was also scared of the fact that they wouldn't believe my parents either because in my past treatment center my dietician stopped talking to my parents because she didn't believe them and thought they were manipulating me into making up symptoms so I could be at a lower BMI for *their sake*.

My mom came home. I finally felt safe to go inside, and I was going to let her know that I don't know if it would be ""safe"" for me to go considering how my morning went. When I get too escalated, I will even end up being harming in front of others, or I will completely shut down. I didn't want that to happen at my appointment.

She started yelling at me, which kind of set me off, so I had a panic attack again. ""Get it together right now. we are going, or else you're paying for the appointment!""

Obviously, I saw this as a way out. I started telling her I'd pay her right there, but then she starts yelling that she's calling my dietician right now and I'm talking to her. By then, I was full out shut down, so I don't know if that was the best idea, but yeah.

TLDR;

***Basically, am I wrong for being mad at my mom for this?***

**I understand that a) it's frustrating because she had to call out from work**

**b) treatment isn't cheap.**

 At the same time, though, on my end, I was getting extreme self-harm issues and am also currently getting treatment for medical and treatment related PTSD due to gaslighting  and misdiagnosis at previous treatment centers. I think it makes sense that I'm afraid to challenge my dietcian on some things.

I guess the reason it annoys me so much is because I have actually PTSD from previous treatment & also I know that if this happened 3 months ago when I was 17 she wouldn't have made me pay for the appointment. And also I'm *her child*. Idk it just feels a little backward to me? Frankly, I'd rather not attend treatment if it means it's coming from my bank account.

~~She also made me call my dietcian after that. I was home alone at the time, but I got so scared I became dizzy and nauseous and almost blacked out??? I was still conscious, but I could  not see it. It was really scary. I guess my fear feels so real that it manifests physically, and I wish she understood that even tho i still get why she made me pay.~~",1678997016.0

I'm 20 and living in a flat w 5 other 19/20 year olds. We all moved in together after we lived together first year, and I am at a loss. It was established in October? of last year that 5/6 of us have had eating disorders/disordered eating. One with ARFID, two with AN, one with BN, and I have EDNOS (i have had disordered behavior for so long, the binging, purging, restricting, etc just kinda culminates into what I feel comfortable calling EDNOS).

Last year, before my relapse, I was recovered and doing so well. I got into a shitty relationship, however, and I felt like the only way I was able to control my life was through my finances/eating habits. I stopped buying food to save money, and it ultimately became an ED relapse--the more I lost and happier I felt. The control in the midst of instability was addictive.

I know my flatmates noticed, but I never really cared. It is my life and my body, it's my way of seeking control in the least harmful way possible atp, I didn't really care. Now, !40 lbs! down and bordering on underweight, I'm realizing how much my ED has affected my relationships and the people around me. One of my flatmates (20F, AN) started restricting again, not necessarily because of me (she's going through it in general), and I can't help but be upset with myself for possibly triggering something in her with my behaviors. Another part of me is envious of her, in some twisted sense. She !doesn't eat for days at a time! because she doesn't have a job or go to her classes, meanwhile I have to work to survive the month by the skin of my teeth, whilst juggling a hard degree program. I've felt myself get so distanced from her as I turn to more of the B/P aspects of my ED, in a mixture of life and the fact that I'm upset with myself for having EDNOS rather than AN. I know that AN isn't a pretty ED either, but binging and purging has been taking such a toll on me lately I needed to get it out.",1678964064.0

I feel constantly bloated and there's lots of gas, it doesn't matter if I've taken a pill or not. On days when I skip my dose, the bloatedness gets so much worse and I have trouble eating anything because food only seems to make it worse... 
Another issue is that when I do take it, the next day my stomach and insides hurt so so much for the WHOLE DAY. And yet I keep taking it. 
I need to stop. I know that now. 
I was wondering whether anyone has undergone the same or a similar experience? And if so, how did you stop using? Would I need to reduce the dose and the frequency at which I'm taking the pills or do I just stop altogether, cold turkey?

""Okay, so next session I think we should talk about gaining weight!""

This makes me pissed for multiple reasons:

1. She *still* hasn't looked over my growth chart

2. I'm finally at my pre eating disorder weight BEFORE the binging started and after the restriction stopped. I fluctuate between the same >!5lbs!< now. Most women in my family are small in stature. ~~A majority of my genes are Cypriot which finally explains the smaller women lmao~~

3. We still haven't addressed my chronic bloating, chronic constipation, or gut issues that caused my ED. Being forced to eat foods just because my head is 'making it up' is not OK especially considering the fact that I still have terrible reactions to most foods. Next month will mark my 1 year anniversary of starting treatment and learning my gut was the REASON I CONSENTED TO TREATMENT!!

I appreciate that she still honors my perspective, preferences, and the fact that my primary diagnosis is ARFID. I appreciate that I can be open and real with with her. Hell, she doesn't even raise her brows at certain ""ED stereotypes"" because sometimes those don't even apply!!

But man, I'm annoyed at the lack of helping my body function. So far, I've been told to add whole grains (which I had recently cut out, other than oats because they give me problems). Originally, we cut out *oats* because they were ""too safe,"" when in reality they were the only things *not* giving me issues. Well now the other stuff gives me issues, great!

My actual *preference* to low fat dairy & alternative has been challenged. We've learned when I eat full fat dairy I actually lose weight because I won't stop shitting!! Amazing A+ 👏 

Like please, I'm not a liar.

I stop movement, I don't use the restroom.

I eat red meat & white carbs, I don't use the restroom for a week.

I eat a high fat item, I cramp up into pain.

I take supplement, I lose weight because I'm not digesting food. I will pass an entire meal in minutes.

When I need to use the restroom, I take so long that I cannot even attend class.

This has been my *whole fucking life.* It totally makes sense that I have an eating  disorder

But how about instead of addressing the **eating disorder** we address **the actual fucking problem.**

I know I have IBS, but sometimes I wonder if there's other underlying issues. I've already had a gluten sensitivity tested, an endoscopy, an ultrasound, and an MRI with contrast. What did we find? Absolutely fucking nothing. 

I've tried supplements, prebiotic, low fodmap, gluten free, exersize, going vegetarian, only liquids, sugar free, yoga, meditation, 3 different anti depressants, an anxiety medication, and basically everything I could think of to solve my gut issues. 

And to be honest I've kind of given up. I'll go out to eat with my family and I'll deal with the pain later. I'll ""challenge"" myself to a family meal and experience symptoms because of a trigger food in a recipe. I binge because I restrict, because I'm absolutely fucking terrified that the food won't come out. I won't use the bathroom for a week and then I sneak into my mother's room to use her laxatives.

My parents were eating with me and they gently encouraged me to keep eating but take my time if I needed to, which was nice.

For my thesis, I am analyzing the role of different household dynamics (single versus double parent) in the development of eating disorders and/or disordered eating behavior. My research consists of 26 questions regarding personal/family medical history, family dynamics and feelings related to weight/body. The survey will take approximately 10 minutes to complete. ​​The survey poses psychological risks for participants due to the topic of eating disorders and other psychiatric disorders. The survey also includes discussion of eating disorder behaviors including restriction, inappropriate compensatory behaviors, and binging and purging episodes which can be triggering. An “I decline to answer” option will be available for all multiple choice questions, and can be stated for the free response answers if needed. Additionally, there will be behavioral health resources listed at the end of the survey. Due to the sensitive nature of this survey, no identifying information (such as participant name and internet protocol address) will be collected, and survey responses will be kept anonymous. 

This is project #1551 and has been approved by the Viterbo University IRB. 

I am requesting responses from individuals who meet the following criteria: 

1. At least 18 years old
2. Grew up under their parent(s) care until at least 18 years of age. 
3. History of or currently engage in an eating disorder/disordered eating behavior
   1. Disordered eating can be defined as but is not limited to: frequent dieting, anxiety associated with specific foods, skipping meals, chronic weight fluctuations, strict rituals/routines surrounding food and exercise, feelings of guilt/shame with eating or a feeling of loss of control around food including compulsive eating habits. 

If you meet this criteria and are comfortable completing this survey, please click on the link below:

She tells me honestly how fat I look compared to her. Before I turned into “bigger than her” she would remark on how I was thinner than her. Now she tells me to accept that I’m bigger than her and tells me I should know that I’m fatter than her. 

She gets mad when I make her compare my thigh to hers because she hates telling me the truth that I look fatter. Well this was before I lost weight again. When she commented that I was thinner that her at 15 I had a waist around 28 inches, 39 inch hips, and 21 inch thighs. I ended up losing weight until I had a 26 inch waist, 37.5 inch hips, and 20.5-21 inch thighs. I am 5’11 and reached my adult height at 15.

I was scared to let her see my body at first so I wore very oversized clothes. But then we went clothes shopping and I worse jeans that didn’t hide my legs but weren’t skin tight either. 

My mom implied I couldn’t fit into size medium shorts. She told “those are a size medium you might want the large”. (She never did this before I got fat with a 29 inch waist, 41 inch hips, and 23 inch thighs). Then came the jean section. She has remarked that I am probably size 10 now and gained 5 pounds. (I had a 28.5 inch waist, 39.5 inch hips and 22.5 inch thighs then). This was 6 months ago. 

Yet she directed me to the size 10s in the store. I just said “no mom” and went to the 8s. She respected that but still tried to get me to take the 10s in jeans “for length”. I cried when we got home because she clearly still thinks I’m not back to normal.

I just feel so defeated. I lost so many inches everywhere. Yet I still look like a size 10 to her. I’m trying so hard to get the wow you lost all the weight comment. She knows better than me. I didn’t even fit in the size 8 as it was baggy. Most of my jeans from when I was skinny are baggy now. (I’m probably fabricating this to feel better.) I let her see me in tighter pants. Which she remarked that I look really good. (Probably just because they were new ones I got that she didn’t see yet). I don’t have the nerve to ask about weight now.

when i was doing low res or fasting, even just at the beginning (y'know the period before you lose your hunger signals) how did i cope with this painful feeling in my stomach? how did i cope with feeling so weak??

i mean, i know how. i know i could technically do it again if i pushed myself but like. this is legit painful and it's somehow such a foreign feeling now? like i don't remember this feeling. i KNOW i've felt it but i think I'm just realizing how little i remember from my low res/fasting periods. 

my boyfriend once told me how worried he was about me and how weak i was back then. i don't remember him being worried. i don't remember him noticing anything, or asking me to eat and stuff like that. but he did that. and i don't remember.

602,roommate co-recovery,3,11s1o3h,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11s1o3h/roommate_corecovery/,0,"hey y’all 

so essentially I’m moving in with a good friend of mine and we were having an adult conversation about what our needs are from each other as roommates. she mentioned that she just started the recovery process for her BED, and that she wants my support. naturally I’m down, EDs fuckin suck and she deserves to feel better, so I told her I’m all in to help her make more conscious snacking/dinner choices and keeping accountability for eating responsibly. 

here’s why I’m asking y’all abt it: I’ve got a nasty little case of ednos myself and admittedly I’ve been eating like shit. I recognize that my eating habits and patterns are still very, yknow.. disordered. I actively desire recovery but I feel like I lack the necessary constitution to follow through with it (I’ve been talking to my therapist about it but I’ve also got a laundry list of other things to cover) so I’m scared for what’s going to happen and whether or not I’ll hardcore relapse like I did last time I tried recovery. I’m extra conscious of it because I don’t want my attempts at recovery to impact my friend’s progress in any way (unless god willing it’s for the better) and I’m inherently afraid of the competition aspects of restrictive EDs because that’s gotten me in trouble before. I’ve told my friend that I also want to recover with her, but I didn’t mention that last part. I’m aware that that’s out of her control and that it’s entirely my responsibility to get over that mindset. I’m telling y’all so that you have a better understanding of where I’m at mentally. 

here’s some of the recovery ideas that we’ve come up with so far:

- planning recipes a week ahead and becoming an ingredients household rather than just a snack household (my concern is that ADHD executive dysfunction will kick in and I won’t eat because it requires Time and Effort)

- opting for more nutritious snack options like carrots and hummus rather than exclusively junk food (my reservations on this one stem from me already worrying about ‘good food’ vs ‘bad food.’ conceptually I understand the purpose but I sometimes rely on midnight snacks of junk food for calories because they don’t require prep or clean up - my logic is that /something is better than /nothing, even if it’s not the healthiest) 

-clear stackable storage containers for the fridge that are labeled and dated (big fan of this one)

- having at least one meal a day together (idk how feasible this will be with my school and work schedule because I’m out of the house at most ‘normal eating hours’ which has also been a major contributor to my issues) I threw the idea at her for regular text check-ins to make sure that we were following through, but it reminds me a little too much of early 2010s tumblr ED chats iykwim

I feel lukewarm on a lot of the ideas we’d talked about, but I appreciate the intention and I don’t want to quell that momentum and possibly fuck up my friend’s recovery. what are y’all’s thoughts on the current game plan? what do you recommend we add or remove?",1678898210.0

I have just started eating animal products (for health reasons) after over a decade of being vegan. I went into the vegan lifestyle with bulimia, but recovered in my second year of being vegan. At least I thought I did. In the past year, I've come to terms with the fact that my ED just turned into a new one over time.

Essentially, I have developed orthorexic tendencies (as well as OCD relating to food and eating). I am now committed to finally recovering from disordered eating and have stopped tracking and measuring everything, trying to take a more intuitive approach. But I'm finding the adjustment to now eating animal products difficult and I'm very anxious about not knowing how to structure my meals as an omni. 

To add to my stress, I am in my 30s and trying to conceive. As a vegan, I gained a lot of weight and have become clinically obese. My dilemma is, I need to lose weight in order to improve my fertility. But I don't know how to achieve that whilst also recovering from my apparent lingering ED. I don't have a lot of time left before it becomes even more difficult to conceive, so I am feeling incredibly overwhelmed.

Shocker, this is intensely triggering to me (I'm not recovering, but I am tentatively trying to practice harm reduction and build healthier habits). 

A few months ago I asked him why he never refrains from these comments despite knowing about my ED and he told me that he doesn't believe he should have to walk on eggshells to make other people more comfortable. 

I know its my responsibility to stand up for myself and I'm willingly putting myself in this position/relationship. The other side of this is that I feel a kind of pressure to be the ""cool gf"" who isn't ""too sensitive"", doesn't demand their partner censor themselves, that bullshit. 

My instinctive reaction is that I need to lose more weight in order to show that my suffering is real and should be taken seriously (preferably in the form of people being more thoughtful about their actions towards me).

Today is pi day, and at my job (a school) our math teacher brings pies. Delicious homemade pies. I've been going through a more restrictive phase than usual for \[reasons\] and so I have literally spent a week preparing myself to eat a slice of pie. She made a key lime pie because she knew I loved it and she knows that I've been ""sick"" (I was in ED treatment for 6 weeks last year, but didn't tell anyone why), so she even asked me if I needed different ingredients or anything. She is so kind and I love this pie.

I get to the lunchroom and prepare myself. I've got this. I've talked myself into it for a week. I take a slice (which I honestly cannot even tell anymore whether it was gigantic or tiny; I have no concept of portions). I sneak back to my classroom to eat this pie by myself and pace around my classroom because I cannot be seen eating. It tastes like sugar and butter and graham crackers. I am briefly happy. I go back downstairs and tell the math teacher thank you, etc. and she says, but wait, nobody ate the key lime yet. 

I have apparently restricted and brain fogged myself into not being able to tell the difference between cheesecake and key lime pie.

 I immediately lose whatever brain cell had not given in yet to the madness and go FULL mental illness for the rest of the day. To be clear, I was already planning on eating a slice of pie, but because it wasn't the \*right one,\* now it was my last straw. As a full adult, I faked sick and left work early >!so that I could exercise for one million years!< and I had to use every single tool I learned in recovery to get myself to eat dinner. I googled ""calories in cheesecake"" MORE THAN ONCE as if I would magically know and the results would change.>!Every glance in my bathroom mirror, every time I felt the waistband of my pants,!< I have been crawling out of my skin. >!I have never purged in my life and I have never felt so tempted.!< For one slice of pie that I was so excited about. And to top it all off, I can't get myself to talk to anyone about this because I ""don't look sick."" Mental illness. Absolute mental illness. I know it, but I can't stop it.

Anyway, I hope one day we are all able to eat a slice of key lime pie or cheesecake and just keep going with our lives.",1678841682.0

I’ve not lost a significant amount of weight almost a year, I’m medically “stable”, most of the time I can’t restrict under xxxx kcals, I walk a lot but really it’s not that excessive, I eat several times a day and relatively normal looking meals too. 


All of my friends with EDs are struggling and it’s so triggering, I love each and everyone of them. It I hate their EDs. I have a really healthy relationship with these friends, we met in hospital a few years ago and we have really clear and well respected boundaries when it comes to talking about mental health and our EDs. Although it’s inevitable that sometimes it’s triggering regardless. 

On one hand it’s hard to see them losing more weight, especially when they are already UW and it’s difficult to watch them being in and out of hospital/inpatient. Or to hear they’ve been struggling and professionals are beginning to worry because I deeply care about all of them. 
Yet it’s also hard because I feel some jealousy toward them too. 

I’ve been struggling a lot recently, but I’ve got nothing to show for it physically which makes me question if my ED is even real or a problem. I feel like I’m a failed anorexic. I’m functional (barely but I manage) and because of that no one seems to care or think that my ED is a problem. 

I know this is literally a symptom of my ED but I’m so sick of never feeling sick enough. And feeling triggered by ever tiny thing. I want nothing more right now that validation and for someone to acknowledge that I’m not okay, and not making it all up. I feel like I’ve got no right to say that I’m struggling when I’m not low restricting, or really losing any weight at all. My compulsive walking is pretty out of control but I am always praised for how healthy and active I am because of the amount of steps I do so it doesn’t even feel like a problem or something I should complain about.

then I woke up irl and was still panicking for a bit thinking it was real but then quickly realised it wasn’t and got so relieved.

I couldn’t stop crying and hyperventilating.
Even just the thought made me react like that.

I hate it because I genuinely do love food and always look up recipes but my stupid brain makes me absolutely terrified of consuming anything because the thought of not losing more weight is so scary to me.

I’m just scared of what he will do.

This will be my first Ramadan as an anorexic. My physical condition is more dire this time; I'm underweight, don't get my period anymore, I've become an obsessive calorie counter. I know that the sick are exempt from fasting, and there are other ways of partaking in Ramadan. My therapist recommends against fasting, but she's not a Muslim. She doesn't really get it.

Part of my anxiety stems from how gross and messy and embarassing the whole ordeal can be if you don't act quick when you know it's coming. Especially if you had a big meal beforehand. 

So in my mind, if I eat little enough, and I happen to end up getting sick later on, it'll be akin to spit up, and it won't really freak me out too badly. Also, it would probably be over with much quicker. Whereas anytime I feel nauseous after a binge, my anxiety spikes. 

TLDR: my brain is broken 🫠 also, the bulimia part is probably confusing. I thought that I would overcome my emetophobia during my bulimic days, but I didn't. The only reason I was okay with purging is because I had control over pretty much everything: the time, place, amount of privacy, when I'd start, when I'd stop, etc. But you can't control whether you throw up involuntarily or not.

When my heart is pounding in my chest when I’m laying down doing nothing. When I’m shedding more hair than I’m supposed to. When my period is a lot lighter/shorter than it should be. When my stomach growls and I feel light headed.

There’s something about the suffering that excites me. Like knowing that I could be seconds away from dying but that I’m the one who controls that and I could just go eat something to stop it. I feel fucked up for it and it’s the most evil part of my ED. I just get in my head so much about it especially when I’m going through sporadic bouts of depression.",1678745805.0

These past 10 months have been very interesting. I've lost more than half of my entire body weight in exchange for heaviness in new medical issues. I was in extreme denial about my issues until I got diagnosed with anorexia within this past month. I've always had issues with my health, but didn't realize how bad they've really gotten until uhh.. the title of my post 😅 

I was dealing with obvious signs of vitamin deficiencies but didn't stress too much until I began getting weird bruises overnight on my legs. Then eventually my both of my legs were almost completely bruised upto my knees and it progressed into excruciating pain felt in my bones. Got it checked out, yep you got scurvy which is extremely uncommon. I haven't had any sugar or fruit during these months, so shouldn't be too surprising - but yet I was surprised lol

During the discovery of scurvy, I've learned that I've actually gotten shorter in height by 1.5 inches. I've been the same height since middle school and am in early 20s
Wtf? It isn't just in my head either, it's noted in my medical history. Don't know why. Tried not to stress over it.

The icing on the cake at the same time as all of this transpiring is the massive amounts of hair that are falling out of my head daily. I used to have such beautiful healthy thick blonde hair and now it's so ridiculously thin and I can tell I've lost a significant amount of hair. I try to take extremely good care of my hair and don't cheap out ever, but it seems to be falling out now faster than I can save it. 

These issues have me at a loss for words. I never expected any of this. Yes I'm finally that size 0 but at the expense of everything else I've noted and many more unnoted. I thought I'd love myself now coming this far, and that's far from the reality.

Any advice on how to cope with these issues? The guilt of feeling like a burden to others around me dealing with these issues has impacted motivation for wanting to recover. I just want to hide in a hole and not bother anybody ever again. I can't believe I did this to myself unknowingly and forced it onto the others around me.

Am I alone? I feel so alone 
Hugs and love if you're here with me
Any positivity is always appreciated.. thank you

What my eating disorder heard: ""Oh. So you are obviously eating too much now, some day you will have to start eating less again! Why not start now before you become too greedy and get used to overeating. Your body doesn't need that much food and your hunger cues are just fake.""

I don't think she should have said that. Got me months and months to face the fear of eating more. I know she didn't mean harm but my positive mindset towards eating freely is now disturbed again.

I had to leave school early because of it and the people where I’m staying at made a doctors appointment for that evening.

I told him about my eating issues. I felt like I had to because he was talking about maybe doing a test to get like a picture of my heart or something? I’m not sure what it’s called. 
I felt that if I didn’t tell him I’d just be wasting his time with a bunch of tests when I knew exactly why I was feeling like this.

I have a new appointment scheduled for this morning to draw some blood to check if any nutrients and vitamins are missing which tbf there probably are.
I’m not sure how this can go further though.

He expressed genuine concern and noted that my bmi was pretty low after having measured my height and weight but the problem is that I really don’t want to eat because I’m genuinely terrified of gaining any weight and I want to lose more.

He said he wants to keep an eye on me that nothing gets worse but if I refuse to eat then obviously things will get worse which I’m fully aware of so I’m just really confused what could happen next. I don’t think I’m unwell or sick enough to get hospitalised or admitted into a facility so idk what else that doctor can do.

When other doctors expressed concerns for my weight in the past I always came up with some sort of excuse and they always believed me and did no other check ups but this time I straight up told him about my eating issues.

The trip came and for three days I had to eat like a regular person, I didn't binge on greasy food, I ate a well balanced plant-based meals and the portions that were too big I shared with my family, I even drank a bit of alcohol (I don't drink anything that isn't tea or coffee due to calories). So yes, for three days I was able to remember what it was like to be a normal person, to not think about food all the time, about the calories, or about exercise. I was able to enjoy my trip, to have fun, I ate delicious food and it felt like waking up from a coma. And yet, when on the ride back home I was again thinking of going back to my old habits, but when I looked at myself in the mirror while changing I realized how f up I looked.... ( I ''knew'' before my body was a pile of disgusting bones but it's like my mind hadn't really realized how bad it was until today) Must be because now that my brain is working on something else besides caffeine and nicotine I'm able to recognize what I've gotten myself into.

I want to be happy again, I know this illness is comforting, it feels so good to hurt yourself like this, to watch the numbers on the scale go down, the dizziness and the constant cold you feel, it doesn't make sense why it feels so good but it does. And yet I know if I don't put a stop to this I'm going to get hospitalized soon either by my parents or my doctor soon. And worst of all I'll just keep going through life like a mindless zombie.

Idk if ill stay in the sub or not, I just hope someone reading this might relate or might want to give recovery a go too.

I had known at the start of the year after the holiday period that I had gained a little just because of overeating which I didn't restrict to counteract like I usually do. Then after that I've just been eating ""normally"" but fucking hell I thought it was just water weight fluctuations and etc. I haven't weighed myself much this past month just due to time constraints due to a packed study schedule. I've been buying lunch and breakfast every day (with unknown cals. didn't think they would be high cal but i guess my scale is telling me otherwise) but am still restricting most days of the week and yet I've STILL managed to gain weight. Last week was especially the worst because one of my coworkers made a vegan cake specifically for me and I was eating a lot of that throughout the week but holy shit I didn't think I'd done that much damage. 

It took me so much time, effort and suffering to lose this weight originally I just can't believe how much I've managed to gain back and how easy it was. I want to cry, this is so frustrating. What hurts the most is that I legitimately couldn't even tell that I had gained that much, I thought I looked the exact same but I measured myself and I've managed to gain >!3 inches!< on my waist since November and I want to SCREAM. I had put myself through the hell of relapsing to look amazing before my partner's graduation in November and was finally actually starting to feel confident in my skin and for once in my life happy with my body after losing that weight but here I am, back at square one. I'm so disappointed in myself. I'm hoping that some of this weight is just fluid retention from eating a lot of high sodium foods (which I have been lately) as well as just food weight. I really am hoping some of this weight drops off after getting back on track with restriction because otherwise idk how I'm gonna freakin cope.

Mind you I am not underweight or anywhere near underweight. The weight I was happy with was smack bang in the middle of the healthy BMI range for me as well, and this weight gain is pushing me towards overweight. I hate myself so much right now. I wish the world would just open up and swallow me whole right now. I even changed the batteries in my scale thinking maybe, just MAYBE, the number I was seeing was a bit funky because I was just a tad bit heavier than my current weight prior to my relapse and looked notably bigger but NOPE.

She orders takeout frequently because she's convinced she ""has nothing to eat."" There is SO much junk in her diet in between 15-hour sleeping spells and candy for dinner.  But then I thin, ""Well, it's way better than not eating!"" But it has to be something she is in the mood for. Always. And if she doesn't feel like eating anything, she'll just go back to sleep, despite knowing that not eating is causing pain.

I've told her I am worried about her relationship with food. She said she is, too. She keeps putting it on her health, which may have some truth to it. But we live together, and she is refusing my help at times and breaking promises that she will look at her ED program binder. 

My son and I live with Orthostatic Hypotension. It really sucks, but we graze on food and manage it as a beat we can. With pain, we treat it and try to stand up to feed ourselves.  Everyone is different and deserves care. I feel like she may be placing unnecessary blame on medical issues that are treated instead of a deeper problem. 

Could this be relapse? Thank you in advance for your thoughts.",1678767249.0

757,Extreme Hunger?,11,11qaezj,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11qaezj/extreme_hunger/,7,"Extreme Hunger?

I need advice. First some backstory, i am 19 years old and i have anorexia. I used to be pretty overweight last year and i have lost a significant amount of weight in only a year. Im very happy with that, however i cant eat normally now. I either have to track everything to make sure i eat enough not to lose weight but also not gain any. Or i dont track my calories and i eat the entire day long.   


My question is, why am i always so hungry? I read somewhere its because i have been restricting for so long and im underweight so my body is trying to make me eat a ton of food to gain back some weight asap? Or is my binge eating coming back?   


I have been feeling like maybe i should honour this hunger and just eat even tho it will make me feel very sick physically, i will gain weight and that is what i want. I wanna be healthy again, so is honouring the hunger the right way to do it? Will i ever stop and start eating normally? I feel like i dont have any feeling of ''hunger'' or being ''satisfied'' with food anymore, i wonder if i will ever get that back?

I know there is no sure way to tell and it’s best to ask my doctor or something (kinda hard to do in the UK lol). But I was wondering if suffering from an ED/Exercise-related bulimia for just under a year is enough to stunt growth? 

I suffered my worst period from 14-15 (peak puberty lol) before recovering by 15-16! I still ate fairly nutritiously, but nowhere near enough for my age/activity levels (was playing sports/running 2+ hrs daily). I ended up cutting lots of fats/calories from my diet too. 

Here’s the caveat, I kinda grew around 3 inches after recovery (and gained a few cm at 20…). But I’m still pretty short and am hoping to gain a little more. I’m also male for context! 

Is my growth stunted for good, or is there a chance I can catchup where I left of?

I've had anorexia for 6 years now and have attempted to recover more times than I can count. I usually quit within a few days to a week however a couple of times in the lifetime of my ED I have either weight restored or gained a notable amount of weight and my mental health plummets. I've been trying to put in the work, develop other coping skills, work on my mindset, reach out to others, get professional help. None of it seems to help. Every time I gain weight in recovery, the desire to self harm as well as suicidal ideations kick in. Each time I gain weight, it seems like I am willing to go to even more dangerous lengths to lose it as rapidly as possible. At least when I'm at a weight I feel comfortable with, I can allow myself to eat. Albeit not enough, but I'll allow myself meals and snacks within my calorie limit. When I weigh too much for my own liking, I don't even treat myself like a human. I feel like a prisoner within my own body, I just want to tear my flesh off of my skin until only my ""real"" body is back. 

I feel so repulsed, so ashamed to live in a larger body. I had more energy, a beautiful personality, a glowing smile and robust laugh. My hair was full and shiny, my skin was radiant. I was gorgeous in ways that were not defined by my weight. But I just cannot do it. I can't go back. I never felt good enough. I was constantly comparing myself to other women and feeling inferior. I've lost a lot of happiness alongside the weight but I've gained peace of mind. I feel worthy of eating, worthy of being loved, worthy of taking up space. I feel good enough. Nothing else in my life has ever given me the same peace that controlling my appearance has.

I know recovery isn't easy, nor is it supposed to be. It's so uncomfortable and scary, and I applaud everyone that can muster up the strength and fight tooth and nail to free themselves from the grasp of this illness. But, personally, I'm exhausted from fighting. I'm worn out. I have no interest in being underweight but I also have no interest in sitting at the weight that aligns with my natural eating habits.

Before I start, I want everyone to know I do not say anything as pro ed, I am in full support of recovery, not harming yourself in any way, this is mainly just a way to vent. 

Basically, I’ve noticed the only forms of ED community that are allowed on the internet, seem to be ones where every individual is either recovering or FULLY recovered. In these communities you often have the people within demonizing those who still suffer from the disorder. I have seen the most innocent of ED accounts on tumblr (ones that aren’t even sharing tips, etc. literally just. Documenting living with their disorder) being taken down. You could argue that them simply documenting their disorder is harmful, but this is the same website that allows racism, transphobia, homophobia, full blown nazis. And other eating disorder focused accounts (such as BED, which I am not saying is any less serious or important of a disorder) are allowed to remain. Unfortunately, I think this results in communities like ed twt, which is such a vile place… 

Specifically, if you go on TikTok, (I know it’s a cesspool) it is hard as FUCK to find any accounts that are focused on having an ED. You can find pro recovery ones, where they often demonize people with eds. I notice people with anorexia are often villainized on TikTok. However, BED focused accounts where the user is not actively recovering are permitted to stay.

I’m not saying I want pro Ana content up. I’m not saying I want a “safe space” for unhealthy habits and behaviors to flourish, along with self harm, but I WOULD like there to be more permitted spaces online where people struggling with an ED are allowed to be open and honest about their struggles.

I wasn't anything impressive but I felt better about myself. I felt confident. Skinny guys would ask me how to gain muscle, I'd get asked to do physically demanding tasks. I felt strong and like I looked better than how I looked when I was deathly sick despite being at a much higher weight. I feel like I looked better when I was bulking and fatter than how I look now. 

Like I definitely had bad bdd blues but I at least had moments in the day that I felt confident and good. I can't even feel good now about not eating, since I know I'm wasting all the progress I made. I cant lift half of what I used to, I feel fragile and small and weak but it makes no sense. I'm such a fucking contradiction since this is exactly what I wanted.

Like I really feel like I have no redeeming qualities in my physique now. Even if I was fatter back then, I at least had muscles and now I just have fucking nothing. 

I stopped going to the gym after I restricted my calories too low intentionally. For some reason, I thought that if I lost enough weight, I'd feel less dysmorphia once I got skinnier, and then I'd be able to go back to the gym. For some reason, I thought I'd be able to set a goal weight and start eating again once I hit it. I have, and I can't. 

I've tried to go back to the gym, but I've lost so much of my strength and mass that it feels pointless. I feel like I'd just end up spinning my wheels again, and I'd inevitably fall into a gain-relapse loop over and over if I don't get sickly ill again. And it's also like. I've fucked myself over this far, why not get worse? In for a penny in for a pound. It's so contradicting and I feel stuck. I know nothings going to change either. I've been feeling like this for months and I can't do anything about it but rage about about losing mass, seethe about not losing fast enough. Either way I just find new ways to feel like shit.

I am binging for years, but just recently I realised that I am doing this. Before I wouldn t thought about food, because I would eat every second of the afternoon. Now I try to tell myself I am not hungry, but I feel like losing my mind. I eat until I feel sick, then tell myself why am I doing this and that is harming me, but then the 2nd day I binge again...
I never ate in the morning and don t feel hungry, but since I found out about what is occuring to me, I can t stop thinking about my meal. I even tried to eat in the morning so I don t binge anymore, but doesn t help...once I feel the taste in my mouth I can t stop. So I don t force myself to eat in morning anymore. Then I thought eating healthy as I really like healthy food actually would help, but it didn t help at all so I quit that as well. All I am craving is sweets, sweets, sweets. Not fast food, not chips, no soda...only stuff like chocolate, sugars.Even if I stop enjoying the food, the binge continues. The binge happens after lunch time, at about 3pm and lasts until around 7pm when the hunger suddenly dissapears. The only times I forget about my cravings is when something bad happens or I am playing sports or I am in a social situation/or with family. The worst is when I watch tv like i really get bored and try to pay attention to movie but I feel like I have to move, but if I go for a walk all I think about is sweets again and when I try to study like I really can t focus. Then I binge and my head and stomach hurt really bad so my study is ruined.
Sorry for the long post, didn t knew where to share my struggle as no one is taking me seriously as it didn t affect me physically(looks) and my mom is scared that i may have diabetes. At this point I am not worried about my weight which shockingly wasn t affected by my binging habbit(may be that I walk a lot), but about my health.

My solution was to split my eating into 3 larger meals and try to eat very similar things (if not the same thing) everyday to make things less stressful for myself.

I got gastroparesis when I was severely underweight (my lowest BMI was >!15.2!< which I maintained for a year or so) and although it got much better in recovery, it never went away completely. It's been almost seven years since my last bout with anorexia.

Now that I've relapsed and been eating very little for a few months, I feel the symptoms are coming back and it's making it even harder to eat at all. I'm not even underweight yet and I've taken care to eat solid food every day (I suspect my gastroparesis was caused by being on a liquid diet the last time around) so I don't understand why it would become a problem again. Lots of fiber and vegetables as well, and I drink plenty of water.

I feel full after just a bite or two, get pretty severe nausea (no vomiting, thankfully) 20-30 minutes after eating, and no matter what I eat, it makes me so bloated I might as well be six months pregnant. Obviously that doesn't help my ED issues.

So we've been watching it together as i run but mostly walk on the treadmill.
I completely forgot that the whole reason why I watched it in the first place was bc one of the episodes focuses on a girl with an ed.

So I awkwardly watched it with my mom. Running at high sped the entire time to avoid awkward silence.

She did ofc ask ""so do you still throw up your food?""
ive been doing it minimum 4 times a week for a little while now. I was ""recovered"" about a year ago when I quit for 50 days in the beginning of 2022.

My mom found out the day I decided to quit completely coincidentally. So I didn't mind going into detail as a ""person in recovery"".

But yeah that only lasted 50 days and ive been bulimic on and off ever since.

So when she asked that question I lied and said ""nope! i quit, im exercising instead dont you see?"" as if i didnt purge an hour beofore.

I also added ""its not like im losing weight anyways, how could i be bulimic"" and she went on about how im maintaining my ""lean"" figure. My immediate response was ""mom im literally overweight according ti my bmi"" but she said stuff like ""no way youre overweight""

To be fair i am close to being a healthy weight, but i havent been losing rapidly.

So because of the stress of the situation I managed to run fast for a whole hour with only 1 water break.
I wouldn't have done that since im still not used to running for that long but bc of the anxiety i did it!!!

I had heart palpitations and sometimes dull chest/left arm pains when restricting or after b/p sessions, but those generally went away once I got my shit together and began recovery. I also stopped being light-headed and those kinds of things. 

I've always had issues with insomnia, but recently went through a period of pretty intense stress. I wasn't sleeping well, but I was eating well, and earlier this week, I took an advil PM on Monday and woke up with a sore throat and fatigue on Tuesday. I felt really tired Tuesday, had a killer headache, but slept 10 hours that night and by Wednesday my headache and sore throat were gone. I was feeling fine, just mostly tired, but didn't actually rest well that night. On Thursday, I felt decent in the morning, then decided to make the half hour walk to my college campus carrying my heavy backpack so I could go to class. During class, I began to feel quite light-headed and dizzy, almost like I was about to pass out. My heart fluttered a bit in my chest, so I figured I maybe needed more calories because I was sick and just starting recovery, so I ate a granola bar. Went straight home after class, but kept feeling very tired and suddenly began fearing that I was having heart issues, because of the heart palpitation I experienced earlier in class. Before bed, I began to feel nauseous (though I'd already been feeling a bit nauseous the past few days; I chalked it up to being sick) and like my chest felt heavy/I couldn't breathe well. I didn't sleep well at all that night, just tossing and turning. Friday I felt god awful.... I kept feeling like my chest was heavy/I was short of breath, I was incredibly tired and lightheaded. I ate proper meals throughout the day but after eating two bananas at night I suddenly felt a lot better, so I thought it may have been my potassium levels? I was also nauseous, especially at night. But I'm not sure. Tossed and turned the whole night as well. Today I felt a bit better in the morning, but my hands began tingling and I had some minor chest/arm pains. Now I feel nauseous again, and lightheaded/dizzy when I stand up. I can't tell if I'm imagining or exaggerating these dull chest and arm pains, but sometimes my hands will tingle. I don't know what to do. I can't tell if this is sickness affecting my heart, signs of a heart problem, just sleep deprivation.... or some sort of combination? What should I do? I'm honestly super worried to go to sleep because it's my biggest fear that something will happen to my heart in my sleep, which is probably why my sleep quality has been so poor lately (and is also probably exacerbating my symptoms). I told my mom and she didn't seem that worried, but it's freaking me out a bit, especially now that it's nighttime. I always get this feeling of impending doom at night when I'm sleep-deprived, so I can't tell if I'm being unreasonable or what I should do?

944,"my ed has been a very personal, extremely selfish, highly guarded, very real, ever present, issue with simply : ""not wanting to be how I was made"".",3,11orwj1,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11orwj1/my_ed_has_been_a_very_personal_extremely_selfish/,0,"I know that this is a wildly unpopular opinion, but I hate the focus on body diversity. I hate celebrating weight. In general. Why are we doing this at any size? 

It is so triggering. I hate that I even typed that word out, but it just is. This bothers me so much and it obviously shouldn't because all shapes sizes colors should feel welcome to do and be whatever the fuck they want in their own space. All sizes and shapes, ALL sizes and shapes should be free to feel whatever they want. 

Sometimes it's hard not to feel personally targeted by these in your face models that do not fit the typical model stereotype. I feel like these body diversity campaigns are attacking the way I personally like my body to look and feel. I feel like my existence at a certain size is not acceptable. So I don't feel like I can decline an invite to lunch without feeling judged for ""NoT eAtInG"". I feel like I've been personally called out in my own skin when it is made so abundantly clear that being thin is not only unacceptable but is unattainable. Its weird how ""energy drink is life"" is not accepted the same way as ""leg day is life"". 

My struggle with ED is about me, and perfecting the pile of flesh I'm navigating the world in. 

This daily personal drama with the skinny mirror angled on the floor vs the mirror hanging on the back of the door is fucking ri-dic-ulous. I'm WELL aware of how stupid this whole number is, but it has nothing to do with anyone else. It has always been solely, 100%, painstakingly felt in every single fiber of my being  that this battle has always been a very solitary one. It has nothing to do with how anyone else looks or how anyone else feels about the way I look. An ED doesn't care, there is no brain space left over for that. 

When a person stands in front of the mirror and takes immediate issue with who they see, or even with the amount of space they occupy that's an internal battle. When they are disgusted at the most fundamental shape of their bone structure , that's so completely unquestionably obvious to me (and the rest of the quiet body diversity hating population) that I have a ME problem. 

Its a very personal, extremely selfish, highly guarded, very real, ever present, issue with simply wanting to be not what you are. 

It's an inability to accept a lack of control and or a lack of perfection. I don't see other people the way I see myself. I don't care what other people look like in a sense I'm not judging them. In fact, I know the pain of this disease. 

What I don't understand is this idea that there exist some kind of secret members only plus size people hating club?  

The fact that people (judging me) think I have time in my day to spare after spending approximately 37 minutes obsessing over how my left arm will look in a long sleeve shirt if I sit down is absolutely insanity because I so clearly dedicate 1000% of all available extra minutes to  hating my own reflection. 

I feel like that is what the world does not understand. This awareness of my size is never too far from what I am doing, what I am thinking, or wher I am. I am very much a  suffer alone, in the dark, in silence type. But with the health craze, Instagram influencers, and muscles for days as far as the eye can see.....I feel like people are so in my face telling me it's not okay to feel the way I feel and that there is something wrong with me.

Unfortunately for me, I am wired this way. There is no cure from me. Whether I was born a little ball of self hate or I learned to allow the scale a maddening power over my life is irrelevant at this point because once infected this feels like a forever thing. 

I've been lucky enough to remain living, and I've tried to accept the things I cannot change. I've found a way to live around it. 

Do I wish I could change it? 

Honestly....? 

Yes. But sometimes only from a sense of : I wish I was naturally something I liked more. 

I simply do not like who I am, how I appear, or how I FEEL when I am over or under a certain weight. I never asked anyone else to like it, or even accept it because coincidentally, i am also the only one who has got to wake up every day and like how I look & feel well enough to make the conscious choice keep participating in my own life. Its so frustrating that the way I like to look or want to look is not acceptable or deemed  toxic by someone else. 

My recoil with this super positivity movement is rooted in how those things make me feel about myself.  Seeing bodies and exposed skin stretched to the limit displayed as this thing to be desired just doesnt jive with my brain. It actually gives me mind numbing anxiety to imagine myself at weights that are now being celebrated. It's like a contradictory image to the way I personally want to look and feel. 

I just feel like this whole movement picked a fight with me when I was minding my own business strolling through target sipping my extra dirty chai tea latte. This unconventional bikini model seemingly staring straight into my soul telling me that it doesn't matter what I look like as long as I like who I am. 

Flooding the world with ""I am beautiful, I am enough+, I <3 big beautiful women"" doesnt change the fact that I have a body I haven't always enjoyed living in. But unfortunately, these affirmations do not change my aversion to curves or calories. 

An ED is deeper than a movement.  

Hi it's me, attempting to control this bag of bones makes me feel closer to the pretty that I think is beautiful.

I kind of feel like I don’t have the right or don’t fit in here or something. Like my issue isn’t nearly as severe as others. And I’m sorry in advance for taking up time and space.

When someone thinks of ED, I don’t feel like I’m who comes to mind. I’m a middle aged man. I haven’t been diagnosed with anything. But I have thoughts that are starting to scare me, and I want to get them out into the universe.

Some background. I was always undersized as a child. Small boned, malnourished, and kind of neglected. As a guy growing up when I did, small was the last thing you wanted to be. So I ate like a garbage truck to make up for it. Even into my 30’s and 40’s. 

Then my metabolism slowed down and I started filling out. Which was fine, but I felt misshaped and odd. Like Mister Burns from *The Simpsons*, thin arms and legs, larger belly. Freaking gross, honestly.

Fast forward to 2020. I got COVID just before vaccines were available. It didn’t hit me as bad as some, but it certainly wasn’t “just a cold”. Symptoms lasted for a few months - particularly my breathing.

Sometime in 2021, I decided to cut gluten and dairy. My breathing got better. I started walking. Then I progressed to free weights. COVID scared the hell out of me, and I was determined to get healthy going into my later years.

Sounds like a win, right? But wait.

So like I said before, I was a small kid. No matter how much I worked out, I couldn’t gain weight or mass. In middle age, that’s changed. My shoulders and chest have progressed nicely, better than I could have ever hoped in my 20’s.

But now that that has happened, my gut freaks me out more than ever. It’s not going away. So I started intermittent fasting, then progressed to restriction. 

I find myself paranoid to eat bread. I find myself panicking during the morning waiting to eat. I mentally beat the hell out of myself when I finally do eat.

I feel like that’s how ED starts, and I’m kind of freaked out by it. I was never someone who cared about aesthetics, yet here I am.

And I know, I know…it’s ridiculous. I read some of the other posts here, and it’s like “dude, get over yourself, other people have real problems”. 

But it’s still kind of scary. I don’t know. Sorry for the rant.",1678459819.0
954,Anyones mom OBSESSED with YOUR weight?,13,11oeyty,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11oeyty/anyones_mom_obsessed_with_your_weight/,1,"This is in fact what triggered my ED. Let me explain (it’s kind of the reverse of most situations I feel like) 

When I was 12, I lost a few pounds (trying not to put numbers!) because I was slightly overweight, and I decided to eat healthier and start exercising more. Once I lose the few pounds, and am a healthy weight (still on the higher end) she freaks out, tells me I have an eating disorder, and takes me to a therapist. They say I’m in denial when I say I don’t have an eating disorder and my mom pushes this narrative relentlessly. Even so putting me in outpatient forcing me to gain these pounds back. I’m in outpatient and cooperating and doing good (but they still say I’m in denial because I don’t admit to ever having an Ed) but also pissed because she is forcing me to gain weight when not necessary), she ends up somehow getting me put in inpatient in another state, and I gain even more weight. (I’m gone for months btw) (and I didn’t cooperate because I was confused, and the food tasted so bad I opted for ensure A LOT) anyways when I got out, that’s when the real ED started!! Because I was uncomfortable with being force fed and I picked up these habits being around others, I learned a lot and ended up getting very ill because at this point it was like an F you to my mom for putting me through all of that unnecessary trauma. Even after recovery the second time, if I was weight restored she still wanted me to be a specific weight and would threaten to put me back inpatient if I didn’t gain x lbs in a month. Because she had this ideal of what she wanted me to be at, even though my eating habits were normal and healthy. Even after turning 18 she would threaten to take me to court and get rights over me to claim I wasn’t mentally stable and force me inpatient again. She would threaten to kick me out at least once a month if she thought I was losing weight. 

It just irritates me so much to think about. My mom is incredibly controlling but she never took it out on my sister this way. She pokes at both of our weights constantly, to me it’s always that I look like I’m losing my butt (I’m 25 now) to my sister she gives her dieting advice and ideas because she wants to help her lose weight.

I hold so much contempt towards my mom and I wish I could cut her out completely, maybe one day I will. It’s so hard to explain this to people too, because it’s a shitstorm of an experience obviously. And I feel like it’s not that common this way, it’s more common for it to be the other way around.

I had a mastectomy, my chest is flat. It’s about 80% of why I developed an ED in the first place; I didn’t want to be curvy with a flat chest, it made me feel deformed and like a monster. The thing is, I’m finally happy with my body. My BMI is >!18!<, so I’m 100% sure they will want me to gain weight, BUT. The mastectomy got rid of >!13!< lbs of fat and breast tissue, so technically I would weigh that much more, and my BMI would then be >!20.4!<, which is healthy.

973,Just some mom rant,2,11ogvyv,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/11ogvyv/just_some_mom_rant/,0," So yesterday we were watching a TV program and there was a girl who revealed that she weighs >!39kg!<  and after hearing that my mom said ""but she doesn't look thin she looks like you"" (im like >!5 kg!< heavier than that 😆)

She also occasionally makes comments that are implying she thinks i am too thin (e.g. ""you should put on some weight"", "" >!You look bony / like a skeleton!< "", ""you started to look like x [names a anorexic acquaintance]"" ) 

I really don't get her like does she thinks im thin or not?? Because she keeps saying sht like this but when a acquaintance refers to me as thin she literally gets in a defensive mode and corrects them by saying ""she is not thin she is normal"" (YES i am actually at a healthy weight for my height age but  why do you make comments about me being too thin then?) 

And it's not like she makes those comments when we are in private because sometimes she also makes comments about me being too thin around acquaintances 😭 (which is embrassing as fck because i'm literally not so people must be thinking sth like that ""hahaha does she really think her daughter is skinny"" ) 

Oh she also always trying to force me to eat more (and this is fking annoying because currently i'm not restricting at all)",1678530709.0

I added a couple chocolate chips. It’s been one of my new safe foods. 

My boyfriend notices this and is like “…you added chocolate chips to your oatmeal?” “Yeah it tastes good you should try it.” “Well doesn’t that destroy the purpose of a healthy breakfast?”

He knows of my ED so this enrageeeeeed me. I ask him why would he say something like that to me. He says it was just a constructive comment. I say something like “you know I don’t have a good relationship with food you can’t just make snide comments like that.” He then says “everyone has a relationship with food stop overreacting.”

I’m so mad for so many reasons. A) he eats takeout and shitty food all the time, yet I’m unhealthy for putting a half serving of chocolate chips in my oatmeal? B) he knows my history, so why would he DOUBLE DOWN?

I always thought that my partner wasn’t like the people that I see get posted on here but I’m wrong.

I have issues with finishing most of my meals but this lunch, I went into it super motivated to finish (burrito and handful of chips). All the meals are timed with lunch being at 30 mins, but if you were like  close to being done at the end point, you could usually ask for like an extra minute to finish, otherwise you'd be supplemented. So at the end of the 30 mins, I'd finished my burrito (which tbh at that point was a miracle for me) and had a handful of chips left, so I asked to be allowed to finish but then the diet tech said no, I had to throw the food out, and be fully supplemented because the rule now was that no one can get even one extra second to complete unless specifically said in their meal plan. I just need to rant and say that how in the world is that even remotely close to real life?? I get the whole timed meals thing at ED programs but no one would ever say you can't take even two seconds to finish your food because the timer said so?? And it's honestly bizarre to me that you would outright deny someone with a restrictive eating disorder and known tendency to not complete to finish their food. And then when I was drinking the supplement, I got told I was drinking the supplement too fast. My motivation's pretty much plummeted into the abyss at this point even though it was high before this lunch.

I feel it's a ""damned-if-you-do-damned-if-you-don't"" issue. Say ""Yes, you should!"", and you may be answering incorrectly if the original poster is likely going to B/P the food later, if they have a health issue that means they should not eat the food (e.g, hypotension, IBS, lactose intolerance/celiac, etc.), or that they have BED and you are actually perpetuating disordered behavior. Say ""No, you shouldn't"", and then you're ""curating a pro-ana space"".   


I can never answer these posts, because all the comments are something akin to ""YASSS QUEEN EAT THE TWINKIES"", and it becomes clear that OP is looking for reassurance to eat junk food. Which is fine if that's what's asked. If OP were to say, ""Hey, I'm really struggling with disordered thoughts around eating x. Can someone give me some reassurance that it's ok to eat it and not feel bad?"" rather than asking us if they *should* eat it, I'd be more apt to answer them honestly and with more empathy.
