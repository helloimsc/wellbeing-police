If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",1663429685.0

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",1572360722.0

I had 3 abusive partners, 2 of which severely SA'd me as well as physically and mentally abusing me. The other one was just extremely physically violent and mentally abusive. I've been single now for a year, and obviously have no plans on interacting with anyone romantically. 

I've stayed in a psych ward 3 times. I've been to every kind of therapy you could imagine. I also study psychology and have done for a while, so im very aware of the system, treatment, the process of getting help. I've been through this too many times. 

The main thing that has pushed me this deep into a hole is that despite my mental health issues. I am responsible for my 2 young nieces, as well as my sister, their mother, is incapable to say the least. I am responsible for their wellbeing, I am responsible for my sisters wellbeing, I am responsible for my mother's well being. If I don't constantly hold them all up everything crumbles and chaos ensues.They are all aware of my mental health, but they are all so self consumed and so wrapped up drama and negativity to acknowledge that I might struggle too. I know people are going to tell me I'm not responsible and I shouldn't take on that pressure but I'm telling you, if I did not pour my entire self into those kids and keeping them safe, keeping my mum and sister from fighting, acting like im okay so that they don't make it all about themselves and how I am such a burden, even though I help them more than they have ever ever helped me, then everything would fall apart. Those kids emotionally rely on me. And I am not capable of giving them or anyone else what they need. I have no help, no one seems to listen.

My dad is dead, he's the only man I'll ever love. I can't hold this family together. I can't care for 2 kids when I can't care for myself. I've been through everything too many times. I've been here too many times. I wake up and im devastated that I have to face another day. I don't enjoy the human experience. I never have. I don't want to have to live. It's exhausting and I know shit can get better but then bad times come again, and I just can't do it anymore. I really can't. I relapsed in SH which I hadn't done in a year. I enjoyed it. Because I'm done. 

 I don't have anyone to talk to so this post is just things I need to get off my chest I guess. Thanks to anyone who reads this, it means a lot that anyone would take the time to read my words. 

Thanks again, sorry for the long post, I'm sorry if this brings anyone down also. I do not intend to be triggering.",1679175315.0

My problem: actually packing to leave. In the past the only time I’ve ever had to pack was during traumatic experiences. Being ripped from my childhood home, being kicked to the streets by my bio mother, and having to move in from the streets with my bio father. So, just packing up my tiny room of junk at my dads house feels like I’m about to enter another round of horrible trauma. It’s not a lot of stuff, but every time I start packing tears start falling and I end up spiraling. I’ve been procrastinating it. 

At this point, I’m going to have to smoke a lot of weed and just start throwing things in trash bags because it’s easier than actually boxing them and it gets it done faster. But the thing with that is, I’ve only ever moved in trash bags. This is my chance to actually have a proper move instead of being given the old foster system carrier. 

I don’t know. I can’t share this with anyone because everyone thinks I’m so excited to be out on my own. And obviously my living situation isn’t the safest. My dad and his family are all out on vacation right now without me and I’m meant to be getting my shit ready to be taken to my apartment.

I don’t even know what to title this… but basically I’ve been off work since august, let go last week and in the process of applying for disability benefits. Had a full mental breakdown. Really struggle to do anything at all. I have bad anxiety in addition to depression and am waiting to be assessed for autism and adhd which are both very likely. Since being off work I have left the house definitely less than ten times, I don’t go out as I am far too anxious. I have anxiety attacks when I’m just chilling in bed ffs. I don’t speak to any friends and I have no bandwidth to be around people. I am constantly exhausted and have no motivation or energy to do anything. Unfortunately this means that a lot of household tasks have fallen on my mum, even to the extent of her cooking meals for me. She makes me food every day and when she doesn’t I don’t eat. Today she being short with me and then exploded with me about how I never help her and I’m selfish which really upset me and has been on repeat in my head all day, she went out after saying it and hasn’t spoken to me since. She is also struggling to look after my grandma who has early dementia and is in complete denial about it. She says I’m selfish for not helping her with my grandma. 
Now I completely understand her frustration at having so many things to do and I know that she is struggling too, but I can’t help her. I tried to help by not changing my clothes as often and only using minimal crockery to ease some of the workload but I am not able to do anything else rn. I currently cannot make myself wash or make food or anything. It’s so difficult because I feel like a piece of shit stressing my mum out but I don’t know what the hell to do when I can’t *do* anything. I feel like such a fucking burden all the time and wish I could just switch it off.  She also said it’s been the same situation for months which hurt as well, as if I haven’t been trying to get  better when in reality the doctor and I haven’t found the right medication for me yet and I’ve been waiting for therapy treatment since June.

She’s been struggling for a couple of years. I noticed a lot of superficial cuts on her arms and got her in for a psychological evaluation last summer. She was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and OCD and started Zoloft. It noticeably helped with her OCD symtoms, but the rest stayed about the same. Last month she told me she thought a lot about killing herself was really afraid she might actually do it. She said she comes close sometimes then talks herself out of it. We went to her Dr who sent us to urgent care and she was taken to a behavioral health inpatient program 2 hours away. There’s no inpatient for adolescents here even though it’s a decent sized city with multiple hospitals. They upped the Zoloft and added seroquil to her meds, hydroxyzine as needed for anxiety.

While she was gone I did my best to set up outpatient care The psychologist told me she needs to be in an intensive outpatient program after discharge, but there’s nothing like that here. I found an intensive outpatient program online that involves 3 hours of virtual group therapy 3 days a week, one hour of individual therapy and one hour of family therapy once a week for 12 weeks. So 11 hours of virtual therapy for 12 weeks plus I planned on taking her to in person counseling once a week, and just that was nearly impossible to find. All the therapists and and behavioral clinics here have long waiting lists. I bought safes and locked up meds and anything else that could be a danger. She hates the social aspect of school, but her grades are great and I read that adolescent suicide rates drastically increase during the school year so I told her she could finish the year out online. Her absences this year were off the charts and I thought that would help. 

She came home after two weeks and three days later she told me that she lied about how she felt to the drs because she wanted to come home. She said that was a mistake and that she was really scared of hurting herself. She said I’d forgotten to roll the dial on the combo lock box after I got her meds that morning and she took the her antidepressants out planning to take the whole bottle but when she texted a friend to say goodbye they talked her out of it. She went back to the hospital last night. 

I’m a single parent without much of a support system. My parents work a lot and we’re all struggling financially. I have to work full time Monday through Friday in order to provide for us. I just don’t know what more I can do, but I’ll do anything I can. She’s everything to me.",1679156039.0

I know I’m not perfect, but I am a good woman, and have always had his back. I never nagged him about chores, never stopped him from doing what he wants. And I know I always made sure he knew I was satisfied. And he knows I appreciate all he’s done in our relationship. 

Right now he’s not interested in sex and I have not even tried to do anything. Because I don’t want to make him feel guilty for not wanting it. 
I know depression is rough, but how he treats me makes me feel like it’s me. 
I am loyal, I am kind, I try to understand that we both have jobs and we’re both tired, so I’m always willing to help where I can. 

I take hurtful things he says to me, and try not to react (but he’s my husband and I truly love him so it hurts) but I will let it go and try to forget it by not bringing things up, or trying to ask why questions. 
I’m really at a loss here and I don’t know what to do. We’ve been together for 16 years. He’s all I know, he’s my best friend. And now I feel alone. 

I want him to get better and feel happy again, and I want to be here for him, he pushes me away and I know I can’t force my way into his healing if he doesn’t want me there.

Because a part of me does desire to leave everything behind, not necessarily commit self-harm but leave for good. I even think about the girl that broke my heart. I think I wouldn’t tell people about my imminent death. Not out of fear but because I wouldn’t see any real purpose behind coming out with information like that.

You don't see her as sparkling beautiful but there's an almost 'ugly' honesty to them in the sense that they look real.

My family is awesome. They are mostly doing well in life. They are supportive of me in almost everything I do. And they are almost all I have, I like spending time alone and I honestly don't know how to make friends anymore.

But there's times when I just feel so awful around them, it doesn't take much: ""your hair is a mess go fix it"", then correcting my grammar errors when I text them, taking and spending photos of me when I'm on my phone... It's little nothing done with good intention but I'm a mess, I already feel so worthless I don't want to be reminded of it everytime I speak to them...

I do tell them maybe way more emotional than they should, that it hurts me, that their words stay in my mind for hours without leaving me alone...

And they told me to stop taking everything so personally. ""Genius, I never thought of that!""

I know it's not easy for them either, I mean it's a family thing so I can be judgmental as well.

But it hurt so much.

As for the reason for my tears today: my parents decided to adopt a dog, I'm the only child still at home so they ask me to help find a name for him. It's the year of the U so I picked Ursus, I find it cute and my parents do too.

When we annonce it on the family chat, one of my sisters responded by saying that it wasn't lucky to fall on the year of U. The others say that it was true but there were still other options. It's stupid as hell, but I was so happy for this little dog and that my Idea was liked by my parents. Hearing both my sisters implying that it was not a good name made me feel so bad.

So I tell them: ""I chose this name and we like it, don't be a ass about it"" 

Of course I was way to violent about it. And once again I was reply by ""stop caring so much"", ""we have the right to say out mind without being guilt trip or tell at"" 

And they are right.

I want to respond to protect what little self love I have still left but my mom stops me, keep going will just make things worse. And I only have m'y family so I don't want that.

But now I am alone with nobody to listen and I feel stupid to cry over something like that but more than that I feel hurt.

I don't understand how people are maintaining happiness when the world is the way it is. To do anything in life you have to play by the game of a system they set up. Follow rules, policies, fees, penalties, processes, etc. Etc. Etc., Especially if it has anything to do with money. And we all know that these rules etc. don't necessarily come from well intentioned places. 

People look out for themselves, for those they care about, not the vast unknown amount of people. It's become a common method of living for some people, who choose a path of walking on others and using them to raise themselves up. Being sus and sketch and making our system beneficial to the few and only the few. But this behaviour has consequences, of which I see and feel every day. From people living paycheck to paycheck, to more and more people going on services such as food banks, income assistance, etc. It's become impossible to afford living, food prices have raised, gas prices are rediculous, you have to pay to get to work then pay to park to work then work and not make enough to pay for anything. You take extra work, but then you get burnt out, your trying to maintain some essence of a standard of living, but due to rental prices can't afford a safer location. Your mental health just keeps taking hits after hits. You move to help with prices, more bad shit happens that is the exact same. Friends die, your pain increases, your health worsens, people are yanked and pulled out of your life, friend no foe, stress, you yourself start getting diagnosed and have to then pivot to try and manage life. Life feels like a constant fight for survival... How can anyone starting out have any hope of owning a home, affording a family, having a yard for children to play in, etc. Not everyone has families that can buy them houses and help them out. Some people are in this world alone, trying to learn it alone, trying to figure it out alone. Living shouldn't be barely surviving to line the pockets of the people we elect to take care of us. Wake up, work, function, sleep, repeat. Don't get anywhere, don't have anything, just suck it up and take it.

But eventually the functioning slows, putters, sometimes stops altogether. Your mental health and depression is so bad. Fighting for help is even worse. Can't get better unless you pay. Can't pay unless you work, can't work unless your better... There is so much unfair shit in the world. Why do parents even try to keep things fair? They're just going to have disappointed children with trauma from realizing how unfair the world is. No one at the top is looking down going let's take money from the wealthy to help make life more equal and fair. They're the ones telling us you need a pen and then selling it to us because they bought all the pens before telling you you needed one. Covid, now a war, of course because they don't care about human lives more than money and being a dominating economic country. Because money is on the top and that's all that matters bull fucking shit. I'm done not making sense now... The world sucks and it's why I'm depressed and I have no hope that things will get better because it's a constant band aid",1679190302.0

I have never told my story to a stranger. Admittedly, it's about damn time I get this off my chest. So here we go. This won't be brief, and it won't be easy for me.

Background: I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child, and was on medication before my teenage years. My mother is clinically depressed, a severe alcoholic and has used medications her entire life for anxiety and depression. I have been on and off meds my entire life as well, and currently take Alprazolam (xanax) on a daily basis. My dad was a very happy go-lucky guy, but dealt with extreme anger issues and had VERY volatile emotions. I observed countless, terrible fights between the two growing up, along with poor behavior on both sides. I'm honestly surprised they didn't get divorced. My mom got two DUIs in less than a year when I was in high school, and my dad was constantly smoking pot (I took this up as well, eventually). Growing up, my dad took a lot of anger out on me and my two older brothers through physical discipline. I remember dealing with major depression and anxiety as early as junior high. Despite all of these early life events, my Dad has always been my best friend.

Let's get to the point: The guts of this story. I have been battling non-stop for the past 5 years in what have been the most difficult years of my life. My family was pretty close growing up, so family means the world to me, like it does to many people. I began dating a girl in 2014 from my home town in Idaho, right after I was commissioned as a Naval Officer and had just started my journey as a student pilot. She cheated on me, plain and simple, due to her insecurities. She was upfront about it, and I appreciated her honestly in the matter and didn't want to toss our relationship to the wind. I ended up getting married to this person at the age of 26, after having been booted from flight school and was assigned other duties as a young officer in the Navy. I was stationed in Florida for the duration of my service; my wife and I enjoyed the best days our lives during this period. We moved back to our home town in 2017 after my four years of service were complete. We moved in with my parents because they had the room and were always willing to accommodate. We were both excited and ready to embark on this next chapter together. That year of living with my parents together was exceedingly detrimental to our mental state. I regret the decision to this day.

This is where the story takes a turn in the wrong direction, and doesn't really stop. The events began in 2016 when my grandmother (Dad's side) passed away after battling lymphoma for 16 years. She fought hard, and I loved her to death. She passed while I was on a plane flying back home to see her. Her passing was expected because her time was near. At least I made the funeral. I still remember our last phone conversation; with the final 'I love you grandma'.

Less than a year later, a tumor decided to grow on my Dad's neck. This would be successfully removed through very intense chemotherapy and radiation, which took its toll on the man. More on this later. Six more family members passed away over the next 3 years. The most detrimental at the time being my uncle Steve, my mom's brother. He was paralyzed from the waste down the year I was born, from a roofing accident, and battled everything to do with being a paraplegic for the next 30 years. He would eventually succumb to a multitude of illnesses and I was the first to see him deceased at the hospital on the day he passed. He was as much a mentor and prominent figure in my life as my dad. His absence will always be present in our lives, and he is dearly missed. My dad spear headed the efforts to renovate his house, with our help, so that we could sell it and move forward. During this process, my other uncle, grandmother and grandfather (Mom's side) also passed. There was no time to mourn. People kept dying. We eventually sold my uncle's house after a ton of effort from my dad, mom, my wife and myself. It was time to put that chapter behind us, if that was even possible.

Very shortly after these events things got much, much worse. In late 2020, my wife decided to leave me. This was beyond soul crushing. I fought with every fiber in my being to find out why and remedy the situation, but it turns out there was no real reason. The only words she could muster were that 'she fell out of love with me'. We did not have an abusive relationship by any means. On the contrary, I supported her on major career changes and every hobby interest she embarked on. I truly felt that I was a very good provider, but I know there are always two sides to every story. It wasn't the perfect marriage, and I know I wasn't the best husband. We fought like a lot of couples, but I loved her with all of my heart. Regardless, it looked like I was destined to go through a divorce.

Less then a month later, my dad was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. He was given only several months to live. The cancer that had appeared on his neck a few years back had metastasized through his entire body. My entire world began spiraling out of control. After falling to the lowest low I've ever experienced, I found myself dry-firing my pistol against my head multiple times without ammo, and I talked myself out of this pure stupidity by realizing my dad is still here and needs support. This became my only purpose for living.

Over the next nine months I spent every waking moment outside of work with my dad. I was able to learn things about him I never knew, and formed a relationship with him that never existed prior. He spent most of his remaining time building and listening to his vinyl collection. We always shared the same love of music. One of his favorite genres was 60s jazz.

This part is significant and beyond explanation to me. One day he stated to me, about one particular record: ""Son, if you ever find yourself stuck or in a funk, and just don't know what direction your day is supposed to go, put this on and it'll take you places"". I will never forget these words. The day came when my family notified me that he fell down after going to the bathroom and I needed to get over there immediately. I left right away and showed up 10 minutes later. He was on the couch leaning against my brother, looking practically unconscious with his eyes wide open. He still looked like he was trying to stay alive. We laid him down on the couch and called hospice. We could tell he was probably passing. In a sudden moment something shot inside me that I can't explain to this day. I got up and put on that record I remembered him talking about. This seemed to be what needed to happen. If he was about to pass it couldn't be in silence. The man thrived on and lived for music. I put the record on, sat behind him on the couch and held him. I told him that I know he can hear it and that I know he's jiving to it. I held him as he took his last breath a few minutes later. Not long after I put the record away and looked at the track that had played. It was called 'Let the music take your mind'. I knew then that my dad successfully danced his way into the afterlife. I hope.

Fast-forwarding a few months: I decided to quit my extremely stressful Federal job, sell my home and move into the house with my mom to provide support and hopefully build up the relationship between the two of us; which was never great to begin with. A month later my mom wrote the most disgusting, hurtful letter I have ever read in my life. Addressed to me, she wrote this letter on one page of loose leaf notebook paper. In summary she blamed me for her own unhappiness and that I don't understand a single thing about the dynamic between her and my dad, and asked why I don't want her to be happy. This was the most absurd, unexpected and hurtful thing I have ever read. One month later she started seeing a friend that she and my dad had known for 35 years, longer than I had been alive. All just two months after my dad passed away. Two months later while I was away in Portland, she moved him in to the house. I immediately started applying for jobs out of state and ended up moving to Denver, Colorado in April of 2022.

The job I ended up getting has turned out to be the best job of my entire life. A small company of 25 people that treat each other with respect and as if every employee is family. I live here completely alone, aside from my work family. Everyday I fight severe depression loneliness and severe anxiety. I have been here almost a year and haven't made a single friend, I attribute to my own mental issues. My social anxiety is crippling. I thing about suicide often. But I keep fighting the good fight. I know there are good people in this world, as there are awful people. I am constantly trying to find decent people to be around, and I spend most of my days alone after work, or after going to the gym. I can't seem to break the cycle I am in. I have hope that some day I will find someone that respects me for who I am. I hope that I can make some new friends. Until then, I'll keep fighting the hard endless fight. I know I can't quit or give up because that would be a disservice to those fighting worse battles.

If you made it through, thank you for your time. I hope I am not just spewing crap.",1679187665.0

I noticed that my only friend from that time hangs out with the people that bullied me, I haven't seen him for almost a year, most of my classmates from that year all hang out with each other, travel, they do a lot of things together.

I spent a couple of mins checking out their FB, they are all having normal social lives and here I am, all my accounts are empty, I have no one to call, no one to hang out with, nobody cares if I disappear or turn my phone off.

Sometimes I wonder, is it normal for a person to be like this? Your average Joe has friends, hangs out with someone atleast once? twice a week maybe? maybe more, depends on how close friendships are, so what, a couple of times a month...?

Basically i oscillate between two moods.  


I baptized the first one Dark sasuke:  
It's a permanent state of deep sadness, i easily cry, i do heavy self-depreciation, I feel like i'm an useless/worthless pile of flesh who'll never accomplish anything in his lifetime, it would be better for humanity if i'm dead, if i'm sent to a psych ward it will be a waste of public money and maybe I'll take the place of someone who needs it a lot more than I do,  Etc etc i think you get my point.  


The second :  
Way less self depreciation, no sadness, I'm calm, i'm more optimistic about my future, and i tend to minimize/doubt the sadness and the suicidal thoughts i had when i was previously in """"""""the other mood"""""""".  


I have no clue about what triggers either mood and there are things that don't change no matter my mental state. Loss of interest or pleasure in most or all normal activities (even meeting my family), Sleep disturbance, lack of energy, etc.

Have you ever experienced something similar to my current situation ? Is there a funny scientific word that describes it ?  If you've ever talked to your therapist about it, what did he say ?

*My 5 year relationship was disintegrating*

*A month and 3 weeks after my mom died, I contracted Covid on January 2nd 2021*

My dad moved away to get a job when I was around 11/12 (major recession and my parents were dead broke at this point). I went from seeing him every day to 2 weeks out of the year. We were constantly being told whether we were moving/not moving, leaving me in limbo if I was leaving all my friends/family behind (we never moved despite putting our home for sale). This ultimately strained my parent's marriage and they got divorced.

My mom tried to commit suicide when I was 14, I read her suicide notes that night and said nothing about it (she still doesn't know). If it wasn't for her friends and my brother she would have taken her own life while I sat in a room hoping she was going to be okay. She spent weeks in the hospital and it was just my brother and I trying to keep it together at age 14/17 but he was never home.

A year or so later my grandma was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia that she fought for 2 years before she decided not to go through chemo anymore and passed shortly after.

My brother was a drug addict, who is now clean from hard drugs but has become an alcoholic. He was emotionally unavailable and impossible to talk to without him getting angry.  I used to look up to him so much. I wanted to do everything he did. I started becoming scared to talk to him, let alone try to get his advice or have a serious conversation.

I fell in love at the end of high school. This girl took all the pain away. She distracted me from the fact that my family had fallen apart. I moved away for school and things came crashing down. She lied to me and broke my heart. This caused my first major depressive episode. I was extremely suicidal for 2 months and depressed for 2 years. One night I was really low, I drank a bunch of vodka and took the rest of my Ativan, I still have no memory of what happened the night...I just woke up. I still want to talk to her during my low points.

Every time I get low I look back on my past and always feel like it haunts me. I have so much regret for some of the decisions I made and things I said to the people that mattered to me. There were so many conversations I was too weak and scared to have that could have solved so many issues. I wish I could go back and re-live my high school / early college years since I missed so much trying to isolate myself.

I'm now in a fairly healthy relationship for the past 5 years. But I've slipped again. My depression has crept its way back and I can't get my past out of my head. My brain wants to isolate and burn down the life I've made for myself.

Am I really happy? Should I just end things so I can try to deal with my shit? I burdened my last relationship with my issues and it almost killed me. Why do I have to feel empty all the time? Why can't I let go of my ex?",1679180130.0

Cutting a long story short - I’ve been struggling with depression and OCD since I was about 15. It caused me to be anti-social and distant from everyone. I would especially feel like this in summer as I would never do anything because I was too mentally drained and depressed to care. 

However, recently (5 yrs later) I have gotten help and feel like I’d like to start reconnecting with people. Here’s where I’d be grateful for some advice.

I struggle to connect with my (once) closest friends now. I have no idea what to ask about to keep the convo flowing (this might be due to my self confidence of thinking no one wants to talk to me / I’m annoying them) and escape the tedious “how’s everything” convo. It gets me completely down and I relapse probably every 2 weeks into a full week of feeling so sad/lonely because I feel like I’ve ruined my whole life. 

Last week I slept in till 6pm half of the week just because I had no feeling of self worth due to having no one to just chat to. I’m not awkward or bad at making friends but I find it hard to reply to messages as I get the feeling no one will text back for some reason. 

I’d love to reconnect and chat daily/weekly with my friends (we still hangout sometimes not completely distant and are a big group of 15 so not everyone I’m super close with but civil/good friends) but unsure how to start the process as I always feel discouraged if I get the vibe I’m unwanted as I truly hate myself. (I have also explained my mental state so many times and been given the “we are always here for you” but I don’t want to be the complainer so obviously I don’t do this! Thanks for any help/insight.

I wanted to ask if anybody was in the same situation and how it played out in your experience. 
I'm about to travel solo for a month through South east Asia. I have travelled alone before but not for that long and not backpacking. 
I struggle with what I call depressive episodes. Not sure if it would qualify as full blown depression but when I'm low it's an unbearable low. 
Now, I don't have anybody really. Family does not live in the same country and don't have much contact to them. No real friends as I don't like socialising and just moved to a new country. I recently resigned from my job which was ultimately the right decision but it took the last pillar of routine from me and given that I'm as lonely as it gets I'm afraid that if I spiral down i have nothing really to come back for, if that makes sense. 

Ppl who struggle and travelled alone in the past, did it help with depression or did it make you feel overall worse?

I have zero clue why the good times are avoiding me and it's confusing. I would have a date and it's either hurting me or not happening. I got distanced by my friends and I have nothing, but a father who hurts me with every word his mouth leaves. My mother is never around, trying to cope with her divorce and struggles by having fun on her own. I won't judge her, we talked about this a lot and I enable her, because I am beyond grateful for everything she did for me. Like she was my only parent who has actually done some parenting and raising in my life. My dad is rotten to the core abusing me physically and verbally, doing nothing a parent would do, but oppress me, like I am a slave who is a tool to use for pride and glory. Also he hurt my mother and now divorces my mother because he wants to cut her off from any financial benefits just to mess with her. My dating life is going nowhere. I had a girlfriend I didn't even love, I just tried to somehow get the heartbreak shoved away because I have other things going on. What my father says is catching up to me, he is wrong because I already am a better person by not following his footsteps and be a raging alcoholic. But the facts are facts. I am far behind my peers in many ways. My love life is trash, I am envious of them in a way that I am happy for them, but I can't shake off the bitter feeling I have. I just can't get myself a lover who can make me forget all my problems for the moment I am with her, because she is the only thing on my mind then. I never had friends while others are more connected than organized crime families. I always was alone and the only solution I had was solving it myself, because I can never rely on help, I am alone in this and no one will help and it's the way things are. I suffer while others succeed without any trouble. Others just have everything worked out and have a happy life. I just need to embrace that I am a failure, a nobody who maybe will have a decent job and an apartment, but I will end up with no one to actually motivate me to be extreme and awesome. I have so much to give, but no one to give it to. I can't afford a therapist, I can't digest and turn my mind off. I did nothing right. I have no purpose in life, I not only failed as a functioning person in society, by not having a girlfriend, no friend groups to hang out with, nothing but failure after failure. I should have been an Average Joe and have no unique thoughts, be a slave to fashion and trends, I swear to God I would be happier. I just hope I will be dead the next day. I wish I was never born since I was definietly an accident. I had a feeling none of this should have happened, but now I know why. I should have never existed. I am an error in the system. I wonder how better the world would be without me. I don't know how much I can hold on, but I plan to leave this horrible place and spare everyone from my hideous looks, my awfully odd taste and my annoying personality no one wants.

I quit my weed addiction, and im going to leave my country for 8-9 months and work abroad on a cruise, its gonna be hard, but i ll eat much better, my physique will improve by alot since i will work 8 to 12 hours everyday, i will reset my whole dopaminergic system by working and travelling, when i come back i wanna start my own businesses, i have so many ideas and i don't need money for them, if they work i will reinvest maybe everything i will have saved this year.

fuck working for someone else for the rest of my life, i know i can do this, i believe in my creativness and adaptation skills, i wanna retire my mom and give her all she ever needed

Im gonna get away from this toxic place that i've created for myself

Im gonna forget of everyone and everything that happened to me and everything i've done

I hope im gonna find me again

Im thankful for everyone and everything",1679161550.0

There is this very nice coworker from a different department that I sensed a kind of connection with, but I never approached her in that sense.

Until I said fuck it and declared to my friend (who works in her department) that im gonna grow some balls and ask her out. He floored me the next second saying she is going back to her country for good by the end of the month.

Just my luck. Couple of my friends were like ""so what, just fuck her and let her leave"". Yeah, maybe if I weren't a virgin guys and i dont want to have my first time with a girl I'll never see again in a few weeks. They don't know that of course..

I thought about not asking her out at all after that, but you know what? Im sick of being depressed, because i never do anything fun, because im depressed... its a vicious cycle.

I realise now that not everything we do needs to have a goal, or a meaning. Im not going out with her tommorow because i want to make her stay, or get in her pants. Im going out with her because I felt like it at the moment and i dont want to spend any time fantasizing about what could have been.

Lost along a road of living, 

Always searching, but never finding,

To be seen by people, hazy but loving,

Roses and smiles with thorns protruding the heart,

A thought I hold within me, nestled to my chest,

While the endless raindrops soak my soul,

161,Feeling numb,3,11uovdd,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11uovdd/feeling_numb/,0,"I have posted this on the advice community too, I hope this is ok. Please delete if not 🖤

I’m not sure what I hope to gain from writing here, advice, direction maybe, a sense of belonging - I’m not sure, but I hope that writing it all down helps. Thanks in advance for reading.

My life feels utterly devoid of meaning. I say that not in a bleak, “I want to end things” way, but in the sense that I’m just so completely numb and feel like I’m just existing, going through the motions, putting one foot in front of the other and totally lost in life.

Some backstory about me: I’m 31, female and gay. I met the person I thought I would be with forever when I was 21, and we were in a relationship for 6 years. We owned a property, she proposed to me, and I lived near her family and friends - eventually drifting apart from the people I knew. She left me for someone else, which devastated me. I had to start all over again. 

About three months later I met someone else and we eventually moved in together. Our relationship lasted three years, was challenging due to the Covid lockdowns, and was very toxic. There was a lot of emotional abuse and manipulation. We broke up last year, and I’ve had to start all over again for the second time. I now live alone in a tiny apartment with my cat, I know no one in the area and I’m 200 miles away from my family.

I have since started a relationship with someone I met online four years ago. This time I am very protective of myself, I won’t be moving in with her any time soon and we are taking it slowly, seeing each other only once a week but texting and calling on and off all day, every day. One of the challenges is that she is on the spectrum (no hate towards people with ASD, I am also neurodivergent, but there are many communication difficulties that it brings, which have been very hard for us both).

Despite my current relationship having good parts, 50% of the time we experience big personality clashes, arguments, bickering, and are completely polar opposite in terms of our interests and outlook on life. 

Some other challenges: over the years I have developed OCD (I have been through therapy and take SSRIs for it, it has now settled to a somewhat manageable state), and I was diagnosed with ADHD two years ago (again, I am on medication and have been seeing a psychiatrist every few months, recently discharged from their care but continuing with medication). I have racked up a lot of debt that I am slowly tackling with the support of my father, who is helping me learn to budget and be more responsible, but it does mean that despite earning a good income, I live a very frugal life with not much to show for the time and effort I put into my job, nor the salary I take home. 

I have a good career and I work hard. My job is my outlet. But when 5.30pm rolls around, I have nothing. Nothing but phone calls from my girlfriend and hours spent playing video games online with her. Recently I’ve found those things aren’t fulfilling me, I’m not as engaged, I don’t always look forward to seeing her or speaking to her like I should - which makes me feel guilty - and deep down I have the feeling that there is no future in our relationship. I find that so hard because I am desperate for a family one day, but my biological clock is ticking, and if I step away from it now I only have to start all over again - which I just cannot keep doing. Every time, it’s like I lose part of myself. My passion and zest for life has dwindled so much over the years and I just feel empty. All the time. 

On the outside, everything seems fine. I have a good job, I’m quite attractive, I look healthy and I take care of myself. I have friends at work and I smile and laugh, I go to the pub with them sometimes and have fun. But I have no outside friendships - apart from one, however she lives 90 minutes away, and hanging out is difficult. I don’t know anyone in my area and spend my work-from-home and off days completely alone. 

The only joy in my life is having an alcoholic drink or smoking weed - both of which I do responsibly and moderately, regardless of your beliefs on the matter (I’m talking a quick vape with a cup of tea in an evening, alone, with my cat. I’m very low key and I would never want to jeopardise my work or independence - I would stop immediately if I were to have a family, that is my biggest goal in life). My girlfriend is a recovering cocaine addict though, so my lifestyle is a great source of conflict between us. Despite me never, ever doing anything around her, she has a huge problem with it, and I often feel guilty. 

When we argue recently, I have no emotion. For an easy life, I tend to just agree with her and promise to alter my behaviour, which I have, greatly. For example - I stopped smoking weed for three months to demonstrate I do not have an addiction and that it really isn’t the be all and end all. However I find it fun, that it genuinely helps me with my mental health and well-being, and have imbibed recently. I tell her every time as honesty is imperative to a healthy relationship, but as I said, I’d never do it around her nor put her in a triggering situation. 

I just don’t know what I need to do to feel alive again. I fear that if I carry on as I am I will end up feeling continually more numb, and if I break up with my partner - who, on paper, is wonderful, caring, loyal, kind and attentive - I will be alone forever. I have no idea how to make friends as an adult, especially as I’m quite nomadic, moving around a lot for work etc.

I’ve been through so much therapy for my OCD, I take meds, I read self-development books and practice mindfulness, I try to do crafts and writing, I open up to my limited friends and family - but nothing is helping.

The above sentence may be simple to understand but when it is used to apply, you may find it difficult. We have no control on the things that continue for example you are born as a boy or girl, sometimes we don't have choices to make but rather one's to accept and move forward. Waiting for something you want in the future is not useful because it will become wishful thinking. We mostly want to satisfy ourselves by doing things that we love but rather we should try to do things that help us improve towards success. Some are born in rich families,some are born in poor families, they don't have control over that, but they do have control over what to do for improvement. Whatever position in life we may be, we should always try to make the best of it. Being jealous of someone else, comparing life with others, expecting all the achievements, these thoughts lead us to be not contempt with life. Some people are having the time of their life and some are struggling, some are trying to get their daily bread while some are trying to heal themselves from injuries. Every person has a choice to make the simple steps towards improvement. As I said, some things are not in control, we have to accept that and move forward by improving us by doing kindness. Yes, we may be unlucky with the lives we have but all we have is now, the unlucky part of life where we struggle but we should accept it and should find the small gaps of happiness that we create. Honestly, from the time we are born we start to compete, crave to achievements, attention, acknowledgement but if you don't get that we push back and feel deprived of happiness. Looking at some perspectives might help, you might have a struggling life but comparing to someone else, you might have a better life and can do so much more to improve that and many things. We end up in difficult situations but how we move forward rather than looking back, being jealous or feeling that you are not receiving good parts of life, will always push us down. Some people don't jave fair life, sometimes life is cruel, sometimes people who don'y deserve great things achieve it and sometimes those who deserve it don't get it. As I said, we are not living a satisfying life but satisfying can be different from personal perspectives. A school boy might be hoping for some good luck in exam, but some other person who is not a school student might be looking for food. Making the best out of what we have is life. Life is unfair, you will be demoralized but accepting it and trying improve is life. Life is unfair, someone who deserves the best things might not get it, but should not quit on improving the quality of things we do for satisfaction. Make the best out of your situation is a must because you have no other option, either do something that makes your life a little bit better, don't refrain the situation you are in but rather create something that makes you happy. Whatever is the problem, you are in it and you cannot escape so try to work around it rather than running away from it. The more you are capable to work around problems and make better things out of the problems you have, the more efficient your life will be. Life is about the situation you have and how you will make the best out of it. Don't expect happiness, you have to create it.",1679167049.0

this week i had a horrible panic attack – i couldn’t sleep for the whole night and just stayed awake and was shaking constantly. but this was due to acute stressors (i’m moving countries, leaving my partner of 4 years, don’t have a job now, but also something bad happened that day). i also became very paranoid this week and i feel like my heart rate is too fast now too, even though i’m not anxious. 

i feel like i need AD medication but i also doubt it because: 1) i’ve got a bit bitter since winter, now i get out of bed easier and generally feel more normal; 2) i called my GP for the first time in years (i did mean to do it for months but didn’t) because of the panic attack yesterday and they prescribed sleeping pills and beta blockers and said maybe i could have antidepressants but didn’t prescribe it to see how i do with beta blockers/suggested it may be better to do it if i’m in my home county in 2-3 months. maybe beta blockers will be enough? 3) i have a counsellor who doesn’t suggest i’m depressed (they seem avoidant of that word).

how do i know now is the time? should i do it even though i’m feeling better than before (anxiety aside)?",1679163726.0

Tried to rob a bank and locked up with 20 years. Which I was told 10 but they lied to me. He wouldn't be getting out until I was 25 years old. I would have waited. And I was. I took it to have consideration that maybe he did that because he didn't have anyone and the last person he had died so I was trying to understand.. all he had was me and my mom.. my mom obviously didn't want to be with him but I talked and helped him as much as I could.. Talking to him when he was in prison he was the only person who has talked to me the nicest and give me advice more than anybody in my family and talked about God to me. At one point I told him I was modeling so hot topic... He got curious and I guess he called my mom and asked her.. she just straight up told him what it actually was.. porn modeling. I was not expecting her to do that... Before all that happened I sent him a picture of me modeling for ink magazine. Sooner or later he called me back asking about it.. and asking me about it.. I'm getting too curious. So like what do you use. I thought it would be fine cuz I was like it's not like we're blood so you can talk like this it's fine.. and then I guess.. I did say at one point I did see your dick when I was younger on your phone. I was just talking. It just got very awkward.. he eventually told me that he finished five times to my picture. And I was just modeling in clothes. Blah blah blah eventually she started telling me to send more pictures and send more pictures and I was doing it to make him happy.

The crisis lady and my mom's we all made a deal and I said and I was going to say I don't want to talk to him like this anymore but if he continues to want to. We wouldn't talk anymore. So yea. We don't talk anymore. I don't know how to feel about a lot. I'm very confused. He was the only person I felt to connected to until they got sexual and been sexual ever since. What the fuck did I do.

I'm stuck at home with an abusive and manipulative parent. She has told me to my face that she doesn't care about my stress or my depression, and that my best isn't good enough. As soon as I get back on my feet I'm burning that bridge faster than a dry field in July.

Anyway, I'm actually making progress despite her. I had given up on applying to jobs because after about 100 applications and zero callbacks I asked myself ""what's the point? I'll probably just be here forever until I die, either by my body failing under depression or by my own hand."" I started applying again, though. I'm getting a little more traction so far. No callbacks just yet, but some emails saying ""you've made it to round 2"" or ""please complete the following assessment to be considered"" you know the type.

I'm working on getting healthier too. I realized that no matter what happens, if I don't lose a lot of weight I'll be doomed. I've got a lot on my plate right now. My mother yells at me or belittles me almost on a daily basis if I don't do things for her, when she does basically nothing herself lol. I mean, I get it, I'm living here so I should pull my weight, but it's hard to do that when all I want to do is just...sleep, because then I'm not in pain. I'm trying to do the bare minimum things like showering, doing laundry, and keeping my room clean. But the stress of it all is too much to handle, especially when I'm constantly being told how lazy and awful I am by my mother. It's hard to do even the basic things I need to do for ME, let alone for her. But she doesn't care. She told me straight-up, multiple times.

Truthfully, almost all of my problems right now would be solved with money. (This next part is political so if that's not your thing stop reading now.) I'm angry at the world for not having a UBI. If we did, I could have taken the time off work that I needed to recover from my depressive episode instead of basically being sucked into it for an entire year due to having to move back home. It's not my fault I'm depressed. At least I recognize that now; that kind of helps I guess.

I'm poor, I literally have no money. In fact I can barely afford to keep open a bank account due to the monthly fees lmfao. What a dystopia. Anyway, I'm just trying to hang on. I hope I can find a job soon. Until then I'm stuck here with my mother, just constantly feeling like shit and wanting to kill myself. I never felt better than when I moved out for the first time. It solved so many of my problems. I just want to be free. It's not fair that I have to suffer because I don't have money. It's hard to keep a positive outlook when you know that you're one bad day away from living on the streets. I guess I should count myself lucky that I have somewhere to live for right now.

202,I'm the happiest I've ever been when with my husband but the most depressed I've been in years ...,1,11up7af,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11up7af/im_the_happiest_ive_ever_been_when_with_my/,0,"I honestly don't understand it. A little background - My relationship with my husband is healthy, but I had a rough childhood with abusive significant others alomg with other things that I'm fairly certain f*cked me up beyond repair. I work in a lab and primarily work independently. We have quadrants of lab benches and the other benches in my quadrant belong to scientists who are in meetings often so I'm alone with my head the majority of the day. I've been in this job for a while now, and listen to music/podcasts all day to keep my mind at bay and up until last week-ish, it's been working great. 

But now I get to work and it's like my anxiety and depression kick into overdrive. As soon as I get home, though, I feel fine. But every day it has progressively gotten worse to the point of an anxiety attack yesterday (thankfully I had my emergency anxiety meds with me so no one at work seemed to notice). I don't know if it's my separation anxiety finding a new route of torment, or something else, but the overdrive is to the point of bringing up every traumatic event I've lived through, every mistake I've made, and situations I've realized I haven't made closure with.

I don't know what I'm even looking for with this post. People with similar situations? What others are doing to cope with daily depression? It hasn't been this bad in years, probably since middle or high school. But all those times something had triggered it. That's not the case here. I can't pinpoint anything. I feel content with life other than the sh*t economy. I can't adequately provide to the extent I had promised to (on what used to be considered median income even 4-5 years ago) while my husband finishes college. He has offered to get an all-season job among other things but I've made it clear that I want him to finish out these last two semesters enjoying his college life and coacing as much as possible. It's just me. I had this idea of buying a home for us to build on and to buy him a truck before his car runs into the ground and whatnot, but this economy has sunk to absolute sh*t to where I can't do that.

Okay I guess I can pinpoint the sh*tty economic situation we're in despite me having a stable income. I guess you just can't live in a one-income household comfortably anymore. I mean, I knew that, but to experience it right out of college isn't something I anticipated. But is financial instability really triggering my depression to this extent?? Or is my depression just that pissed that I'm finally healthy and the best version of myself?? I don't get it.

So I woke up and texted my dad if we're all ready to talk. They were delaying this like crazy. I had to sit in their room for like an hour. Which made me believe that they're procrastinating the fight that were about to have. 

That's exactly what happened. It started by me apologizing (I still don't believe I should be the one apologizing. But yknow)  my mom instantly started screaming at me again. Saying how I am a lunatic drug addict for fighting about my mail being open. I started screaming back. 

I started explaining to them the pain that I've been going through for years. And these meds actually helped me. They saved my life. They disagreed. Apparently they know how to read my mind for years or something.

I eventually just got sick of it. There's no hope. So I just started demanding my meds back. They refused. Saying that me getting this angry about the mail situation is abnormal. Literally trying to say that I'm the one in the wrong for getting upset after asking them to stop opening my mail for the 12th time. 

They refused to give me my meds. I kept demanding them back. Etc... I got sick of it and threatened to call the police. My mom screamed some more. I said something like ""these meds have saved me from suicide. And your choices are putting me back on that path of self destruction"". 

For some reason, after I said that, she took it as a threat. And something that I can go to jail over? Then she started saying that she is going to call the police now. 

I got my coat, walked outside, and waited for them. Despite my immense pain from withdraw, I stayed calm. I explained everything to the police. 

They somewhat agreed, somewhat didn't. I think they were just trying to keep an open mind. I kept showing them respect. Didn't freak out, etc.. Basically acting how I usually do when someone isn't literally threatening to take away the thing that saved my life. 

The cops told my parents to give my meds back. They left. I walked in my house. Parents wanted to talk. They said ""you're an adult. We can't stop you"". Surprising that they say this, yet they still disagree with the mail argument and the meds I am taking. 

Basically in that talk, they basically kept disagreeing about the mail thing. They still think that the meds are making me a lunatic for not wanting them to open my mail. I told them multiple times to look from my perspective. If you ask someone to stop doing something, and they continue to do it for a year. Obviously they're going to get annoyed and fight about it more. 

But no. Apparently I'm a crazy junkie for this. But luckily I got my medication back. I eventually just left the discussion and went to my room. Tomorrow I am going to get a safe for my meds. I am also getting a PO box.",1679114661.0

I've been struggling with depression for a long time, but recently I feel it's taking all I have to just to survive. Midway through last year, I accepted that I'd have to leave a job I loved in an area I enjoyed living in because I couldn't find anything to feasibly rent. I had to move back to the Midwest, back in with my mother. While I'm grateful, I've been struggling with a lot of shame being here. I've been on my own since 18, so moving back in at 27 was never the plan. My girlfriend stayed with her parents halfway across the country due to medical issues preventing her from leaving the state. The only solace I had was in my dog, a 6 year old blue heeler who I adored. He was absolutely my best friend, the closest companion I've ever had. After about a month of being in the Midwest, he started having trouble pooping. I took him to the vet, assuming there was an obstruction, only to find that his body was riddled with tumors. The vet said it was the worst case they had ever seen. I was advised to put him down immediately, but I couldn't. I kept him alive for two more weeks before he stopped being able to function, and I had to put my best friend to sleep. It's been 4 months, I haven't been the same since. I can't do anything. My girlfriend and I split up tonight, after a rocky three year relationship. It's always been a struggle, but since losing my dog, I haven't had the energy to try to sustain it anymore. She was my best friend though, and really the only person I feel like I can relate to. We had similar interests and morals, but we fought frequently. I never wanted to lose her, but there was really no way to continue the relationship at this point. It ended in flames, so there's no way to salvage a friendship. All my friends are different people than they were when I left, I'm a different person. I'm not good at maintaining friendships, and since my dog died I've hardly spoken to anyone. I start my new job Monday, I've run my savings dry while wallowing. Its a labor intensive job, but the only thing I could really get in the small town I grew up in. I'm already dreading it. I'm telling myself that it's just to save up to do something else, but I don't even have a goal at this point. I feel like everything I've been striving for is just completely out of reach. I wanted to be a tattoo artist, I'm decent at art. But before I moved back to the Midwest, I lost my ipad that had my entire art portfolio on it, and since I've been back I just haven't done any art. Thinking about trying to find an apprenticeship just seems pointless. There aren't any good parlors around, and I don't think I'd be able to balance an apprenticeship while also having a job. I don't feel like I can do anything. I wanted to travel. I wanted to live outside of the midwest, outside of the US. I wanted to live near mountains. I got a degree in geology just so I could work in a mountain related field, but I was never able to find a job with it. It's too expensive everywhere to just start over somewhere else. I just feel like there's no where to go. I feel trapped. I feel sick. I just have no drive, no motivation. I don't want to kill myself, but I want to die. I just don't want to be here anymore. I'm so tired. I'm not taking care of myself. My body hurts. I'm always sad, anxious, stressed, and so, so tired.

I didn't mean for the lengthy post. I feel like I didn't even express myself properly. My entire body feels like every nerve has been on fire for months. I miss my dog. I can't express how much I miss my dog. He was my reason for being alive. Every day that goes by, I feel like I'm leaving him further and further behind. There's no future where I'll get to see him again, and that reality is constantly on my mind. Getting a different dog would never be the same, but it would also be financially irresponsible with how difficult it is to find housing that allows pets. I just want to reach out for to my now ex, to do anything to make it work, but the relationship has drained me so much that I know thats not the right decision. I miss my dog. I already miss my best friend. I miss living next to the ocean, and I miss my old job. I miss having a drive. The area I'm in now is incredibly religious, to the point of bigotry, and I feel so out of place. I just don't know what to do. I feel so isolated. I don't know what to do, I don't want to do anything. I just need to know that it will get better, but I can't see how it could. I'm trying to tell myself to just work, save some money, and go from there. But without an achievable goal in mind, it feels pointless. I've always sustained myself with grand dreams of the future, but I don't even have those anymore. I'm just hollow. 

Thank you for reading through this. I know it was long, I know it was all over the place, but I feel like I barely scratched the surface. I don't know where else to turn.",1679132209.0

I should be grateful and I hate that sometimes I feel like the opposite. But The thing is I don’t miss home as much as I thought I would. The problem that I have is I don’t really know how to open up to people. I never tell anyone my problems or what’s bothering me. I’m struggling to handle my emotions so I just quietly cry myself to sleep at least once every 5 days. I have a boyfriend who I’m comfortable talking to about everything but because I’ve been busy with school and he has a new job I feel like I’m just inconveniencing him. My sister said I could talk to her about these things but I really can’t. We have a family history of mental illness (idk if thats a real thing but I believe it) I grew up coping with things on my own. Unlike my first born strong independet sister I’m the middle child and for me, privately dealing with my own business and enduring by myself was enough. I hold most of it in so I end up having emotional breakdowns when it gets too much. I didn’t get that much freedom before, I grew up quite guarded and I felt like I missed a lot of things in my childhood and early teens.

Everyone has moved out of this town that I'm back in, except for one, but he has his own house and an illustrious past.  And here I am...same room I grew up in, no career, no illustrious past, many failures, emotionally immature, agoraphobic, uninteresting, afraid, bored, alone, not much to show for anything, aimless, bitter, tired, no hobbies, forgot what joy feels like, passions are dead or dying, disconnected from life...just, wow.

226,Why fetishizing my sadness is therapeutic for me.,4,11ucibo,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11ucibo/why_fetishizing_my_sadness_is_therapeutic_for_me/,1,"Look, last thing I intend to do is offend anyone here so forgive me. I know how bad depression hurts. It sucks, it’s unfair, but so is life. But for the longest time, I’ve felt so much shame and embarrassment about my depression that I’m terrified to express myself to others. I don’t want people to know that I do experience depression regularly. I fear being judged and ridiculed for it. 
Maybe it’s a generational thing, but when I was a kid, depression or sadness was not considered “cool” or glamorized in any way. You were told you were broken and should feel bad about yourself. That what society said anyway. But here’s what I have to say about that: society can go fuck itself. It’s okay to be sad. It’s only human. It doesn’t make you less of a person. When you consider all the pain and suffering in the world, I think you’d have to be crazy not to be depressed. Sometimes I’m convinced that hell is real, and we’re living in it. Sure, there’s some silver linings, and when I’m feeling happy, I’ll enjoy the moment. But I’ve come to accept that my depression may never go away for good. And that’s okay. What’s more important is learning how to manage my depression. It doesn’t make me a broken person that needs to be fixed. It doesn’t mean I should feel bad about myself for experiencing a very human emotion. Maybe I am too emotional and sensitive. But I’m human. Why the hell should I not be emotional? We’re not robots. It’s okay to feel depressed. Anybody that judges you for that can royally fuck themselves. Honestly, anyone who never gets depressed is either lying, stupid, crazy, or all of the above. Depression shouldn’t be stigmatized like it is. You shouldn’t have to feel ashamed or embarrassed about it. If you’re feeling depressed, you shouldn’t have to be afraid to say it. Depression makes us human. It’s a part of human life, a part of the human condition. There’s no reason to be ashamed of it.

I was away from home, which made it worse as I am an international student; I went fully self-loathing for so long that it caused me depression. I'm slowly getting back on my feet with therapy and meds, and so far, I have improved.  I workout, but I lost so much muscle and weight during that time that I felt weak. I'm exercising again, but I still have a long way to go. I decided to tell my friends that I was going through a tough time, and maybe they would understand that I was struggling with life. To be honest, they are great friends, except something happened today.

We decided to try rock climbing, and I was excited to try it out. After all, exercise helps against depression. I was easily the worst when we began climbing and trying to challenge ourselves. I was fatigued and could barely climb, and I kept losing my grip. I was trembling, and the man I felt exhausted mentally and physically. Now I used to do five pull-ups, and now I can barely do one. They kept teasing me, and I wasn't upset, you know, it's just jokes between friends, but it got to a point where they continued laughing on and on. They said that I was weak and were like, ""yeah, we all had fun except you know who."" one of them was like, you got issues and should check the doctor because you might have diabetes as I was shaking while barely holding on.

Only one of them was supportive and kept cheering me on that I could do it. They all could do it except me. They said that I came here and wasted my money because I could not climb.

 the truth is I'm so lonely and sad inside that even if it's someone who has hurt me a dozen times, I'd still care about them n talk to them or do whatever with them. because they're like the only people around me.

238,Acne,5,11u9397,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11u9397/acne/,0,"i'll be turning twenty six next week. it occurred to me this morning that I've had fairly severe acne for a decade now. i've been depressed about a relatively mild skin condition for close to half of my life. it's stupid, and i feel stupid saying it, but it's true.

the acne manifests as swollen red cysts on my face that i can never quite keep myself from messing with. when you flare up, before you can get upset about the social ramifications, there's the immediate and intense discomfort of having clusters of malignant fluid sitting under your skin. i don't know whether i have a worse psychological reaction to this than most people, but it has never gotten easier. i remember being particularly freaked out by the scarabs in Brendan Frasier's The Mummy as a kid, and have come to learn that cystic acne sort of feels like that. like some invasive species has carved itself into you to lie dormant in your face.

i have a cyst on the underside of my jaw as I type this. it's the worst place to get them because the deformation is most noticeable. it completely changes the silhouette of your face. it juts out more when I smile, so I haven't smiled much this week.

i look like this about half the time, if I'm lucky. i can handle not feeling attractive, but i feel disgusting. people are perfectly polite and sympathetic, but they are disgusted by it. why wouldn't they be? i've cancelled or delayed half the dates i was ever supposed to go on purely because my face looked bad on a particular day. i avoid my friends when it gets like this, it's impossible to forget yourself when you know your face is being observed. well-lit rooms become excruciating. i see my partner for a few days every fortnight because we live in different cities and, though she has never said anything to imply this, i'm sure she finds it disappointing when i show up with worse skin than usual. i feel like i'm somehow responsible for it, like i'm doing it *to* her.

i've used retinoid creams, i've had chemical skin peels, i've had a doctor electrocute the comedones in my face after numbing it poorly, i've done rounds of lymecycline and accutane. accutane was the only thing that worked, but it only kept the acne at bay for a year or so. the hoops you have to jump through to get it are maddening and expensive. i was lucky not to suffer many of its possible side effects, but the ones i did get were still life-altering and uncomfortable.

i realize that this all sounds melodramatic, but it's been 10 years of this now. most people don't conceive of it as a particularly disruptive condition, so there aren't really any avenues to call it anything more than 'annoying'. bad haircuts are annoying, this consistently sucks the joy out of my life.

251,Currently dating with someone who has severe depression and PTSD,1,11uhc0m,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11uhc0m/currently_dating_with_someone_who_has_severe/,0,"Hi guys! I’m totally new here and I just wanted to be heard and lowkey, maybe ask for help. I don’t really know at this point. I just want to apologize in advance if this post will be long or it will be difficult for some of you to read. Maybe i just wanted for someone to listen to to me. Maybe someone out there who’s in the same position as me.

I’m (27F) in love with this person (28FTM) for almost 3 years now and we have our fair share of down moments in our relationship. He’s been struggling with depression and used to go to therapy and had recently discovered that he also has PTSD. Even before we were official, he was very honest about his situation and despite all of that, I stayed and promised to love him no matter what. I knew all of his struggles, his demons, his awful past and how he would triumph over these and would sometimes spiral back down. I never left his side even at first, I don’t know how to help and  it seems that everything I do to help him makes it even worse. And it pains me so much. So I try to learn — I listen to him and he helps me understand his situation. But there are just instances that our fights would get really bad. Simple arguments that would escalate to him hurting himself and blaming everything on him. Saying hurtful stuff that I should just leave him and I’m too good for him — that he doesn’t deserve me. These are the times that are most difficult to me. He would himself away from me to a point that I can’t bring him back up. 

I’m so scared that I don’t even know what to respond because even if I do try to calm him down, he would find a way to twist my words and say things like “I’m sorry if I’m being such a burden for you” “F*ck me i should k*** myself” “Please hate me” back at me. He wanted me to lash out at him too but I don’t want to. I know that he didn’t mean saying those things and I shouldn’t take it personally. But during these breakdowns, I would find myself breaking down alongside with him, but I don’t usually show it. I would always have to be the strong one which is not the case all of the time. I don’t want to admit it to anyone but I’m also slowly losing myself. I’m trying my best not to blame myself for not being good enough or not knowing how to help. It got worse to a point that i’m considering going to therapy too. But that’s a different topic altogether. 

For now, I’m giving more time to calm down. I try my best not to give in to his hateful words. I would usually drop everything and go to him immediately but now, I have to also think of my well-being too. 

Thank you to anyone who listened to me. I really appreciate your time.",1679123979.0
252,"Is it too much of a burden to tell close friends that you have semi-suicidal thoughts? Or more generally, how much is too much to burden your friends?",1,11uhbbx,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11uhbbx/is_it_too_much_of_a_burden_to_tell_close_friends/,1,"Some real quick context here. I've had some pretty severe anxiety and depression for a while, but very luckily I have a close knit friend group that is very supportive and offers to listen to me rant/vent and tries to help. They've told me numerous times that if I ever feel deep in the trenches that I should reach out to them and talk.

Unfortunately due to various circumstances my mental state has really deteriorated and I've been plagued with thoughts of ""wanting to die"". It's never been to a point of ""wanting to commit suicide"" but rather at the level of ""I wish someone would hit me with a car"".

I recognize that these are pretty severe thoughts and I'm also slightly worried they may further expand in scope. That being said I've never vocalize these thoughts to anyone, but now I feel like I need to tell someone to feel less isolated inside of my thoughts.

That being said I'm worried about telling my friends, not that they won't worry or won't try and help, but because I don't want to burden them with something that, realistically, they cannot help fix. I don't want to become some sort of mental burden for these people that I care about.

Realistically I should contact therapists and psychiatrists but due to my location, and timezone, getting in contact with them is unreliable, and the ones I can get in contact with may be not ideal either.

So is this something I should talk to my friend group about? Or should I instead just hold out for a bit longer and try and find a good mental health support later/when I can?",1679123900.0

255,Deep in my mind,1,11uh95v,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11uh95v/deep_in_my_mind/,0,"Lately I've had a series of emotions, this sadness that overwhelms me. I can't seem to get rid of this huge void inside me. No matter how much I try I am never enough, each and everyday is a struggle. I try to stay positive but how can I when at the same time at the end of the day the people who bring me down are my own family. It's truly a struggle being the oldest everyone depends on me and it’s so draining. I wish I could just run away but that would be selfish of me. I can’t do that. Why is it that I have to be the one there for everyone and nobody is there when I need them. I can't speak up when it comes to me because my feelings aren’t valid. It's not one bit fair. I get blamed for everything and my siblings make mistakes. It's not my fault that they do certain things. They each are their own individuals and I can't change that okay. But the one person that makes everything worthwhile . He makes me feel at peace when I am with him, I love him so dearly he’s my everything he is kind, loving and caring. But it's just so hard to be me, it's not fair. I feel like I'm grabbing onto a huge rope and it's slowly slipping away and I don't know how much longer I can hold onto it. I am fully at peace when I am asleep. It's the only time I can get some peace of mind. My dad hates me and I hope I can be around for awhile I don’t think I could ever actually kill myself I am to much of a pussy to do that. All I can do is lay in my bed and listen to music. I try to understand them but they are much too complicated and it seems that each time I speak for myself all I get is put down, I can’t speak up my mind. I get threatened the moment Iopen my mouth. Today while at school at a soccer meeting my phone blew up from calls of my father and when I answered it I got lectured as to why I am not at my brother's meeting. I have other things,I have a life. I set up everything I went to his school a while back and got all the papers to send to the Academy that my parents want to enroll my bby brother. I wrote essays for him and fixed the grammatical errors. Put him first to make him look good. They missed the meeting. I get blamed for not being there but that's their job. Don't get me wrong I love my brother but I am not his mom I am his sister. This is one example of many, I’ve given so much and none of what I do seems to be appreciated. I help them so much and they don't appreciate anything. It's so draining. I gave up my childhood for them and they don't realize that. I seem heartless but I am not. I am an ocean, a sea with a storm. I feel like I’ll never be enough no matter how hard I try. I am not okay and I wished I could have someone save me from this. Some to open up to and be vulnerable but what if they use that against me. I can’t let my gard down. I can't have people in my business. It's better if everything stays hidden behind my bedroom walls. If I keep my mouth shut, cry behind the closed door. I have to stay strong and work hard because if I don’t all this pain won’t be worth it. I need to make my pain and all my struggles worth it. I need to make my younger self proud . I can't let her down everything she went through. Man I am so fucked, theres so much about me that people don’t know. Words kill. I wonder if I am the only girl whose mother calls a whore. A whore? Oh mom if only you knew… How deep those words you say kill me. I try to not let your mean commits get to me. Because I know I am not a whore. I try to not let those mean commits you and dad say to me. You ask me why I am always in such a bad mood. It's not that I am in a bad mood, it’s just that I keep my resting bitch face so that you guys will leave me alone. I don’t think I am well each and every time I get upset, mad, angry, sad my nose starts bleeding non stop, my head begins to hurt and the fact that I haven’t gotten my period in over two months. No I am not pregnant I am just so overwhelmed my hairs have been falling out. I’ve been overeating. I just can’t help it…. Eating in a way feels so comforting. I stuff myself and cry looking in the mirror, looking at my reflection and feeling sick to my stomach. I tend to throw up often, whether I mean to or not it just happens on its own. There's days when I can go days without eating and be perfectly fine… I won't lie, sometimes I just don’t feel like eating so I dont I just drink water, chew gum or drink coffee and that's my meal. I really hope nobody else knows this feeling. I have all these things that are wrong with me and I just keep quiet. Why should I open up? It’s not like someone can help me. I don’t need anyone pitting me. I just gotta act like I am unbothered, focus on completing my assignments, graduate and leave this place my parents call my home… I’ve been smoking and honestly it makes me feel good, I know it’s not good for me but it helps me sleep. I need to get another pod. I just ran out and don’t have any more. I hope I feel better with time and that I will be in a better place soon well mentally yk",1679123680.0

Couldn’t sleep the other night and kept thinking of ways I could end my life. Everything just seems so meaningless, we all suffer so much and some days I just wish it all would end.

I’ve been going to therapy which has been helping temporarily, I think in the next session I need to be honest with him about how bad this is really getting. I thought about maybe trying anti-depressants to see if those would help. unfortunately I’m also bipolar which if I’m not mistaken can complicate the situation with taking medication. I was going to the gym and working out almost every day a few months ago, that seemed to help my mental health a lot and I know I need to get back into it.

The reason I haven’t gone through with this is I know it will be devastating to my family and the few friends I still have. When I really think about it rationally, I know it’s not worth it. This is hard to talk about but this community seems understanding, even to that level of depression.

It was all going smooth and fine for a week but the past 2 days have been hell. I’m feeling depressed, I’ve been crying, this overflowing feeling of sadness/anger in my chest and also felt suicidal (just for a few minutes) I know it’s all part of the progress but damn.. it’s hard.

I feel so incredibly sad and hopeless.",23,11tq9sh,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11tq9sh/im_so_incredibly_tired_i_dont_want_to_do_anything/,3,"Hi, I (17F) am not doing the best right now. I'm a senior at high school, and right now I am incredibly burnt out.  It's not just senioritis, and I know this. I've been struggling with depression or depressive thoughts for a long time, and for the most part, I just powered my way through it. For context, my parents are very traditionalist and think therapy is scandalous. 

Right now, I feel like I'm at a tipping point. I really want to leave state but can only leave under my parents' conditions. Which is, I can leave if I am admitted to an ivy league or Stanford. It's so stressful because I'm also fighting a really complicated immigration status which leaves me as international for most college apps, making it so much more competitive for me esp since I'm asking for financial aid. I'm so scared and I don't want to stay in state anymore. I feel so depressed because they have crippling expectations on me, and believe me, I worked my butt off. 

Over the years, I did so much and always aimed to be the best for them. And now, after all these years, I can feel it coming crashing down. Right now I just feel so sad and unmotivated. My parents are overwhelmingly overprotective and won't really let me do anything unless they're hovering over me. They care a lot about reputation and always want me to speak or show off. For instance, we had a shouting match because I decided to NOT speak at the school open house (I didn't want to stay at school 'till 8 pm). They said that the school didn't pick me because I'm not smart enough, 

Why? Well this freshman's parent spreads misinformation saying girls with 5.0 GPAS are picked to speak, even though getting a 5.0 overall is impossible at my school unless you took ALL AP/IB since 9th grade. I have a 5.0 for semester, but they don't believe that. Apparently someone from my school got admitted to MIT as well, according to the parent. Even though everyone would've known by now. This is causing me a lot of stress. My parents don't think I'm smart enough, and I know my dad ""joked"" multiple times that I'm not smart enough to get into any of the ivies. They won't even let me go to this program in Alaska even though they are covering all the fees (including travel) because it's too far, I'm a girl, and they're scared for some dumb reason (that I'm a girl and I'm oh-so fragile). 

They always say that I'll feel the same when I become a parent. This is absolutely not true. I know I'll do the exact opposite. The amount of pressure they put on me turned into crippling depression and other hosts of mental health issues. A medical professional I managed to talk to said that I display neurotic behaviors and even my school administration is worried for me. I'm the resident ""crazy girl"" who's obsessed with colleges and doing the best and over-achieving who only drinks redbull and nearly faints. I'm so tired. I just feel worthless and dumb and I KNOW the ivies won't take me anyway. I  just don't know what to do besides rest. And I mean rest for a long long long long time.",1679057607.0

So, this is my third week being a barista at a boba shop, minimum wage with no tips. 

Yes, I understand getting paid low isn’t a reason to do bad. 

But at first, no proper training was provided. They just threw me out there and expect I will just look at the recipes or ask other colleagues when have questions.
But this method doesn’t work when it gets really busy. I felt that I am annoying everyone when I constantly ask question when they are busy. 
I really tried to learn. But I just couldn’t be familiar with all the drinks like my coworkers. 

My boss is pretty rude and has poor communication skill. Instructions are so unclear. 70% of the time I cannot understand what he is saying. One time, I put wrong thing in the drink, and I asked what should I do. He mumbles I thought he said just toss that. Then he said, “thats money! I said just keep it like that why you threw that” and makes me feel so dumb at that moment. 

He is so unsatisfied with my performances. Constantly pointing out how bad I did. When I was washing utensils, he is like taping on my shoulders “oh can you just do faster”. 

When I am just sorta taking a break and chit chat with my coworkers, he’s like taping my shoulder again “hey did you clean up that trash?”. 

Honestly I hate people touching me. Being my boss doesn’t grant him rights to touch me without consent, right? But at that moment, I really don’t have the energy to fight back for myself.

Every time I seem to make a little bit of progress with anything, whether it be improving my mental health or learning something I find interesting, my stupid pea-sized brain seems to do a hard reset and make me forget everything.

I also feel guilty because I'm sure that there are others who feel the way I do and have lives way worse than mine. I would love nothing more than to help these people but I can't because I lack wisdom.

My social life is pretty nonexistent. I had friends but gradually stopped talking to them. I don’t talk to any of my cousins either. I’m practically a recluse. I barely talk to my family these days. Not that I’m in a bad mood all day. But the lack of a direction, goal or motivation is making me worried. I have interests. I read, watch movies, learn languages, dream of making art, visualise a good future where I’m happy and productive. But future is built with efforts in the present. Here and now. And my lack of creativity and productivity brings me back to reality. ‘Another day wasted’.

I know I’m more privilidged than half the population on earth. Which makes me wonder if I’m actually depressed or just lazy. That it’s actually a lack of effort on my part and not real failure. Because, I look at people who are underprivileged and yet working their ass off and here I am just wasting my time with hobbies to give myself that little ‘dopamine’ and ‘serotonin’.

I feel weak. I feel useless. I feel guilty. Like a misstep in the journey of evolution. Like a king in a democratic nation. Like a panda. Like a sloth.

I’m even scared of killing myself. I can’t even gather courage to find a cliff and jump off of it. Not that I’m scared of dying. How do I get out of my parents’ house without making them suspicious?

Today I feel like one of them betrayed me, even if he didn't actually do anything (precisely because he didn't do anything) and I'm afraid there will be no one I can trust again. I'll probably d!e before december. I wanted him to be at my funeral, but even if he goes, I'll never feel like he cares about me again.
Today I saw him for the first time in two months. I've been feeling really bad all week, and the two weeks before, and I stopped texting him and the other person I trusted. I thought today he'd ask me if I was okay or comment on my disappearance, but he didn't talk to me. Not because he was avoiding me or ignoring me, he just talked to the other people who were there. I felt really unseen and like he had never cared about me as much as I thought he did, and that no one would care about me like I care about them.
So yeah. This is about him, and about dying without trusting anybody.

291,Penny for your thoughts,1,11udex1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11udex1/penny_for_your_thoughts/,0,"I used to have a lot of friends in my early 20s. Over the years, as is common, they have dissipated and off doing their own things. The thing is, the people from my past, friends I've had for a very long time, well, they can't stand me. This isn't without reason.

I'm turning 34 in June, and for years I battled drug and alcohol addiction. Until about the age of 25 it was all fun and games. I didn't realise how bad it was until I reached that age and knew how dependent I was. I have past traumas which I suppose made reality harder to cope with. But, to put it simply, over time I lost the love in my heart and became a vile, destructive, hateful alcoholic. Drug use was intermittent but drank most days a week. A lot, a sprinter, trying to reach loss of consciousness.

This continued and over the years people would have less and less interest in talking with me, being my friend. I just wasn't a very nice guy. I get it. 

Around the age of 30, a long time gf broke it off with me for my drinking. 6 or so years down the drain. Met some other bloke. Lied about it though, and I knew, exacerbating the hate and the angry feelings brewing inside. 

Moved back to my home city (gf and I lived in a country town together) and it wasn't until then that I realised how alone I was. Old friends, I'd felt abandoned. They weren't interested in me, and I talk this personally. When sober I could see that it was my behaviour when intoxicated however when intoxicated those angry feelings and feelings of abandonment caused me to destroy what remained of old connections. You can guess how this was done. Rude messages/phone calls etc. I had lost control. 

Now, 34 in the June as stated, and I'm sober. Looking back, I can see how sick I was. I never, ever felt happy. Not until I had a drink in my hand or was under the influence of something. Nothing but hate in my heart for everyone, Selfishly, feeling abandoned by the people I thought would always be there, despite realising just how bad I was.

Nowadays, sober, and i have a beautiful girl that loves me for who I am, and what I became when I changed my life, but I still have an extensive list of old friends that remember me for the person I was when I was unwell. I have tried time and time again to message and get my messages across that I am sorry, pleading my case, not expecting friendship but just acknowledgement that who I was, wasn't who I wanted to be. 

Well, despite heartfelt apologies, I haven't received a response and desperation has made me feel like I have become a big joke to all of them. In fact, some are connected, so I already know through a source they feel I'm that 'crazy guy'. 

I know that if the tables were reversed, if my mate abused me once while intoxicated, which he has before, I would give him 2 minutes to say his peace. Well, that's not the case here. And it isn't one. There are about 5 people from that time that simply won't respond or even check a message. 

It feels rough, but i know it's a lesson I have had to learn the hard way. At times I feel paranoid that they all conspire and joke behind my back about how I'm a lunatic, which I know im not. 

I just find it saddening to know how people you think will always be there respond to you when you have a mental breakdown. This is what you get for years of friendship. I acknowledge that I was awful to be around, but is this fair?

What do you think? Honestly, am I wrong for feeling that I deserved a bit more than total ignorance? It always hits more when you feel you don't even deserve acknowledgement on their behalf. Sigh. Anyway lol thanks to anyone willing to get through this novel.",1679110888.0

On Monday I decided to take a chance and start my own business. I’ve been out of work for a couple months (long story), and a job opportunity I thought I had fell through. 

So I told my closest friends about it, since they’re aware of my struggles with mental health and now my financial struggles.   

Out of like 8 people I consider friends, only 1 offered any words of encouragement. Most either ignored my texts (I’m in a few group chats), one “emphasized” my text, and my best friend since high school (we’re in our 40s now, so we go way back), said “cool”. 

This is kind of a big deal. I’ve never tried to do this before. I’m terrified, but since Monday night when I made up my mind, I’ve been excited! For the 1st time in years I’m excited for something. I’ve been studying all week. Looking at the market, watching YouTube videos trying to learn the ins and outs, and figuring out what equipment and materials I need. 

But today, the lack of encouragement from these people I’ve been friends with for years or decades in some cases, just wrecked my confidence. I’m second guessing everything. I keep breaking down crying wondering what a fucking idiot like me is thinking about…there’s no way I can create and run a successful business. Just who do I think I am?! I’m a fucking loser. Always have been, always will be.

Part of me feels like I definitely should for clarity, but another part of me feels awkward about it. It’s not something easy for me to speak up about so I’m always putting it off. However until I find the courage to go, I thought I’d make this post and ask for opinions. 

I have always struggled with issues regarding my mental health. I have a bad case of social anxiety. It gets so bad where I even feel weird about answering my front door for things like pizza deliveries. I do things like chewing the inside of my cheeks until they bleed or biting my fingernails. 
    Overtime I’ve noticed a lot of changes to myself physically and mentally. I have a hard time having the energy to do anything besides lay in bed most days. Daily tasks are nearly impossible and my own hygiene is neglected most of the time. Some days I won’t brush my hair or teeth. Showering feels like a mission. It makes me feel so disgusted with myself but everyday it’s still hard. My body is always heavy and lethargic. My mom says it’s just laziness and because I don’t do much so my body has no energy out of habit. It makes me feel overwhelmed because there’s things I want to do but it’s hard with how tired I am most of the time. I can’t keep a regular sleep schedule. Some days I can’t sleep more than 5 hours. Some days I sleep for 12 hrs straight. I’m always zoning out and when I do my thoughts is full of negative thoughts about my life and myself. In a sense I feel like my life has no meaning to it. I always believed I should have accomplished more in life. I’m always disappointed in the way I am and how I live. There’s hardly a good thing I can say about myself. In other words my self love is nonexistent. To the point where I can’t bring myself to post raw unfiltered photos of myself even to a private page of only friends and family. I overthink a lot and would tell myself things like “your parents probably aren’t proud of you the way you are now.” “You should be trying harder to accomplish more things” “You are a failure.” Etc. Some times I sit and cry for no reason at all. Im constantly thinking about what others see when they look at me. Are they disappointed? Proud? Disgusted? It runs through my head every day. Some days just feel impossible for me to get through.

I'm a big introvert, like top 10% of introversion. I don't hate people they just exhaust me. It makes maintaining relationships a chore rather than natural. I kind of take my friends for granted in a practical sense. I never reach out, they reach out to me. I'm fortunate for that but I have no urge to talk to people. I came to the realization that most of life is relationships with people and I'm forced to do it. I want to meet people in real life but there doesn't seem to be a place in the real world for people to be...people. Everyone is chronically online and of they're not they stay with their friends and not branch out. There's no place for loners to meet each other.

I don't like to work. If I work a job for too long I get depressed. I don't hate money or people who have it. I don't think people who work are suckers. I have little desire for material wealth, but if I had the choice between rich and poor I would choose rich every time. But money as a motivator? Meh. Right now I'm unemployed after I left a shitty job and I am much happier unemployed than working. My parents help me out a bit and I find ways to get money here and there. I only want money for necessity's sake. 

I have ADHD. I have trouble focusing on making and executing goals. Compounded with my low work ethic, I don't get anything done. I hop from goal to goal and complete nothing or forget. I'm a creative person but sticking to a skill to get good at feels impossible. When I do work on my creative work I criticize it to hell. I criticize the utility of it. I criticize everything.

I'm prone to depression. I'm not even sure I experience happiness as much as others. For example, I like to draw. I know I do. But when I draw it feels like there is one molecule of dopamine and that's it. I have no urge to do it, I have to choose to do it. It often feels painful to do it and I often wonder if it's even worth doing.
Am I missing something? Artists are drawn to their craft and even if they have problems too the work still gets done.

I don't use drugs or drink anymore and that has helped. I eat better and take care of myself. But I still am in a pit.

I often wonder if my brain is broken. I feel like I don't receive reward the same. I just live and suffer.

I do love to laugh and joke around and play video games (video games are getting boring). I do feel happiness and enjoyment sometimes but day to day hobbies and such is a chore. It feels like I have to do them just to stay sane and not because I enjoy it.

My parents and friends say. ""Don't worry, everything will work out and you'll figure it out."" Really? Will I? What if I don't? I haven't made many improvements and life is fast and short. I'm scared.

I want to feel alive.

I watched her cry and shake while I hugged her, assured her it was okay, and then left her alone to go play a game.

Later that night I read both of her suicide notes to my brother and me. She asked if I saw her notebook and I lied and told her it was already closed. I laid in bed and listened to her try to drink herself to death while her friends tried to calm her down. I listened to my brother come home and try to get her to stop. I pretended to be asleep while the ambulance came to pick her up. I refused to go in the ambulance with them.

This seems to be a common point of regret I have in my life. Constantly trying to avoid any sort of conflict. I'd rather sit by and say nothing than have to have a serious conversation with somebody.

TL;DR I’m an anxious mess 

21(M) I feel like I live in a constant state of anxiety and there is no place for me to feel relaxed and comfortable. I go to school out of state but very close to my family. My family recently moved across the country and I’m now very far from the friends I grew up with and my family. However in my time alone I realize that a lot of people I grew up with weren’t really my friends from a lot of actions they did to me that I didn’t realize at the time. Thinking about this makes me really nauseous because I held them in high regard. My life growing up was really difficult and home life was very abusive and lonely towards each member. During Covid however since my family was forced to be locked in together we all grew to slowly understand each other and we all patched up the relationships. However I feel as if I never got the appreciation in my life cause while my dad was home 2 days of the week( he just slept for those 2 days) and my brother off to college, most of my life was me and my mother and I had to take care of my moms depressive state where she would take a lot of her anger from work on me which caused me to be terrified of her most of my life. This constant state of anxiety couldn’t get shaken off and I would bring it to school which was probably why people use  to bully me at school, including my “friends”. Now that I’m in college, I had my first girlfriend and she ended up cheating on me and I have virtually no friends. I was able to make some friends this semester but I started to realize that I’m only invited and “liked” because I’m convenient and the punchline of everyone’s joke. I realized this and now I just huddle in my room only leaving to go to the gym and class. I went out to the bars sometimes and once I was punched several times in the head for accidentally bumping into someone’s shoulder when moving through the crowded bar(no joke) and another time I was kicked out for getting mad when a worker was throwing paper at me and saying racial slurs to me because I asked him not to place a wet paper towel at me. I don’t go out anymore because idk if I just do something so small I’ll get in trouble. My college friends just bully me, my hometown friends(the couple who are good) are far away and my family are an expensive flight away. When I do visit them, the house is very depressing and seeing my basically half dead grandparents struggle it’s hard to be home and smile. I’m scared to go in a relationship after my past one(not like any girl likes me because I’m an anxious mess). I hate how all these people who bully me get to have better lives than me and get to laugh with their friends and hook up with girls and everything but I’m the loser whose always the second option and the butt of everyone’s joke. I just feel so alone in my life And this feeling just keep getting worse. I was talking to my mom and I literally have had nothing good happen to me in years and that’s not even a joke. I have to work twice as hard as other people to get or do something simple, that doesn’t make me upset and I will continue to keep going but things don’t come to me as easy as other people. They are starting to see my depression is getting bad and offered me to come home after my internship but I declined because I am a year from finishing college and also in my head I don’t want to stay with them and be in the depressing house making my view on life a lot worse.",1679107581.0

Maybe it’s the jealousy that I have towards their outlook on life but they just annoy me. I’m not saying they all suck but most of them come off as seeming to never experience a lengthy amount of time battling debilitating depression or anxiety. 
Believe me I went deep into the motivational stuff. I even started preaching it but felt like I was just faking it. Fake it till you make it is bullshit because I’ve been faking it for 15 years and I’m soooo over it. I’m all for being optimistic but don’t make me sound like a sack of shit because I think a bit more realistic. Imo it comes off as you actually running away from how you really feel. Idk maybe I’m just being a pessimist but the king of pessimism my lord and savior Arthur Schopenhauer made me really view it as “you’re fine don’t worry everyone else is just faking it they just aren’t aware of it.” and I can thank him for that because I have my own motivational way of thinking that doesn’t involve aggressively bullying myself into thinking like that. 

Anyways just ranting because I stopped going on social media (other than Reddit) because I was sick of seeing people posting shit like that and it’s actually made me feel more motivated.

no one specific thing is toppling me with burden, but each piece has shifted into a pile that has become a mountain. I am standing at the base, looking up the height, circling the width for an opening to start chipping away. when I find a place that looks like I might be able to start, I notice that all it does is loosen debris that may begin an avalanche to inevitably crush me. I thought maybe I could find a way to climb atop and work down, but each path just slid me backwards again. I know the longer it takes to make progress.. the higher the mountain gets, more expectations drop into it, sturdier inadequacies build barriers around it. with the mounting impossibility that it is becoming I am just falling apart inside. the task is too large alone, but my voice had been muted centuries ago when I was  flatly denied access to love and support. my hands have frozen in isolation from a mixture of being abandoned and from cracking at the false hopes of ever being taken again in the smallest gesture of comfort.

all along it gets higher, wider, stronger, more impossible and all I can feel myself do is sigh, deflated. I may as well give up, because I will never do what is needed..

314,Don’t waste your time reading this. I just need to say this somewhere :),1,11ubrvq,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11ubrvq/dont_waste_your_time_reading_this_i_just_need_to/,1,"
I’ve been fighting depression ever since I was 3 years old. 2 decades of just.. carrying all of this. It really feels like I just have.. the weight of the whole world on my shoulders every day.
I didn’t have a great childhood. I was depressed once my mom left me, so I was adopted and raised by my grandparents. 
My mother was a little abuse towards me as a child, and she had me at the age of 16.
Because of my sudden becoming, I didn’t really have anyone to take care of me so I would have to go to daycares. 
I hated it. It was one of the first times my grandmother would write about my anxiety as a child. It’s something I ignored growing up because I didn’t get why I felt this way or what it was. 
Unfortunately.. in my experience with daycare I was exposed to sexual abuse at such a young age. Physical abuse, and sexual abuse was also present. As a child I didn’t talk much, so I guess that’s what made me an easy target. 
I feel like that’s what was just stuck with me for years. It really has messed me up. Only recently it came to my attention once I was diagnosed with ptsd recently. I always really never understood why people made me so anxious, or why I was always hyper vigilant. 
It’s something I started doing to not get hurt again. I never told my grandmother about the stuff that happened to me in daycare, because at a young age.. I knew it would absolutely break her heart. I didn’t want her to blame herself for it. It’s not her faults anyways.  
In addition, I didn’t have it any easier in school. I got bullied a lot. It didn’t feel like I fit in all the time. I didn’t talk much but I did have a tiny group of friends. 
It was also in highschool that I really had felt the start of the full force  of my depression. 
Unfortunately- during first semester of college, my ex girlfriend of a couple years cheated on me, and in addition sexually assaulted me. This is something I hid from alot of people. It really really drove me deeper into depression. That plus I was having a rough time my senior year of high school with depression and not knowing what I want to do in life. Or- well I thought I did. 
As a kid I really loved art. I always had a thing for art. My grandmother was someone that would always encourage me to do whatever the hell I felt like, and she would support me through it. I would do gymnastics and rock climbing back then, but this all suddenly stopped for me one day. I just - didn’t feel like anything anymore. I started to realize that I don’t understand what it felt like to be happy. Or enjoy my life. Art.. was one of the few things that was always there for me. Along with video games. I’m an only child so, being by myself was normal. I didn’t talk really. But it isn’t as if I don’t have social skills. I just always feel so exhausted being in peoples presence. It just stresses me out, and I always felt uncomfortable around people. I just have body aches after just being around peoples, it’s exhausting. So it didn’t feel unusual. 
My grandma was the one that started to notice, when I would just not eat. She would come talk to me and she would always make me some spaghetti. (Pasta is always a safe fav food of mine) my grandma just got me as a person. She was always kind to me and others. Everyone loved her, and I guess I looked up to her Ofc. She made me feel like a human being . Both her and my aunt. They were.. 2 sisters from different mothers basically. And they.. both died to cancer 3 and a half years ago. 
They would make me feel.. like I was seen. It felt like they were real people. They always gave me warm hugs, that.. I feel like I don’t remember the last  time I have been hugged. I’ve been lonely without them. My entire life .. hasn’t been the same since. That day I was looking at my aunt, dead in her coffin. 
I think.. when my grandma told me that she was diagnosed with cancer. I didn’t want to believe it. I mean.. I didn’t want to believe that she would be gone just like that. I watched both my grandma and my aunt just.. slowly wither away from cancer. Their smiles just.. slowly got weaker. They both got very skinny. 
Their hair fell out. I watched as my grandma tried to not freak out infront of me as she noticed some clumps of hair were coming out this one particular day. She knew. She knew how much it hurt me  to see her like this. She just smiled and said, “don’t worry I’ll be healthy again” I Knew she knew. I knew that she knew she wasn’t going to make it, and she didn’t want me to worry. But she knew that.. I’m just like her. When she was near the end of her life.. she would ask my grandfather if I ate each day. 
Till.. that one Saturday afternoon. I went to wake her up. And I noticed that she didn’t respond at all. I just.. stood there. It’s as if the world just went completely silent. The house felt bigger. One less person really does.. make a house feel bigger somehow. I don’t even remember the date she died. It was really traumatic for me I guess because.. I just barely remember  the funeral. It was just strange to me that all of her co workers would recognize me and tell me that she talked about me every day. I was just shocked because all I could think was .. me? I’m not anything special ..it was my grandma who was the special one. 
She was liked by everyone and they liked her cooking. But my grandma would always be there for me no matter what. She meant everything to me. I dropped out of college to help take care of her, and I couldn’t even focus on school once my aunt died the year before. 
Both my aunt and grandma were really supportive of me in school. They always praised me when I did good, and always told me to keep doing my best. They were at every single graduation, and important event. And they just.. both withered away from cancer. Ever since then I really and truly lost motivation for everything. I stopped taking care of myself even more when they both died. My eating habits haven’t really gotten any better. The week after my grandmas funeral I just had so many nights, where I would just get drunk to try and numb the pain. One day I felt even worse than before so I made myself stop drinking lol.
My grandfather got diagnosed with cancer a year after my grandma died. So.. I’m stuck taking care of him. Honestly.. it really does take a mental toll on me. My grandfather is a really difficult person to be around. He constantly talks about my grandmother, and it’s really difficult for me to deal with the stress of just always having to relive her death. Some nights I get nightmares of finding her dead, or other old memories of losing her in dreams. 
It just makes the pain feel heavier. I really do miss her. I always wished that I could have got cancer rather than either of them. They didn’t need to die. And it’s been hard dealing with my grandfather ever since. He changed  once she died, and his health has been deteriorating. I’m always cleaning up messes after him, and he makes fun of my mental health at times. He always criticizes me for not finishing college, and he doesn’t realize how I’ve been doing throughout all this, and how difficult my mental health has been all my life. 
Depression really has been forever eating me up, and it’s been at my neck for years. It took the things I enjoyed away from me. It feels like it has taken away my humanity, or my soul? I really and truly don’t understand what it feels like to be happy. I feels strange that I don’t understand this basic feeling. I would typically feel extremely low or just flat throughout my life. I always feel like I don’t belong here, and I don’t know how else to describe it. 
I often feel like I was born too early. My mom having me at 16 made me feel like I shouldn’t be here, a mistake I guess. 
Depression took art away from me for so many years. It didn’t really help that when I was growing up , my grandfather would always shit on me for being into art, and would always tell me that “these drawings  will get you nowhere.” 
Depression, social anxiety, and  ptsd feel like they have been choking me to death all this time, and I don’t know how much I have left in me. 
I feel like a failure. I dropped out of college, and I never had a job. I didn’t understand my mental health as I grew up. I didn’t realize that I’m so .. incredibly damaged. I’ve experienced so much evil in the world at such a young age, it has made me very hyper vigilant. I wish I could just be normal. 
I feel like my therapy and my medication just can’t fix me. Every time I feel that my antidepressants wear off and I just feel that familiar feeling of my mood dropping heavily, it makes me lose hope. After trying a couple different medications it just worries me, that maybe I’m so mentally ill there is no hope for me. I won’t even be able to afford therapy after this month, and insurance doesn’t help me with any of that. It just feels like everything just goes wrong for me my uncle won’t be able to help me out with it anymore. I’ve been doing therapy for a year now. I just don’t even know what to do anymore. I just feel like I don’t want to live, but I don’t want to die. I don’t want it to hurt, since it just feels like that’s all I’ve been feeling  my entire life. Just that pain and empty. I just really feel like I don’t belong here. Maybe I’m really not supposed to be here. 
Idk anymore. I just don’t feel human I guess. I don’t have any support or .. anyone that cares. I don’t feel like I exist at all, or even feel like I should exist. Nobody listens to me. Every day is really hard to live. 
I don’t know what to do anymore.",1679106045.0

Worse is understanding exactly what I mean and dismissing it cause the truth is too uncomfortable.

I've won but at the cost of me becoming a fragile man and one more single heartbreaking event would put me back into the deep black hole of depression. I started to socialize again but felt really weird, feels like I cannot relate with people despite being true to myself. I cannot pick up social cues but forced myself to socialize despite that, to relearn. I tried for so long that it kept failing, so then I shifted the focus to myself. I started to love myself even more but then another heartbreaking event happened to me and now I've become so careless about life that made me think maybe suicide is my only option here.

The actual amount of work a human must do to live is impressive especially if you compare it to any other species on this planet. 

Sure, every living being must play his role in their own life. They care for their families and work for their pack, queen or similar, but have you ever seen an animal having to worry if they can keep their family alive due to high rent prices or being psychological at the end because their parents and family is driving them into depression?

Living in the wild is hard and we as the humans have it comfortably not having to worry about hunting, fishing, and forging but is it actually better for us this way? The constant stress put on us from society, the worries this evolved lifestyle brings with it, has it made things worse than they where before? Don’t get me wrong here, I appreciate the health care, technology, and supermarkets. I wouldn’t want to live without them but the way we exist is not the nonplus ultra, we must evolve further. I can´t deal with being oppressed by other anymore and I don’t want my children to have to deal with this. The way we are constantly told how to live our lives, by our family, by social media, by society, by school and I could go on for ages, is not right. We should be able to live our lives in a way that makes us happy as individuals. I am sick of living only for the sake of others and it is driving me insane, slowly but it does. And if we where to talk up we where the bad person, the ones doing wrong, because how could we not care about our family, how could we not care about the others. But that we are breaking apart is insignificant, as it only affects us and not the others around us. Whereas doing what we want and what makes us happy would have an actual impact on them. But if you are exhausted and can’t, go on anymore, that is your fault. “You have such a good life. Look at others they have it worse. Be grateful!”. As if I didn’t try to appreciate it, but how could one if it doesn’t feel right…If it makes you unhappy? 

I drifted away from what I started to talk about, but I think this is as important to note, so I will post it anyway.

I couldn't even eat because my anxiety would take control of my stomach and basically everything would give me stomach aches. I had started to go to therapy and it kinda helped. Starting this new semester, I was feeling way better. I could eat normal stuff again and my overthinking was way less. I was starting to feel in control of myself and of my life. Now we are in March and I feel totally hopeless again. I barely have any strength to get up in the mornings, I lost my motivation and excitement for most things I loved and for my major( which I know I love but I just feel numb about it). Apart from all of that, my overthinking is getting the best of me and I can't control it anymore. I'm crying myself to sleep half of the week and I assume that the person that cares the most about me really doesn't and that everything he says about being my best friend and caring for me is all bullshit and I end up spiraling and getting mad at him really easily. I just wanna take control of my life again and not hurt my best friend with my overthinking. I went to therapy again but it didn't help.

Recently I left my X-wife because she had cheated on me twice in one week. We have a son together and had been together from the age of 14, up to 24. I live two hours from her and my son, because after we split she went back to live with her parents, I told her to leave our son with me but she wasn't to keen on that. After she left, I had lost my job, Had my wallet with my drivers license in it stolen, and my car because she took it in the divorce. I had to make money doing Uber Eats on a bicycle to cover the cost of a new birth certificate since mine is with my mother who does not speak to me, because of a falling out involving my X's dad, and my mother. after that, I had to continue to Uber to get my new license, all while doing this I could only contact my son via phone call because she refused to bring him to me and told me I had to find a way to pick him up myself, which in our area and distance was not achievable for me in my situation. once I got my new ID though, I landed a job as a sales councilor for fitness international at an LA fitness in Portland Oregon. Now I was making money and starting to garner a foundation in which I could begin to raise my child. I was constantly being verbally barraged, being told things like ""your a deadbeat, you don't see your son, he never gets to go to your place, I never get a break"" etc. etc. etc. 

I was offered a promotion two months at my job to become the sales manager of my own location. We have a daycare at my work mind you, and I was given permission by my work to let my son use the facility while I'm on the clock so I didn't have to fork out money for a babysitter and i could have my son for long periods of time, since our original agreement was I was stable,was to swap every other week. Now I'm making big boy money, I have child care taken care of for when I'm working, AND I bought a brand new car. I have everything I need to make sure I can take care of my son. I work 6 1\\2 days a week every single week, and I still made sure that I was capable and mentally prepared to take care of my son. After I all of this comes to fruition, she tells me that I'm not involved enough and she doesn't think I'm ready to take care of him, and I have to prove to her that I want to be in his life. I've been restricted to supervised, 1 hour visits, and none of this is court ordered. There are times where I get too busy at work and i can't always call him, but he's under two years old, so i don't think its making that much of a difference, plus i've said to her before I would rather just spend physical time with him because I can at least pop in our daycare center and check on him and spend time with him at home. 

The other day she sent me a text, and it was very direct and aggressive, told me I'm a burden to her and our child, that I'm a waste of human skin, that there's a reason my parents hate me and how I only care about myself and how I'm lazy. All of this, with the stress from my job, the limited time I get outside my job, The effort of starting from nothing to something so that I can raise my son, has built up, and I feel like I've accomplished nothing. I feel like I'm doing all this for my son, in return to be shit on, given further stipulations that aren't court ordered, and verbally abused and never get anywhere. My son is my life, the reason I even cared to make a comeback in my life in the first place, and I'm made to feel like I don't care about him and told that he's better off without me, and I'm a dad whos actually trying. 

I barley sleep, I barley eat, all I do is work, and stare at the ceiling wishing I could just have an aneurism or a heart attack so my death doesn't look like it was on purpose. I make more jokes about killing myself as a cry for help, but I've always had an edgy sense of humor, so I don't think people think anything of it. I cry myself to sleep in the dark hoping i can muster up the courage to jump out of my apartment window or veer into oncoming traffic, because if I don't have my son, I really have no purpose to be alive. Every waking second I'm happy,cheery,and positive on the outside, but that's simply a way to hide from my peers that inside I'm constantly thinking about ending my life. I'm not talking about in a sad manner either, I get tactical, I plan, and come up with ways that are crafty and logical. It's almost soothing for me to think about it because the mental thought is like a sample of what I could really have.  I yearn to escape all of this stress and pointless effort when I'm not making any progress towards being a father. I WANT to be in my sons life, but I'm painted as a deadbeat. 

I appreciate you if you read all this. I'm not sure how to overcome this feeling, and each day it gets more and more intense, and almost like it gets easier and easier to step to that final ledge. She said my son would be better without me and I want what's best for my son right? I can't take it anymore, and I want to close my eyes and never open them. I want to inhale, and never exhale.

My dad apologized for freaking out. He explained that this mail thing is happening because it's a habit. They've always just blindly opened the mail at the end of the day because any and all mail used to only be theirs. They apparently still see me as a kid who doesn't get mail often. 

He then proceeded to claim that he is still unsure if I should get my meds back because of the way I originally acted. Apparently he can't see that someone would push the issue after months and months of them politely asking not to invade their privacy. 

I told him to look at it from literally anyone else's point of view. If someone else was opening their mail, you ask them to respect their privacy, and they continue to open their mail anyways. Seems to me that anyone would push the issue more at that point. But no. Apparently getting angry after a literal year of them not respecting my privacy is absolutely insane and I need to quit these meds that are supposedly making me go crazy. I feel that I was actually too lenient. I should've pushed back sooner. 

Well he had no valid rebuttal after I said that. Yet he is still debating giving my meds back. I have yet to talk to my mom. She is playing the silent game. She will be the hardest to convince. Even if I have every valid argument laid out on a silver platter, she will still come up with some bullshit excuse and turn it around on me. 

We will see what happens tonight. If she refuses to give my meds, I am debating just straight up calling the police. This is absolutely ridiculous and childish.

I’ll try to keep this short, but for the last few months I’ve been sinking into a very deep depression again. It’s getting to the point where I don’t want to socialize because I feel like I’m a bother to everyone and I’m better off not there at all. I feel like friends keep me around out of a courtesy, but probably plan things without me when they can. 

I have high functioning anxiety and depression, so it’s not impacting my ability to work (hopefully never will). I’ve been with my partner for 3 years and he is very supportive, though we’ve had a breach in trust a couple times and makes me wary to fully trust.

I’ve stopped initiating hangouts and conversations with people because I wanted to see if they would reach out to me first (I’m usually the first). Well, that has only shown me that nobody ever engages with me.. its really making me feel annoying, bothersome, weird, unwanted, etc.

Lately I’m feeling like I’m not worth having around at all, and it’s scaring me. I wouldn’t end my life, but it worries me when I feel such intense hatred/shame about myself. I used to be so social and outgoing, now I keep to myself because I think I probably bother people. 

I don’t have many friends who have similar interests or hobbies, so it was always tough hanging out and feeling “fulfilled” in that respect. I know a handful of people who have one hobby in common with me and we all know each other, but again, I feel like I’m a loser or weirdo to them.

I just want to go back to my normal, carefree, fun self and stop being so socially awkward and depressed. The amount of intrusive, negative, anxious thoughts is so prevalent now.",1679063850.0

My ex broke up with me a few months back and blamed me for everything. It kicked me into gear, dumping everything and focus on my mental health. I know the break up wasn’t 100% my fault but I did have a part in it and I’m trying to fix my issues. Im getting professional help, doing all the things people recommend after a break up (journaling, working out, yoga, meditation, self-care, etc). Overall I’m making huge progress and I feel like a better person. I know if I continue down this path, I will be the person I was always meant to be. 

I can’t help to shake off the feeling of being unwanted and unloved. During the break up, my ex made me feel like this monster, this terrible person and I don’t even know what was real or fake. I don’t know how long she was dishonest and I don’t even know if she truly loved me anymore. I have this emotion sitting in my chest and stomach. It feels like a few bricks and it just lingers. I’ve been getting into mindfulness and meditation so I know how to feel the emotions come and go, but this particular emotion stays. It doesn’t leave me. It makes me want to lay in bed, not do anything. It makes me want to just stay still. I don’t eat anything when I feel this emotion. It stays for hours and sometimes days like recently. I don’t know what this is and I don’t know how to handle it. True thoughts of suicide enter my head. I’ve made plans and sometimes I want to follow through. 

My family isn’t there for me. I recently had to cut family members out of my life for disrespecting my boundaries and honestly we never had a good relationship.

I'm an MBBS Final year student who gave his exams and just realised that they failed me in practicals in one of my subjects.
Before you guys say, it's a common thing to happen...
I have tried so much despite having depression.. I was so much on caffeine that I wanted to kill my self so many times during the exams. But somehow, with the support of my girlfriend (currently ex) , and a lot of determination from my side, I put in effort.

So much effort that I tried to ignore that I was feeling suicidal also. Now that I do think about it, it feels horrifying. Why am I putting myself through this...
And despite so much efforts, I fail. 

And all the friends I thought I had suddenly don't care at all. None of them even bothered to leave a text as to how I am.
All I see is their statuses "" Yay, it's Dr.XYZ now"" and now I question everything now. Were they my friends in the first place? They're just there with you because you just happened to be in the same class maybe time pass

This month has been a terrifying one. I flunked in my exam. I met up with a car accident (major one, almost cost 1/10th of the price of a mid range sedan which ofcourse went on insurance, but another 1/10th of it insurance company didn't approve)

Accident number 2: I fell down boarding a train which just started moving and I'm wounded (both legs and clothes torn)

Despite this, my girlfriend also broke up with me saying that "" long distance isn't working and we'll be close friends.""

Do people really care about anyone?
If they don't care about me, why am I going head over heels putting in so much effort and trying to help out the society.

I really wish I had someone to talk to at these bad times. I mean, no one would even listen to me talk about this.

If you have read this till here, thank you for reading and i should love to have you as my social support. But unfortunately, I have no one there too.

I was taking Wellbutrin when I was a freshman in high school. I stopped in my '20s because I'm an idiot. Then about 6 years ago, in my early thirties I started taking bupropion again.

The reason why I stopped recently was because I got some helpful advice on an IBS subreddit about how certain types of antidepressants can help I be a symptoms. But he can't take bupropion and amitriptyline at the same time, so I wanted to detox off the old one before I start the new one.

The new one didn't work out for me didn't like the side effects. Give up after 2 days.

So now it's been about 3 weeks, maybe a month, since I've taken bupropion. And I think I'm noticing some relief with my IBS symptoms.

Starting to wonder if my boo boo Brian was making my IBS worse. I've had IBS for as long as I can remember. But I've also been taking these meds for most of my life. I do know that the meds aren't the cause of my IBS, but I'm starting to believe that they may have been causing me to have a hypersensitivity to its symptoms.

Makes sense.

For the same reason that amitriptyline was supposed to help. And I depressants effect the neurotransmitters in the brain. There is a very strong gut-brain connection when it comes to IBS. It's possible that boopopreon works in a way that heightens every gut tremor and gurgle and sensations of bloating and everything else.

And considering that IBS is one of the biggest reasons why I feel I need depression medication. I'm starting to wonder if I should go back on the meds at all.

For those of you have been taking medications most of your life. How do you feel about the side effects? Which medications are you taking? Bigger question is, how do you know who you are? How much of you is you and how much of you is the meds?",1679070696.0

So to try and keep this short I’ll explain my problem now, and provide extra details if/when asked. Lately, I just feel like shit. Back in 2021 I was sick nearly the entire year and thought I was going to end up getting diagnosed with some kind of bone cancer. I have a girlfriend, 25f, that I’ve been with for 5 years in a long distance relationship. She lives in Australia and I live in America. We met back in the beginning of our relationship but then Covid hit and we couldn’t see one another. At that time I had a job but because I kept getting sick I had to quit and I’ve been living off of SSI since. That was like 2 years ago. I was in college and I had to drop out because of mental stress coupled with living with my parents who I’ve tried to come out too multiple times but the conversation never ends well. In the past they would just take me to church with them more and say “we need to spend more time together as a family.” Because they think that me being trans means they don’t love me enough or something. I haven’t told them that I’ve dropped out of college and I have 5 months to either tell them the truth or get really good at degree forgery. My mom is prior military so not going to college will piss her off. This is my third attempt at college and if I’m being honest I think I was just too terrified to let the family down again. That and, if I don’t stay in college then my parents have to pay out of pocket for my healthcare and can’t afford that because my mother is the only one working in the house.

The other night me and my girlfriend had a talk and she helped me navigate some of these feelings but the thing that’s fucking with me is mainly the fact that, I have no job. I’m only getting chump change from the government. I’m lying to my family because they don’t want to know me so I feel like I am just a waste of space and a disappointment to not only them but my girlfriend.

I have been here for 4 days and the only time that I see him is when I make dinner and call him down. He eats for 10 minutes and goes right back upstairs to his room with the door shut. He does not come out of his room AT ALL besides that.

About me: I’m 20 years old, child of divorce with 2 middle class parents. I did well in high school, I liked history and economics. I was happy, yes I’d had moments where I wasn’t but I had never truly experienced depression. I wasn’t popular but I wasn’t an outcast, I was able to make friends with just about anyone. 

I graduated high school and was working at a UPS warehouse earning decent money for an 18 year old. One day a co worker in his 40s was talking to me, as it turns out he gone to the same school as me. I got hit with a sense of stagnation that if I didn’t do something I would end up like him, working an entry level job for the rest of my life. I’d missed the window for college, blown off my SATs (Covid timeframe) and decided to go talk to a recruiter. They told me all these wonderful lies that I wanted to hear, I’d always had an interest in history so I figured why not live it in a sense while also giving myself purpose and commitment. 

Military experience: I went to boot camp, got through it with the expectation that somehow the fleet would be better. I enjoyed the initial freedom ITB gave me but after being forced into an MOS i didn’t want my opinion was soured. I get to the fleet and immediately spiral into the worst depression i have ever experienced. I hated my life, I hated my job, I hated my peers and seniors. I was a shell of my former self, displaying all the characteristics of normal person but internally there was nothing, every time i crossed the street I hoped a car would hit me just so I wouldnt have to exist, I wanted to disappear, I wanted my old life back. A year and a half goes by and I’m no longer a boot, no longer treated like the lowest form of life but the old me isn’t back. I feel nothing, no joy no happiness and no peace. The only tangible emotions I can feel are disappointment (in myself), disgust with the marine corps and anxiety. I simply do not exist as a person, I’m just a sum of parts, my PFT and CFT, Jepes. I am alone and miserable, I want nothing more to do with the military yet I want the benefits enough to not purposely fail a drug test. I neglect my mental health for years and I want so desperately to return to a society that judges people on their character, I don’t want to feel like some soulless husk. I hate where I am, what I’m surrounded by and what it really is behind the curtain. 

If anyone wants to reach out please do, none of my “friends” know how I feel and I continue with this facade as those that have shared their true feelings have received ridicule and ostracized.",1679063734.0

423,Why is there a void?,2,11tn2h2,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11tn2h2/why_is_there_a_void/,1,"I needed somewhere to put this… and seeding that I am in the start of figuring out what came first (ADHD or depression), I needed to vent.

My parents are moving apart. It’s not a shock, but I don’t know what I feel anymore. My dad messaged me about it and after that I felt numb, it was going so well today as well. Every day I don’t really feel anything. At first I thought it was just directed by being tired or maybe that’s just who I am, but now this void of emotional numbness is drowning me. I either feel nothing, or I feel sad.

Should I feel sad? Angry? Happy? I feel like nothing will affect me, it’s as if I’m always expecting something bad to happen nowadays, no matter what. I’m unable to hold friends, unable to want to take care of myself. I just want to lie in bed and sleep. I don’t want to wake up.

I’ve been considering getting a cat, for the emotional support and the fact that I seem to feel a sense of purpose when I have a pet to take care of. Would it be clever? I need someone to meet me when I come home from university, I don’t want to reach out to my family because they have never really seen my problems. To explain simply I think it would be the case of middle child, where I am just forgotten. Mentioning how tired I am 24/7 I am just told to get fresh air, or told that everyone is tired once in a while, I never made any problems when I grew up so why would I have problems now?

I am just so scared, because no matter what I do I feel like people perceive me as weird, as if there is something wrong with me. I am unable to focus and do schoolwork, unable to play games and keep my twitch channel alive, I’m not even able to properly take care of myself.

I wasted time and did not pray.

425,I just need the courage to end my life,11,11tbngj,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11tbngj/i_just_need_the_courage_to_end_my_life/,4,"I don't know what I have to change, but I just can't connect with anyone. I have no passions or enthusiasm for life. I still try to talk to people and start conversations but I don't really know what to say to people. I'm too paranoid about saying stupid or awkward things because of judgement and social rejection I experienced countless times in the past. These days I struggle to feel any positive emotions towards anyone at all. I'm certain that nobody will ever truly care about me or my life enough to be my friend anyways. When I try to socialize it feels like people just don't care about or relate to what I'm saying. So I find myself desperately reading about social skills even though talking to people is always an unenjoyable experience for me.

 I try to relax but if I just let everything go then my face is just blank and I look stupid. I know this because I'll often turn to look at myself in a reflective surface if I have one next to me just a second after I'm finished with an interaction. It seems like the only way for me to get by in this world is to be a completely fake person. 

None of my smiles are genuine because I just smile because I think I have to in the given situation. If you don't smile enough people think you are rude, creepy, any number of really bad things. I'm just not able to feel good feelings around other people anymore I guess. I try to convince myself to like other people but I'm not ""normal"" enough to be treated normally by other people. People instinctively don't trust me and I'm constantly trying to raise my inner confidence and coming up short.

There's not a day that goes by that I don't at least seriously consider suicide at least once. Between having to work so hard to survive and not being able to connect to others and have friends, I struggle to see the point. I'm not able to have passions. I feel like I'm not allowed to like things and now I don't really have an emotional reaction to anything.

 The only positive emotion I feel is relief, but never real happiness. I'm not able to make myself laugh. I can only kinda sorta laugh at other things, but I can only enjoy humor for so long before I start to realize again that I will never be able to produce funny things and be a fun person like others can. I try to learn but it's hard to really understand other people. My tone is always messed up when I try to be friendly or joke around anyways. If I make someone laugh it's only to gain their apporoval. It feels like work and nothing I say makes me laugh. I just kind of say things that I think in my head have a probability of making someone else laugh and then I try it. Sometimes it works, a lot of times it doesn't. I can't make myself laugh. 


I don't know what to do about being so dead inside. I'm not capable of enjoying another person's company because I am always worried about being labelled as a weird, stupid person. I'm only able to put on a performance for others and hope that they respect me at the very least. Not many people do respect or like me anyways.

They say you have to be vulnerable to be likable but I don't know how to do that. I'm not even able to feel happy about talking to another person with no worry of judgement no matter who it is. It could be my mom, it could be an old ""friend"", it could be the coworkers I see almost every day. I just feel like I'm in the lion's den when I socialize and if I relax I just come off as dead inside because I have no interest in people, places or things. They say you have to change yourself to make yourself interested in stuff but I don't know how. 

Sometimes I think I'm too stupid for any of this. I don't pick up on patterns anymore. I'm not able to think about what to say to another person without them thinking it's weird in some way. Everything I do to try to relate to others feels forced. It seems like my memory in general doesn't work well enough anymore to be able to socialize. The plethora or relatable social and general life conventions people draw on to socialize are always lost on me. 

I am always primarily concerned with survival and being able to afford food and a roof over my head and I can't imagine that getting any better. I'm not able to find joy in this life of survival. The struggle is always on my mind and I'm not able to be lighthearted and happy around others. It seems like absolutely no one I've ever met can relate to that. People just downplay things if you're sad.

 For example someone in my sobriety group therapy was crying one session due to his struggles in life. When he's not there, the counselor just pithily refers to him having a ""rough time"" like you would talk about a little kid who just scraped their knee. 

But it's more serious than that. It's not possible to just choose to be happy. Everywhere I turn there's more proof that this life isn't worth anything. I'm probably fucked with brain damage or something. Whatever is wrong doesn't matter I guess. 

I don't even want to be happy. They say people like me choose sadness and I think that is true, but it isn't my fault. I'm not able to keep being happy when I'm socially awkward in a social interaction. I'm not able to keep being happy when I have to be with/around other people. Everything about socializing makes me feel depressed and I have to do it every single day for the rest of my life. There's no point in the torture. I will always ruin the vibe and people are better off without me. I am just a burden and my life will always be an uphill struggle to not be a burden on other people.

I'm going to go workout and go for a run, then take a cold shower. Even though I don't want to do any of it. Life is only about doing things because you have to. There's nothing to be happy about fighting to survive every day. I just want to take some kind of medicine that will make my heart stop in my sleep.",1679012924.0

I have so much trouble sleeping. I haven’t been eating much since leaving her, and people have commented positively on my appearance, but I’ve lost this weight in a (mostly) unhealthy manner.

I’ve moved from home, found a decent job where they actually treat me like a human and not some shit stain on the bottom of their shoe. I’ve managed to somewhat ditch precarity, I guess, well I’m ironically uncertain I have but fuck it, it’s the least precarious I’ve felt for a long, long time. Despite all of this, I still feel generally pretty shit about everything for the most part.  

I hate the fact that whenever I seem to have something good, I can never really appreciate it. I can reinforce affirmations, try to “Smell the flowers” and be present but I just carry around the same persistent feeling of being doomed in some way, like I’m predestined to fail, and not in a glamorous fashion, more like a slow, lumbering, disgraceful descent into failure. I sort of just stumble into things and just say it’ll do, as I really have zero motivation to work hard at pretty much anything, I just fucking float around. Nothing motivates me in any way particularly. I have no desire for power, money, dominance, to be remembered, anything of the sort. To me, a lot of those things are arbitrary in nature. I just want to be able to do what I want to do, live with minimal regret, have a positive impact on the people I care about, to not repeat my own mistakes or the mistakes of others, to have love and empathy for myself and to be true to myself always. I feel I have succeeded in living by these standards in a way, but something is still missing and I’m assuming will always feel missing. I feel like it’s just something I need to learn to live with, like a lot of things.  

I haven’t had a close, intimate relationship in a very long time, nearly 7 fucking years. I spent such a long time grieving about the end of my last relationship and generally lamenting the mistakes I’d made, that I’ve managed to alienate myself into thinking that I’ll never change and that I’ll most probably never be that close to anyone ever again. Whenever someone makes an attempt to get close to me, or if I have any opportunity to really get to know someone, I either close myself off or push them away. My ego can’t deal with rejection, which is fucking hilarious as I’ve dealt with a lot of rejection in my life but can never ever really get used to it at all. I feel like I give off the impression and general image of being happy in my own company and living by my own rules (I probably think I do but in actuality I’m probably transparent as fuck), but the truth is that like everyone else, I really want to be loved and understood. Not only do I want that, I want to be able to love somebody else.  

I feel like I can never get out of the this cocoon I’ve made for myself, constructed through all the bitterness, scorn and insecurity I’ve been harboring for years, and that I’ll be alone until I die. I want to open my heart and let someone in, as incredibly lame as that sounds, but something is always standing in the way of this. It’s a really tough thing to balance, self sufficiency and not being codependent on the approval and admiration of others with the general need to be cared about and wanted. I feel that this balancing act will persist for the rest of my life and I’ll never be content with what I have, adding to the familiar sense of doom that I mentioned previously. I know I’ve ranted on sporadically about a myriad of things, but if anyone feels the same way or has felt the same way, please say. If you have any advice, for any points I’ve mentioned, it is hugely welcome. For anyone who’s going to be a prick in the comments, fuck you in advance.

Tried to date my father wanted me to find a good woman that would be my rock and steady me, but I hate myself so how could I find someone when I can’t stand myself. I can't sleep at night because I have either unbelievably bad nightmares that will wake me or because of a herniated disk in my back pain that keeps me from falling asleep. I could never sleep even as a child I fought sleep. My father was murdered on a night like tonight (how I wish it could have been me) and after 21 years it still fucks with me especially on nights like tonight.

I want to get better, but medication doesn’t work. It makes me more suicidal; I have tried ECT did not work, tried TMS did not work. I don’t trust therapists, so I never tell them what’s truly going on.

I get into screaming arguments with family. Take tonight accused my niece of stealing and once she left the house, I caught it from my mother and my sister stating I am accusing her without proof. I don’t have proof, but I know what I know. So, after a 2-hour screaming match, I locked myself in my room. It’s now extremely late and she still has not come home. her I’ve tried to apologize but the damage has been done. Now watch she doesn’t make it home something happens to her, and it will be all my fault because it is and everything, I do is wrong and my fault just not tonight but all the time.

Why am I such a coward that I am still here, why doesn’t nothing work I just keep getting further and further from being any type of person that should still be breathing. I hope I die of a heart attack soon. I know I can’t continue doing this and no sleep let’s hope for death soon. There’s no longer anything left. I made sure that I have successfully burned all bridges I can't enjoy even the simplest things anymore. I just in this haze that time is moving slow keeping me alive for as long as it can.

Just started a new medication that should help with my mood swings. Was manic yesterday, saddest bastard around today. 

I can't get this recurring thought out of my head, I'm playing russian roulette, toying with fate, pull the trigger, and it's empty. Pull it again and again and again, hitting every empty chamber leaving me with the only one with a bullet in it. I toss the revolver aside and just lie down on the floor, crying myself to sleep. 

I don't self harm, well, not anymore. I have no intent on attempting or completing, every method is just too much effort. I respond to stress by lashing out and pushing people away, accidental or intentional. But after I calm down I almost always beg and plead for forgiveness. I can't be the hero and I'm too soft to even be the villain. It's just pathetic. 

I'm just tired of living, this shit sucks. I've got loved ones yeah, but what good are they when I can rarely even talk to them? I just hate everyone else around me. Hate might be exaggerating but nobody else makes me happy. They either contribute nothing or just straight up make me feel worse. I'm stuck either super hyper and excited over nothing but easily irritable or I can't fucking get out of bed. Near constant thoughts of suicide but none of the gall required to just do it. I want to die yet fear death. A walking contradiction until something or someone does my job for me.

My Leave Specialist said it wasn’t uncommon that doctors would be hesitant to sign it but suggested I asked my primary doctor. 

I got the psychiatrist to send me my medical records and SOAP notes pretty much stating how I couldn’t focus, and that I have severe depression. My primary doctor said she would not sign it and said “based on those records, you don’t need rest”

I tried as hard as I could to get things to get better, but I only got to lose the few things I had in life.
I know it sounds a bit dramatic, but I really feel like I got nothing to live for anymore.

my mother passed away from cancer when I was fourteen, she was the light of my life and the most important person in it. I had to move out with my dad, who constantly neglected us me and my disabled sister.
the time I lived with my father I went through hunger, loneliness and extreme depression.
Two years ago I couldn't get up from my bed, i used to sleep about 11 or 12 hours a day, waking up at 6pm and sometimes not eating for days, i failed highschool and everything I tried to achieve. Yet some family members who were worried about me got me in therapy and into pills.
Last year I started having a serious problem with drugs, like xans and similars, i developed an adiction, and sadly, it was the best thing that happened me in a long time.
For first time in years I got all the fun i wanted, i meet new friends, I started dating a girl, i got good grades and generally i just was having a good time.
But when my need for pills got heavier I started fucking everything up, making all the people i knew mad, and having a lot of troubles with almost everyone i knew.
This girl broke with me and spread a false accusations about me being a creep, i cut bounds with my new friends and most important, I had to leave my house because my dad beat me up and I couldn't stand more abuses.
I was sleeping on a different house everyday,
My bigger brothers first gave me a hand, but then, they got tired about me being depressed and having to live in their house, i wasn't even 18 at that moment and only thing I had was my backpack and the things it.

Some time after that my brothers finally kicked me violently out of their houses.
Now I live with an old friend of my mom, I had to get an awfull job in the summer and I just started my last year before college.

Things may seem better but believe me they aren't, i don't get well with the person I live with, yet i always try to do the best for her bc of the help she is giving me letting me live in her house.
I got only one friend, who currently is going through a similar situation, all my family has forgot about me, i was just a burden for them and they look happy about not having to care about me anymore.
The story is longer and I skipped some things because the post is long enough already.

I genuinely have nothing, no family, almost no friends, and no will to live anymore
Im just alive for not reason at all, I'm not afraid of death, I'm such a pussy for being incapable of taking my own life.

But I also have this undiagnosed autism that I probably have that makes it hard to know if someone is my friend or just being friendly. 

I don't know how often someone should send text messages. All I know is that people never initiated conversation with ME. I always had to be the first to say something, at least with the people who I had in my life until recently.

So out of spite I deleted my Facebook this January and now the 8 ""friends"" I had on there are now gone, including my cousin who I no longer talk to. But I had deleted other people out of spite for the same reason on there years ago. Of course, I'm kind of a hypocrite because I never initiated conversation either. But I even lost touch with my extroverted friends who usually used to initiate conversation. It's as if I'd been forgotten by everyone.

But I don't have a Facebook anymore so I can officially say that I have no friends. But it really hurts knowing that no one is going to be at my funeral.

Since I have moved back in with my parents, every once in a while, they will ""accidentally"" open my mail. I am someone who takes their privacy seriously. But I didn't get upset the first few times because it very well could have been an honest mistake. 

Fast forward about a year, they still ""accidentally"" open my mail. At least once a month. Today it happened again. I asked them to stop opening my mail. I told them that I have to remind them once a month. I expressed my frustration about this. It quickly turned into my mom screaming at me saying it's her house. Her property. Her mailbox. Bla bla bla. I told her that it is still illegal to open my mail regardless of where it ends up. She didn't believe me. So I sent a screenshot of the law saying that it is illegal. I am an adult. I have rights. Its really not that difficult.

Both my parents stormed in and screamed at me. We went back and forth. Threatening to kick me out. Me saying ""just don't open my mail. Idk why that is so difficult"". 

My dad punched my door and took a couple steps forward at me. I calmed down and said ""ok. How about we just leave eachother alone tonight. And we can talk tomorrow morning when everyone has calmed down."" My dad punching the door and screaming at me was very surprising because my dad is a great person. He is smart and logical. So this was a shock when I saw him punching the door and screaming at me.

Right after I said that, they started blaming my medication. They seriously believe that I am acting this way because of my medication. Funny thing is, I've been arguing with them about respecting my privacy before I even started taking ADHD meds. So I don't understand their logic here.

They forced me to give them all of my medication. Which I'm pretty sure is also illegal since I am an adult. 

I am pretty sure that stealing mail and/or taking someone's medication, a controlled substance, is highly illegal. But I don't want to report them for this all because they let their anger get the best of them. I also love them dearly. I don't want them to suffer the law because of this. But idk what to do.

They don't realize that if I lose my medication, I will be worse than I supposedly was. I was so depressed before I started taking my prescription. These meds have quite literally saved my life..

I am debating moving out. But the whole reason I moved back in with them is because I couldn't afford to live on my own. I don't know what to do. I am looking for some advice here. Can I explain this to my doctor to get a new prescription without getting them in trouble? What do you guys think I should do? Am I being too unreasonable?

Have I been stupid?,1,11tm14i,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11tm14i/jeopardised_a_job_over_a_holiday_have_i_been/,0,"So over the past year my friends have noticed I haven’t been really down and depressed lately to the point where I’d be ignoring/not replying to messages not hoping online with them, giving cold responses on calls. 

To make me feel better, they planned a trip with me to go get out of the country and have some fun. And whilst I’m very introverted/not really good at socialising I was all for it.

But knowing my luck, I finally got a job offer (temp, 3 month contract with chance of renewal) it pays well and the experience would be great on my cv even if I don’t get my contract extended. And since I’ve been stuck in retail for the past year I finally felt like I’d secured a W and could progress in my life even if it was only a temporary thing. (Being stuck in retail was ruining my mental too)

However this contract clashes with the time I was supposed to go on holiday. So I told my friends about the situation but because they already planned everything and they need to be back at a certain time they wouldn’t budge on moving the holiday. 

At first I thought okay I’ll just reject the offer but I started having second thoughts. This job is only temporary but I feel like it would be a good step in the direction for myself since I’ve been so lost with my career choices. 

But I also think the holiday would do me some good to forget about all the other stuff and really enjoy myself and maybe boost my confidence in social situations. (I haven’t been on holiday in over 5/6 years) I think my issue is I’m trying to please both parties. 

These are my closest friends and I don’t wanna make them thinking I’m ducking the holiday (I’ve said no to a lot of events like this in the past due to me being so introverted) 

But the more I think about it the more stupid I think I’ve been choosing a holiday over a job. Part of me feels my friends won’t have the time to do something like this again (we’re all 23/24 and they want to go for a month) which is why I wanna go and make them happy. 

But since I haven’t found anything decent in terms of jobs I feel like I’ve thrown everything back in the faces of the people who gave me the offer. 

My friends thought I should make an excuse to leave the job early but I wanted to be honest with them so I told them my situation. They said they’d get back to me yesterday but so far I haven’t heard anything from them which I think is a bad sign. I asked to see if it was possible to do part of my contract, go on holiday then come back and finish it (which I honestly think was a silly move and a slap in the face to the employer). 

Since I haven’t heard back I think I’ve blown my chances and I guess this is the price you pay for trying to please multiple people at once.

This may not apply to many folks on here, but I figured I'd give it a shot anyway. I am currently looking to recruit participants to complete my online research study that is part of my dissertation in clinical psychology. My research focuses on understanding the concept of Fear of Depression Recurrence, which captures fears that people who are remitted from depression may have about becoming depressed again. The goal of this online study is to gain a better understanding of the construct and validate the psychometric properties of a Fear of Depression Recurrence questionnaire. We hope that learning more about fear of depression recurrence may present a small window into understanding depression relapse and thus lead to better informed prevention efforts. 

The mods of this subreddit have vetted my study (which has received ethical approval from my institution) and verified my identity.

**Interested? Here is some more information about the study:**

***Were you ever diagnosed with depression? Do you feel better now?***

It will also ask you for basic personal information (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity, occupation) and questions about your current depressive symptoms, other mental health concerns, beliefs about depression, coping strategies, and quality of life. 

The online survey will take approximately **1 hour** to complete. All components of this study can be completed remotely, in the comfort of your own home. 

Participants who are eligible and complete our online survey will be entered in a draw to win one of **seven** $100 CAD Amazon Gift cards.

My neck was stiff I was extremely irritable my vison blurry and static and colors look greyed and lifeless my perception of depth and reality are completely off. Peoples faces for some reason look aggresive to me like there judging me. Going out in public is really difficult for me I get paranoid thoughts. It's extremely difficult to read it's like i just see letters but can't make sense of it and comprehend what I'm reading. I slurr and have difficulty recalling my words. My emotions and sense of empathy have been completely numbed the only thing i feel strongly is anger. My voice is extremely monotone. 

I feel like I had a stroke but I got an mri scan of my brain and everything came back completely normal. All the mri showed is a sinus infection and nasal polyp.

This all happened to me in the span of one night. Each morning I wake up and my vision and control over my emotions is better than the day before. Each day I wake up people look less and less threatening and I feel as if I'm maturing physically and mentally. Each day I'm more human and less robot.

It can be demanding, but lately it's been ok. Prior to taking this job a year ago, I was unemployed from getting laid off in 2020. I took most of 2020, 2021 and the first part of 2022 attempting to focus on health issues and dealing with depression. I realize now I really didn't focus on my health from 2020-2022 because I was just a nervous wreck about things in the past and was trying to move too fast in my mental health journey. I think I might need to just take another break. Most likely, I might need to quit my job.

I've tried therapy, medications and just working it out on my own. Each has some use, but ultimately each one has its limitations. I just feel tired all the time and panicked.

Pros of leaving my job are that I can focus on my health 100%. This time around, I know not to rush things and how to completely focus instead of having one foot in the future and one in the past. Getting rest would be great.

Cons are I'd blow through my savings, and with a recession looming, might not be able to find another job when I need money. Also, I'd have to start paying for my own health insurance again and potential therapy bills. I guess also, there's a self-esteem issue in being unemployed again, which could send me in a downward spiral. 

I've been working here for almost year, and I'd like to have at least a year here so I can get back into the labor force if I need to. However, dragging out these issues doesn't seem wise since I'm really not the most productive worker as a result.

I am in the US, and any thoughts about this are welcome. Thank you.",1679027566.0

My head is going crazy because i can't think of anything else other than how bad things would turn out, how miserable i am , how sore my body is, how badly i want to hurt myself .

468,i'm never gonna be loved by anyone... and i think that's okay,2,11tgu7b,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11tgu7b/im_never_gonna_be_loved_by_anyone_and_i_think/,1,"for a long time, all i wanted is to be loved by other people, but as a depressed individual, it's been kinda impossible to believe anyone will ever love me. and i don't even mean it exclusively in the romantic sense (how does a first kiss feel? i don't even know), but in the platonic sense too.

i don't even think i'm physically unattractive, but i do know my personality is unattractive, which is somehow *worse*. with this i am not saying i am worthy of love, i mean that my goals in life and my way of being is not what it's expected of people nowadays. i have weird and extremely niche interests, i am weird and my only purpose in life is to collect the biggest spectrum of unique experiencies; definitely not the kind of people that attracts other people in this world (i mean ambitious people with dreams of financial gains, charismatic people, etcetera). 

don't get me wrong, i love my weird quirky self, but so far nobody has ever loved my weird quirky self lol. i know there's *lots* of people in this big and wide planet, but it seems like i don't have the skills to find the people who will like me, the people who will form groups with me, the people who will desire me in a romantic way. and considering my age, i feel like it's too late to find those skills, the skills of making deep, meaningful, reciprocal connections with other people.

but i think that's okay. somehow, getting rid of the desire to form connections with others has made me happier with those small-talk friendships whom only talk to me about the weather or their job, with those classmates who only talk to me when i awkwardly join the bigger groups at college. maybe thinking that i'm worthy to be loved by other people is me asking too much?

the approach i'm taking now is to love myself. and with ""love"" i mean romantic love; i flirt with myself. i tell myself i'm beautiful, even if i don't recognize that person in the mirror as someone beautiful. i have lots of love buried in my heart, and i always waited to get into a relationship to give this love to someone else. now, i try to give it to my own self. there's days when i really want to die and i can't even get out of bed, and i ask myself ""what would i do if the love of my life felt like this?"" and i realize that i would support her; i would do everything to get her out of bed, help her bath and make some food for her. so i get out of bed, i bathe myself and make myself some food. 

there's some days when loneliness hurts, though. i always see stories of the beauty of romantic love, of touching the lips of the person you would die for, feeling that person's chest and not caring if the world ends, as long as you're on their arms. stories of the joy of hanging out with like-minded people, and just being up at 4am enjoying each other's presence and looking at the stars together. these are experiences i will never live, and it hurts. and it makes me feel like this whole philosophy i just described in this post is just a dangerous coping mechanism.

but what would i do if the love of my life felt like this? i would hug them and tell them that it's gonna be okay. so i just tell myself that i'm gonna be okay.

i’m really struggling with letting myself be hurt, & be angry, & take care of myself. all throughout high school i hid my depression from my parents until i couldn’t, & even after seeing a psychiatrist & regular therapy sessions tried to handle everything by myself. i don’t think my parents truly understand how dark my entire adolescent life has been, because i’ve never really expressed it to that extent. i was scared i would scare them, but in the process ended up harming myself in ways i’m still paying for now. i did excellent at school, got straight As & A*s, even graduated valedictorian. i’m dealing with a lot of anger now about how callously school staff treated me but how quick they were to celebrate my academic achievements. 

i’m in university now, & this breakdown came at the beginning of my second semester. i feel so terrible for not getting better quicker, & not ‘snapping out of it’. i feel like i’m wasting my life away, even though i know logically & emotionally that i couldn’t just keep holding on & going about life, handling things alone in that way. i’ve been going to therapy so much lately, i have called my dad, my friends & just cried on the phone, for hours. i feel like i’m failing my parents, like i’m wasting their money & letting them down by being so distraught about this.

Back then i believed the virus wouldn’t stay in my body forever so I moved on. I started talking to someone else who is my current boyfriend right now. I didn’t think about this shit cause I thought my body could clear it. When we got into a relationship all of the sudden Ive been keeping thinking about this and I finally told him what I went through last year. I assume myself always contagious bc theres no way to tell the virus is gone. I wanted to tell him so he could decide if he wanted to stay with me or not as i didn’t want to waste our time.. he still wanna be with me and decide to get the vaccine soon. Everybody knows its not 100% effective and my bf doesn’t know much about this so probably this is why he still wanna stay with me.. my health anxiety is getting worse lately. I can’t work or study or enjoy my life. I used to be a good student who always got a good grade in class. now i’m almost failing the class butI’m trying my best every single day. I’m worrying i will get cancer one day. I live in fear, wake up with anxiety. I can’t tell anyone about this. I can't keep telling my boyfriend what I'm struggling with since he can't always understand how hard it is, and of course, you don't want to be with someone who keeps being negative and has an STD while there are a lot of fish in the ocean .i feel i’m worthless, he still likes me a lot but i feel i don’t deserve him. I had a thought that i didn’t want to live anymore. Whenever I looked at my mom, I felt myself so awful. She gave me a good life but I ruined it just because I had sex with someone who abused and harassed me? I hate how stupid I was. I’m depressed, tired, struggling with my life right now. I want to live a normal life, have worry free, finish college degree and have a job like normal people. I still have lots of places that i wanna travel to. This shit hurt and ruin my life completely. I’m going to see a therapist next week :)",1679020753.0

I've been under consistent psychiatric and counseling care since mid 2020 as a result of being in and out of treatment programs for my eating disorder (that by the way, I'm not actively using behaviors but my thoughts are consistent with ED). 

The feeling I have now, it's like nothing I've felt before. It's been here for a while, at this intensity. I have this strong disillusionment for everything around me. I've lost all hope really, there's nothing in this world that sticks out to me as worth anything to be enticing. I only leave the house on weekends for my job. I'm taking time off from college after not being able to get out of bed after transferring (stupidly, I was less than a full semester's worth of classes away from my original degree). I transferred so I could be happy after having issues at my previous college and it being laced with memories of my active eating disorder. I switched my original major after a professor told me that she didn't think I was that passionate about music as I originally thought I was. It ruined everything for me, and at a small college, I had no other option in voice teacher. 

I was going to a new music program after that being my true passion. I didn't make any friends last semester. I have no friends now besides my husband. We got married last summer. In a way, he was the only way out from the claws of my narcissistic mother. I still don't know how to drive and didn't have a job until college. I went NC with her last year. 

I stay at home day and I do nothing. I know I have promise but it's pointless. Everything is. I feel so worthless and I just know that everything I've ever promised to myself was pointless. 

I don't feel like I can connect to any other human in my life. I don't feel like I even connect to anyone else. I seriously think that something is wrong with me and that also causes me a large amount of distress. I know that I'm different. I know that I always have been and I know my brain isn't like everyone else's. 

I now pretty consistently get high or drunk whenever I want to self harm, or whenever I don't want to feel anything. I don't do it every day, couple times a week, but I know it may be maladaptive. It's of concern. My therapist thinks I may have PMDD too which doesn't help anything. I'm too scared to see a GYN because of past trauma, and I can't really take any SSRI. 

I've been thinking a lot of psych wards. I know they aren't great, but I feel like I need a break away from everything, including my husband. But I have deadly food allergies and I've heard and read stories of so many people not getting the right food, only food that would hurt them and then I'd have to not eat to protect myself, but when I stop eating, I'll stop eating myself into a relapse. I even was exposed to my allergens at a residential ED facility after my dietician told me I had nothing to worry about, to alleviate some fears around eating. 

So, a psych ward could do more harm than good. These are very much passive thoughts, but I'm afraid of escalation. 

I don't know what I want. I'm high right now, so this didn't make any sense I'm sure. I know I'm smarter than the grammar I utilized above, so please believe me on that, my intelligence is the only thing I have some faith in (but even then, I think that maybe I'm not as truly smart as I think I am and am only lying to myself and in real actuality, I'm actually not. It would be the end of me.) Advice would be nice. I know I need to get out of the house, but my husband is at work all day, I can't drive, no public transportation, can't afford rideshare, an intense fear of strangers. I'm also scared to leave my house sometimes now. 

Whatever you say, please don't be a dick. I'm sorry it's long and there's no TLDR, but at least I used paragraphs to break it up.",1679018993.0

I have fucking lost everything I have ever worked for because I'm too fucking retarded to not have a mental break down when I leave my house. And that has now gotten me till I'll either be in jail for back child support or homeless come April 1st. 

I took care of my grandfather for years. I lived with him after his stroke to feed him and make sure he got a shower and stuff. In his last weeks alive he suffered so much, he was in pain and he fell. I told my uncle 'his on paper care taker' and he said it was nothing. Fast forward a week and grandpa is falling out is chair and cant say a complete sentence. I call 911 daily but my uncle keeps saying he doesn't need to go to the hospital. Well grandpa finally went after I threatened to fist fight every one there and long behold, grandpa had sepsis when he went to the hospital and was dead 12 hours later.

I still lived there for about a month after grandpa died and then I got kicked out.

I found a place to live with my mom on the tail end of her getting evicted. So now I'm going to be living out my car, or in jail and lose my car. 

Imagine having agoraphobia with out a house...

They shut my power off today. It's $379.99 to get it turned back on.... until the 22nd, I don't have that kind of money for a week of power. I don't want to spend that and I'm not asking for anything towards that.

I have about a week until court for being behind in child support. If I make it that long I'll be away for a while.

My best friend is going through his 3rd round of stomach cancer surgery because there has been a leak everytime and he has developed sepsis twice now.

My cars battery is dead and I cant charge it with out electricity.

I've not fucking slept in 4 days...

Itll be real fun when I get out of jail and find out my car and everything in it has been impounded. I'll get out with nothing.

There will always be new animal species to learn about that seem like a science fiction creation, and there will always be mythological creatures that haunt us. There will always be new experiments and things to ponder. There will always be philosophical questions that were solved time and again. 


There will always be new people to meet and things to talk about. Some people will always disagree with you. It's important to find virtue in the people who you consider to be horrible. Earth doesn't care about economics and boundary lines, laws or morals. We're all in the same life boat.

Due to being on a different wavelength than most of the world I find it incredibly difficult to even find a worthwhile conversation, let alone love. As such, my circle has always been a tiny one, but now it has shrunken down to nothingness.

July 4th, 2020 is a date I'll always remember. It is the day the last bit of my love died, my cat died from stomach cancer in my arms as I slept. For 20 years she was my best friend because I can't make connections with humans. She was also all I had left, all my meaningful family had died, a girl I thought I had a future with died, hell even the ex-girlfriends I still was friendly with that I loved at one point and fell out of love with...dead. My cat was the only bit of love and happiness I had in the world, and now it has been years since she has been gone as well.

My life is thoroughly empty and devoid of incoming and outgoing love. All I have is the vain hope of one day meeting someone who I can love, but I'm becoming increasingly miserable and difficult to love as I continue a miserable empty existence. 

I'm very independent and capable of providing most things for myself, but loving someone else is external and not something I can simply do myself. 

I wish I didn't have the craving for love. I could be completely content with my quiet life of playing video games if I had just one person I could truly, deeply care about.

I’ve been with my gf for 8 years and we’re in our late 20s. I’m not sure if we’re not asking the right people but she’s never been able to get any sort of diagnosis or meaningful help with her mental health. From a healthy amount of google and self-diagnosis, she seems to have OCD (she’s had this since her teens) and in more recent years, depression. She was on medication about 2 years ago which she stuck with for maybe 1 year but then stopped as it didn’t seem to be helping. Despite this, she is able to function well at a job within the emergency services where she frequently comes across death and other traumatising scenarios. She does this partially for a love of helping people and is adamant that she does not want to look at less difficult / depressing jobs (just to address one possible response). She does however bring huge amounts of emotional baggage home with her which I don’t think helps.

She went to them 6 months ago saying that she needs help with her mental health and the response was essentially that the system is too full. Over the past year, she’s spiralled significantly to the extent of drinking / vaping heavily, talking about her indifference towards living (including active self harming) and just generally struggling to get through day to day. I used to think (probably naively) that with the medication / my support, she would be ok but that evidently is no longer sufficient.

If anybody can steer me towards useful avenues to get help (private or public, at this point the money doesn’t matter if something will help) then that would be huge. Unfortunately she’s tried various therapists in previous years which were all unsuccessful and now almost has a mentality that she cannot be helped which is demoralising her even more.

If you’ve got to the end of that then I can’t thank you enough. I genuinely don’t know what to do at this point and I’m terrified that this spiral will end in her trying to end it.",1679003170.0

So why should'nt we all fucking get it, humanity will die but, the earth and nature will bounce back even if the world we know would be destroyed. I hate, this world, i hate where i am no matter where it is and most of all i hate myself for everything that i am. theres no escape from this i have nothiing to gain its all meaningless and i have to march through it everyday for no reason and it will never end until i die which could be decades away as my existence gets more and more unbearable unless i kms which won't fucking happen of course. My life is'nt even bad but, the person that occupied it very much is, as shitty as they get. My bitterness and hatred for myself and the world around is one the biggest culprits. Ive gotten to the point of hating myself where I hate everyone who does'nt hate me because in my book they are almost just as bad.

&#x200B;

I just hate everyfuckingthingandimsofuckingSick of it and i cant stand but i have to go through despite nothing ever changing or being accomplished. 

&#x200B;

Ive lost all motiviation all the things Ive wanted to do or make can be done better by someone else and now AI. which all take all the jobs in the area I want and make it impossible for me to obtain a job after college. I will be washing dishes my whole life and my degree and everything i have worked for so far and for the next two years will be worthless just like i am. its my own fault for ever having the ego to think i could be worth more than the shit on the floor no one bothered to fucking throw away because it just was not worth the effort. 

&#x200B;

the computers the AI will replace everything, anything that makes us human art, literature, drawings, human creativity of all kinds has been devalued out of existance there is not point of pursuiting anything because the things that made us happy and human are now nothing and we will all be consumed into the void with no escape in site, either that or we will be vaporized by nuclear warfare as if it even fucking matters anymore how we fade away from this sad stupid existance. 

&#x200B;

Nobody seems to see it, not one person ive met or seen seems to see what is going to happen everyone is just going through it as if they are not about to be replaced as if not every single person except the very wealthy will be replaced. in the old days they wanted many children not just becasue many would die to disease but, they needed a growing workforce to keep the engine of society running. Now that is gone eventually robotots, AI models, computers, drones, kiosks and all will replace those jobs and then the everyone will no longer be necessary or important. they will remove us in some way, in the best case by making sure we dont reproduce slowly depopulating us or in the more likely case finding someway to remove us in a more forceful manner. it wont  happen today tommorow or even very soon but, i believe before the end of the century or even by the 2050s.

&#x200B;

the is no more point in continueing if i no for certain the world i will continue into will be worse than the one i already hate living in and i cant change i never will be able too nobody can no matter how nieeve of a person they are they cant change it. It was'nt any better in the past it never really was we just got good at hiding it. because it was never the physical pain of living outside needing to survie not having electricity, dying of disease, no clean water, no comfy first world life. no not in my diluded eyes, it was the pointless the void, the fact that the pain that is inflicted upon us that we are forced to endure no matter how miniscule first world problems they may be or man made horrors beyond comprehenion. we experience these for no reason, nothing, one day we will die, and maybe there might be some fun things along the way to hide the truths but ultimately the end will be same.

&#x200B;

unlucky for me i find little to no joy in anything anymore my mind is dull and slow and foggy except for void that will consume me completely one day with no hope of chainging it. maybe the fog is what prevents me from seeing what THEY see but, i feel that i this may not be the case. I just wish it would consume me faster or relieve itself and let me see what they see again but, neither will happen.

I dont see anything in the furture anymore just foggyiness, nothingness, dread and fear at I will be forced to deal with despite having no energy or motivation to do so even thought they may not be bad things really in the grand scheme of things. My life is'nt bad i live a first world lifestyle things have been handed to me and ive never had to struggle in the way others have, never had anything horrible or painful happen to me. I am just simply weak even with life on the easiest setting imaginable i still struggle and fail at almost everything and manage to be completely and utterly incompetent, i will never i acheive anything, past highschool i have made no freinds and i most likely will reamain that way, im almost certaintly never getting a love interst, or girlfreind or whateever, im never going to create any of the things i have wanted to, nobody really likes although nobody truly hates me either, i will never have anything to add and I have no excuse for any of it.

&#x200B;

I cant stand this fucking shit anymore everyday it gets worse and worse, everytime i hope it will get better. I try to better myself everyday, i go the gym, i try to eat healthy elminating foods, i drink as much water as i feasibly can but, im constantly fucking thirsty, i take cold showers, i take supplements, i go to a phsych/therapist, i take medications. None make a difference, not longer than a few months anyways. and it just gets worse today my lower back and testicles hurt so fucking bad but, i can tell no one and there is nothing that can be done to solve it and even if there was why? one problem medical or physical, or life, or the car, or the computer or whatever the fuck problems just run into more problemss wo why even bother solving them. 

&#x200B;

We are going nowhere i dont understand where anything is going its just moving but, for what why i cant rap my head around because, in the end its just a question nobody has an answerer and not without a lack of trying. but, everyone else has distracted themselves with other things and moved on wither their life. But i cant, i dont think that i can, the dread, the emptieness, the hopelessness, the no will to do anything, the lack of joy, the lack of anything human and the lonliness of it all. I will be forced to go through it time and time again for nothing and no reason at all i hope the hand of god comes down wipese me off the face the earth as if that would ever happen.

But, it would happen if i ever found a way out of everything than that would be the day the world ends becasue thats how it alwasys fucking goes so why even try. I want to do it so bad i loathe those whome care because they make it so that i cant do it and the door will reamin locked keeping me in my chamber.

I suffer from major depressive disorder with psychotic symptoms, plus ADD somewhat and I warned him about that. He didn't care about that. Which made me feel good. But I kind of sabotaged our friendship. Feelings were involved, but he's married with children, so of course can't really give me much time, while I currently have no job, so have nothing to really focus on right now. I'm married too, which makes me a horrible person. I got depressed and needy, and I divulged too much and ended up texting him all the time, like throughout the day too, cuz idk, he would read them eventually anyway.

So in 2020 I suffered a lot from depression and anxiety. The situation was a bit different then though. I broke up with my boyfriend and was alone, without work. Already then, I wanted to cut myself (I never understood why people wanted to do that...) but I was too afraid of sharp things (phobia). And I wanted to die.

I started therapy and freelancing. I was suecessfull. I gained quite a lot of clients and everything was fine until two weeks ago or something like that.

While being burnt out and at my wit's end, I jumped right into a warehouse job just a couple of weeks afterwards. I was faced with several bullies and I was literally driven out of the place in less than three months. Both of these incidents sent me into a spiral, one resulting in me holding a gun to my head.

Things have gotten marginally better and I've gotten a job working in a home improvement retailer. I thought things were great until these past few days. After three days of online training, aka staring at a screen for the entirety of my shifts, I've been told to work with a 'mentor' on the salesfloor to get hands-on experience. No one has been around to train me, and the times they’ve been around, they conveniently disappear after sending me away with a menial task, leaving me to wander around not knowing what the heck I'm doing. 

Today, the guy in charge of hiring and basic HR duties expected me to go out, while not knowing anyone or their names, and track down a trainer myself. I found no one. Saturday is my first real day and nobody has shown me anything. I don't even know how to get into the building since I'll be going in before opening time. 

Due to my poor mental health I've viewed this job as a last chance. I burned my bridges at my two previous jobs and I refuse to go to other places knowing that I'll be faced with another bully situation which will harm me significantly. I have been doubting my ability to work without going into a spiral each and every time I start a new job.

Frankly, I'm terrified. 

I plan on seeking out the overall store manager, a really nice guy, and explaining to him that everyone has been passing the buck on getting me trained in-person, and I've got no clue as to what's going on or what I'm doing. But I keep thinking about the likelihood of having to quit due to this unprofessionalism and then not knowing where to go or what to do for work. I'm kind of lost right now and between all the other impossibilities of this 'American Dream'… I'm not seeing much hope to be had.

I'll never own a home. Rent is impossible to afford. Retirement is some kind of sick joke… the list goes on. This work nonsense is so small but it feels like this is it for me and I'm already on a path towards this last shot going up in flames.

I just want someone to hear this. People have told me, to my face, that I'm lazy and incompetent and weak for all these feelings. It's getting harder and harder to maintain the will to go on.

I'm 21, I have ASD, social anxiety, insomnia, and **probably passive suicidal depression**. I say probably because I haven't been diagnosed or spoken about it with anyone, this is the first time. If I had to choose a few words to describe how I feel day-to-day, They would be grief, loss, regret, and apathy.

My dad was a deeply religious man, something that conflicted with my beliefs at the time, and because of this, I had become a little estranged. He also moved away and so I didn't get to see him as often. On my birthday, September 17th 2021, he tried to phone me. I didn't answer and let It go to voicemail. He sounded sad, alone, and depressed. Despite that, I still didn't call back. 

My dad died on October 3rd 2021, It was sudden and not expected, he was 64. I pray that nobody feels what I felt that day. I cannot express the gravity of the grief, pain, loss, regret, anger and hatred I felt. Words can't describe It... And It's even stronger now.

In 2022 my mum was walking to work when she collapsed and suffered a stroke. She had to give up work, something that she loved. Since then I've slowly watched her depression get worse and worse. She struggles to do everyday activities due to what happened.

These past few years the only memory I have Is grief. I lost my Parrot George suddenly, my cat Milo, my dog Jenna, and then my dad.

I feel empty, incredibly empty...

The truth Is, If I were to go to sleep and never wake up, I simply wouldn't care. I don't necessarily hope It happens, I just wouldn't care If it did. I'm going to seek help for it because I think I might have passive suicidal depression. I simply don't care about anything anymore. I've gone months without a shower, brushing my teeth, and years without leaving my home unless I have to.

My question Is how do I tell my family? I would tell my mum, and perhaps I should, but I fear part of the reason her stroke happened was due to the stress of grief she has felt, she has lost more than I have in recent years, and I'm scared that hearing how I feel about life will upset her greatly. 

What do I do? I know I need to speak with someone before It gets worse.",1679014934.0

540,My Life thus far,1,11tatbr,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11tatbr/my_life_thus_far/,0,"My life thus far.

Today I wanted to create a post about my life thus far, in hopes that someone may be able to read and learn something from my life, I also wanted to reach out and make this post in hopes that I might find some answers myself, warning this is going to be a long post. do I know what the point of this post is? no probably not, only what I have stated before.

I was born in a small town, at the time of my birth my parents separated, my mother raised me and my 2 older brothers, when I was 4 years of age, my mother married a man who had 4 sons, so I was the youngest of 7 brothers, growing up in a blended family was not always easy, my parents scraped everything they had to raise us. I would say I had a somewhat normal child hood. at the time of 2 grade, was placed in class with a teacher who was about to retire, she scared me as a child because she would always yelling at the class and had a hard time keeping her temper in check as I've matured I could see the reasons of why she was this way, as a child tho I did not understand. my mother would drop me off at school and I would walk home because I was terrified of this teacher, the days I managed to make it to class, I would have my head buried in my arms with tears rolling down my face, I believe I was and am a highly sensitive individual, for what ever reason I had a very hard time with being in groups of people, my mother for a time thought that I may be autistic. when I reached the 3rd grade I was so far behind that the School staff decided to put me in a special ed class, this made my mother very angry because she knew I was smart enough to be in the normal classes and they did this with out her permission. eventually my mother just had the principle hold me back. so I ended up repeating the 3rd grade. I passed and move on through school, I obviously had a hard time in school but I graduated, through out high school I worked as a yard care worker, some days consisted of up to 14 hours of work in the sun and up to 100 lawns a week, I worked very hard and learned a lot from it all, about 3 years before my high school graduation my mother and step dad were having marriage problems, my mother had save a lot of money secretly and bought a very base and old home for 60k the house had a good property and a decent size shop. that is how I went into the lawn care business because my next door neighbor own a lawn care business and offered me a job. The reason my mother bought this house was because she didn't want to raise her children around my step fathers kids, at the time they were in trouble doing drugs, having the cops come over and being arrested, I did not understand sex at the age of 5 but I would see it in our own home from my step brothers. so after some years my mother bought this house we packed our things and we moved into the new home. the house required a lot of work luckily we had good neighbors who gave of their time and were able to help us, I remember heating up the floor and ripping up the linoleum with a flat scraper, the house also had termite damage which was cut out and redone. at this time I was exposed to pornagraghy, there was a box in the old shop, I just saw the cover of it, at the time I did not understand this and it honesty confused me. was raised in a christian family. I ended up having pretty bad addiction to it. and as a teenager felt like was an absolute loser and was not worthy of anything because I felt guilt, but to me it was an escape from the real world, and an scape from pain. eventually I came to the conclusion that I needed help so I got help and stopped, at this time I was older about 19 years of age and graduated from high school, my mother really pushed and encouraged me that I should serve a LDS mission, I told her at the time that I felt I wasn't ready to serve and that I needed more time. I ended up giving my 2 weeks notice to the lawn business and for the next 6 months I studied, and read just about everything I could find out about God and his plan. at this time I also would fast every day until dinner and walk 2 hours every morning at about 5 am. I ended up losing about 65 pounds in 3 months. i felt pretty confident about myself for the first time. I put my papers in to serve a mission, I was called to serve in Brisbane Australia, I was excited to go because who wouldn't want to go to Australia. funny part is that when I was young everyone asked me where I would like to go, and I said I would like to go to Australia. so the time came where I was dropped off at the MTC I said my good byes and grabbed my suitcase my mother did not want to let go of me I told her if you do not let go I am not going. I walked away with my suite cases, and for the next 2 years I served as a missionary, the first 3 months were the hardest months of my life, I reached point were I was very depressed, and became suicidal, I had the hardest time constantly being around people all day, I was very introverted and each day was very mentally challenging. I had the opportunity to serve, teach and baptized people, I lived with people from all walks of life. I served as a district leader, trainer, and zone leader, I also served in the Tongan and samoan branches of Logan Australia. I believe my mission was the hardest thing I have ever experienced. everyday was hard. I ended up finishing my mission after 2 years. I came back home and was hired as a guns smith assembling firearms I did this for about 2 years at that time I was marred in the temple, about 2 years in I ended up having a pretty bad mental break down I lost my job, fell into my old poor habits, I needed help. my wife ended up divorcing me. The divorce was not all bad, I wanted her to be happy and if it meant leaving me and pursuing her dreams I was ok with it, I have no ill will towards her, I was just really struggling at the time and needed help. she wanted me to go to counseling but only with her therapist that she had been seeing for 4 years prior. so I did, the therapist basically told me that if I didn't let her go then that means I didn't truly love her. he also stated how he didn't understand how I wasn't dead? this confused me and made me even more depressed, I go out on a limb to get help and then I get a divorce and a therapist tells me that he doesn't understand why I'm not dead. after the divorce I was fortunate to move back in to my mothers home I feel completely embarrassed at the time. Jobless for the next six months. This is at the time of around Covid. I ended up meeting up with a girl I knew of from high school, my intentions were as follows, I fully intended on loving her. we dated for awhile, she kept wanting sex from me but I said I don't think we should go that fast. one thing led to another and we were having sex, yes I know, a stupid mistake, I was already depressed and after everything with the divorce, I figured it wouldn't matter, I had no job and my days consisted of just waking up when I wanted and skateboarding. skateboarding meant the world to me it was the only way I felt like I could express myself with out having to talk, it also cleared my mind. well I dated this girl, and I wanted to be more serious, she ended up breaking up with me and stated that she didn't want to be with me, it seems I opened my heart to fast. so there I was again depressed and broke. going absolutely no where, and upsetting God. a couple months later I had a high school friend who offered me a job as a mine operator, you know like driving the trucks that are the size of a small house. I took the offer immediately I was given the job and for the next year and half I drove haul trucks, I drove everything from 793 Cat C, D, and F models to Komotsu 830E ac, DC, and -5 haul trucks, for 12 hour shifts. both night and day shifts. I learned a lot and progressed as a heavy equipment operator, I was also made a trainer. I ended up rented with my high school friend and his brother. it had been a couple years since I had seen him so it was nice to catch up and also nice to have a job, and place. Things were going pretty well. Then we had a bunch of new hires that came to the mine. I ended up meeting a girl, she was 1 year older than me. I felt like she really understood me we talked a lot, and dated. things were getting pretty serious and we were having sex. I know, a lot of you may be thinking really man? have you not learned anything about being a christian you were a missionary for crying out loud. I don't know what it was but I was standing in the shower with her one night looking into her eyes and I felt so connected to her as a person, her spirit, her soul, its as if I could see the pain she had been carrying in her eyes, a longing for peace, everything about her I loved, she was absolutely beautiful, she had green and blue in her eyes, but it wasn't just her looks she had a soft voice and her personality was very tender, and I can honestly say I don't think I will love anyone more than her, I felt like she was the person I was suppose to meet. she was obviously not a christian, and I know her upbringing was full of abuse. but that didn't change my love for her, like the first few versus of the song by Eminem “when I'm gone”. I am sad to say this but it didn't work out with her, once I told her how I felt about her she freaked out and said she never wanted to be with me, this broke my heart completely, at this point I had never felt this heart broken in my entire life, she was also with another guy at the time. and to make things worse she got with my friend who I was living with. so there I was sitting on a couch in my payed for rented apartment watching her sitting and cuddling with my friend. I felt absolutely betrayed, and depressed, but they didn't care. that was the moment I felt my heart being ripped out of my chest. this is the time I started to realize I was not in the right place in my life. my friends were alcoholics and were always partying and getting drunk, they were also making poor financial decisions, but nothing came even close to the feeling I had, I felt completely betrayed, there were many days I thought about driving out to the desert with my pistol and just ending it all, why would it matter I thought I've already screwed up so many things. the days at the mine were so hard after that. because we had to ride in the vans together and she was in there with me and everyday I had to see her face as she walked into the line out room. she would notice me looking at her and she would quickly glance down looking at the floor, she would sit behind me and I could hear everything she was saying, some days I would be dropped off at my assigned truck for the day and as I was doing my walk around I would go to the back wheels lean in close next to the rear dog house door so no one could see me and burst into tears, I would let it all out. somewhat gather myself together and wipe my eyes put my safety glasses on and pretend like nothing happened. as far as anyone knows I'm fine and I'm here to work. she was always coming over to the house laying on my friends. there came a time when I said enough was enough and I told her to stop coming to the house, because it was my personal space and she was invading. I am not into drinking nor have I ever been I've never struggled with it. sometimes on Fridays we would go to a casino and get drinks I of course would not drink. she came with all of us one time and I noticed that she was brought a drink, I notice that she didn't drink it around me. idk why? maybe I had some form of influence over her life, but I notice she was uncomfortable and did not want to drink in front of me. time passed and I slowly buried my feelings for her. as stupid as it sounds yes I still love her and will always love her. perhaps I am fool for doing so, but part of me wanted to take her pain away what ever it was that caused her to be this way. I reached a point where I knew I needed to leave the mine and work on myself. I needed to surround myself with people who wanted the best for me people I could trust. so I save up 11k as window for my great escape. at this time I met another woman who I dated for about 3 months It didn't last long because she left me for another soon to be professor. at that point that was nothing more than a pin prick compared to the pain I felt at the mine. one day I called in sick at the mine packed up my stuff which wasn't much because I. am a minimalist, went next door down made things right with he land lords and left. yes I know quitting on the spot was not the right thing to do. but I know I was headed down a bad road if I would of stayed, call me crazy but but I know for a fact that who you spend your time with is who you become, it's only a matter of time. this is not to say I didn't have good and memorable times at the mine, with I money I made I was able to buy a dream car of mine as well as a new truck, I was able to meet a lot of different people who I trained and learned from. but as time progressed my mental health worsened. so I took a risk and left the mine most people would consider me complete fool and at times i have thought so myself, like why would I leave such a high paying job with every other week off? I moved back home with mom. and as of now I am looking for a job near my home, I do what I can to help out where needed, it has taken everything in my heart to forgive my friends and the girl from the mine. I really thought things were gonna work out, just like the other 3 but it didn't, I have tried my very best to move on but I still have dreams about her and the mine. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't even know who I am anymore. the quote from the movie “joker” I felt like sums up my life so far, “nothing can hurt me anymore” yes it is true I made poor choices and had to pay for the choices. and its hard for me to accept that loving another person does not mean they will love you back. I often look at my life so far and wonder what does all this mean? I guess we just have to be thank for the experience even if it doesn't turn out the way we want. asking me if I'm sad is an understatement. I feel like I lost everything, and now I'm unemployed, am in debt a truck. I'm hoping to get a job more south somewhere warm, I think the sun will help my mental health. I have been applying everywhere I can, selling things on eBay just to stay afloat. because I obviously do not want to lose my truck and I have an amazing credit score. One of my good friends from high school offered me a position to work with him on his Door business, it should help me until I find my were my next place in life is. I have recently been going back to church and doing the best I can in life. everyday I have to remind myself that this is just temporary and life will move on. sometimes I wish god could just tell me what to do and how to do it, I feel like I am a race horse with blinders on I don't know what I'm doing in my life. and ever since that last 7 years of ups and downs I feel numb, uninspired and a complete loss of hope. Please understand that I know there are people in this world who have been through so much, my trials are nothing but a drop in the ocean in comparison to theirs. I do pray and I pray for them, and I pray that God has forgiven me for my mess-ups. Up to this point I honestly don't know how to feel about things, I guess the only thing I can do is keep moving forward, helping those around me to do so as well.",1679011236.0

What did i get? Being forgotten unless they need something or im the only person available. The reserve wheel's reserve. No one ever reaching out, my plans to hang out always go down the toilet, never invited anywhere. I do 98% of the effort, only to receve back 2% at best.

I used to never cry. Partly because it was embarrassing, and partly because I just never felt the need. Now I do it often. A few times a week out of nowhere. 

I think these are some of the reasons. I live with my grandma. I have no friends. I’m overweight and borderline obese. I struggle to date because of my weight and physical features. I’m a ginger and I’ve been treated differently my entire life because of that. My life basically consists of being addicted to and binge eating fast food, working, paying bills, hating my job, trying to lose weight and succeeding for a month at the most and then falling back down into the same hole as before. 

I had an amazing friend group of intelligent people with good morals and goals, whom I pushed away because of shitty choices I made. I think I hated myself and my life so much, that I treated those who loved me like shit, and it resulted in losing everyone who was good to me. My best friend since high-school doesn’t want anything to do with me and refuses to hear my apologies. I’ve completely destroyed every meaningful relationship except for my parents. 

I’m trying to change. To treat those close to me with respect and just be a better and more humble person. But I feel like I’m suffocating. I’m lonely. I hate myself. Nobody knows or cares how I feel. 

I often text the suicide hotline just to have someone to talk to. I don’t want to die. I just want relief. I want friends. I want people who share my interests to talk to and have deep conversations with. I want to have people over and cook for them.

I guess I'm looking to be comforted, heard and to see if anyone else out there has felt the same and did you get through? Both my siblings are non verbal and very disabled, to put a fine point on it my mother walked my brother in a harness because he couldn't understand not to run out in traffic or run off etc. He appeared normal to look at so you can probably imagine the immediate judgement cast upon my mum out in public and this is just a snippet of our daily lives. Growing up I couldn't even contemplate being a mother, like a knee jerk reaction to the thought of raising people like my siblings, I just couldn't hold the thought in my head for even a second, let alone allow the thought to enter into my head 'what if my children weren't disabled', the process never went that far. Fast fwd about 20 years I have a loving marriage and roughly 5 years ago we decided it was time to try. Bravely we tried naturally to no avail and I have since become steadfast in wanting to use donor eggs. What hurts me is the realisation that I've honestly never ever been able to think about or embrace the idea of motherhood as I feel so many other women get to. I never allowed myself to try and picture maybe our children would be ok, what a great father my husband will definitely be n how much I'd enjoy motherhood myself. I've realised how much I've had to hold my breathe and look away from the subject more or less my entire life. Its been a struggle, also convincing my husband to use donor eggs, we're still in the very early stages of this. I feel guilty saying this because I don't feel I could ever say it to him but I feel even approaching having children the natural way with me was a cruel expectation, how could someone have expected that of me? But then I remind myself it was me who grew up with the kid in the harness, the one who bashed his own head on concrete stairs, who I've never had one conversation with. He didn't grow up with that, I did. What's worse is my parents seperated and perhaps unsurprisingly my mum became a full blown junkie. I became estranged from my father and his side of the family after an argument when I explained we were going to try for kids soon. My parents, who are most knowledgeable on my situation have outright abandoned me. I'm furious with my father in particular it is surrounding the idea of me starting my family, there was no discussion about donor eggs or IVF he just ran like a coward and frankly I feel like this is when I needed my family's support the most. I can never forgive him for being such a hurtful coward. I pray to God we can start our family, I know it will heal my heart in a tremendous way and it's something we're definitely ready for but I can't help but feel a little ripped off by life, like a basic daydream was never an option for me and there have been huge expectations asked of me with no acknowledgement to how brave I was for even trying in the first place.",1678973705.0

Thanks.


BACKGROUND:___________________
I saw a specialist today as I have experienced symptoms consistent with severe clinical depression for the last 4/5 months, and he said that because I can still experience enjoyment, he doesn’t want to jump to a diagnosis of depression, even though I told him all I could in the time I had and only scratched the surface, which he recognised. 

When I say enjoyment, I mean happiness when my team wins a big game pretty much. This is roughly once a fortnight and very brief, before I snap back to the misery of my reality. It’s like a distraction. It’s the same when I see friends, but a lot of the time when I see friends I wish I could just go home and be alone because socialising/hiding my pain is too tiring.

He said I should see a therapist for 6-8 weeks and see how I’m doing then, but honestly I cannot imagine how someone could reach a much lower point than I have and still be living. 6-8 weeks for me feels like years away, as I cannot see very far into my own future.

Am I right to be upset, or should I just trust the process? I am considering getting a second opinion, as I just don’t think he understands what my every day is like.

I’m not trying to glorify my misery or play into it at all, and I’m not just looking to get some meds, I just want my illness to be taken as seriously as I think it should, because I cannot continue for much longer in this way. I don’t want to be dramatic, but everything I say in this post is just how I feel.

The best way I can explain my frustration is that I believe that if he could live a day in my life, he would understand how severe my situation is.

Motivated by my therapist, to overcome my fear of being alone at home, or anytime.
I started to enjoy my lonely time a lot, diving deep in my thoughts and reframing many things.. my view on relationships, family, my own position and how I present myself and move through life.
Im very into others, I’m moved by others peoples life, struggle and I usually enjoy encouraging people around me finding their power, self value, etc.
I also like private time with close friends to have deep talks about our life.
But!
I end always feeling very unseen, very unheard.. like no one actually puts the same interest, awareness on me.
For example, I met today a good friend of mine, after many months without seeing each other.
I only had some hours to spend with him.
He invited his gf to our dinner..
And i ended up spending the night listening to his gf struggle with her work, and paying for the dinner for my friend and I.
What I do mean by this is:
I wanted to meet my friend and have a nice, intimate dinner so we could catch up properly.
Instead of that I had dinner with him and his gf ( which I just met ) and could not even share anything with him cause his gf was speaking all the time about her career problems.. me acting as the consultant… and encouraging person for her 
I don’t mind to inviting my friend.. ( at all!!) but the moment of paying he actually took a call and I payed for both and he said, oh, I send you now the money.. and then he forgot .
So I gave my energy, my attention to his gf and my money ( also energy ) to him and had not even a nice “ thanks for the dinner” or proper, how are you doing? 
He spend the most time speaking about himself , his trips.. wich I enjoy, but I like to have a back and forth convo.. 
I don’t mind inviting, not problem ever at all, but sometimes people are so unaware of themselves… it hurts.
And I ended up feeling I did not spend the night I wanted with my friend, and listening to someone ( I don’t even know ) problems.

The bullying through much of grade school. The difficulties of making any friends. But at this point there's no reason to. I would just like to die but I still can't do it.

575,How do you get over childhood trauma?,1,11t65a5,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11t65a5/how_do_you_get_over_childhood_trauma/,0," I \[40 M\] have been dealing with social anxiety and depression for most of my life. It first became apparent when at 22 years old I started to experience gastritis and bloating, something that has never gone away. I think that it’s all rooted in my childhood. When I was growing up I lived with my mum and 6 years older brother in the week. My brother was often not very nice to me and would be unpredictable. He would sometimes get angry and shout at me. it might be because I beat him at a game or it might be for no reason at all. I can remember being hyper-vigilant around him. My mum would also get stressed easily and would have outbursts where she would scream loudly in Spanish (she is from Venezuela). This was also scary for me as a child. On the face of it my childhood doesn’t look too bad - my mum and dad were split up but I had regular contact with both of them and there was no physical abuse or anything. But it must be the reason for my anxiety, depression and insomnia. 

I am really struggling at the moment with insomnia and am often only sleeping 3 or 4 hours a night. Does anyone have any advice on how to get better? My sleep has been so bad for so long now that I think I’m going to have to try antidepressant medication again. It was a long time ago that I took it but I feel that citalopram will suit me best. I don’t want anything too sedating as I won’t be able to concentrate properly at my job. I’m not looking forward to the sexual side effects, feeling dull and the eventual withdrawal symptoms. Alternatively I’ve been thinking of trying LSD but I’m not sure that would be a good idea, it might not work and I’ve already got visual snow after taking mushrooms quite a few times a couple of years ago.",1679000466.0

I don’t know if this post will last because of it’s content. I read the rules of this sub but being new on Reddit I really am not sure I’m really respecting them. If not, I’m really sorry.

I (21F) have been fighting depression for a long time now. It all started when I was nine, because of the loss of two of my close family members and the operation of my mom. I started self harm then, and finally stopped thanks to my therapist who I’ve been seeing for the past few years, not counting some pauses. At 15 years old, I fell deep in a depressive state again, for no apparent reason. I got better. Then, everything fell appart again last year. I started to see my therapist, but for a few months now I get the felling that I’m doing worst. I am really doing worst. I avoid going to class a lot, I don’t hand in my assignments anymore, I don’t go out, I’m starting to skip meals or binge eat, I do not sleep or can’t get out of bed.
A few days ago, I cried all day. Usually, I get better afterwards. But the following morning, I felt just as drained. Two days ago, I had an anxiety attack in class. I decided then to talk to my parents, finally. We decided collectively to change therapist, and eventually to seek some type of medication, which I always refused.
Today, I hit rock bottom, I don’t know where to go from there.
(TW : Self harm)
I used to, as a child and until now, pinch/bite my arms and hands, or slap/bang my head against whatever was there. This morning, I noticed my boyfriend (22M) (I spent the night at his house) was freshly shaved. I went to the bathroom after he had gone to class, and took the razor blade and cut myself. I was extremely calm and lucid. I perfectly knew what I was doing. After I was done, I felt nauseous, I almost puked, I was trembling on the floor, my arm was burning. I managed to get up at some point and shower and get dressed before he got home. Since then, I am completely drained, I am desperate, I am lost.

I always hoped to get better. But right now I question any positive thought like I never did before.

I need support, help and advice from people in the same situation.",1678978251.0

578,My dad keeps comparing his self-diagnosed depression to my professionally diagnosed depression.,3,11svpj6,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11svpj6/my_dad_keeps_comparing_his_selfdiagnosed/,1,"I'm a 16 y/o female, and I was professionally diagnosed with severe depression. My parents are divorced, and I live full time with my dad after multiple incidents with my mother, which destroyed our relationship.. not that there was much of one to begin with.

So I live full-time with my dad. He's a conservative, Christian guy, very firm and expressive with his beliefs.

He hasn't been diagnosed with depression or anything, but he says he was and has been depressed since the divorce, and maybe even before. I told him he should get diagnosed, but he said he didn't need to.

He constantly is comparing me to him. For example, he says things like, ""I'm depressed, and I've been brushing my teeth twice a day AND flossing. It's not hard,"" because sometimes I just can't work up the motivation to get up and do it. I'm not saying I never do, it just isn't every single day, twice a day. But it's not just that. He expects me to do all the laundry, minus his own- which means all towels and my siblings' clothes, along with my own (I have no problem washing my own clothes), do the dishes, take care of the animals (two cats and a dog), and cook dinner almost every night. He is constantly calling me lazy.

Recently, I took several autism spectrum tests, and they all said I have a very high chance of being on the spectrum. I discussed those with my therapist, and she recommended going to see a specialist and getting professionally tested, because she agreed that I'm probably somewhere on the spectrum. I told my dad, and showed him the results, and his exact words were, ""You're not r*t*rded enough to he autistic."" Like.. what?? I was shocked. He then went on to say that he used to think he had Asperger syndrome, but then realized he didn't, and that it was just his personality type. He also refuses to believe that I have ADHD, because I'm ""too lazy"" (his words) to have it, because it includes hyperactivity. However, my therapist agrees with me that I have it, and we're working on getting me diagnosed (she also has ADHD, so she keeps forgetting to test me lol.) She said that the depression can often cancel out the hyperactivity, as well as trauma-induced masking.

But yeah. Back to the main topic. I don't know how to deal with him. He makes me feel worse, more useless than I already feel. I haven't been eating properly, and I know that- I just don't feel hungry anymore. My suicidal thoughts are becoming more frequent, to the point where they're almost always on my mind. I've pictured my suicide many times in my head before- imagine different ways that I could do it, what it would look like, how it would feel, etc. I've even planned it out before, but something always ended up happening to prevent it, whether it be a friend talking to me, or realizing nobody would take care of my pets when I'm gone, etc. But I'm scared that eventually, something will happen that will push me over the edge- whether it's my dad putting me down, or a fight with a friend.

I just feel like shit, and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm sleeping more. I'm almost never eating. I'm getting lectured and yelled at and put down all the time. I feel hopeless. Is there any way to get him to understand? I've tried telling him what my therapist says, but he refuses to listen. What do I do??",1678976877.0

TW: trigger warning for most things. Tried to be vague sometimes. Not so vague with others.

If I 24, F could give the air in my lungs, the food in my belly and the clothes on my back to someone who deserves it more than me I would. I don't need it. I don't deserve it. I simply don't deserve it cause I'm not a good enough human being. I've spent my life trying to learn how the human psyche works so I'd have a chance to understand the world around me. Cause it never made sense. I'm autistic and nothing about how anyone acted ever made sense. So I studied, I watched. I learned. I adapted. I survived my surroundings somewhat. My home was never stable. My friends were never stable. Even the stable I went to wasn't stable. (sounds rich but it was free due to me getting exploited but in a good way I guess, I learned alot, but that's a story for another time)

I adapted and blend into society. I became what I was supposed to be although more hot headed and emotional due to nobody realizing I had Autism (diagnosed Asbergers, this was before the terminology changed. I will not use ""high functioning autism"" due to reasons ask me in the comments if you want to know.) and ADHD (diagnosed) due to basic ignorance and maybe pride by my adoptive parents. 

(Also to clarify, in Sweden people don't adopt for money or anything like they could in the US I'm not sure but I've never heard of such a thing happening here and it's actually the opposite, the comments I would get the most would be ""at least you know your parents wanted you"" and other kinds of comments. Adoption in Sweden is seen as ""noble"" and the people adopting are people who couldn't get a baby any other way)

I had become the person my mother had told me in public. I always acted a part. And I felt like I played a part. I have manners, I have the sofisticated upper middle class manners that my mom had told me to have. That society had forced upon me. Nothing about how I acted was natural to me. Still isn't. I know what to say when something bad happens. I know how to be socially acceptable. But I don't think it translated well into adulthood. And I also realized that my mom is the steriotypical narcissist, she manipulates everything. We were usually dirt poor. My mom stole food from her job as a cook at the local prison. I learned to sow my clothes. But we acted like we had more. I was supposed to fill the hole in the picture perfect family. But I couldn't. 

I think this is the baseline for why I can't seem to have any friends. I am apparently really easy to talk to. Everyone loves me in the beginning. When we're still on the getting to know stage. When I break that holy barrier where I can finally show you my real emotions. This is where it all gets messy. Where I loose everyone. But AI don't want to be fake. I don't want to be any of that. I care so much. I'd go to the end of the earth I'd do anything. Exept maybe cook at your place at first cause I'm scared so I'd rather we cook together and you show me what to do and what things I can take cause I'm scared if I do something wrong I'll get hit or screamed at, or someone will go hungry which is the worst feeling cause all I ever feel is guilt. We'll work together to make sure we're both comfortable. 

I still can't seem to keep friends. I don't know what is wrong. Or maybe yes I actually do but I hate the reason. 

I have no self esteem. I have no sense of self worth. I have been treated like gutter trash, several different men of different ages, different decent, different backgrounds have all had their way with me. Have taken my body from me. I stopped feeling like I was human for a while. I felt like a sex toy. I also felt like that was all I deserved. I didn't even stop going on tinder. I didn't even have the energy to tell them to stop raping me anymore. I just escaped into my head. Disassociated myself from my body. Stopped feeling. Now at least most of the pain were gone. Not all but enough that I'd be fine until it's over. 

And my mom. My mom that told me I was abusing her at 11 years old and cried that she ""couldn't possibly tell her coworkers such a horrible thing was happening to her. By her own daughter!"" When in reality the bruise she showed me was from me defending myself cause she would slap me and they would not lock me i my room. But stand in my room and scream and berated me for honestly not an exaggeration sometimes hours. Especially if I managed to be fast enough to lock myself in the bathroom. It was all about who gave in first. And for me it was always an easy win. Cause I was sure I would die if I came out of that bathroom. My mom would push my buttons on perpouse to get me to ""make the first move"" if I touched her. It was game on. She could beat me, hold me down, pin me. Get my dad to throw me into the wall and they would tell me. And this I timed for 15-60min depending on day, how much of an awful person I was. Just scream it to me. Call me every foul name under the sun. And don't be fooled. Ofc they weren't horrible parents.(sarcasm) No the next day they would tell me they loved me and nobody would ever talk about the abuse. It never came up. They never apologized. They to this day have never acknowledged any of that. 

I feel broken. I love everything. The world. It's people. I still can never see humanity as bad cause there is so much out there. People can be amazing. Fantastic. Tear jerkingly amazing. The universe is amazing. I love science, I love technology, I love nature, I love music, I love animals, I live biology, psychology, litterature, art, movies and the fucking world. 

But I want to die... Or rather I feel there is no way out for me. I feel broken. I don't feel like I am good enough for this world I can't even keep my friends. My best friend is taking a break from me cause I'm stressing him out. Most of my other friends have already left me. And I think it's my fault. I can't love myself so I panic over small things. I ask too many questions. I need too much reassuring and I am too much. I'm a liability. Now depression isn't anything new for me I tried to kill myself by drowning for the first time at the age of 11 and I was so frustrated that I couldn't. I've tried so many times since. But I also think I (almost) always half assed it. Guess I can't even do that right, hah. No but seriously. I don't think my heart was ever in it. I think my heart always wanted me to stay. Cause I have so much to love. I have so much love to give. And never anyone to give it to. And I'm so desperately searching for any kind of love, or love's remote cousins. Just anyone to want to spend any time with me. I think I need to learn the real me and become my own independent person before presuing more relationships. But I also don't want to be friendless. 

And my road to overcoming my past of which this is only scratching the surface of the train wreak that is my life. I skipped the child porn and the details and the crazy ex who kidnapped and tried to kill me and more. So I have some work cut out for me. I have had my severe C-PTSD diagnosis for many years at this point. But I've never been able to accept help. And also nobody has been in my corner and tried. So now I feel like a waste of space. A leach. A parasite on today's society. Pest. Cholera. Scum of the earth. 

I need help and I need friends. 


TLDR; My life sucks. I don't want to die but I feel like I don't have any other way out of this hell that is my life, my memories and my emotions.

I am a senior in high school in Canada and I have not felt alive since 2019 I used to be so outgoing and participate in events  and could start conversations with people on my own  and had so many friends were people knew as a nice and kind person that people can talk to  and during grade 8 in 2019 there was this girl that I met that i liked she was so special to me she was the first person I ever liked we met one recess where she was by herself and i asked what was wrong she shared her feelings the details were not important but i felt so great when she shared it to me we started talking and texting and facetiming like every day It was so fun we got to know so much about each other and i fell in Love with her even though we were just friends I told her I liked her she said she liked me but didn't want to date then I said I loved her she probably thought I was an idiot because how could you love someone if they don't even like you back well i did then I found out she liked my friend and this completely crushed me they didnt date but still this completely destroyed broke me she noticed she kept saying sorry and asking for forginvess and wanting to still be friends I accepted but we just argued all the time we were still close but it wasnt the same people during this time called me depressed cause i was sad that this girl didnt like me which was true I was sad even she noticed I even asked her to prom even after everything she said yes but a week before our grad she said no saying she didnt think it was right I should of known she didnt like me i should have enever asked garde 8 ended she left schools we still texted upto grade 11 then we stopped cause she I felt she was forgetting me and she would takes days to respond and even forgot my birthday multiple times and this made me das because at one point she knew me beter then myself it took me from grade 8 to grade 10 to finally get over her I cried myself multiple times to sleep thinking about her well atealst the sad music felt so good to listen to now. Sorry for getting off track , summer of grade 8 was great though I spent it with my friends and we even recorded youtube videos. They never got that many views but making them was an amazing experience that I will always remember. Grade 9 starts and I was scared which was normal but i was so introverted and nervous that I didn't talk to anyone I just assumed people would talk to me this never happened and on top of this I have really low confidence and my friends just started to call me to introverted and awkward which was true but I took it to personally and I let those words define me and sadly this is all I know and I still let it do for me they all made other friends and I was also no longer part of the group chat and parties but I know its my fault cause I distanced myself from them and other people in general but sometimes I tried to talk to people but covid came while I was in grade 9 and this did not help with my social skills I was alone i did the work and got good marks in th 80s but when grade 10 came i chose a bunch of useless courses that I thought were good cause of the youtube gurus in business so i chose them not knowing that they weren't good also grade 10 was also online so I was at home like 90% of the year and my parents wanted me to go outside but i didnt because I was terrified of finding people my age and having to inteact with them grade 11 came and it was in perons i went back and itw as the hardest thing ever cause U ahd spent the last years cheating and did not know that much and on top of that I had nobody to talk to my marks dropped and I hid in washrooms during lunch so i did not have to see other people I went back online for the second semester this was a huge mistake this is when I stared to get stress I would throw things and cut myself hit my head say horrible things to myself because I was tired i would even say Im going to kill myself to my parents My dad would get mad my mom would cry and I did not mean to make her cry or hurt but I still kept saying that and additionally I completely burnet my self out during the end of grade 11 and i am still recovering from it with heavy procrasanting and sterasing for any amount of work. But in the winter of grade 11 I started working at a grocery store were I met this girl and for five months I was so scared to talk to her or approach her but I wanted to cause I felt like we could of had something special and one day during the summer i heard a coworker saying she was going to leave the country  and then got the courage to talk to her so I did and for the entire week before she was going and it was amazing we did have a good connection but i t was to late she left and I was so disappointed I know I fall in love to fast and I know that I am selfish for wanting someone to love me and I can't even imagine someone saying I want you only you and wanting to spend the rest of their lives with me and saying I love you but I want that so bad to have a person love me the same way I would love them to only want to spend time with that person over everybody else to be someones favourite person but I Know that will never happen it took me very little time to get over this girl now for grade 12 it got worse I was now fully in person alone with bad marks and stressed spending lunches in a corner on my phone like an idiot I reconetd with some of my old friends but its never going to feel the same I still feel like an outsider and that our time has passed I even called the suicide hotline cause of uni appliactions and I was going to do it by jumping of a tall bridge near my school my mom wants me to go to therapy but i dont feel like I am deserving of that and also there have been some school shooting threats at my school but I still went to school hpoiing to get shot and killed and die a t a young age which I am still hopeing for.",1678995253.0

I’m 30 now & till this day I am not sure if it actually was an accident. Now they’re together but at the time my parents were separated. My father living in his own apartment. One night my mom picked me up from a friends’ & we started arguing on the way home. It was about them being so on/off during the separation. I was basically scolding her to stop behaving immaturely & to make up their minds as it was confusing my little brothers especially. She did not like this.

Once home I started walking down the drive way & got on my phone to call my dad as I didn’t want to spend the night at my moms. She reached out for the phone but instead grabbed my pinky & yanked it hard a couple times. I felt cracks. I started running away down our street & my hand/fingers instantly became super swollen, purple, & throbbing. My mom claimed it was dark & that she thought she had a hold of my phone. 

I waited for my dad at the neighborhood marketa. It was late & the area with the only light. X-rays ended up showing fractures in my hand & pinky. I had a cast for some months. There is much more to the story but that is the gist of it. I don’t recall what I told nurses, doctors, and teachers at the ER or at school. Nor do I recall what we told relatives. Why didn’t anyone question how I was injured? Why didn’t I think to call child protective services? I was probably thinking of my younger brothers & not wanting to leave them during such a tough time.

Eventually my cast came off & it became as though nothing ever happened. I’ve brought it up since to inform my parents that this was one of the traumatic incidents that I believe has contributed to my depression now as an adult. Am I being dramatic?

I know your purpose is what you make out of it but what if you just don’t care about what comes next? I can’t kill myself because while I don’t care about my existence I still matter to people and as selfish as that sounds I’ve lived my entire life catering to the lives of everyone around me to a point where I’m an empty puppet. My dilemma is that I could carry on living purely for the interest of others, keeping them happy while being miserable or I end it all and leave them with trauma that might make them do the same thing.

The funny thing about all of this is that even though I said “I matter” I mean in the unconditional sense just like how it’s human nature to be affected by someone you don’t even know dying. I don’t feel I truly matter and to this day i still can’t even think of an ideal situation that would change that for me, I’m ruined there’s no saving me",1678994490.0

Does it ever stop/get better?**

I've taken Mirtazapine a number of times in the past in the 15/30 doses more for my depression as shown below. I'm very familiar with it's side effects of fatigue, weight gain (which made me stop prior), and messed up dreams. I'm dealing with terrible chronic insomnia (onset and maintenance) and desperately trying to find something to keep me asleep as everything else has too severe side effects or doesn't work for maintenance insomnia.

I'm willing to deal with weight gain and fatigue to get asleep, but the nightly multiple absolutely horrible nightmares is destroying me. I'm waking up at least 4 times a night and 1 or 2 of them is in terror/calling out. I remembered prior the dreams were strange, but nowhere near the frequency. I'm completely dead in the morning because I didn't get sustained sleep.

To those who take it / have taken it longer term, please tell me, does this eventually go away or calm down?

I'm depressed because I've been through some complicated, hard times recently; I dont have almost any support in my life. 

I have seen a therapist for 6 months and it hasn't helped. I was hopefully at first, but now we have the same conversations week after week. We are starting to get frustrated with each other. I'm having a harder and harder time and he never seems to know what to say or do to help.

I am hesitant to say anything about it to him again, or I think maybe he will drop me as a client. I dont want to go to another person because it is really hard to find people who won't just treat me like I'm diseased, and shove one size fits all CBT shit down my throat. I find that way of doing things very damaging to me. 

I have no idea what to do. Part of me thinks, maybe this isn't helpful anymore, but I don't want to stop seeing the guy and have no other options. I feel afraid and lost. I don't have anyone else to turn to.",1678955683.0

It feels like my brain's circuitry is fried and the centers for regulating emotion (amygdala) are like eh'. 

I've come to realize at this point that no matter if my psychiatrist changes the dosage or like try different medications, nothing will work and so I think it's time to get outta here.

I don't know much about depression and I have always struggled to understand it in other people. I have never consciously experienced depression before. I have some questions.

I don't think I am depressed at the moment. I don't feel sad, I don't feel physical pain. I don't have tough living conditions and I am privileged enough in my life.

However... There's seems to be something being off sometimes. After high school everything changed. All the friends I had there went separated ways, some remained and became my only friends. 

I don't lack anything. But I feel i do. I go to University now but I feel like i'm doing it as a convention, only because I have to. I stopped to do sports because I was alone and it felt dull. But then I spend most of my day at home, alone. And I'm not sad because of that. I don't feel good or bad, sad or happy. The days go by without noticing. I feel like I don't have the push to do anything. And I am starting to be ashamed of this. I see people having all this will to do things while I just don't.

625,hiding away,4,11sn67i,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11sn67i/hiding_away/,1," I’ve decided today to not let anyone know how I’m feeling anymore. No more late night messages to my friends about how miserable my life is and how dreadful it is to live through every single day. No one needs to know. I was shoving these emotions and ramblings to them for no good reason. I’m hurting. It’s really impressive how long I’ve lived carrying all this weight with me. My life wasn’t great, not even close to good. At some point, things just seemed insignificant. I drowned myself in alcohol hoping that it would give me the escape I’ve been longing for. It works- worked- until everything spirals all the way down. Waking up the next day and getting a gust of heavy wind and realizing I have to keep breathing again. Inhaling and exhaling this dense air around me, it’s suffocating. It’s a substantial effort to even go through the simplest, most mundane things. I’ve reduced my meals to once a day because I rarely find joy or satisfaction from it. 

Life is bleak but there are undoubtedly moments that spark joy. There will even be a stretch of time where I feel okay. Not good, not bad, just okay enough to not get swept away by the heavy waves of my emotions. I can get out of bed without feeling like it’s made of thick cement, weighing me down and trying its best to pin me down. Then things will come crashing down. Every single negative emotion amplified. I’m like a house of cards, one wrong move, one wrong breath and it all comes crashing down. And it’s excruciating to exist. Hurting over and over and over and over and over and over again, it’s insanity. I’m a lost creature trapped in a never ending loop of misery. I don’t want to hurt anymore, I’m exhausted.

People like to say that things get better. But I like to believe that they never experienced true sadness or maybe they are just blind or delusional even. Things change, but they don’t get better. I’m still sad and alone but this time it’s a different cause but I still hurt. Loneliness is my best friend and she never leaves me alone. She’s always there creeping up on me and she has me in a chokehold. I can’t slip away. I’ve made an effort to put myself in a better light, tried to look at things through rose-colored lenses but it’s a fool’s paradise. The instant this filter falters I’m in the very place I was. Abandoned, forlorn, destructive. Always ready to dismantle myself from inside out. I wish it was possible to rip out my heart and never feel again. Every prick of pain is unbearable and it cripples me. I don’t have the strength to keep repeating this cycle but I’m alone in this battle and I’ve raised a white flag.",1678951583.0

I’ve been diagnosed with depression since I was 12 (now 35). I have been unmedicated for the majority of that time. I’m now on meds and we have changed them a few times, but there is no difference. Please tell me there is a light at the end of this tunnel because right now, it’s nowhere in sight. 

At this point, I don’t know if I need to vent, want to talk to someone or what, but you can stop reading here. The rest is just going to be rambling. Sorry. Lol

I know I’m in a dark place but I’m also kinda stuck in a marriage that I no longer want to be in. Not that I physically can’t leave, we just can’t afford it. We have been married since we were 18 and and over the last couple of years I have realized we really just got married because I got pregnant. We played house like we were supposed to. Had two children, bought a house, I’ve been a stay at home mom since we got married, kept up with the Jones’ right? But we don’t love each other. I take that back. We do love each other, we just aren’t IN love anymore. He thinks he loves me but he couldn’t name five things he loves about me. Everything is physical for him. He might love my body but that’s about it. 

I asked him for a divorce a few months ago and when it came down to it, he wouldn’t leave. I asked him for space, he ignored me completely. I opened that door a tiny bit and asked him if we could talk. Well he kicked that door completely in and literally a month and a half later and we are back in the same pattern of shit we were a few months ago. It’s a repeat cycle that I can’t seem to get out of without completely imploding my life. 

Neither of us have anyone we can call and ask for help. He has nowhere to go so unless he wants to be homeless, we have to cohabitate. Well we tried that once before for about two days before he started asking for physical touch again. I’m not leaving because I have two children and 5 animals that I am responsible for and I don’t trust that he will take care of my animals. 

I have told him multiple times how unhappy I am yet nothing ever changes. We always end up back where we started. And I have literally nothing else to think about so this is none stop in my head all day everyday. I have no job to focus on, I have no friends that I can talk to and keep me occupied, I have no hobbies, I don’t really open up to any family. It’s just me and my thoughts Every. Single. Day.  

I’m waiting on a counselor referral from my doctor but I don’t know if I can even be honest with them because I may end up with rubber socks. I know there is more to life than just my thoughts but how do I get to that point? Do I have to completely implode my current life situation and start a new one or will I hate that one too?

Where should I start this I wonder... So my parents have been taking control over my life. They have been involving (or should I say interferring?) in every aspect of my life. I can see that they are trying really hard to squeeze their ways into my life to be honest.

The worst part was that they changed the lock of my room's door without letting me know (yes we still use those doors with the old-fashioned padlocks and keys), and I basically have to legit ask my parents to unlock the door to my room. It makes me feel like they have never respected my privacy. I feel like there's not even mutual respect going on in this family anymore, and it's always the same old excuse 'it's for your own good'. To be frank, I have no idea what's good and what's not at the moment.

I tried to reach out to my friends for help, but they said it was normal for parents to do that and that I have been overeacting. I'm frustrated and lost as to how am I supposed to do. There were times when I tried to talk to my parents but they just wouldn't listen. I was wondering whether there's anyone who feels like it is okay for parents to act in this way. I understand it is absolutely fine for parents to be involved in their child's life. However, I feel like they must also learn that their 'child' is now an adult and they need to respect their boundaries.

637,Over it,4,11smp6f,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11smp6f/over_it/,0,"This is going to be a very long vent post so I apologise in advance.

After suffering years with depression and even trying to commit suicide on several occasions a few years ago I finally felt that I got out of that really dark place. I try to be positive and to see the world and its people in a positive light and keep my peace and serenity at any cost. But the past few months I've been struggling. I have been diagnosed with MS. The symptoms are hard and vicious and the medicine makes me terribly sick so if I have one good day a week I am lucky. The rest are spent feeling dreadfully tired, nauseous, relentless vomiting, uncontrollable migraines, stomach pains and now constant toothache due to all the vomiting. 

My pets are also like my children to me. I lost two of my fur babies last year, one had an awful death after having been poisoned. The fur-baby I still have now is currently sick and I had to spend basically the last money I had left for the month to take her to the vet. If she doesn't get better she has to go back and I don't have money to cover the expenses. My finances, while I'm normally quite good at managing it well, has been collapsing over the last six month due to expensive medicine, bad economy, low pay, raising gas prices etc. etc. I can see it spiral out of control and have no plan B for this month or the upcoming months.

My whole family is struggling with finances and health with no medical insurance. I have tried helping where I can but don't know where to help anymore... I feel helpless and I don't know what to do. 

My children are having trouble at school and I have been trying to help where I can but these days my energy resources paired with the constant sickness are so severe I am struggling to keep up. 

I have been hiding my feelings and how I am really handling everything from my family and use my insomnia to catch up on expressing my emotions which usually means sitting and crying at 1 am in the morning, every morning, trying to figure out how to handle all of this. I can't figure it out. 

Then comes the cherry on the top. I have a co-worker who also struggles financially. I have been helping her out the past 3 years even when sometimes it has come by taking away from my own family to help her. I have supported her and even drove her to and back from work for more than a year (at my own expense) when her means of transport was broken - this was far out of my way btw she was not on-route. She asks me for money 2 times a week and mostly I oblige not even expecting it to be payed back but I can't afford it anymore. 

Problem is she is the most hateful, bitter, ungrateful, sorrowful woman I have ever met in my life. I have tried and tried and tried to see the best in her but, despite everything she has shown no appreciation. She is downright disrespectful to me at work and straightforwardly aggressive if she is in a bad mood. She is also a trouble maker. Now to be clear, we are 3 people in our office... me my boss and her. There SHOULDNT be any politics with so little people!!! Mostly I just let it slide for my own peace and serenity but now she has gone behind my back and told my boss that I STOLE from the office when I took home 3 paperback folders when she was not here. And she is NOT HERE for so many BS reasons basically every second week. Now to be clear yes I probably shouldn't have done that, BUT I honestly didn't think it was a big deal and I had my reasons why I did it.

I buy my own stationary, use my own personal laptop for work AND since she does reception, when she is not here I have to do her and my own work AND then I am stuck at reception. (She doesn't get this. She gets pissed off if I'm at her desk and move a stapler by the way even though I HAVE TO BE at her desk because she is NOT in the office). If my boss is not in the office (which is most of the time) I am then the only one here and cannot go ANYWHERE! About a month ago my children had a school project due the next day and it was once again one of those days where she was just AWOL and I was alone. I couldn't leave the office to go and buy supplies so I just grabbed 3 folders before leaving work. Yes I know I should have mentioned it but I forgot I mean really??? 

I'm so angry that someone I have tried so hard helping and even defended when someone else accused HER of stealing a significant amount of electronic equipment did this. Its such a low blow I am beyond livid I feel she is the literal dog that bites the hands that feeds it. 

My husband says this is the sign that I should now just stop with all the charity and that I don't have to feel guilty because she has shown me time and time again who she really is. Yet feeling I should be the better person I don't know what I should do when she comes begging for money again which should be within the next day or two.

All of this is just too much for me. Physically and emotionally I feel like I'm dying most days I don't need this and his last thing with her just has pushed me over the edge. I feel like my character has been attacked and I'm offended and hurt that someone would go out of their way to do this after I really tried to be good to them. I mean this is a serious allegation and I didn't act maliciously good grief why go out of the way to make it sound like I'm this awful person who should lose my job??

I just feel like crying all the time now I'm sitting at work and have no motivation. I don't want to be here. I have enough things going on already and I don't understand why this is happening. 

I don't know I just feel like throwing in the towel, going home getting into bed and letting depression engulf me fully. I can't... but I want to. I'm just so tired I feel so alone and the darkness is beckoning me back... Its scary...",1678949809.0

It's bad, real bad. I've been almost too depressed to do anything for months now, Then again, that's kind of wrong, I've been depressed almost my entire life, just recently it's slipped so much that I am at the deepest I have ever been. This is my final gambit, the absolute last attempt at connecting with something, anything, for help. All of my shouting into the void over the past few months has been met with nothing but complete, overbearing silence. And, I apologize for having posted this on several different subreddits, I have no options left and this is my final reaching-out. After this, I give up.

I spend around 95% of my time in total isolation in this small, dark room. My daily routine consists of sleeping (precisely midday until around midnight usually, but these are interspersed throughout periods of being awake for 24+ hrs) and working online, doing schoolwork particularly. I don't talk to anyone I live with and very rarely even see them. I do not actually do the schoolwork properly, I only cheat because my mind has rotted to the point of only barely being able to form cohesive thoughts and I am tired to the point of being on the verge of passing out at ALL times, no matter how long or well I sleep, I am always able to nod off even while walking. This cheating is also because, frankly, I don't see a point. I never did particularly well and at no point will I ever be able to afford entering into higher education if I somehow graduate. On top of that, the world is just going to shit, there's no reason to create a legacy or continue the family or even just be happy by myself since in a few years it's just going to be an even more hellish dystopia than it already is, the few careers I was once interested in are now either pointless due to being privatized/exploited for money/censorship, or replaced by AI. This cycle is all I do, all day every day, for months, nonstop. Sleep, get up and walk 2 feet to my desk, mindlessly copy/paste for many hours until I collapse from exhaustion and repeat.

I struggle with a whole cast of mental disorders, primarily intense anxiety and autism, among other things. I am so socially inept I can barely hold my own or act normal in a social situation and avoid going into public or talking to people face-to-face as much as possible out of fear of judgement. My mind feels like a constant uncontrollable hurricane of terrible thoughts. On top of that I am constantly contending with some extreme suicide related trauma but many other smaller traumas as well, all completely unattended, never could talk about it due to my family's complete lack of communication and essentially some kind of silent-running policy where we all visibly acknowledge things that have happened but through quick eye glances apparently agree not to talk about it audibly. Nobody except my online friends knows about my current state, as if this information got out to my family it would cause the only person keeping us barely afloat to have a complete mental breakdown and get us evicted due to not working a couple days. I am certain of this because it has, indeed, happened before but I was able to salvage the situation by some quick thinking and some impressively elaborate lying.

I might be going insane. I am hallucinating near constantly, hearing scratching and knocking on walls and doors, seeing things out of the corners of my vision such as tall shadow figures and massive insects that dart away when I look at them. In fact, sometimes as of late it's not even corners. I open a door and see someone just straight up standing there right in front of me that quickly retreats around the corner or into the wall/ceiling/floor. Sometimes, when I peer into dark spaces, I can see something looking back at me, evidently not staved off by my recognizing it. My sleep is plagued by endless vivid nightmares, for example my most recent one was of being pursued by an incomprehensible eldritch flesh mass covered in screaming human faces that would always eventually subject me to some purgatory-like torment in an attempt to make me kill myself. This was followed by being in an abandoned building with ever single surface being covered in eyes that would stare at me, eventually impaling me with spikes. Other times I have recurring dreams about waking up in a dark, empty hospital surrounded by an endless, generic town and field coated completely in black texture that gets vaguely lighter the farther I go from it, and above is a desolate sky. I am always wearing a hospital gown with one of my eyes gouged out, and many times I have had other missing limbs, seen loved ones, or had oily black tendrils come out of my chest and empty eye socket in these dreams. While awake I constantly have intrusive thoughts about killing myself or thoughts about brutally attacking anyone I see.

I don't do anything else in my life besides work and sleep, for the most part. I don't leave my house (can't actually, at least I can't go anywhere that has anything besides emptiness) and have zero local friends, my only handful of friends are online but they're rarely on and they never ever talk to me unless it's about whatever dumb game they're into at the time, opting to ignore me instead in every other circumstance. As of recently it's starting to look like most of them simply do not give a shit about me. I have tried for months to find other friends but all has failed as my current friends are only around me because of incredible luck and circumstances years ago, no such thing can be repeated. I have posted on friend-searching subreddits of all kinds, gone to online places that supposedly have people with the same interests as me, all sorts of things, and everything has turned up empty. I have always been completely ignored, my existence means nothing to anyone and I have nothing to offer that would make me stand out enough for even a single person to notice me and not forget after a day. Even my own family forgets about me near constantly. The only people that don't ignore me are bots. Actually, *as I am writing this* one of my friends just acknowledged an request for help and responded only with mockery.

I have zero interests whatsoever, everything I used to like I have lost interest in either due to it going to shit, or because of my own inadequacy. I have spent months and years looking for a productive, fun hobby that I can dedicate myself to but everything I try I fail at miserably, I can do nothing well at all and I know this for a fact after having tested it for so long. I cannot gain any skills either no matter how hard I try, my mind just feels handicapped. I am completely useless. All of the hobbies that I didn't fail at, are just too expensive since I am almost totally broke and will be going bankrupt soon. This also explains why therapy and medication is out of reach for me, as well as any kind of decent nutrition besides the equivalent of the college student ramen diet... or anything else you can throw in a microwave for a couple moments. Across the rest of my life before now, it has always been this way. I have not experienced many things that most people would consider normal life experiences, only monotony and isolation, being able to see how life is supposed to be through quietly watching others. I have never done anything worth noting in my life. Not once.

From the conversation, I found out he has a very lienient set of moral rules applied to himself, but anything that is done against him is to him unfair and unjust. And oppositely, every abuse done to me is justified. Or straight up denied that ever happened.

And the worst thing is. After 10 years of sucking my mother's bank account dry and provided no support for us. He suddenly announced that he had planned to leave us to buy a house. So of course I asked him, where the f your money came from. He had the balls to tell us that he worked hard, that's how. 

This POS left us in poverty, and when he finally has the financial ability, he chooses to only save himself. During the 10 years, my mother paid for the rent for his office and sold 2 properties, all to support his failed business. After his business failed, we were deep in poverty, so my mother offered to go back to work. As a result, my father accused her of cheating and some other random misogynistic remarks.

This POS is running free in the wild living his best life without us.

I should know because I've been suicidal since I was around 8 years old. I don't even know why I was/am. It's probably another bullshit thing I inherited from my mother. I mean, yeah. I've been through some fucked up shit and I guess those events would make my teenage-almost 30 year old depression (or whatever, can't even get into a therapist to even be properly diagnosed) make sense. 

Being suicidal fucking sucks ESPECIALLY when you have a family. 

I type this as I'm sitting on my bed, next to my sleeping child and sleeping partner, and am thinking how fucked up it is to feel this way when I have what most people don't and what most people probably want. I'm thinking how fucking selfish I would be to rid my child from their parent and how selfish I would be to rid my partner from theirs. I always defended people who committed suicide when people called them selfish, I think im starting to understand it, though. 

I want to rid myself of my inner pain and fucking misery, but I can't. Because I've watched those videos of loved ones finding out theirs have died, and I shudder at the thought of my mother wailing. I shudder at the thought of my family having to lose yet another. I cringe at the thought of all the social media posts people may make about me. Even the ones full of lies.

So. 

I sit here.

I had a big wave of depression during most of January where I was crying literally every day, binge eating something fierce, and could barely get out of bed. My new work schedule (reduced hours, late nights) combined with seasonal depression really made things hard for me. 

I started getting better in February, and so far March has been bright. Spring is my favorite time of year, the warmer weather and longer days really started to lift my mood. I’ve been working on my art more, I’m growing some plants, I’ve been feeling much better in the past few weeks. 

But suddenly, today I just get an awful miserable feeling out of nowhere. Scrambled sad thoughts and hardly any energy. Took me hours to get out of bed and just water some plants. Feeling incredibly tired all day too. I hate how random depression can be: that I’ll be doing fine, feeling good for a few days, weeks even, then get struck with a dark grey day like this for no reason.

I really want to get on antidepressants again to feel a little more stable, but for that I need healthcare, and for that I need a new job. And this current schedule is really draining me: every day I wake up at like 2pm and it feels like the day is already over. It’s so hard for me to fill out job applications and schedule interviews like this.

I grew up in a household that was wrought with domestic violence.  I was forced to witness so many horrible things.  By the age of, about six, the destruction of my childhood began by someone who had no right to do that to me or my family.  My mother was, in essence, a hostage to this situation.

I have only recently, at age 34, found the ability to tell others about what happened to me.  After having these discussions, I finally began to realize that my trauma had been holding me back since childhood.  Since both the school system and law enforcement, as well as myself, all failed to protect my mother, I simply consigned to myself that my situation was my normal.  Only now do I realize how incredibly fucked it ACTUALLY was.

I began over eating when I was a kid, this lead to weight problems which lead to more ridicule from classmates, I really hated being a kid.

After reaching out and asking people for help understanding, I FINALLY am able to look in the mirror and say “you are NOT DISGUSTING”.  I have been told that I am actually cute, but I am not ready to say that yet and mean it, baby steps.

My anger, cynicism and hatred toward the world is starting to dissipate.  Now I’m starting therapy, I will begin working out hard because this time I need to get healthy for my OWN sake.  I am volunteering for Big Brothers/Sisters, and I’m going back to grad school to become a social worker so I can help others who were like me.

679,Can't get out of bed because all my fillings/crowns make me feel like crap about myself.,3,11shspv,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11shspv/cant_get_out_of_bed_because_all_my_fillingscrowns/,1,"I'm F31. I have 8 teeth with fillings, 1 with a crown and one of the filled teeth just cracked and will need another crown. It's mostly my pre-molars that are the issue. My two top ones had big fillings as a kid and they both cracked in my early/mid twenties. My dentist built them up with composit and one has been holding but who knows what will happen to it in the future. The other broke in half about 2 years ago with what looked like decay inside and needed a crown. It has a slight ache once in a while that I need to address.

Recently, one of my bottom pre-molars with another large filling cracked and became very sensitive. I've been going back and forth to my dentist and endodontists to figure out what happened for months. It will need another crown.

Another tooth, in my early twenties when a top premolar cracked I confused the pain with the tooth in front. I went to multiple dentists that said nothing was wrong, they can't help. Went to a chain dentist (didn't know better) who said I had a small cavity and put a filling in. When the pain didn't stop, they removed it and did a second filling. It now has a big filling too and come to find out it wasn't even that tooth. Nothing was wrong with it. I'm terrified of it cracking and breaking too. I hate myself for confusing which tooth was hurting. I should have 1 less tooth to worry about. 

I don't want crowns, I don't want fake teeth. I'm terrified of them needing to be pulled out. With the exception of the one tooth done at the chain dentist, all the fillings are from childhood. I was a stubborn kid and didn't like brushing and didnt want flouride treatments at school. My mom fed me all the soda and candy I wanted and loved to bake deserts. She didn't make sure I brushed my teeth every night either. I remember giving up and figuring who cares, they'll all fall out anyway. I didn't know my molars were already my adult teeth and that was it for me.

As I got older I took better care of my teeth and (excluding the one mentioned) haven't had a necessary filling since childhood. My front teeth have white marks from all the soda I used to drink. I'm thankful most people say they don't notice it. The top/bottoms are almost transparent and they're sensitive to cold. I have to use sensodyne toothpaste.

Most people my age have great teeth, never had a cavity or maybe only one. I feel gross and like a fuck up. I hate myself for all of this and can't stop beating myself up over it and wishing I could change it. I want to be like everyone else with perfect teeth. I just want my natural teeth.",1678934436.0
680,Three Intrusive Thoughts,2,11skivw,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11skivw/three_intrusive_thoughts/,0,"I've had three intrusive thoughts for the past 2 weeks now. Each of them are odd on their own, but put in the context of each other, they make me worried I'm getting worse.

The first is the most worrying one, and an idea that has been present in my brain for years. It is that classifying things like major depressive disorder or post traumatic stress disorder or generalized anxiety disorder is useless. All the different mental illnesses combinations and the severity of each is specific to the person. So instead of saying person X has these three illnesses, its better to say person X has Person X Disorder (allbeit this would be worse for scientific discussion but whatever) From this, I wonder if every person has a disorder and every disorder is different. This is where the problematic thought comes in: What if some of those disorders are incurable and terminal? What if Peter Disorder will at some point take his life. What if Laura Disorder, despite her seeking therapy, medications, hospitalizations, and family help, what if that sickness will kill her anyway like ALS or MS or Huntingtons?

The second, and most innocuous thought, is: What if I just move to a random place with no safety net. Would I then be able to force myself to be normal. If I leave my mom's house suddenly and don't tell my siblings or family, change my number so they couldn't reach out to me, would I then be able to force myself to go to work, get an apartment, and live like a normal adult without the fear of disappointing anyone. Could I force myself to only rely on myself?

And the third idea that ties it all together in a very worrying sense, is: Some animals will purposefully isolate themselves from the colony or group when they're about to die.

This makes me wonder if ConcerningThoughts Disorder is terminal, and if I'm in the end stages. I'm confused and worried.",1678942295.0

2 weeks ago, I stopped taking it. My emotions haven't come back. I like being sad. I love tragedies. But, now I have no emotions. I can't feel sad even if I want to, I have no emotions or empathy, nothing. I can't feel bad or sad for people. The only thing I can feel is anger. I am just numb.

I told my therapist this. She offered to discharge me. She said “keep in mind that if your change your mind, you’ll be on a 6 month waitlist”. 

It was me who suggested to change from weekly to biweekly. She said that could work out.

It’s incredible how fast she was willing to just move on. I know she’s just my therapist but at least try, I guess. 

Our therapy appointments are an hour long, but we stopped at 30 minutes.

Now my toxic brain is telling me she’s already given up on me, so why bother.

Every week I have to put up with the annoying kids I can't stand being around with their constant talking and laughing and it's taking a toll on my sanity and self esteem, and doesn't help that middle school and high school is merged here. Who the fuck thought that was a good idea??? I also have 0 friends so this experience makes it a lot harder to cope with. Back in middle school and lower I had some friends and that made school more bearable, but now it's been at least 4 years in this school and no one STILL wants to be friends with me. No one gave me a chance. I've had moments where I thought I would become friends with someone, but it didn't work out and, at least for me, that's too good to be true. I do have 1 friend I kept from grade school though, but that doesn't help much at all since we don't have much to talk about compared to his other friends. I kinda accepted the fact that no one wants to be friends with socially anxious high schooler who has a speech impediment and very low self esteem. 

I also don't have the motivation to do work now. I used to have good/decent grades but since 2023 started my grades have been plummeting. I don't feel like doing assignments that require more work, like essays and projects.

I talked to my school counselor about the problems I have and it's been helping me quite a bit, but it's still not enough for me to consider staying here in this prison. My counselor mentioned something about online school and I tried my best to transfer to that, but I think my chances of ever going there sooner or later is slim to none. I really feel like this is the chance to give it my all in school (and btw I did very well back when I was forced to do online school in 2020-2021) and the door is slowly closing on me.  And on top of all of this, school is making me suicidal. I don't have any plans to do it, but I usually have some ideas about. I have 2 years left and I honestly feel like giving up.

Whenever I'm on a break, I feel so much better and happier. I do have some anxiety about school and such but most of the time I try to enjoy my time outside of school. When the last day before school starts comes around, though, the depression slowly start to ramp up and when the day comes, it comes back punching me in the face again. It's an endless cycle of me being happy and wanting to kill myself over and over again and I'm fucking tired of it.

So every time my gf tells me that I’m useless I’m dying inside and think about of killing my self but I can’t.

I can’t leave my gf. She’s all I have and her parents are very close to me. It’s like they are my real family. But right now I’m too stressed from work and having a hard time falling asleep my sleeping meds give a lot of headache. 

I can’t think of any reason why she tells me that, I buy her gifts, we go on dates I always go to her during weekend and spend time with her. I always cheer her if she’s having having a hard time.

So today was a more productive day considering in the morning time I was active and getting things done.

I am at that point of my life where I don't know what to do anymore, I mean, what should I live for? I feel like I'm doing everything for someone else, just because everybody expects me to do that: studying, working, being nice to everyone, maintain a certain attitude in every situation. Sometimes I ask myself ""why am I doing this? For myself, because I want and I have a precise objective or just because everybody would be proud of me?"".
And now i don't have an objective in my life anymore, I've been doing absolutely nothing for weeks, I'm neglecting everything. Every morning I look at my reflection in the mirror and ask myself ""why?"", why am i able to think? It's just that I no longer know what's the point of living the life because is that really important? What's the deal, am I living for something? I could just do whatever I want just because I'm alive and since I'm here there's no need to care about laws and people's feelings, I mean, everyone will die sooner or later and there will no longer even be the possibility for them to think and suffer. As a human being I have an enormous power in my body and mind, an incredible potential, I may be able to do almost everything I can imagine but again, why should I do that?

So now I have no more inspiration and nothing insipires me anymore, i can't be happy or even just in a good mood, but I'm not sad, not right now, I can't explain how I feel. I can't even remember the last time I was happy about something. Everything feels empty, I feel empty, everything I touch feels the same, everything I hear feels the same, everything I taste when I eat feels the same, everything feels grey not even a shade of color that can make my day interesting. I think about my future, everybody expects me to find a monotonous job, working eight hours a day everyday and then get home and do the same shit like watching a movie, sleep or see some friends and then having less than a month of holidays during the year, all of this for the next sixty or seventy years. Is this life? Is my dad's or his friends life worth living since they do that? You can enjoy your job but then what's the value in what you do, for whom or what do you do what you do?

I often imagine myself living the adventure of some fantasy book I've read, finding myself in a situation where I feel the weight of the life I'm living, a life I'm living for something, a big goal, something I really want or love, something that's worth my interest, something that I could die for and if it happens, I permanently lose it and there is no second chance.
That's what I'm saying, life feels meaningless, what's the point of living if you don't have something really enormous and important to fight for, something you really need or desire.

There's only moments when I feel good, when I'm with my best friend, or in the movies. I'm in love with my best friend, and I know she loves me too, but I think not i a romantic way. I know I have to tell her how I feel about us, but I really afraid that I lost her, and her family (I have a very strong relationship with them too).

My mom always blame me for my emotional state, she says is my fault that I feel this way. I can't enjoy the good things because I'm always afraid that the worst is coming. And because of that, I'm afraid that my loved ones will get tired of me. Every day I'm thinking of suicide, and how finally everyone feel relieved that I'm gone.

I've hurt myself multiple times, I've been hospitalized due to my trauma, but I can safely say I'm now living a good life and have forgiven myself for all the shit I put myself through. It's so difficult to be strong at such a young age, but I'm happy I'm a survivor. 

It kinda started when I was a teen, I got taken advantage of by male cousins when I hit puberty. Oddly, they didn't think anything of me being a guy, but they did what they did anyways. I sat in a pool of confusion forever. And it happened so often that I grew up hating myself because I always wondered why I got targeted. My female cousins would always ignore me, and I've mentioned this concern when I got a little older and understood situations better. My female cousins would laugh at me and say things like ""you're a guy, you guy's are just doing guy stuff,"" and when I was a little more vivid about it, their usual response would be ""go talk to mom or dad"" and my parents would always just ignore it because again ""were just guys"". I was put in the impression that it's only important if I could get pregnant, but because I can't I'll get over it. 

Fast forward to about 10 years later and I'm finally healed from my past trauma. But within those 10 years, I've been sexually abused by a lot of my partners, I am gay so majority of them took advantage of me. I've been in group therapy and I've noted that I'm not the only one who got taken advantage of due to depression. I was very gullible and delusional so I was easily manipulated due to no guidance and affection. My only source of comfort was unfortunately toxic ex's who would comfort me just to get me in bed and then argued right after to get me out of the house. I always thought there was just something I was doing wrong, and there definitely was but it wasn't for them, it was for myself.

Im very thankful for therapy, and for growing up and getting this far. I hope that anyone who's going through depression can get the help they need so they don't get taken advantage of in any way, because there's more people out there willing to be terrible human beings than be comforting and understanding.",1678904855.0

That is 400 more then we are paying now and 1000 more then we were paying a year ago.
The only places under 2000 are 2 bedroom apartments with no yards or storage so we would need an expense storage unit or sell all or lives belongings.
Are we really at the point that the only way a family can survive is two incomes house with no space for hobbies or belongings? Do we have to leave the state that we made our home to desperately hope we can find a cheap place somewhere else.

I know factually that I am depressed, that I have anxiety, and that I have some communication disorder. My therapist told me I could also have some form of autism and I agree with her, but I never have gotten an official diagnosis.

About 3 years ago I got in a realtionship with someone who I am obsessed with and who is/was obsessed with me. She had a boyfriend at the time, yet she sayed that she only went in to a relationship with him to make me jealous. She broke up with him as soon as she realized there was a chance just so we could be together. Looking back it now obviously a horrible decision, but we were both living so in bliss (especially in the begining), that we couldnt have cared less (Obession in a nutsell). She stayed friends with his x threwout our relationship (Wich I was fine with) and from what I understood now I have played a significant role in the relationship that existed prior to us being together. When we broke up they quickly bounded again and a few months later, they were back in a relationship. 

Consequences:

The breakup lead to BPD on her end and to a pretty heavy drug addiction on my end (Going to rehab soon tho), wich is why we didnt talk for a long time after the breakup. Attempts to have contact just lead to me cutting of contact again, because I couldnt cope with guild.  A few weeks ago threw some conincidences and me now wanting contact again because I belive thats what she deserves (She went threw alot of, if you couldnt tell already) we started to meet and talk again.  Now we (kinda) activly talk again, after almost 3 years have past. 

Problem:

The problem is her Boyfriend dosent know that and im putting her in a realy bad spot with the current situation. She told me recently that her braking up with him, made a huge impact on his mental health so telling him probably isnt a good Idea, yet it is the most resonable and fair thing to do. It could lead to him saying that he dosent want her to have contact with me - wich in return puts her in a decesission were she would have to chose. On top of that, I still cary my obssession with me and I cant realy pull out now, because it would lead to even more damage and/or erase any still existing trust.",1678923892.0

I still miss my Dad a lot he was the only one able to set me straight most of the time but haven't had him in my life since I was a teen as he died suddenly and traumatically. My depression at the time was bearable because I was starting University and had a future and stuff to look foreward to in life. Friends to meet, potential of still meeting someone I could love, time to find my passions, etc.

Now I am 29f and so lost in life since around 25. I did my undergrad degree in psych thinking I would work as a therapist or go on to do somehting in healthcare. I felt too ""old"" to start prereqs for something else after graduating plus I had a low gpa in undergrad due to depression. This limits options so I took the easiest course I could find to get a better job which was a social work program with an internship. I am finishing the program, doing my unpaid internship now and working with people who have gone through really horrible stuff. Its nice to feel like I am helping but so mentally draining. I thought I would be happier with a respectable adult career but I was honestly happier a few years ago when I was a waitress at a restaurant with no idea what I wanted to do. At least there was time to imagine what my future might be and I was socializing with people my age at the time which was fun.

I am still living at home with my Mom (we have a pretty good relationship, but I think she's sick of seeing me indecisive and unhappy), the internship is unpaid, I am burnt out of school and barely able to finish, My part time paid job isnt enough for rent, and now I have just found out that the social work job I am interning for only hires on 5 month contracts. So I feel even if I get the job, it wont give me any security to achieve my 1 goal which was to move out before 30. Plus I may burn out anyway emotionally so I feel back to square 1 with not knowing what to do.

I feel trapped and sad. I wish I did something more with my life. My friends are from uni and they are a bit immature and still want to party a lot while I have gotten more into cooking, reading, yoga, self improvement and 1 on 1 friendships. Since I have outgrown my friends I am grateful to still have some but I don't feel like spending time with them a lot. I have still never had a boyfriend. I date a bit but guys either only want sex or I feel weird and insecure for not being where theyre at in life. I meet people on apps or through friends (which doesnt work bc immaturity I mentioned before). I have had opportunities for love in the past and feel I made wrong decisions. I had one traumatic narcissistic ""ex"" who really devalued me and never dated me for real and that really hurt my self worth too. Didnt date for years after that experience. I see friends moving forward, moving in with partners. I have never felt like this will happen for me. I am too different to find a match. Recently met someone in person who was unique who seemed like a match but after showing interest in me he strung me along for months then disappeared which was a huge blow at this time. I am that person who all my friends say is cute and great but yet I am the only one to never date anyone/no one ever actually have loved me or liked me for the right reasons. I think I am a bit picky myself so it's just tough to find a match. My parents had this great love and I don't want to be with someone I am not in love with. I am realizing if I want kids I am likely going to have to settle for someone I am not in love with. This is more of a vent but my biggest problem is my career and path forward. Even though I am more of a relationship and friendships values person than career driven, I have made my whole life about having some great meaningful career, because I have had no success in love. But I feel if I had love in my life, I would not be so stressed about career to fulfill my needs. Sometimes I feel I would be happier in a small town somewhere warm like the southern US rather than my fast paced stressful and cold big city. Maybe I could start over and start a new life.

I already saw a therapist and career counsellor. I feel like no one can help me because I am so idealistic and then get so disappointed with reality. Therapy is a relief in the short term but ultimately does nothing to fix my negative mindset that tells me nothing good ever happens to me and it ends up being right. I havent felt happy for years and have a lot of trouble getting out of bed.

My two previous psychiatrists diagnosed me with - dysthymia with bouts of major depression, the other with bipolar II. Not sure if either are correct. My guess is cPTSD.

The holistic psychiatrist suggested 150 mg dose of Lithium. She said we could go up to 300 mg if 150 mg didn't help. I was freaked out by the idea, since I'd have to get regular blood tests to check kidney values and this didn't exactly feel ""holistic.""

Now, I am wondering if maybe I should contact her again and try it.

Anyone have experience with low dose Lithium? For depression, anxiety and or insomnia?",1678935644.0

I started university when I was 19. The first 2 years went smoothly, I finished them well.

I attempted to go into university again and I was not ready at all, I did not know at the time that I could defer the year more, it was my own mistake, I should've asked.

Anyway, I asked for another leave of absence to return in September.

I’m seriously questioning if life is worth living or not and if I’d be making a mistake by cutting mine short somehow


So I had a pretty tough time socially in my younger years, I’m diagnosed w autism spectrum disorder, I think most ppl can’t really tell because I seem pretty normal besides being a little slow to subtle social cues and shit. Either way I had a LOT of trouble relating to others and making friends growing up and it’s taken a huge toll on me, especially throughout highschool. I started smoking weed at 16 to help cope w the loneliness I was feeling and bc my only friend at the time was a huge stoner, so of course I was bound to try it. 
I didn’t really like it all that much at first, made me really paranoid but I did like the fact that it felt somewhat adventurous and fun if I could get past the initial anxiety. Fast forward to the end of sophomore year and I’m now a full blown stoner who’s tried way more drugs than any 16 year old should. Xanax became a huge favorite of mine because I could relax and not give a fuck on it, I called em “confidence pills”. Anyways, my Xanax use spiraled out of control pretty quickly, and I ended up getting caught by my parents bc I blacked out in front of them, they told me all sorts of weird ass shit I said and did but had no recollection of. Nodding off while standing up for example in my moms bedroom. After I got caught I stayed away from pills and stuck to weed pretty much exclusively besides some psychedelics here and there. 
  Wasn’t until senior year that things became super dangerous and out of control, because that’s when I discovered fentanyl. My new friend group at the time were all doing these fake oxy pills that were circulating my area, at first they wouldn’t tell me what they were on despite being clearly high on something, finally one of em told me and of course immediately wanted to try it, because it looked like it felt fantastic. Worst decision I’ve ever made, we smoked those pills, and upon first inhaling that sickly sweet chemical vapor, I was instantly in love. I wanted to feel that way the rest of my life no matter what, at all costs. 
  Opiates completely took over my life, and it got to the point where I sold all my most prized possessions (guitars, music equipment, etc) and anything I could get my hands on for them. Stole countless money from family, became an utter scumbag and I hated myself. Eventually I started running out of ways to get the pills and decided to come clean to my family about it, they were devastated, especially my mom who is a recovering opiate addict as well. They avoided sending me to rehab the first time and I got on suboxone to help, but I ended up relapsing on Xanax and totaling my car which did get me sent to rehab. I didn’t want to go and I made absolutely 0 effort to do better while I was in the first rehab bc I wasn’t ready to get clean by any means. Once I got out, I already had a plan to go relapse on opiates my true drug of choice immediately. Did not get away with using for very long at all because my parents found tinfoil and other paraphernalia pretty much right away. They ended up testing me w a fentanyl test and I popped positive, I had never seen my parents more distressed in my life, never seen my mom sob that hard, and I saw my dad cry for the first time ever in general. It bothered me a lot. Ended up going to a 90 day program where I definitely put in effort but still fucked around. I didn’t trust myself getting out right away bc I didn’t want to relapse, so I did another 90 days of sober living afterwards as well. Finally got home and I felt welcomed at first but things got lonely. There was no AA meetings open bc this was peak covid, so I had little to no support. 
  And that’s pretty much where I’ve been for the last 3 years, staying sober besides smoking weed for crippling insomnia, but def not working a program. Since I’ve been out I’ve dealt w some insecurities, one being my lack of sexual experience. Nevada solved that problem for me lol. But I still have so much self hatred and a very strong desire for success and validation, and it drives me insane. At this point not a lot brings me any joy anymore, really my only passion is music. I want to make music that I’m proud of so badly but I feel like my goals there are unattainable partly due to a lack of support, lack of resources, and a lack of self esteem. If anyone said anything bad about music I’ve released it would instantly make me super depressed and make me question a lot of things. 
  I wish I didn’t have to be so affected by what others think of me. But i crave validation so bad I really don’t know why, I think it’s because of how coldly I was treated by peers and family in my youth. Addiction was the only problem of mine my parents ever took seriously, they didn’t care until my death was a real possibility. So now, my most recent girlfriend whom I loved to death, broke up with me out of nowhere over text, very coldly and for another guy and it’s caused me to spin out and it’s brought on a lot of past trauma. Now I’m basically right back at square one self esteem wise, I think I’m ugly, I think I’m unloveable, and I can’t be saved nor save my self it feels like. A part of me really wishes I OD’d so I don’t have to endure this constant empty heartache, I often fantasize about ending my life in a messy unapologetic way because it just seems so fitting for someone like me. I just don’t want to feel like this anymore, I’m so envious of the success of those around me, I still feel happy for them on some level, but it’s bitter knowing I’m not gonna get the same success. It really does feel like I’m a born failure, if there was “nothing wrong with me” people wouldn’t treat me the way they do is how I feel. I really do just feel like a complete and utter outcast and I just wanna love someone and feel some come back my way for once.",1678915027.0
748,7 years later it still hurts,2,11s9kbh,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11s9kbh/7_years_later_it_still_hurts/,0,"Almost 7 years ago a girl destroyed my life. For months I sat in a tiny dorm room on a campus where I didn't know anyone, crying on the floor wanting it to end. I used to just sit there and think of the ways I could do it, trying to find something that would be possible, quick, and painless.

&#x200B;

I said horrible things to this girl because I wanted her to feel the same pain. The stuff I said was unfair but it was truly how I felt at the time. Even after breaking up, we talked for a few weeks (likely because she didn't want me to end it which is unfair). We would sometimes randomly send texts to each other for Christmas, birthdays, etc. It was about a year before I even remotely felt like I could move on.

&#x200B;

After years (over 4) of being in a healthy, committed relationship (that started before I was fully over my ex) I still sometimes feel these thoughts come back. I still miss her. It feels like I want to be again that kid sitting on the floor of his dorm room in pain. It's like an addiction, it doesn't matter how long I go without these thoughts they always come back. When these thoughts come back I distance myself from everyone, I don't want to talk, and I don't want to be near people. I want to be alone, I want to be sad by myself. Back to being that kid crying on the floor.

It's been almost 2 years since I've had any issues with this but the past few days have been continuously getting worse...but I don't want to feel better? I'm still sad, I'm still so fucking angry.

There are days when every minor inconvenience makes me want to cry, and I feel this deep, aching sadness and guilt in my body that makes me want to shut everyone out and curl up into a ball. The idea of eating makes me nauseous, even when I'm so hungry it hurts. I won't feel like doing any of the things that usually make me happy, and parts of my normal everyday routine that should be automatic (brushing my teeth, showering, studying) feel like huge tasks.

This is just my messed up thoughts i have been having for a while all mixed up into a reddit post.

Ever since college started i have not been studying hard. I just study a little to get by. But its gotten to a point where i dont study at all. I panic when there’s and upcoming quiz/test but i don’t do anything to prepare for it and i get sad when i get the results and yet i still dont do anything about it. i just feel guilty towards my parents because they pay for my tuition and they dont know that they’re wasting it on me. I was not like this during junior high and i dont know what happened to me. 

idk if im depressed or just lazy as fuck. For the past years i have noticed my productivity decline. i have started losing interest in all the things i loved before. i started feeling useless. I feel like my whole life i didn’t live for myself, i feel like i lived for others, trying to be a good kid who won’t cause any problems. My parents are the best parents anyone could ask for. I cant stand the idea of telling them how i feel because i know it would break their heart and they would blame themselves because of what i turned out to be. I dont think therapy would help and i just think it would be a waste of money. I dont want my parents to spend anymore on me. i am just burden to my parents who wasted their hard earned money on me, a worthless human being.

 I started having thoughts abt not existing anymore and to this day i still do. Im too scared to kill myself but i just wish i didn’t exist anymore, like i wish i could just dissappear from this world without anyone from my family grieve. I just want a world where i didn’t exist. I wish i didn’t have these thoughts because, in reality, i have no reason to be depressed about. I live in a third world country and my family are priviliged, I don’t experience the hardships that many of our poor people experience. I have  loving parents who support me and my siblings through anything, and friends i am lucky enough to have. Many people would do anything to get what i have and yet, i waste it. I just don’t get why i’m having these thoughts when many more people have a harder situation than me like the many homeless people i see sleeping in the streets, and yet do everything they can to live, while i, a privileged person want to no longer exist.

In July of 2019 my mom started to get into mini car accidents. My father took her to the hospital to find out that her cancer moved to her brain,again we cried. It was really hard to see my mother go through all of this. She started chemo and radiation all over again. This time it made her really sick.

From all the chemo and radiation she had done on her it made her weak so the covid made it worse. We were all scared so she never let us out of the house because it could still make her very sick.

Mom: moved away and she’s caught up her own self pity and she causes drama.


Dad: loves me but is struggling to love himself and he’s constantly projecting those shortcomings onto me and it fucking hurts. Plus he chose his new girlfriend over me. I used to love being at his house and now it feels like a prison or something when I go there. 

Auntie: kicked me out for smoking weed cause she searched through my stuff and found one  singular nug jug of the smallest caliber. Told the whole family that I’m a drug addict.

Uncle: cool but distant

Grandpa: dads dad is dead and hardly meant anything to me. Moms dad took off early and I’ve never met him. All I had was a papa through marriage and now he’s gone cause he died in 2017. 

Friends: at least they are nice to me while they’re lying to my face. 

Work: I’m a fucking slave with no direction and I’m loosing interest in my job.

Home: I’m homeless. The house I live in is just a house.

I am a 34 year old guy who hates his life and wants to die. I am single. The only girlfriend I had was in college and she was dishonest, manipulative, and cheated on me. I have health issues that began after getting lyme disease in 2011. These issues affect my daily life and inhibit my ability to pursue my passions and hobbies. I have a low paying job where coworkers and students that I work with are disrespectful. My best friend of over 7 years who I did everything with recently ghosted me after getting a boyfriend. I was once a great student and a college athlete with a promising future but now I am an aging failure with nothing to live for. 

One thing that would improve my life and happiness would be the ability to go back to school and pursue my goal of getting an MFA and working in an art related field as I am an artist. Due to financial and time constraints, I do not think this is possible. I am introverted and get nervous/awkward around people, especially girls. I fear that I will be alone forever, or I will meet a girl and she will manipulate and cheat on me like the one girlfriend I had in college did. I love to run and be active but I am in pain on a daily basis, making running and physical activity difficult and unenjoyable. I've been at the end of my rope for many years and do not want to go on like this. My peers have great jobs, loving partners, houses, success with sports and other pursuits, etc. and I do not have any of these things. 

On one hand, I wish I would get shot or a comet would hit the world and I would die. On the other hand, if I could get a better job and be financially stable, find fulfillment instead of frustration with being an artist, find a loving partner, and overcome my health issues so I can live an active lifestyle, run, and perform basic tasks without pain, I would be a lot happier. I have put in a lot of work and effort to improve my life, get a better job, overcome health issues, but to no avail. Additionally, I try to be the best person I can be...I am generous, friendly, hardworking, and down to earth. However, I am also negative, standoffish, indecisive, unconfident, and self centered. I do not think hard work pays off, I am sick of trying, and want to die.   


I am sick of working at my shitty job where kids call me a faggot and tell me to shut the fuck up and spit on me. Most of my jobs have been support roles or teaching jobs at public schools but over the past few years, working in schools has been demoralizing. I am too stressed and can't hack it as a teacher, my license is expiring, and I have not gone to grad school, so I am working as a support staff although I have 5 years of teaching experience. I am sick of hobbling through runs and hikes and doing physical therapy, going to doctors, and taking medication and never getting any relief. I am defective and it would be best if I were not here anymore. I feel like an idiot and the laughing stock of my friends who all have good jobs (doctors, engineers, work at companies making 100k or more) while I struggle to make ends meet. I am sick of being a lonely introverted loser who can't talk to girls and will never have a loving relationship. Additionally, I am sick of being a below average artist and feeling like a hack because I studied art in college but never gained true mastery of drawing and painting. 

If anyone has any realistic advice for a struggling 34 year old, it would be much appreciated. ",1678921628.0
773,Should I let myself sob constantly and forever? Or try and ignore it?,1,11scikg,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11scikg/should_i_let_myself_sob_constantly_and_forever_or/,3,"Hello,

This is my first time posting on Reddit so apologies if i commit any faux pas!

I am constantly seconds away from heaving sobbing. If I think about one of a few different things, or if something external happens that triggers me, I immediately break down. I’ve been like this for nearly two years. 

One of the trickiest things is that I never have any reason to stop crying. I don’t start feeling better, and there’s nothing/ no one around me to lift me out of my sobbing. Most of the time I stop because I feel too tired to continue. 

I know some people struggle to cry with chronic depression. I am the opposite. The worse my life is, the wetter my face gets, and the puffier my eyelids. 

So my question is- should I let myself cry? Should I allow myself to sob for hours, regularly? Or should I repress it? I think sometimes I let myself cry to punish myself.

A therapist once told me humans cry for a reason, as it causes some kind of release in the brain that eases sadness. Is this always true? Is it actually helping me? 

TDLR: should I let my depressed ass sob ALL the time, or should I repress it?

Please let me know your thoughts, if anyone has any!

I struggled academically in high school, even spending 6 months of my Sophomore year in outpatient treatment for depression and SH so college was never really something I considered, let alone Grad School. 

But despite this achievement, I'm having a really really hard time. 

My parents kicked me out last year. They were pretty emotionally and financially abusive for my entire life and once they found out I was telling my extended family that I was unhappy, they threw me out. One of my friends, who is more of a mother figure to me, took me in and let me stay with her and her family until I found a place of my own (which I moved into a little over a month ago). So, thinking about graduation and the fact that my parents won't be there really really sucks. 

In addition, my identical twin sister is also graduating (from a different Grad School) and she still speaks to my parents, so the idea of them being there for her and not me is sending me in a spiral. 

The other thing that I'm struggling with is that over the fast few days, some of my friends have offered to help me pay for my Graduation regalia and that makes me feel so much deep shame and guilt. I appreciate and love my friends so much, but I don't think that I deserve for them to spend their hard earned money on me. I don't understand why anyone *would* want to do that. 

Its just frustrating because this should be a time in my life where I am excited and grateful to have had the opportunities I've been given, but I can't help but feel sort of dirty in a way. I feel like my friends are eventually going to find out that I'm not a great person and regret it.

For the first time in my life I want to die.
I have thought about it and said it to myself before but never really wanted to do it. How is it that now that I have a  child I actually want to do it? Yet she is the reason I won’t , but the urge is still there. I feel numb I catch myself dosing off staring blankly at nothing in particular. My thoughts are scattered.I forgot my baby in the car for the first time, it was only for a minute but how can I forget her?! 
I alway felt like a daughter devoted to her mother. I felt like I had to fix my mothers problems. I had to support my mother through her depression substance abuse, her toxic relationships. I had to be my siblings parent. I had to be responsible for our home while my mother worked I had to make sure everyone was taken cared of. But who took care of me? I was still a child. 
I am a mother now and I see me in my daughter, how can I put so much on her shoulders?! How can I take her childhood away? And why should I? Because my mother was a bad mother and her mother was a bad mother? Why does my daughter have to suffer the consequences of generational trauma? She doesn’t deserve this! 
I am a daughter a mother and I am…..scared. Scared of becoming my grandmother scared of becoming my mother. My child doesn’t deserve this. I had to say goodbye to my mother and it was the hardest thing I have ever done. I have done it before but I know in my heart this was the last time. She is not dead or dying she is healthy and living. But I can’t handle supporting her feelings without her supporting mine. I can’t handle her mistakes that mess with my mental health anymore. I have become the black sheep of my family. Because I did what wasn’t my job and now I look bad for not doing it anymore. I have broken a family that is already broken. Not because of me but because of the decisions my mother has taken and had me fix for her. I have learned too well how to turn the blind eye to horrible and wrong things. I have learned to be quiet and keep my mothers secrets. I have taken so much off my mothers shoulder. So much that shouldn’t be on my shoulders. But I think long and hard and I remember I am a mother now. And I have to let all of that go. I have to learn that, that is not mines to carry that I am not responsible for those things. I have to let that go and focus on my responsibilities focus on my child and focus on my husband. Yet why do I still want to die? I know what I have to do and what I want but I can’t shake that feeling off, the urge like a sweet treat waiting for me that I cannot have. There but just out of reach.",1678906652.0
777,Am I simply surviving and not living?,2,11s5c4r,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11s5c4r/am_i_simply_surviving_and_not_living/,3," 

Hi. I \[25 F\] feel like I am not living the life I dreamed of as a child.

When I was a child I was very imaginative and would express myself in art and making stories, my friends and family loved me for it. At highschool I became a writer in my school and my classmates loved reading my stories, along with that I started trying to make animations along with the stories I created about them. College came and I had to make a choice, to take a program/degree that is aligned with my interests or to take one that would ensure me financial stability. I'm asian and live in a third world country under my parents who make minimum wage. So you could have guessed what I chose. I went with a degree that I had 0 interest in but had a lot of career oppurtunities and a nice salary - TECH/ENGINEERING. I excelled in it but it still felt like it wasn't my calling. At that time I felt like I was just trying to prove some thing to the world / to my parents?

10 years later after making that decision, I'm working overseas as a data engineer and making a pretty decent salary. (But I don't have any assets yet). I am also living with my boyfriend whom I met at college as we took the same program. I hate my job as it demands a lot from me and it doesn't spark my creative side. Lately I felt like my creative spark is gone. I seldom draw anymore. I don't write. I used to imagine a whole ass movie in my head before I sleep and now there's just nothing. My creativity has totally left me and realizing it right now is making me sad. I am so miserable and guilty because I should be thankful that I get to eat 3x a day and have decent work.

I thought being financially stable would be so rewarding but everything just feels so bleak. I wake up, I work, I sleep and it repeats. I know that I can use the money to sustain a lifestyle that I want but I don't even have a lifestyle or even a hobby that I enjoy anymore. On my off days I just lay down in bed or the sofa and watch tv and just wait for the next workday to come. I feel like a robot. And I'm scared of dying and regretting the time I wasted. But at the same time I am also too tired to do anything. There's this fear of doing anything wrong that would lead to me being 'unsuccessful'. If it all sounds familiar to you- yes I am diagnosed with anxiety and depression and been to countless therapists but nothing's changed. I feel like I'm in a cycle and I want to change but I cannot because the risk of losing everything I have right now is too great.

I wish there was a piece of paper that would tell me what I need to do to be finally be able to feel like I'm alive.",1678905958.0

I didn't do a good job of handling her souding like a zombie when we'd talk on the phone and I'd get frustrated that she seemed so cold and tired everytime we hung out. 

She kept saying how she acts isn't a reflection of how she feels and it didn't make sense to me.  I tried to be supportive but often times she'd just want to be alone and I took it all personal. 

She got diagnosed late last year and now blames our entire relationship struggle on being depressed. 

Thing is, anytime, anything bad happens (even outside of us) she bottoms out and either breaks up with me temporarily or becomes some what catatonic. 

I want to be supportive but this is so hard. I want to show her she's worth fighting for but when she's in a state, she's not even herself.

My sister didn’t had a good reaction to me being sad I don’t blame her at all but if someone is high I expect the other person to be calm and reassuring but my sister started crying with me and saying “I feel so depressed too” then boom I start panicking and making her promise me she wouldn’t commit suicide and I couldn’t tell if what I was living in the present moment was reality I felt like that before too when I got high so in my mind even tho my sister is standing in front of me what if that’s not true what if she’s laying somewhere with blood killing herself cause she’s depressed I hated being so paranoid so when she was sharing her personal stories with me I shut her up cause I didn’t want to hear her being sad

Now today I was going to ask her if she’s okay but she told me she doesn’t want to talk about anything ?!?

It's nice to not being crushed under so much self loathe and guilt, but still, every morning I don't know why am I alive. I still have to convince my body to move out of bed and repeat one million times ""move a little. Now get up. Get up. Get up"". I still struggle to remembering to eat or to have any kind of ambition or desire. Being with my husband is the only thing that brings me joy, which I guess is more than many people have, but of course we can't always be focused on each other, and I'm scared of how he feels spending time with me since I've become a bit boring lately, without interest of my own. 
 
I'm not really suicidal, just the tipe of slowly die of neglect, maybe. I need to find a way out of this, but therapy seems to have reached the limit, or it is way to slow.

787,The constant feeling of loneliness,1,11s81ru,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11s81ru/the_constant_feeling_of_loneliness/,0,"Throwaway account because last time an irl friend found out about my account and I was bullied for it.

Hi, so this gonna be a bit awkward as I'm currently struggling to put things together. I've been Linda lonely from a young age but I've never thought about it, I've always people to chill with near my area and never truly felt lonely other than if people asked me who my best friend was, cause quite frankly, I didn't have one that was until I turned 16 and I developed my first crush. Turns out she wasn't interested in me, and one of her friends became my best friend, who in turn helped me get over my crush. The ""friend"" in question was also my first ever friend who was a girl and was the first person that I felt genuine love and affection from. She had a very rough break up, and I helped her through, and she became quite vulnerable after that. Skip forward a little bit, and right after my 18th birthday, I left the country and went back to my home country alone, leaving my family behind. She was also from the same place, and she moved about a year before I did. I was very sad as I was leaving my family and all my friends behind and I'd be moving but I was happy at least I had my best friend with me. Our friendship slowly developed more and more, and it became an fwb thing. It went from a healthy, comfort, and safe space for both of us to a place that was very toxic for both of us and only used each other for our sexual desires. 2 years later, I guess she had enough, and she stopped talking to me completely. I kinda didn't care at the beginning, but after 2 months, it took over me. I turned to substance abuse to feel better about myself, I tried talking to other girls to get over her but it didn't work. I didn't really build any strong friendship after moving here, so I felt very alone since then. No family, no friends, no happiness, I contemplated suicide around that time. I couldn't go through with it at that time, because I couldn't leave my younger siblings like this who depend on me to be successful, my parents are old and retired, so if I couldn't do anything, I'd be leaving them to drown and I wanted to atleast fix that before I killed myself. Another 2 years pass by, and currently I started talking to her again. I knocked her back in December, apologising to her and was hoping to make things right again as evidently I couldn't live without her. She was in a very happy state of her life, so she accepted me back. I told her this time I loved her, and it was serious its been over 5 years that I've loved her and wanted it to be serious. She simply told me, she doesn't have enough love to give to anyone and has decided that she will get an arranged marriage this year. That kinda broke me, but it didn't stop us from being great friends again, turns out she wasn't okay after our split up as well, she tried many guys to rebound from me and ended up being more hurt. She is struggling with quite a lot but she made amazing friends who helped her along the way. On the other hand, I have not been doing any better for myself. I've been sober for about 6 months but recently I haven't been able to control myself at all. I feel so helplessly in love with a woman, who will never return it back. I don't have friends, I don't have a family with me. I just feel like I'm alone. I've been sobbing uncontrollably for the last few weeks. I can't keep a straight face at uni anymore, I end up breaking down omw to classes, or when I'm in the toilet. It's hard to get my work done on time as well, I've been struggling to keep my job as well. I'm a media buyer and recently because of all these feelings made an error which lead to a big loss of the business. I just feel so empty and lonely everyday. I met up with her few days ago, she seems to be struggling quite a bit as well. I can't do anything to help her and she seems to not really care about me anymore like that and it's breaking me apart. It feels like my world has been split into several pieces and I can't hold onto them anymore. I've recently started having suicidal thoughts again. I have been on anti depressants foe the past 8 months, it helped me for a while but again recently it's not been enough at all. I'm fucking up at my job, I probably lost the only girl that ever cared for me, I don't have friends or a family to share my thoughts anymore. I've not been eating at all recently, I usually make my own food but its so hard to get up and cook. I am losing a lot of weight, very quickly.  I dropped abiut 6kg in the last 2 months . I've been trying to talk to her, trying to maybe re ignite the spark we once had. She tells its not impossible but its probably improbable we can ever be together. If anyone had any experience regarding heart breaks like this, any tips to move on would be nice. I'm currently 22, I've only ever loved her, I've done enough to support my family, If I die tomorrow, nothing would happen, some might be a little sad but it wouldn't matter. I don't have many worldly possessions as well, I've lived a simple life saving every penny I could save to send back to my family but I'm quite rich now. I tried using money to solve the issue it didn't work, tried substance it didn't work, tried other women but couldn't get myself into anyone other than her. God, I'd give up everything I have to for us have another shot at it.

I do apologise for my English and grammar. Ita not my first language, so I probably made a lot of mistakes and this uncontrollable sobbing isn't making things any easier to type out. I get told I'm quite an attractive fellow, and I've had lots of girls to talk to and mess around. But no one comes remotely close to her in terms of anything. And this just makes it harder for me to move on, to not feel this alone in this world where there is 8 billion people but I'm struggling with a random girl I encountered when I was 16",1678911689.0

I'm 16 and i have my GCSE's coming up and at the end of the month i have to have finished two important things to do by the end of the month and i have absolutely no drive to get them done. I know i have to do them and there's a fear there i suppose but generally i just don't give a shit about anything.

I don't have friends or go out anywhere in my spare time and only really listen to music and write. I have no talents and i fail all of the tests that i actually try. I think that over the last few years my drop in grades is a sign that I'm just stupid. I've felt worse lately.

I know that there is a point but i just don't care. i don't see how anyone does.

i feel even worse knowing that in order to live 'happily' we have to settle for what everyone expects of us. we have to go to university and get married to the opposite gender in our 20s and then settle down and have kids all very quickly or else everyone will just ask 'when are you having kids?' or if you arent interested you're running out of time. I'm just sick and tired. i feel like I'm living the last 'happy' (even though I'm not) years of my life. when we become adults we all become depressed and have to sacrifice anything we are actually interested in. id like to be a writer but that's basically impossible to get big in and I'm obviously no good.

i feel like one day I'm going to just get sick and tired and end it. ill be surprised if i even make it to at least 25. i have no friends and that probably wont change, I'm lazy and untalented and sick of my life. why did i have this existence forced upon me?? i just want to float.

everyone i see around me has a thriving friend group, hopes for the future and a lack of virginity whilst I'm just sitting around rotting all day writing dumb stories and listening to music instead of bracing myself for whats to come. i am a disappointment.

the only thing other than writing that has excited me lately is writing political stuff on bathroom stalls and walls of my school. I get a real kick out of the idea of my school getting mad at the messages I'm writing even though I'm risking exclusion. i obviously don't want to get excluded because my parents would be enraged if they knew half of the shit I've written.

Between the rest required *for me* after I get in the zone rucking for an hour (10+ hrs of sleep the night of), gaming, everyday BS (chores, bills, groceries, etc), reading, watching stuff, napping when depressed AF to do the aforementioned...I'd say I'm functionally depressed. 

IMO you can get a runner's high/zone out much quicker/easier with rucking vs most other physical activities.

If you're looking for the next thing to help you through, try this.

He comes by it honestly: his mother and I are both dealing with it ourselves, and the last five years have seen his older brother hospitalized six times and left me with PTSD.


Youngest is an intensely private kid. He has friends on-line, and I hear him talking and laughing with them, but he doesn't talk to us about anything important. Nor will he talk to professionals;  we had a family therapist for several years and he flatly refused to participate in any way. We didn't push, because his brother was in a constant state of crisis that literally demanded our attention.


We've tried to make it clear to him that the only things that we want is for him to be healthy and happy, and that we're willing to help however we can, but his only response is that he doesn't want to talk about it.


It may well be that we're overreacting because of what we've gone through these past few years, but I don't think so. We just can't figure out any way to reach him, because he won't even crack the door for us.


Does anyone have any advice on how to get through his shell and allow us to help him? Even a little? His mom and I were raised by boomers whose tactics were, respectively, ""Snap out of it"" and emotional neglect, so we don't really have any good models here.

&#x200B;

My friend is very depressed. She has been for a long time. She struggles with a lot of stuff and I understand why she's sad. It has gotten a lot worse in the last few weeks. She will be very distant, and then respond and apologize for being distant and tell me she's worried about ruining what we have. She isn't talking to anyone from what I can tell.

In the last few days she has gone completely silent. No response. Not online once. No one's heard from her. I'm not sure if she's at school because I don't know enough of her peers to check.

I know she's tried to kill herself before. I'm not a stranger to these feelings, but I don't have it as bad as her so it's difficult.

I think she knows that I care about her. I've said every single reassuring thing I could think of. I've asked her if she wants space. I've asked her if it would help to go on a walk. I've called her. I've told her she's not dragging me down. 

And yet she's silent.

I'm kind of worried but I don't think she's going to do anything dangerous, I don't think she already has. Maybe that's a little denial but I really do think she'd reach out. I mean I'd reach out but I guess it's person-to person.

That was the last two years . I didn’t make any money and drained my savings. (Also credit card debit)It also cause me to put my self in a rut and I gained about 50lbs . I finally got out and now I can’t get my rhythm back (I’m actually pretty decent at sales and I enjoyed it prior ) now it feels like burden. I’ve also between that and other things have lost all interest in any hobbies and lost pretty any self esteem and confidence I had left . I also have a huge problem dating someone I’ve always had I’ve never really kept a relationship longer then 6-8 months before I find someone reason in my head to end it . The last girl I was with got pregnant…. Turned out it wasn’t mine and she was cheating on me the whole time so wasn’t mine even though she tried to trap me into it. So that broke a lot of trust I had or any at all with dating . I’ve fallen into this slump of just not wanting go on it feels like everything I’ve worked towards is crumbling in around me and I can’t escape it I have no energy no meaning . It feels like anytime I try it goes no where or it comes back to just to hurt me . My daughter is the only thing really keeping me going at this point …. My mom killed herself when I was 18 and I would never pass my pain to her if that makes sense … but I just keep living like this . I won’t even check my mail anymore because the anxiety of bad news makes me freak out . I’ve been losing sleep because my brain is running scenarios of what I did wrong or how everyone doesn’t like me . That’s pretty constant throughout the day. Thanks for any advice.,1678893932.0

In 2019 I had a nervous breakdown. I was driving to work when this terrible feeling came over me. I thought I was having a heart attack. Came home early, felt this sickening feeling of dread, terror, and impending doom come over in such strong waves I thought I was dying… scary thing is, I didn’t know what it was, or what was happening to me… which intensified everything. I quickly got worse, to the point I couldn’t get out of bed.
I just laid there with something that could be closely related to akithesia. I couldn’t stop moving and shaking. And the terror on top of it made me petrified… I still wasn’t on any meds yet cuz I still didn’t know what was happening.

I then went to a holistic doctor, who was very expensive and did absolutely nothing but aggravate my symptoms and made them worse.

He finally gave up. Couldn’t figure it out. One day it had gotten so bad I literally called my primary doctor and managed to get to the doctor. I trembled and rocked back and forth in the waiting room. It was like I was having a continual panic attack 24/7… no sleep on top of it! Everything looked like it was happening in a horror movie. I went inside the doctor’s office and they looked at me and said they couldn’t help because I was so sick, that I needed a mental health specialist. I managed to get myself to a psychiatrist and they treated me with lexapro and Xanax. I did not take the Xanax, but started lexapro. It slowly pulled me out of the nasty pit of terror… but when my psychiatrist increased the dose of lexapro I had a floor encountering panic attack.. laid me out for 3 days. Switched to Trintellix. Finally and gradually got better…..",1678893645.0

When my friends told me this I came home with a panic attack and my anxiety about the news spreading went over the roof. Only person whom I treated so badly in the past was there for me who’s my ex girlfriend, the sweetest girl on the planet. She was affected by all of that but was still helped me to get my anxiety and panic attack calm down.

I didn’t do anything wrong with the girl, i was super respectful the whole time. I just want my ex back because she understands me, and helps me deal with this world but i took her for granted and took out all my anger on her.

Only to find out 2 months later that she never really liked me and she only said yes in the moment. Even tho i cared for her, me breaking up with her somehow made me happy.

I can't tell anyone I know because they don't know what to do either.

I fucking hate it. I hate that i'm such a little bitch. All I do is whine and complain and do nothing. I'm the average, i'm the fraud, the negative influence.
I want to off myself and I can't even answer whether that is selfish or not. Yet at the same time, i'm too afraid to go through with it.

I plead to be someone else while there are people who have and do suffer far more than me and still get ahead despite it.

I want to give up. I want to throw myself away.

I want to be left behind but whose fucking choice is that? Mine.

I've considered ECT as an end game option. The possibility of memory loss would be very problematic for my job. I also live alone and would not have transportation to and from ECT sessions.

I am not in a place to organize my thoughts,  so if you stick around I thank you for it. 


I have been quite honest with therapist the past few weeks, in that I feel worse off now than I ever really have before. The intrusive thoughts are relentless, the night terrors as well. I don’t want to die, but I don’t like this existence. I haven’t told her just how desperate I am to disappear for the people in my life who deserve better. I’m afraid that if I am truly honest, I’ll get hospitalized and my life will be ruined. 

Yesterday I had a doctors appointment with my autoimmune specialist because my thyroid function has worsened inexplicably. I’ve lost a fair amount of weight, so in theory it should be getting better but it’s not. It takes months for this to regulate—over two years I’ve been treating it but for some reason, over the past 4 months, my thyroid function has been set back significantly. I was vulnerable and told her all of the things I struggle with and she pretty much said “I can only help you with your thyroid, but let me give you a hug and up your prescription.” 

I feel that I’m seeing a trend. A scary trend that people talk about on here and in general when it comes to the “help” that is available. I’m crying out. I’m telling my doctors and my husband that I don’t feel right, that the pressure is too much, that the only joy and peace I have is on the weekends and even those are cut short by needing to rest and recoup. That it’s agony to fail at everything. And the most I really get is *:/ let me know if there’s anything I can do for you.* I want to be able to take time off from my demanding job and heal. I don’t want to be disabled by the various things going on with me, but I can’t manage being a mom, a wife, an employee, and my health. Let alone, find time to enjoy living. My fear of rejection is holding me back from being able to explore what I feel I need. I don’t want people to think I’m lazy or unmotivated. I feel hopeless.",1678889193.0
839,How do I stop thinkning.,1,11rxciy,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11rxciy/how_do_i_stop_thinkning/,0,"My father packed up and left my family thanksgiving 2021, and moved overseas back home to Europe. We were never really close and long story short my parents had a marriage that shouldn't have existed. They should have divorced ages ago or better yet never married. They only stayed together because of religion, but my brother turned 18 in 2021 and the next week my dad filed for divorce in Europe during his summer trip. He came back a few days after the 4th of July and just dropped the news on us. Fast forward to now- we risked losing our family home to auction twice, and ultimately were able to sell it. Now I support everyone financially in a small 2 bedroom a few towns over from where our home was. I don't support everyone entirely, my mother is buying her and my brother food from her savings from years ago when she worked prior to having us- and she and my brother have insurance through the state. Everything else though- my pockets.

***Anyway***, my main issue. I think about my father 24/7. Any time there is a moment where my mind isn't thinking or focusing about something else- he comes into my mind. It's not like ""oh I wonder where he is right now or what he is doing."" I just see his face, or have flashbacks of some of the key few moments leading up from divorce to him driving away the last time. No sadness, no guilt, just neutral thoughts and feelings. Initially at least. The more I accept the thoughts the more my feelings get involved. Anytime I see a truck that looks like his did I instantly fill up with rage and all these memories come flooding in.

My father was the sole breadwinner at home and my mother refused to work. That was just the lifestyle that they both grew up with in Europe. My father didn't see that here in his circle and constantly complained that he wanted to be like everyone else and that all his coworkers wives etc worked. My mother would always come back with that his boss' wives never did work nor did their kids' finances, or any of her friends. It was always back and forth between who is working and who isn't. My father worked in construction and made a decent income. 60-90k a year depending on overtime hours, projects etc. He always worked under the table on weekends so it was probably more towards 70-75 a year on average. I would know- I did their taxes as long as I could remember.

Now that I am in the same position I think to myself how shitty it feels. To come home to my nagging mother who always wants something from me, and doesn't respect me at all. I'm the type of person where I want to just come home from my desk job and be to myself to decompress. Instead I am met with words a million miles an hour thrown at me ""how was your day?"" ""what did you do at work?"" etc followed by stories of her day etc. I always tell her to give me some space and we can talk later. I'm always met with ""you hate me, why are you so mean to me?"" etc. All I want to do is change into some comfy clothes and make/have dinner. I have a routine of coming home and making dinner/lunch for the next day, then eating it. After dinner I always pack the leftovers I purposely cooked for lunch the next day and repeat every day. You'd think she'd listen to me after telling her daily I just want to decompress but no. Not even putting in my headphones while cooking will do anything, it just makes her scream or come over and stand in my way in our already cramped kitchen.

Was this what my father felt? Did it excuse him for just leaving us? I mean I get it, if this is why he did what he did but god damn did he handle it like shit. I constantly tell myself it is different in my situation. The last thing I want to do is sympathize or forgive the monster that told me I was too fat to be his kid and left me to be my mothers new husband and a pathetic excuse of a father to my brother. But... I can't not see where he was coming from. I just don't get why he did what he did. I could never and I don't even have kids. (for context I am 25). If I had a wife like my mother and two kids I couldn't just make them homeless- despite how my mother is treating me now, yet why do I not have more hate towards my father? Why do I constantly think of him. Why don't I want him dead? Why am I more mad at my brother and mother than I am at him? Don't get me wrong- I think my father is scum and deserves to be in prison for what he is doing. I won't even go into the details of the divorce case as it is still pending in both Europe and here.

Is all this because he isn't around and I just have to treat someone like shit and it might as well be the two people I share an apartment with?

Please reddit. Diagnose me with something or tell me what I can do to shut this stupid brain of mine off. I can't sleep, I can't smile, nothing that used to bring me joy brings me any anymore. I have no attention span. I can't focus on anything for long enough to just forget. I've turned to video games more because it seems to be the only thing that distracts me for longer than half an hour.

 In 2021 I met a very nice girl, we talked a lot, and we became friends. Just friends. I also didn't want it to become something else. 
But then I got replaced. Several times. We still met each other and did things together however.
But then 2022 came. I hate to say it, but I think it's my Fault. When 2022 started, there was a Week, where we won't Chat or do anything with each other. And she thought of it, as if I wanted to end the friendship. 
I Became depressed, because she wouldn't Text me, ask me if anything is alright or just talk to me.
I Became suicidal, I wanted to end it all. I just wanted to live, but I couldn't. My friends all told me 'to just get over it' and think of happy things. But all my happy memories are with her.
I can remember going through town with her, playing piano together, doing all sorts of stuff. I remember playing videogames with her, being in the woods with her. I can't forget it. No matter how hard I try. She's on my mind. Always.
However, in the summer holidays of 2022 I started texting her again, I wanted to be with her so fucking badly. But she had a new friend. And I wasn't of matter anymore. 
She always promised me, that we are very good friends and she definitely wanted to hang out with me again.
Spoiler alert. She didn't.
When In September our inevitable year anniversary as friends came, I tried to plan something with her. But it didn't matter. Instead, she went on to hang out with the new friend.
In November, they eventually got in a relationship and I was completely down. I was starving myself, cause I wanted to end this shit so fucking badly.
Then, on Christmas Eve, I saw them, being happy, while I was crying in my room. I couldn't deal with it. It was worse than before but let's skip January and February 2023. 
Fast forward, March. I tried so hard to save our friendship, but it made the whole situation the worst it has ever been. One morning, a friend of mine send me an Audio, clearly by her. In that Audio, she said, that she never thought of our friendship any way near good. She always thought, that I was okay with her replacing me every now and then, then setting a spark of hope in me, and then letting me fall again. 
When I then spoke with her about that Audio, she told me the whole truth. She lied to me the whole time. She didn't think of it as important. After 2021 the friendship meant nothing to her anymore. 
Okay, so, last night, I was casually laying in bed, texting with a friend, when a thought struck me. I remembered the first time we met at her house. Then, every single memory is right in front of me. I start crying, and I cried for half an hour. Why did all this happen? Why did I mean nearly nothing to her? Why did she lie to me?",1678887540.0

Outside there is basically no life, no real flowers anywhere and a bunch of half dead looking trees. There are no local riding trails or really any parks for jumping bikes. We'll 1 bike park and a bunch of ""walking"" trails. Along those walking trails you are more likely to see trash then actual flowers.

Then you got all the idiots trying to survive working a meaningless job and wondering why life is so hard... Sorry you make your life off of selling dead animals/vegetables that someone else is having you put together..  McDonald's for example, literally doing nothing except heating something frozen, You are a life-sized microwave! Then these same people think every job should pay a living wage... Probably the same Jerks that think 10$ a week allowance can actually buy something... Please tell me how you are going to afford the guys sweeping the floor, washing the dishes, or cleaning the restrooms when the only thing making money is the food items selling... Ya real smart trying to make a profit selling a bunch of cheap items that nobody actually needs. Literally I can pay 1.25$ at this very moment and have it heated and ready to eat before you even get into that dumb line...

Then you got these stupid places like Walmart which are basically China junk warehouses... Same plain Jane items for everyone! It's like you wouldn't even know plates use to look different or have designs on them.

Then you idiots out here are paying for ""Car insurance"" but it doesn't actually insure the dumb thing is going to work... nah you can blow up your engine driving off the lot after you just bought it and the insurance isn't going to do anything.. now that's what I call coverage!

So you pay monthly for your car that takes you to work and allows you to gather your groceries... More like you waste your time and money driving somewhere that you are going to slave for someone else and grab items that came out of the ground.

I honestly think that 95% of you people couldn't even figure out how to grow. Potato.

Don't get me started on the idiots who think their opinion should mean something when they have no actual relation to the situation... If you force that woman to keep that child YOU should be physically responsible for its WHOLE life! The mother is already stating she doesn't want it... gonna be a real loving life for that kid...

Then you got these other idiots looking at pixelated distorted images that look like nothing and they think they are ufos! Lmao you morons it's more like tears in the ozone you are seeing there are no space crafts from other worlds... You know how I know? Because a species doesn't just ""become"" that advanced over night, So if they are visiting us they have been forever and it changes NOTHING 

Now we got people piggy backing of others videos because they think we want their opinion... nope you are usually not adding anything to the video and now that person doesn't get their video watched... 100% parasitic 

I mean ya'll are actually parasites in the eyes of mother nature(myself included) She doesn't need us killing our beauty and creating these eyesores someone calls a house.. 

Don't get me started on how ugly the modern day house is...

I need to be big, better, smarter, funnier, better looking so i built my self up in the outside and im stuck to this person i dont even know and Dont even like(me) and in the inside i beat my self down sometimes severely. Then i think maybe if i get my shit together have a perfect grade and a perfect life and all the stuff i wanted that will fill a hole. So i study hard like hard but these things doesn't work out for me and now i gotta deal with big dreams and feeling like a failure and even if it do work out and i make it to the top and i get all the shits I've always i think that would make me happy but when i get there im gonna look around and say ""now what?"" Something's still missing, time passes the emptiness is still sitting festering, formenting, becoming toxic. It changes me making me bitter critical and self centered so i blame everyone and everything around me for not fulfilling me. Ultimately im tired im done searching i just don't care and i give up trying to solve the mystery of the ""Big dark infinity hole"" and just deal with it. Perfectly fine to stringing together distraction and stimulation to get me or through keeping me ""MODERATELY SATISFIED"" till the day i die of course at the outside no one will never know everything appears going great to them exactly how I want it to go, exactly how i planned it together.

English is not my first language. This is in Thailand if that matters. Disclaimer: I may use terms wrong. I don't know much about mental health.  

My(32m) wife(31f) and I have had a very tough and stressful start to our marriage(5years). Mainly economically, but also in terms of responsibilities to her family and tragedies happening.

Shit life syndrome makes sense. We can both definitely point to several things as the reason for feeling depressed. I am not sure if it is ""just"" that or if she has developed ""actual"" depression. I'm not doing great myself either. But I can't focus on that unfortunately. She is much worse. 

For years as this has become worse she has had suicidal intrusive thoughts, and for a few weeks now has said she is afraid of losing control. She also told me she had started to write a suicide note to her mom, but not to me yet. 

This made her finally agree to seek proffesional help after her mom and I had a mini intervention. She agreed and we went to a local clinic on her break from work. She got to see a Psychologist emmediatly. She had expressed worry about getting drugs as she doesn't want to become a zombie without emotion (her words).

She was in there for an hour and got out with a prescription for xanax, tryptanol, deanxit, and sertraline. This was quite shocking to me as she hasn't even been diagnosed yet. She got an appointment to come back next week but it didn't seem they discussed a treatment plan or anything.

I talked with a local friend who has experience with his son having schizophrenia and he said the local hospitals don't have the skills to deal with mental health and just prescribe stuff to earn money. And recommended a famous facility that specializes in this. 

Yesterday she took the pills for the first time and. Yeah. Zombie. Slurred speech. Vacant look. I had to get her home from work because she was almost falling asleep standing. She went straight to bed and slept 10 hours. It is first today evening she starts to look ""there"" and feel like herself again and now it's time to take them again.

I am so afraid these medicines are going to mess her brain up and make things worse. I don't know what to do. I tried to suggest going to that better specialized facility that my friend recommended. But now she has already started ""treatment"" at this current place and is very hesitant to change.

Only has every other week appointments. From the start she would send texts offering any openings she had during the off weeks 

The other day I was bawling. My life is unmanageable as they say in codependents anonymous and I was struggling hard. I felt the whole fucking world had it in for me randomly and spitefully. (I felt like a victim and I get it that this is not attractive behavior. 

But I thought I could cry in therapy 


And have feelings validated? 

She very indirectly said I need to cut that shit out. Only with such flowery language that I felt like she was saying something nice to me. Like she phrased it as “I would be wasting your time if I didn’t redirect towards getting better” and then a few days ago (and several sessions later) while I was describing this to a friend, I realized it was perhaps her way of saying, that I am wasting HER time but it was spun to sound altruistic. 

Meanwhile ever since that happened she no longer offers any openings between the twice monthly appointments. 

Am I nuts? Until she basically called me out for not wanting to get better, she sent the odd openings every other week. 

I think she thinks I am help resistant and that I’ve got no interest in getting better. That I hold unreasonable grudges. Due to people I mention when I am very upset. 

I feel like I am not accepted as I am. I DO want to change. And I have been through very painful times in the last 7 years. Do I not get to cry about it or process it?

850,Depression,3,11romzk,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11romzk/depression/,0,"What’s the difference between being sad and being depressed? 
Well with depression even with the best circumstances and fruits that life can offer, a person with depression will still suffer considerably. There are many people who seem to have everything Family, friends, wealth and health yet they still feel that soul crushing void and a longing to escape. It may seem hard to understand but a person with depression will want to end it even if they are happy. On the other end of the spectrum there are people with nothing who are perfectly contempt.  You may not suffer from depression you may just suffer from sadness due to life’s circumstances. Sadness and the majority of suffering stem from an inability to change one’s circumstances. Attachment to life’s circumstances is why we suffer. We want to be healthy, we want to feel accepted, we want to be accomplished and it’s perfectly human to want those things. The main thing to ask yourself when you’re are frustrated is can I change it?
Can I do anything to improve my situation?
And often change is difficult and is a suffering of its own. 
It’s hard to quit an addiction.
It’s hard to get in shape.
It’s hard to be and maintain a relationship.
It’s hard to find a job or career that will sustain you and leave you feeling accomplished.
How are you going to do all that when you can’t even muster the strength to take a shower and brush your teeth.  The truth is there is nothing I or anyone else can say or do to cure you from all of life’s suffering.  People often feel that they have to go to extremes just to see any progress and this couldn’t be farther from the truth. Often extremes are difficult to maintain and are just not practical.
Consistency is key however small and perseverance conquers all. 
Can’t quit an addiction? Make it a goal to take less everyday. 
Can’t  brush your teeth? Just use some mouthwash real quick. 
Can’t workout? Just go the gym and do anything however small.
Can’t have a relationship? Just ask one person out.
Can’t maintain a relationship? Just do one thing to try to improve it today.
Can’t find a job? Just fill out one application. Getting started is usually the biggest and most frustrating part.  Once you start it gets easier even though it may never be easy. And who knows maybe when you go to use some mouthwash and wash your face you’ll find the strength to brush your teeth and take a shower. Maybe you’ll go to the gym expecting to be there for 15 min and end up staying for an hour and absolutely crush it.
So what do you do when you  can’t do anything to improve a situation? Accept it and let go and that’s most difficult thing anyone can do.",1678863174.0

TLDR: I dont want to get into friendships or relationships because I have been hurt a lot in the past and I tend to isolate myself, and its driving me crazier by the day.

I (23F) have had social anxiety for as long as I remember. I was so cheerful and full of ideas as a kid, but between being bullied by my classmates and neglected by my (well meaning but busy) parents and teachers, I developed social anxiety and was very scared of others. I have had very few friends growing up, and most of them were toxic. One who affected me a lot was my best friend for some time but things got really toxic between us, and she gaslit me into thinking I was the reason she was treating me so badly. It was borderline abusive. The guys I've dated were the same, they were all emotionally unavailable and gave me breadcrumbs, making me feel like I am too much.

Now, I have been working on myself and going to therapy, and I can recognize a lot of patterns in my past. However, I am unable to progress to the next stage. I can't talk to people or make new friends or date, because I was traumatized by friends and exes, and I am afraid to let anyone close. I am afraid even to talk to people on a surface level, even to my classmates or my neighbours. It is driving me crazy every day to spend all my free time in my room, only stepping out for classes and groceries. I have decent social skills but nowhere to use them. I could go out to events where I know no one, like extracurricular events in my uni but it gets too overwhelming to get started even. Sometimes it is just easier to slip into my maladaptive daydreams and stay in my room.

I recognize that this is unhealthy. I'm just not sure how to proceed. I feel really lonely and I try to block it out by scrolling or youtube, and now my studies and work are being compromised. I try getting into a routine every day but I can't. I always wake up late, just in time for class and come home exhausted. And my sleep cycle and my diet is bad. I am cooking for myself for the first time, and it is very overwhelming. It is hard to deal with all of this at the same time.

Thank you so much for reading until the end. I am a good person and I am trying to be the best I can, but I am not able to heal or progress beyond recognizing these patterns. Please let me know if you have any advice. Or any points of view. Would really appreciate it.",1678849167.0

My dad and my sister basically raised me and my younger brother. My mom left my sister when she was a new born but then she came back around to my dad and then they got pregnant with me. My mom started to come around more but she was never really a “mother” to me or my siblings. She is also extremely narcissistic and she is an alcoholic and she has been that way for the entire duration I’ve known her. As a child, she would get so fucked up and say some of the most hurtful things to me and later on when i would bring it up to her, she would gaslight me and say “I never said/did that to you!” My dad would then get mad at me for saying something about it.

As a child, I didn’t understood that she was a functional alcoholic so when she would tell me that she never did or said something, I would think that she was right, and maybe I was just imagining something that she said but now as an adult looking back, I realize I wasn’t “crazy” or hearing things. She would just say anything when she is intoxicated. As an adult she still is this way but it’s gotten much worse. I’ve told my dad a little bit how I felt and my siblings have also. She’s slowly killing herself by having all of this alcohol and he does snap at her but it just isn’t enough and it isn’t fair to me or the rest of us that we have to just “deal with it”. We literally have to tolerate her but if I or my siblings were acting the same way she does, all hell would break loose. Basically in other words, there are double standards. She was never there for me as a parent and now that I’m an adult, she wants to interfere and be involved with my life but I don’t trust her at all. My siblings are pretty much done trying to build a relationship also and I have already moved out of their house once before a few years ago and I’m ready to move out again. I just can’t take it anymore.

When I was 18, I got into my first real relationship. Everything was ok for the first couple of months, then that is when the red flags started to come to light. He was also very narcissistic. He would yell at me, belittle me, call me every name in the book. Kept bumming money and food from me. Cheated on me by texting other girls a few times. When i would threaten to leave, he would get emotional and cry. I felt compelled to stay with him. 

I literally had no business being in a relationship with this person and back then, I didn’t understand that. I thought that how I was being treated was “normal” because I would see my parents kind of do some or say the same things so in my naive mind, I thought this was “normal” in a relationship. After about 6 months of dating, it started to get too much. He would blow up on me and just yell at me for hours on end. 8 months in, when got into an argument once again but this time, he got a bit physical. He pushed me on the bed and he was just verbally abusing me. This went on with him acting this way from 12 am to 4am. I attempted to call the cops on him and he confiscated my phone out my hand. I was also half naked & he was blocking the door which was preventing me to leave. 

I broke up with him on the spot. Went to bed barely then I went to work and told my coworker about it. I don’t generally like involving others in my business but I knew if I kept my mouth shut I could end up dead. He begged and pleaded for another chance over and over. He had an obsession with me and did not respect my boundaries. My coworker took me home that day and he was sitting on my apartment staircase waitin for me. It was very creepy and scary. Immediately my coworker sees him and she tells me to get back into the car. 

It was bad. The calls and texts from him got pretty desperate. When is block him he’d give my number out to his friends and then they would harass me. He bought me flowers at work as an attempt to reconcile. Never gave me flowers while in a relationship. He was starting to do all of the things that I was complaining about in the relationship. I ended having to get a new number, email address and blocked his ass EVERYWHERE. Including PS4 & cashapp because he would use ANYTHING to contact me. He kept coming to my apartment unannounced, the he was harassing my dad to talk to me. I told my dad he’s crazy and to block his number. I actually went on my dad’s phone and blocked him myself just to make sure he would never message my dad again. The stalking behavior ended after I changed my number, deleted my Facebook and blocked him on all socials. This went on approximately a year before it all stopped. 

He threatened that he would kill me so I called 311 wrote a report and the cops went to us house I guess and talked to him

Then 6 months ago. I’ve had 2 deaths in My family back to back. My aunt died from cancer and a month later, my cousin died from cancer as well. I’ve never experienced anyone close to me passing as an adult. It’s been tough. I’ve been using weed to cope but now I’m interested in trying other drugs to cope. 

People that I thought were my friends betrayed me badly. One of them lied to me about a lot of stuff and then she moved back to her home city and didn’t even bother to see me. She lives 5 minutes from me but she was always available to call me and be in my business. She reached out a couple of time but I ghosted her and never responded. Now that I’ve stopped dealing with her, she does everything to get my attention. Likes, comments on my pictures. I still don’t really say much to her but it’s just funny how now I no longer talk to her she’s trying to get my attention. When I was her friend she never was consistent with me and now she is commenting on my stuff ? I don’t get it.

The unfortunate thing is I have a serotonin deficiency so it can be really difficult to fight off the depression. It feels like when I’m happy I’m neutral when I’m neutral I’m sad and when I’m sad I’m suicidal. There have been times in my life where I have been able to go decent periods of time where it doesn’t effect me too much but as far back as I remember I think I’ve spent more of my life in a deep depression than not.

I’ve only attempted once before, in high-school and it didn’t take, after that I’d get really depressed but never to the point of planning an actual suicide. However every year that passes it feels like I’m making no progress in my life, like I’m just spinning my wheels, and every year I think about it more and more. I’ve gotten to a point in my life where the depressive episodes are more frequent and last longer and I can force myself to carry on with my responsibilities but nothing seems to bring me any joy, it feels like I’m not even here half the time, like my brain is just in a void while my body goes through the motions on its own. I think about how I wish I would die every day now, it’s getting really hard to find reasons to keep trying to make improvements to my life. Sometimes I feel like I’m cursed, it seems as tho bad situations and loss are attracted to me. I feel like I can’t escape it, constant failure and disappointment in myself and others, repeatedly getting hurt by people I trust and care deeply for, and losing the things that do bring me joy. When I find something that makes me happy it feels as tho the universe or god or whatever finds a way to turn it into something that hurts me. Everything I want feels so out of reach, but the worst part is I don’t just not get anything that makes me happy, I get it briefly and then it’s very quickly taken right back away, I feel like the only thing worse than not getting the things that bring you joy is getting them and then watching them be taken away or lost. I try to be hopeful that I someday I’ll find something or things that bring me joy that aren’t fleeting but the more time passes the less I believe it will ever happen. Sometimes I feel like the powers that be are playing a sick game with me to see how much it takes to completely break someone beyond repair, it feels like the universe wants me to kill myself. I’m losing my resolve, I don’t know how much more I can’t take it’s like I’m losing the ability to feel joy at all even the little things that usually help do nothing for me now. I feel empty inside and sometimes I feel as though I’m on the verge of a full on psychotic-break, like one day I’m just going to lose touch with reality and walk out into the desert to die. I don’t know what to do anymore, I don’t know who to turn to, I feel as though I can trust nobody not to hurt me but isolation feels just as bad.

It's like they think I'm just being dramatic or seeking attention. But the truth is, I feel like I'm drowning in my own thoughts and I don't know how to get out.

I've tried to reach out to friends and family, but they either don't understand or they tell me to just ""think positive"" or ""get over it."" It's not that simple. If it were, I wouldn't be feeling this way in the first place.

I'm tired of feeling like a burden or like I'm being judged for something that's completely out of my control. I just want someone to listen to me and offer me some support. Is that too much to ask?

I know that mental health is still stigmatized in our society, but that doesn't mean we should ignore it. We need to start treating mental health just as seriously as we do physical health. It's not something that can just be brushed aside or solved with a quick fix.

So please, if someone you know is struggling with their mental health, don't dismiss them. Take the time to listen and offer your support. It could make all the difference.",1678865456.0

872,Beauty is the most important thing about being human and that is killing me from inside,2,11rntb9,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11rntb9/beauty_is_the_most_important_thing_about_being/,0," I'm sorry if this post upsets you in any way, but I need to vent about this and put it somewhere else other than in my mind. I hope you can understand that this doesn't come from a place of hate with the desire to make other people feel bad about themselves but from a place of pain where I just need to make sense out of this.

 I've seen poets write about the beauty of many different things, from the sea to the sky but almost everywhere I look I see people lying about the importance of human beauty, if your parents had the decency to give birth to a child with good genetics you're probably clueless about this aspect of the human experience, but if like me you're not so lucky you'll feel the consequences of that throughout your entire life.
 
 I feel anxious, awkward, and even inherently wrong in social situations because I know I'm nowhere near being pretty, I've always known that, even as a child I always felt different due to my ugliness, recently it's gotten to a point where I struggle to even go outside and expose myself to the world, I know ugly people are often not even noticed by the majority of people but how can you feel confident or even attribute any value to yourself if you see yourself as less or broken because you lack the most important trait someone can have? They say you'll crave the thing you don't have, so I guess it makes sense why I feel this way.

 Some people will tell you that beauty doesn't really matter, that being beautiful on the outside and empty on the inside is one of the worst things that could ever happen to someone, and while there's some truth to that it doesn't really matter, because no matter how intelligent, honest, patient or responsible you are you still need to have some beauty because that's the gateway to be recognized in some way by someone because, at the end of the day, we are still creatures with natural instincts and being attractive is the first and most important thing to succeed in a social environment and society is based on social interactions.

 Some people say that I should stop judging people by their appearances and that I shouldn't be so hard on myself, but how can I not see that if I have eyes to see? Am I supposed to lie and try to convince myself that I'm somehow beautiful the way I am and that beauty standards don't exist?

 I wish more than anything that I was beautiful, or at least not ugly because I think that beauty is the most important thing about life, I know beauty doesn't last forever, but I still wish I could experience it at least once in my entire life because is the thing I care the most, other things like friends, building a family, money and a career just don't have the same weight on them and they all seem pointless without beauty.

 I know it doesn't make sense to say this, but sometimes I even feel anger towards beautiful people, as if they were given a gift and they don't even recognize that, often all it takes for me to have a depressing day is to just look at someone who isn't ugly. 

 Ugliness is like a sickness that doesn't allow you to live or be happy, I wish I could take it away, I wish I was pretty. I'm tired of myself.",1678860395.0
873,Feeling like I turn people against me because I'm an idiot and I can't help it,2,11rnlc6,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11rnlc6/feeling_like_i_turn_people_against_me_because_im/,2,"I feel like everywhere I go I somehow manage to get people to dislike or hate me. I have been told many times throughout my life that I am weird. I hate hearing that so much, even my friends have said it to me. I don't care if there is no real normal, or if there's nothing wrong with being weird in some ways, It just feels like a reminder that I will never be accepted by most people. I was bullied consistently throughout my childhood and as an adult I still feel afraid that the people around me will taunt me or spread negative things about me to others. I feel like it's in peoples nature to be senselessly cruel and to take advantage of any weakness once they see it in you to make themselves feel better.

I'm in school right now. I go to a large university but my major is relatively small. I see a lot of the same people in my classes. I want to get along with people and form connections, but I'm constantly getting negative feedback from other people. I can sense that my lack of social graces makes other people uncomfortable and I'm worried that I'm starting to develop a negative reputation. What's worse is that I know that a lot of these people I'm very likely to see in my future career if I continue living in the same state. 

I can't help but feel like I'm a fool. I've tried with varying success throughout my life to understand other people and learn how to get along better. Recently I have fallen into a habit of regular drug use, alcohol, cannabis, various others. I think many people would consider my use moderate but I know that it affects me more than most people because honestly I've always been a stupid person and I can feel the impact its had on my mental health and on my cognition. I also know these impairments have negatively impacted my anxiety and social skills, making people like me less and spiraling my depression. At this point even if I stopped I don't think I would get all of my mind back. I feel like I'm in hell. I don't know what to do anymore. I've worked myself out of a depressive state before but I don't know if I can do it again. It feels too hard now. I don't think I would ever commit suicide, because frankly I'm just too scared, but it just feels like things are only going to keep getting worse until I die. 

I hope that made any kind of sense. If anyone has some advice to give me about all of this I'd appreciate it. Thanks",1678859663.0

I was depressed, maybe since i'm 17, (i'm 23) i don't really know, and then realized i was a trans guy at 21yo. I thought depression would go away and it did, at least it was getting better. When my therapist said i might have depression and my doctor gave me antidepressant, i thought ""hey! i'm not just a piece of shit, it's actually depression! :D"" and i was happy that ppl see it. But now i feel like i'm losing the fight and that my life will never change. Even tho i'm more open/joyful than before, even tho i feel more comfortable, sociable and hopeful, thanks to my transition, i feel like nothing will ever change, cause deep inside, i'm still always scared of everything, i don't know what i want to do and if i'll ever want to do anything in my life. I just don't want to live at all!

I do nothing at work, barely. My boss just gave up on me cause i'm useless. She's always angry at everyone and it's so hard to go talk to her and not feeling hurt and scared. She says she's not yelling but that's the only way she can speak. I try to feel lucky cause i still get paid, but i hate to feel so useless, worthless. I don't change job yet cause i need to stay here til i got my top surgery done. But even then, i have no idea what to do in my life, and i feel like things will never get better anyway. I'm just so weird and anxious about everything.  I just can't enjoy life, it's impossible. I could never be independant, i'll always be a burden for my parents.

Even doing things that are important for me is hard : it took me so much time to plan my top surgery, because administrative stuff is such a nightmare. Sometimes i feel like i don't deserve it, that i'm no trans enough, because i'm not getting it done fast enough.  On the other hand, it kills me to have to wait so long, i wish i would be operated rn so bad.

I used to talk so much to my therapist, she was so useful/helpful to me, but now i don't know what to tell her anymore, my brain is empty, i know i feel in pain but idk what to say bc nothing will change anyway. There's no issue. I've been complaining, i've been helped, by my friends and family too, and still i'm here complaining again. Because i'm the problem.

I don't want to bother my friends anymore, so i just talk here cause idk what to do :(

Depressed as all hell.",1,11roqaz,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11roqaz/24_year_old_male_unemployed_with_a_college_degree/,1,"Hello Reddit I hardly ever make posts on this site but I need to rant and get some things off my chest. Apologies since it is 2:30am where I am at and I’m on mobile.

I used to work at a sales job for about a year before I started having panic attacks before making calls. I was always nervous making calls until around Christmas 2022 where I started to have severe panic attacks and realized I needed a change in careers. I tried to find a new job in the company I worked for but they wouldn’t have any jobs available until July at the beginning of their fiscal year. So I decided to put in my two week notice and quit. 

Since then I have fallen into a deep depression. I’ve had depression since hs but it came back full force once I decided to quit my job. I had a mental breakdown and decided to finally get some help with a therapist. I’ve been seeing a therapist for a little over a month now and have been put on medication (lexapro and aripiprazole). I know there are people who agree and those who disagree with taking antidepressants, but I know what I’m feeling is not due to them. 

I have since started therapy applied to around a dozen jobs and all have rejected me or haven’t gotten back with me yet. But tonight feels like a breaking point from me when I was rejected a job at TARGET fucking TARGET!! I worked my goddamn ass off to get a degree in psych (which I don’t really want to do) and I can’t even work at target. I’ve applied to so many jobs and gotten help in trying to get some jobs from family friends, none have been successful.

I feel like a fucking worthless waste who is jobless and is using his saving to pay rent at an apartment. I always joked that I would rather jump off a cliff than work at McDonalds or Walmart but at this rate I’m going to have to apply to a place like that soon. I’m angry and tired and feel like a complete failure. Fucking target won’t even hire me. I feel like a complete waste of a human being who has mo direction and no path in life. 

I’m thousands of dollars in debt and paying rent and can’t find a job anywhere where I could see myself being remotely happy. 

I don’t want to die, but I don’t want to live anymore. If that makes sense. I feel like I’m going to end up working at some gas station for the rest of myself because I have too many things tying myself down to this life. I just feel like a complete joke to my friends and family. 

If you have a job, keep it, it’s scary out here.",1678863496.0

I’ve been having to change my sheets so often that I needed to buy an extra duvet cover and at this point should probably just wash the actual duvet.

900,Treatment Resistant Depression - Running out of options,1,11ro8d6,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11ro8d6/treatment_resistant_depression_running_out_of/,0,"I don’t know if this is to vent or what but here goes. 
First time poster. I am a 35 year old male and was diagnosed with MDD as a 15 year old. I was given Zoloft and all was well. For some unknown reason, the family doctor switched all of us (My whole family has clinical depression to varying degrees) to Effexor XR when I was 19. Still, it controlled my depression so I was fine with it. 
In 2015 I caught a really, REALLY severe case of Viral Meningitis that caused severe encephalitis. All my EEGs were wildly abnormal and I was completely nuts, totally out of touch with reality. This experience completely fried my brain. They never discovered the identity of virus that caused the infection but I was hospitalized for over a month while my medical team hoped the virus would clear and the swelling around my brain would normalize. It eventually did and I was discharged home. The recovery out of the hospital was worse than my scattered memories of my time in the hospital. I physically could not fall asleep and after three weeks of begging was finally given Trazadone (thank God) along with my steady stream of my newly prescribed opioid pain killers and Valium. Over the next two months I slowly recovered from the worst of it. I got off the opioids but still take trazadone to this day. I went back to work and tried to begin life again. 

However, I was not the same person I was before the meningitis. Anxiety (which had never been a problem for me before) joined my depression, which sadly was no longer responding to the Effexor. I found a great psychiatrist and we have tried almost everything with no effect. Welllbutrin, Zoloft again, Seroquel,Mirtazapine, Lamictal, Pramipexole, Lexapro, pretty much everything under the sun. The next two years was just a roller coaster of meds and shitty side effects. I eventually was given Xanax which at least kept me functional despite the fact I am completely chemically dependent on it now. I did a whole round of TMS and felt nothing. I am now classified as “Treatment Resistant.”

My psychiatrist is frustrated and said to me that beyond a few more drugs and possibly MAOIs, ECT is where we are headed. I am not against ECT but I am absolutely just exhausted fighting this battle. It’s been seven years living like this. I make it to work and excel there but I feel like I have withdrawn from life. I was always the social butterfly but now I just sleep my weekends away. I recently started going back to therapy and am doing ketamine infusions but I just feel stagnant and I can’t see myself doing this forever. I don’t want to die but I definitely don’t want to continue living like this. 

In addition to my Effexor, Trazadone and Xanax my psychiatrist just prescribed me Caplyta, which is relatively new and based on what I have read, used primarily for Bipolar Depression. I pray to God it works because I don’t want to just exist anymore. I want to get back to living my life. 

Does anyone have positive experiences with ECT? Is there something I have missed? I feel like I am running out of road here. Any outside insight would be welcome.",1678861779.0

TW: SA, Abuse, Suicide

I just want to finally tell someone my whole life story and secrets, I might delete later
 the man who was supposed to protect me, care for me, and bought me cute toys took my innocence away, this all happened every summer I visited him in Mexico, I didn’t know at the time, I feel so sick to my stomach and shitty that I want to tear my skin apart. Not only him but an older cousin and uncle done disgusting things to me, I feel disgusting to be alive. Though what truly spiraled me to depression was the spring of 5th grade and the only one who I thought would be beside me was my older sister. My mother, whom was difficult to be with growing up, kicked her out when she was 18 when my mom found out she had a boyfriend. 4 years no contact with my older sister and within those years, my moms resentment and anger went towards me. Constant beatings, blames, guilt trips, gaslighting, neglect and manipulation from that women made me hate myself and everyone, however she made it up by taking me on trips and fun events. Too bad it didn’t prevent me my first attempt in 7th grade home alone and I failed at that. I’ve started cutting but eventually stopped because I was afraid what my mom might do if she found out, she got mad and annoyed how she had to pick me up from the hospital cuz of one of my many panic attacks. One core memory I have was when my mom was driving me back to school from the doctors and said “if you want to kill yourself, then you better do it somewhere else. I will not clean up the mess” “go ahead and do it”, I cried deeply in the school bathroom. I’ve done another attempt around that time by trying to swallow some pills after not eating for days and threw it all up. Another memory was when she found out I was talking to an online friend who was a boy scrolled through our messages and many sex jokes and also discovered how me and my other friend at school was sexting a 30 year old man who was the boss of my friends mom and liked her. Thankfully they didn’t do anything physical but my friend ended up taking the blame and I still feel super shitty about, if only I had deleted the photos of their messages. That morning my mom discovered, I yelled how I was going to kill myself at her and she told me to go ahead and do it, I ran to the kitchen to grab a knife and she came towards me witnessing me pointing the sharp end of the knife to my stomach and quickly slapped me across my face and dragged my hair to the living-room where she beat the shit out of me. Kicks, punches, tons of slaps while screaming, I didn’t understand what she was saying because how each time she slapped my face my vision went dark. After the beating, I still went to school holding back tears and trying to not feel the physical pain and she gave me.  I done another attempt when I was home alone but stilled failed, how more miserable can I get. Honestly majority of my attempts I failed because of how much of a fucking pussy I am. Over the years, my mom has calmed down and now I’m jealous how my two younger sisters get to have the treatment I yearned for when I was their age. I hate this fucking life and I hate myself even more. The only thing I got going is working and going to my second year of free college program. After this semester I have no clue what I’m going to do in life, I never pictured myself being alive at 19. I feel so fucking guilty too because I have a secret boyfriend of 3 years who cares for me and wants to marry me but I don’t believe I should, I feel like I’m undeserving of love and especially when I have not told him about my past, I’m afraid he’ll see me differently but at the same time I want him to break up with me for his own good. I hate myself so fucking much and my talents are wasted on me. Im so pathetic that even after years of all my traumatic events have passed I’m still grieving over it. Recently I stopped talking to my dad, he has different family and I can’t bare to talk to him after knowing what he has done. I have constant meltdown breakdowns and panics attacks whenever a bad memory of my childhood flashes. I’m so disgusted, guilty, and sad. I’m feel shameful to be here. I want it to end so bad, I know I have people who care about me, I don’t know if it’s enough. it’s straining waking up. I don’t even know who I am anymore I used to be good at school to forget all my problems but I give up. I’m giving up its too painful to be alive and I’m afraid I’ll still be struggling once I move out of this toxic place. I just wanna try every drug and overdose, or I hope someone can do the job for me and murder me. I hate how many bad things have happened in my life and I’m not looking forward to the future ones. I suck at socializing, I missed many good opportunities because I care less. I hate myself I hate who I am I hate how fucking ugly I look I hate how I hate myself and No matter how many times I tried to change and move forward in life I always end up being more miserable because I failed to stay happy and content.

Taunted when death visits and spoken are the words “They’ve gone to a better place” 
Yeah, we know.

You see, we have disconnected so much so that we understand our body is a vessel.
The house of an alien.
It holds the unknown itself.
The “you” that tells your brain to stop reading or continue. 
The “you” that determines your wants, pleasures, dislikes, desires, and so much  more but most of all, decisions.
The vessel is susceptible to its environment.
The “you” is susceptible to the body.

The vessel is not impenetrable or indestructible.
Certainly not immortal as we all well know. 

The definite inevitability of expiring is somewhat comforting.
Many are motivated to live by that thought.
Others the opposite,
or could even go through stages of both extremes. 
The thing is though, we can’t worry about the you or the vessel solely, at least most do not have that luxury. 

There’s the other aspect, life itself. 
The life that slowly tumbles into damage beyond foreseeable repair when you phone in sick to work for weeks on end because you’ve been unable to pull yourself out of bed from the debilitating thought, eating you alive from the inside, that only you can hear, see, think and feel. 
The life that you gain then lose interest for more often than you change your underwear. 
The life that will without any doubt continue even when you have left the vessel and it has decayed into dust. 

Explaining it to a loved one or professional? 
That’s what’s recommended.
So why does it feel contagious? 
Spreading intrusively destructive desire of death is not on our “to do” list. 
How even could I with the mental pain blocking my throat through every attempt to cough up the truth?
I really don’t even know what to say when someone is in crisis apart from what I have read and been told, which hasn’t/doesn’t help me?
How could I possibly think someone else had the solution to my problems when they have their own?

The tears are frustration. 
Despair. 
It’s beyond a sadness and no one seems to quite compare. 
Falling deep into a relationship with depression, there’s many stages, it varies throughout us. 
Some only dip their toes, spending quick trips at Casa de La Rockbottom before a healed departure; they may try to assist others flee but the exits are as unique as we are and not all of them work for each person. 
Others however, can’t find any exit no matter how much they search or are guided. 

Decisions can be split second and regretted, sure.
A lot of living, hopeful and happy people like to believe this to be true. 
In some cases it is certainly true. 

Unfortunately though, there is only so much patience one can have, being mocked by the peace of death and stuck in a life they find no psychological comfort from.

I believe this is what solely allows a person to make the decision. 

It isn’t about strength, bravery or empowerment. 
It’s patience.",1678841188.0

And I gotta say, things changed for the better since the lockdown finally ended. We started attending classes again, and I felt good. By that time, I had been going to therapy for almost a year. So everything was seemingly good, I even got to be on one of my school's sports teams, and went to a national tournament, where I performed quite well.

The awful part started when I realized I still had a crush on the same guy since high school. We've been friends since then, and even though I had somehow managed to deal with my feelings, now it's time I can't.

By the end of November we had a falling out (Sadly, I have to say it was my fault), and haven't spoken all these months. I tried to talk to him twice or thrice since it happened, but didn't succeed, so I also got mad, and my anxiety made me think of all the times we both hurt each other ('cause he's done that, too), so I've been kind of mad at him, but at the same time, I want to make things right.

Last week I got to know he just got a job out of the state (circa 1000 miles away from our city), and will be leaving a few days after my birthday, which I wanted to celebrate during that weekend.

I could gush about her for hours, she's really wonderful in so many ways. We spent a lot of time together at first and I was over the moon; we started calling each other ""babe"" and ""baby"" and stuff. People assumed we were a couple, she never corrected them. So I asked her to be my girlfriend, but she left me with a ""let me think about it <3"".

I started feeling pretty insecure about things. Not long after, there were 2 or 3 days in a row where she practically did not talk to me at all. I confronted her with my fears and insecurities - one of which being that I was suspicious that I liked her a lot more than she liked me. She admitted that I probably did, but told me it just takes her time to develop strong feelings. She told me she *did* like me. Then we didn't talk for a few days, which was rough. Really rough.

Today we've spent some time together over a game, but I haven't heard her voice in days, which is really hard for me. I want to be spending time with her for hours a day like we would when we'd first met - like we'd been just a week or so ago.

I develop too strong of feelings too quickly. It's always been a problem for me - becoming *immediately* attached to someone. It's distressing that she isn't as immediately attached to me as I am to her, even though it's an unrealistic expectation for her to be.",1678853215.0

It just built into our dna. I am kind of glad that I also suffer from heirtary kidney disease, as when it time to need dialysis I will opt out . I seen what years of dialysis does to a person as my uncle suffered from same genetic kidney disease for over 15 years  and eventually passed away, so I will avoid having a family by getting a vasectomy soon to ensure that I don't knock up someone and those kids don't suffer like his family did for a long time after his passing. For last few years before his passing , he focused on creating a savings that would pay for his childrens university and to allow his wife to build a business of her own to take care of her self when he is gone.

I'm 18, but my story starts in my Freshman year of high school.

Hello random person, I’d like to believe that you aren’t actually so random, but rather that fate has brought you here for a reason. I appreciate you clicking on my story and I hope you take something of value with you when we part ways.

My Freshman year of high school, I was placed in 5 AICE and 1 AP classes (college level classes for those who don't know). I was a 14 year old in college level classes. This was during online school, so I sat there day after day at my desk, sedentary, not doing anything but working and mindlessly consuming online content. I was so overworked I developed bags under my eyes and wrinkles on my forehead; often getting around 5 hours of sleep a day at best. I didn't have any interaction with friends at all, which obviously wasn't conducive to a healthy mind. As the year went on, I became more and more depressed, literally not giving a flying fuck if I ceased to exist the next day. I became suicidal; having dreams of jumping off an overpass near my house, which then worsened to pinching myself till I bled, which then worsened to cutting myself. At the end of my Freshman year, I broke. The pressure was too much for me to handle and I confessed that I was cutting myself to my parents, but I didn't mention anything about depression to them. My parents aren't the kind of people that I would want to talk to about deep shit. I didn't get any help at all, I merely confessed to my parents.

The 4th quarter of my Freshman year, I had the option to return to school, which I took. The first day, I had an exam to take and bumped into one of the girls from one of my classes on the way, what a simple way to start an unfortunate cascade of events. She asked me where we were supposed to go because neither of us knew, and so we spent about half an hour trying to find out. Long story short I was crazy in love. I had a new purpose, it felt like I had been revived, I felt alive finally. She even gave me her number a couple days later because she wanted to send me pictures of a paper assignment she could have easily handed me (which I took as a sign). After spending the remaining 3 months of the school year talking and sitting together, I was fully convinced I was in love with her, it wasn't just friendship. On the last day of school I was going to ask her out to a local arcade, but she unexpectedly had to leave early for summer camp, so I never got the opportunity to. Luckily I had her number. After pouring my heart out for an hour typing up a message to her, I sent it, then I was balling my eyes out. I had just put my entire life on the line with one simple text. All of my joy, all of my willpower, my future all relied on her response to this message; she was my everything.

Fast forward to the end of the summer, she responds (she was at a rural camp up north where they had a no electronics policy). Sometimes I wish she would have never responded at all and ignored me. Years later I still remember what she said. After coming in from a hot July day spent mowing the lawn, I checked my phone; a new message, it's from her. I felt my heart drop instantly. She rejected me. I was in so much shock I couldn’t move. I literally remember sitting in my chair just frozen, the terrifying moment I realized that I had just lost everything. Now this is when my story takes a regrettable turn.

I immediately fell into a downward spiral, I didn’t care anymore. I started taking sips of white wine from the pantry thinking I was “rebellious” or whatever, it was incredibly stupid looking back on it. This then worsened to full on heavy drinking. Beginning my Sophomore year, I was regularly drinking. It had become a habit for me. It became so bad that drinking to the point of blacking out was a weekly occurrence for me. I would simply stay up saying “I’m just working on homework”, then I’d do it. I would wake up on the cold tile floor at the ungodly hours of the morning, then drag myself to my bed to pass out. Waking up and running to the bathroom to vomit was one of the worst experiences of my life. I didn’t learn, and for three quarters of my Sophomore year, this was the self-destructive cycle I was stuck in. Hell, my New Years resolution as a 15 year old was to not drink anymore. How fucked up is that? Then one night, I couldn’t find anything. I desperately searched for something to drink and I found liquor. I ended up blacking out and waking up on my kitchen floor several hours later, then uncontrollably vomiting. This isn’t where it stops though. Only a couple weeks later, I was at the lowest point in my life. I was so depressed that the word “depressed” isn’t even suitable to use. I didn’t care anymore. That terrible night, I remember thinking to myself: “I don’t care if I die”. I tried to drink myself to death, but I passed out before I could do so. This was the last straw. Once again I found myself at my breaking point. I ended up opening up to my parents about my habit, but I concealed the true severity of it, downplaying it out of fear of punishment or the fear of my parents viewing me differently.

Everything from the end of the summer before my Sophomore year to the end of my Sophomore year I now refer to as “The Dark Ages”. Even thinking of it makes me nauseous. I hate it, I hate everything about it, and I hate that it happened. Everything from that time period is traumatic to me; clothes, music, places,

people all turned sour. This time is so traumatic to me that I often subconsciously deny the events that happened during this time, unwilling to recall the memories that plague my mind in fear of reliving those times in my mind for even a second. I have even gone so far as to delete every trace of my online presence from this time period and completely erase everything that I associate with that time period in real life too. Any time that I experience something that reminds me of this dark time of my life, I immediately run away and deny that this thing even exists, it’s almost like a subconscious barrier is in place to protect my mind.

Writing about these events was very uncomfortable, it feels as if I am cutting open fresh wounds again. However, the peace of mind I will gain from sharing the true extent of my experiences with someone else outweighs the temporary pain I am experiencing now.

Currently, I am in a spot in life that I am comfortable in, I’ve solidified my friendships, I’ve found my passions, and I’m performing extremely well academically. However, as good of a position I am in right now in my life, I am still reminded of my past from time to time, and every time it happens I can’t come to terms with it. My immediate response is to deny that it happened and disregard the thought. I also still experience remains of the symptoms of depression I experienced a while ago, which has had a lasting effect on my personality.

I acknowledge the illegality of my actions and the terrible decisions that I have made. I don’t think my life will ever be the same due to the single decision I made on that summer day so many years ago. Addiction is a terrible experience that I would not wish upon my worst enemies. I regret this time period of my life immensely and I often wonder how I would be now if that wasn’t how my Sophomore year played out.

To anyone who made it this far, I cannot express how grateful I am for you. Thank you for taking the time to read my story to its extent. I hope you were able to take something useful away from this, and remember, time heals all wounds.

Stay strong and keep that head of yours up. Thank you, and I wish you nothing but the best in all of your endeavors.

I have a complicated issue. My twin brother, my other half, someone who I can't really see myself on this earth without has been struggling with depression for a very long time and for the last year or so its gotten to a point where my closest friends and I are very worried. In short, my brother and I have been close since day one. We both come from music backgrounds, have similar tastes in life and have always been there since day one. 8.5 years ago (age 24) I left the country and moved to Asia to pursue my dreams and career, he going a different path in life has been living home with my parents ever since, we are now 32 (there's nothing wrong with that). We have two very different lives these days shaped by careers, interests and personalities. I'm outgoing, he's an introvert, he likes gaming and staying home, I like meeting new people spending money and drinking in bars and connecting with people. Overtime, I've found my peace, I don't have a dime to my name, but I'm happy and value my life and love myself (I didn't always though I had to learn this), he is a true artist and also in the top one percentile in North America in his specific instrument. I went to business school and had different sights in what my future would behold, he went to school for music. After graduating he pursued a lot of professional routes in music, but none of them really turned fruitful. Me on the other hand, my financial situation isn't great, but I can say that I've made a career for myself and feel pretty secure with my current and possible future jobs wherever I turn out, I also always had the mentality that no matter what I'll survive off selling coconuts if I really have to and I'll still make the best of things. Him on the other hand, he's what I would call a true artist. He lives and dreams music on a daily basis, but because of the truths of music and art and how hard it is to make it, life eventually caught up to him years back and he had to fall back on IT (he's always been good with computers since day one). That said, he's in a job and career that I can see he finds soulless and gets zero gratification out of. The issue is though when I was out at events and bars meeting people who would in fact changed my course through networking, his introverted decisions kept him sheltered and no matter how much I told and begged him to get out there all these years and make shit happen, well he never did. He has a hard time accepting who he's turning out to be and this has been a downward spiral for the last 5 years, I've seen him deteriorating. The distance between us is terrible as I live in Asia for all this period and I'm not home to be there to support him and I almost feel guilty that maybe I should have been there to help push him a bit, but he really never listens to me or anyone for that matter when it comes to advice. One thing he has done though is save a very hefty amount of money from staying home and living on a budget so 3 years ago he took a leap of fate and took my advice finally to jump back into music as a career starting back up (as a first step with the hopes of making it in the performing arts world) teaching students to build up a business, but then corona hit, he was worried about his health care so after a year off he returned back to IT, again something he's not getting a lot out of. These last 3 years have been hard on him, but they have been tough for everyone in retrospect. I returned home for the first time in 3 years finally and I really got a taste for how far this has gone. He basically sleeps in on his job because it's hard for him to find motivation to get out of bed, he seems disgruntled, though hes productive with his music and working out (he plays in a lot of bands live shows almost every week) on his down time hes in his room smoking huge amounts of weed and playing video games. Making matters worse, hes in a toxic relationship. I wont get into all of those details, but my brother is more of an old fashioned dude and his girlfriend is a young free spirit with a past that he's not fond of, and he's turned into this man who has a dark sense of humanity, he doesn't trust people, has a terrible outlook on people, talks a warped sense about women with hateful tones like all women are evil and can't be trusted they all cheat yada yada, and yeah just a dark dude. It's sad because he was always happy, I think deep down he just feels wrong and cheated like he spent so much time on his craft since the age of 4, school, etc. just for this to be his life, but the truth is he never really got out an made things happen like all of the starving artists I know who literally go weeks without eating just to get what they want and need. It's to the point where its scary now, it's like he's given the fuck up completely. I check up on him almost weekly and it's always the same thing, nothing new, life sucks, work sucks, I suck, his sense of self worth is basically in the trash which is very sad because hes so good looking, smart, and talented. He's just lost in this dark bubble he's built for him. Going back to the sheltered part, he never got out in the world and I feel like hes had so many wasted opportunities, we are only 32 and though I feel like young ox, he has the mentality of an old 60 year old right-wing white dude (idk where this even came from), he talks like life is over, he talks terribly about women, and even worse he talks terribly about himself. I have seriously tried everything I could do speaking to him wise and even though he doesn't listen to me, I'm basically the only one he can even give his full attention to. He will never listen to any of my family or friends because in his mind everyone a scum bag so how could they possibly give any advice to him right? The reason I'm alarmed is because when I was home last my two closest childhood friends who still play in the same band with him both pulled me aside on separate occasions and extended their concerns, they are really worried about him, to the point where they feel like he may hurt himself (apparently he told his girlfriend who has also threatened to hurt herself that he would hurt himself if she left him). Making things worse, my brother has told me things that he had terrible breakdowns and panic attacks. He's definitely somewhat aware of whats going on with him because he's considered seeking professional help but hasn't done anything yet and because I'm so far away and in my own shit I'm not there for him and I can't watch over him. We are all really worried about him and I've done my home work and I'm all out of gas on this, but I'm not going to wait around for something stupid to happen to my brother.

I also have imposter syndrome and keep things to myself because in the past I was very open and communicative, unfortunately with the wrong people. It gave me trauma.

I live in assisted living for people with psychological disorders. Every person who lives here, has a reference person (idk if it‘s right word, i dont live in an english speaking country). You have 1x appointment in a week and then talk about stuff.
She has basically forced me to talk about my problems. So she can „understand“ and „empathize“. I did that and if she doesn‘t get it she makes me feel like an imposter. She‘s always questioning my motives.

I am very self-critical, I‘m very bad to myself.. when I have a clear head and realize how badly I treat myself, I cry. She makes me feel so much worse about myself. I feel disappointment in me everytime I talk to her. I shouldn‘t feel that. I am truly trying my best. 

I hate breaking up with people, meeting new people, scared if they are the same.
But I can‘t take it anymore. I live in assisted living and work in a safe workplace. They should help me and respect me but it‘s like they (well, actually only her) don‘t believe in mental disorders. 

This will be the very first time I end a relationship for my mental health. I should’ve ended it sooner but was too afraid to „hurt“ her because so many people don‘t want her as a reference person and I didn’t want to hurt her self-esteem. So interesting why I always have to look out for others but don’t stand up for me, or give myself the same type of empathy. But now I have to look out for me.  This cycle will end.

 Male, 20, Currently in Canada as an international student.Reasons why life isnt for me

**Love**: 

I cannot express my love to anyone. My last relationship was a disastrous 4-year long drag. During the period, there was no intimacy and was mostly long-distanced. Now, i cant seem to socialize because for the better half of my teenage years, I was busy dedicating my everything to one girl of which i got no return.

**Money**: 

Wealth is vague for me. I cannot save. It was evident when i was in my home country but now in this new country, it is taking a huge toll on me. I have been laid off from my job for 3 months and cant seem to find any job in Toronto. I am a talented person and I have skills in computing and software but there are simply no jobs that fulfill my 'requirements'.

**Social Life:**

My friend from school is in Vancouver and he is the cloest thing to a 'safe-zone' that i feel like. I cannot socialize with anyone because I am living in an apartment with other natoinality students. They are treating me as a doormat and making a laughing stock out of me. I was addicted to THC vapes mostly because it was like a warm hug to my cold soul. But now i am trying to actually make effort in socializing which is coming off badly. Apparently, the punjabi guys next door put a spycam on me and were spying the entire time i was high and fooling around. I dont have the physical proof nor have I seen the camera itself, but i have heard them talking about me in their language which i understand quite a lot but they dont know that. It was like listening to a live commentary about your own game of life. I get extremely defensive and dont know what to do when cornered like that. Also, I simply dont have enough social battery to make friends and actually carry on a conversation. maybe i already know what they are gonna say and dont like to waste time.

**Time**:

Time too is vague to me. Eversince i got addicted to THC and left it, time has been speeding like a motherfucker. I dont sleep at nights and during day i just nap a couple of tmies. This has been going on for a week now. I dont know how much my body can handle sleep depravitiy. Maybe it is the subconscious way of punishing myself? IDK. Anyways, time passes quickly and days are like hours with me just wondering what the hell did i do for that long. I am a software student in my last semester and so I have a lot of projects and assignments to take care of. I do handle them quickly and efficiently but i dont like doing that. Because once i finish a task, I am back in the constant state of worrying and detachment from the reality.

**Family**:

 I had a shit childhood with absent mother and an alcoholic father. My mom chose money and my 'future' over taking care of me. I get her perspective because my dad was a drunk asshole. I had somewhat 'luxury' in terms of materialistic things but i never wanted them. I wanted them but not as much as actually having a family. I always thought i would never be like my drunk dad but while being addicted to THC, I got his perspective as well. It seems as if i was the initiation point for my family's troubles. My mom spent 10 years abroad and returned when i turned 16. A year after, COVID struck. Fortunately, we followed the regulations and we were healthy and alert enough. But I got to spend just 2 years with my mom. After which I came to Canada.

**Canada**: 

Dont take me wrong, this country does have plenty of good things but for me, for now, it is literally the definition of hell. My home country was so peaceful, so much nature, friendly people, little stress, and more nature. But here, especially in Toronto, I havent been more further from my past self than now. When I had no one to talk to in childhood, I used to make friends with local animals like stray dogs (non-rabid & somewhat friendly). I used to feed them and they used to be an emotional support for me, it was a nice trade. But here, there are no stray dogs, no cattles, every animal is tamed and marked. Here humans have made it easier for animals to live but didnt care about other humans. Also, nature sucks here. I cannot go out without putting on a jacket and I hate putting on jackets. I get extremely sweaty while putting on the bigass jacket and the constant noise from my ear and head rubbing against the interior of the jacket cap is like the icing on the cake. Also, there is so much capitalism. Capitalism in a sense that I cannot go out to my local store without waiting for 2 crosslights. Everything is car-centric here and ofcourse I dont own a car. The people are judgy and the job market is going to shit. Once I tried to go out in 2 degree Celsius (i asked Alexa the temperature before going out), while in a tracksuit jacket. I did have a heavy tshirt underneath but its not the temperature here, its the winds. The motherfucker wind fuond every single entry point from my attire and managed to make me almost freeze. Apparently, the temperature was 2 degrees but due to the chilling winds, it ""felt like"" minus 8 degrees. I dont know wy they put the main temperature even. The only point of knowing temperature for a regular person is to know how it feels like to them. No one is trying to take actual thermal energy of a place. Anyways, that day, I felt with each breath that the steam in the air was condensing and accumulating in my lungs or chest. It literally was a droplet inside my body. I recalled when i had Pneumonia as a child and then started to contemplate why I even caame to this cold god forsaken place. After that incident, I have been indoors most of the winter, which is like 8 months here. 

**SO WHAT HAPPENED?**

Well, I have been searching for a job but havent been successful. My credibility among my friends is drastically reduced due to my past addiction. I know i am a better and more understanding person than before due to self realization and pondering but there is no way they will take me as they did before. This includes my housemates as well, including the punjabi guys. They talk shit behind me all the time but its their house as well so i havent done or said anything about that. I am like a sponge as of now, taking all the rotten shit, but hey I too need someone the squeeze the rotten shit of me. Anyways, Yesterday, I got a message forwarded from one of my other housemates for a job position. I immediately replied to the given number on whatsapp. As it turns out, it is just another ""Online Job/Personal Assistant Gift Card"" scams. I literally have 5 dollars in my chequing account with credit exceeding 400. I have no hope of getting money from family but looks like that might be my only way now. And, for it to happen, my mother needs to believe in me which i dont think she does. She keeps things from me and honestly is a control freak. Most of our relatives have backed off from our family because of my parents. Few cousins talk with me and love me but in this other world, I dont know to what extent it helps. Also, I have $2500 credit in college which I managed to accumulate due to failing one course because of ONE missed exam while I was high. I am trying to conjure up an article to help vent my anger towards others but in reality, it is just anger and dissatisfaction with myself. I also have agoraphobia i.e. fear of going outside. The phobia is unproven but experimentally verified. During my previous employment tenure at a security company, i was almost hit by a car that was being operated by a drunk person. The car was actually trying to hit me and the driver was screaming something like ""almost scored a point"" through his window. It was in a shady part near Yorkgate Mall. This paired with the previous mentioned cold adventure made me shit scared of going outside. So much so that I literally watched my bank account drain because of some USA based scammer slowly taking 40$ USD every two weeks. i always wanted to go to the nearest bank and sort it out, but the nearest bank was a bit too far for me to walk. And I didnt want to put on a jacket and take a bus with so much fear. I have sorted it out now but its been too long since i felt normal that idont know what normal feels like anymore. I have always been an empath, I could tell how the other person was feeling or thinking but It is really hard to come to terms with my own senses and feelings. It is almost like I am my consciousness and am trapped in the material body which is controlled by a dumbass brain. The recent scam event has caused me to almost breakdown and seek therapy in typing things out. The monotonous typing sounds is like ASMR for me so its a win win. i always felt like I am a good expressionist on forms of art like poetry, dance, drawing, writing, but the real life, is simply not for me.

They care about you and will be sad if you are gone. But that’s not enough. And if that’s really all you want, I can tell you that you matter and I’ll be sad if you are gone.
But maybe you want someone you know to tell you that. But even if they tell you that, you would still want to feel special/important. They can tell you that you matter to them and they care. But they can’t really show it because they are living their own lives with their own issues. Are they lying about it? No they are not, but how far up are you on their priority list is the problem here.  Personally im around here. And let’s say you have someone that shows you they care about you deeply. That’s not enough because maybe you want someone else that you care about to care about you. Could be someone you love romantically. This is my assumption that I will never feel like it’s enough. And let’s say the person you care about cares about you deeply as well. But what if you have no purpose and don’t find joy in life? You’ll keep having reasons that it’ll never be enough.
