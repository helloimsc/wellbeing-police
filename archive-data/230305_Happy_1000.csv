On Sunday, my parents took my family out for dinner and we ended the night with Krispy Kreme donuts!!!

On Monday, I met up with my employer and she told me I‚Äôll be able to have a regular, part-time role (I was originally told I was going to be a substitute).

On Tuesday, I got a lot of work done in my school‚Äôs library. There‚Äôs something so peaceful about doing work on the 8th floor of the library, hot coffee next to me, with the sky slowly getting darker. 

On Wednesday, I went out for a walk since it was so nice out!!! I also got closure with a friend I lost touch with, something I subconsciously needed for a few years. 

On Thursday, I had my first therapy appointment (something long overdue), aced my psychopathology midterm, and got boba with my friend!!! 

Yesterday, I took the day for myself and didn‚Äôt do homework so I could properly unwind after the last few weeks. 

And today, I finished my drug awareness essay I had been procrastinating on, and I‚Äôm about to start watching a new episode of one of my favorite animes!!!! 

This week has been VERY kind to me and I am extremely thankful. I can tell March is going to continue being kind to me, and not just because my birthday is soon and I‚Äôm getting my first tattoo.

I'm just so peacefull in my life, last summer i posted about suicide and my chronic depression was at the lowest and honestly had the idea of trying to kms and serious plan and opportunity to do it. My life before was a whole valley of trauma,  i never had the luck to being born in a happy family, system who failed to protect me, doctor and teacher who always pretended to see nothing about bullying or domestic violence. 

My love life was also an hell, when u never learn how to love and grew up for surviving u become the perfect victim for every kind, broken abusive kid like you or other who don't have any reason to be ah other than it was easy to abuse you and they won't remember about ur name or being shocked by the consequences their actions provoked. Therapist failed me for good, i hate meds cuz they put me in when i was younger and i had a serious past of od and addiction to shit like valium and xanax. 

Now i just feel like i finally can take a breath, i finally had the strongness to escape an abusive relationship i was trapped in, to take time for myself during month's and i never collapsed again. 

It's been almost 5 month's since i met my bf, we live together, we wanna adopt a rabbit or a kitten together. It's just so calm, i do my stuff, we sometime lay on each others but we just choose to break the cycle, now i restart my life slowly, finish to do my paper and i will restart my studies in the domain i love ! (makeup and hairdress) 

I always did what my parents wanted in terms of studies and as a result I had to stop high school because of burn out and since then I don't have my highschool diploma and I can't set foot in a school without having a panic attack, so all of this is surely ridiculous in the eyes of the world, but it makes me happy to do it at my own pace for me, to see myself, the child I left in my childhood room who was crying silently and hoping that she wouldn't die tonight. 

&#x200B;

I am saving her little by little, I am sad about the past but I have a lot of hope for the future, I am doing my best, the bagel of dissociations that is my life is filling up little by little.

34,"As someone who normally struggles socially, today I learned that I do have something valuable to contribute and maybe I‚Äôm even more likeable than I thought (!!!)",15,11g9e7f,happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/11g9e7f/as_someone_who_normally_struggles_socially_today/,4,"I (30F) had to wear a large, very visible medical device all through high school. I was in an orchestra that required auditions and I was in marching band as a FLAG GIRL (I was the *SECTION LEADER* lol), I was in drama club, had braces and uncontrolled asthma, big frizzy curls, and took only AP and honors classes‚Ä¶ I was basically Lisa Zemo from Ned‚Äôs Declassified School Survival guide but with headgear, acne, and a World of Warcraft addiction. I was asked on one date in high school.. by a boy who felt bad for making fun of my headgear. I kissed a boy once when I was 12 (before the device) but never again til my device was off when I was 19.

I eventually grew up and got a degree in statistics. As a woman in STEM, I was constantly looked over and talked over in group settings so I just got used to viewing my input and ideas as invaluable and even bothersome. During that time, I put myself through college, bought my first car, *and* moved out of my parents‚Äô house earning money mostly off of my looks after blossoming around age 22 (promotional modeling, Gogo dancing, etc) until I was 29, when I got my current job. Yes, I started college late. Now I have a career based on academics alone, which is more my speed.

But as we all know, when you grow up funny-looking, you always feel like that little weird kid inside. I have always felt like an annoying, socially-inept nerd due to existing solely online during my formative years. I‚Äôm 30 now and I am medicated for social anxiety due to that, but I still really struggle socially, especially opening up to people.

Yesterday I shared about a free, local quantum physics lecture event coming up soon that‚Äôs open to the public‚Ä¶ in a staff-wide email at my job. It felt risky! I wanted to throw up! My hands were sweating when I sent it! I fully expected people to think I basically sent spam mail and everyone was going to think I‚Äôm bothersome and annoying.

BUT

Instead, I got several emails back thanking me for sharing, some saying it sounded cool (!!!), and a few said they might even go!!!!!!! A coworker I‚Äôve never met even went out of their way to come introduce themselves to me and thank me for sending out the event details!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It might seem small but it feels incredible knowing that what I genuinely expected (the worst case) didn‚Äôt happen, and I know my therapist is going to be so proud of me when I tell her about this later today. I called my mom about it and she said she‚Äôs proud and it made her day. It makes me feel like maybe I am actually likeable and it‚Äôs given my confidence a little boost. Maybe I‚Äôm not as weird and annoying as I thought.

And I‚Äôm so proud of myself for getting over that fear for long enough to share something that can bring other people joy.",1677780240.0

I know I was lonely for a long time but I never became toxic because of it. A huge amount of people spiral into negativity and end up lonely.
They will refuse to believe that they deserve love which will become self fulfilling.

76,"If You Aren‚Äôt As Happy as You Would Like To Be, Consume Art",4,11cn31k,happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/11cn31k/if_you_arent_as_happy_as_you_would_like_to_be/,1,"If you are unhappy or not as happy as you would like, consume more art. 

Citizens who consume art tend to be happier than those who don't. [A study of more than 20,000](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332097023_Does_Art_Make_Us_Happy) adults found those who went to the theater, concerts and read often reported more positive well-being. Researchers from the Institute of Social Sciences Ivo Pilar recruited 4,000 Croatians to test a similar hypothesis. [They found a positive correlation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-010-9724-2) between subjective well-being and time spent on leisure activities such as going to art exhibitions. Medical researcher [Grossi also identified the link ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265139702_Cultural_Participation_Relational_Goods_and_Individual_Subjective_Well-Being_Some_Empirical_Evidence)among Italians who consumed music, literature, and art.

Art can improve your subjective well-being by influencing how you feel. *The Blind Side* is a movie about Michael Oher, a homeless Afro-American kid who eventually becomes a first-round NFL draft pick. For non-American football watchers like me, let me explain. Drafts allow teams to recruit players throughout the rounds, as few as seven and as many as thirty. A team picking Michael in the first round meant they found him so valuable they couldn't risk losing him. This story is bound to elicit positive emotions in almost anyone because we can[ place ourselves in the fictional story.](https://nicolasforero.substack.com/p/you-should-probably-watch-more-netflix) We can feel the protagonist's thankfulness, respect, and courage. ""He deserved that,"" we all think.

*Quick note: You might be thinking, who are you, and why should I listen to you? I'm a social scientist, author of In the Arms of Morpheus, a human behavior newsletter.* *Pleasure to meet you :)*

There's a chance plays, movies, and artwork won't make you feel emotional easily. It's common among ""cold"" people, those who don't often bring their emotions to the forefront or who lack the vocabulary to voice the emotions they feel. As a ""cold"" person, I can tell you that art can still improve your well-being. 

Art can make your brain simulate how you would act in complex situations you haven't lived without paying the cost of living them. In[ You Should Probably Watch More Netflix](https://nicolasforero.substack.com/p/you-should-probably-watch-more-netflix), I wrote:

""You don't know how you will react to discovering your partner cheats on you until it happens. And I can't think of anyone who would like to experience that to know what it feels like. Watching or reading a fictional story of someone dealing with a cheater is a better alternative. ""

You open the space to think about how you would react to situations you might live in the future when you watch a fictional play, movie, or painting about those events. It is not guaranteed. But, often, the decision you come up with will have more benefits or fewer costs than the one you would have made without thinking. 

Let's say being cold is not the problem, but not liking art, or at least the art forms you can access. Art will improve your well-being even then because it can raise your status. Galas, art shows, and operas often host prestigious people. People who are more likely to change your career or life in the least amount of time or know someone who can. One conversation is all you need to outweigh the annoyance of yawning. With time, you might develop a taste for art and squish every drop of benefit.

Sometimes, your social status won't change, but the group itself will improve your subjective well-being. 

I'm part of a writing community called Foster. In 2023, twenty-five writers and I flew to Puerto Escondido for a four-day retreat. In it, I met people who fit the ideal of a friend I'd built over the years. My anxiety about meeting people like them was so pronounced that I spent five weeks in Mexico in 2022 because I felt I had more chances to meet them there. In close to 24 years of living, I hadn't found these people. So it does not sound irrational to believe it could've taken me more years if I hadn't participated in Foster. But I found them. And, thanks to that, I've been feeling more positive emotions than I've felt in months.

Now, if people who consume art are more likely to be happier, shouldn't most artists be happy? Or at least happier than the average population?

While I didn't find scientific data backing the idea that artists are unhappier, many artists I've met seem unhappier than others.

Of course, this could be an illusion. 

My experience and conventional wisdom tell me artists tend to be more attuned to their emotions and less ashamed of sharing them than people in other fields. How they feel about themselves and the world inspires them to create. Without emotions, few ideas would come, if any. There would be nothing to express. So when artists create, for example, poignant artwork, it isn't because they are in despair. But because they have the emotional serenity to discuss these events without affecting their feelings. 

If this is true, I can see how those who work as artists aren't unhappy, on average. But how the kind of people who want to become artists have inner challenges already and seek art to solve them. Their ""negative"" art is, thus, not proof of art affecting their well-being but of their need to express these emotions somewhere to heal. So the benefits of art are still there.[ Higher relaxation](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421656.2016.1166832),[ reduced anxiety](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.4276/030802213X13603244419077), and increased well-being. It's just that the average artist trying to enjoy them has gone through more than the average person. 

What I can see as a cause of unhappiness, though, is artists' average incomes. Architecture, design, and production are artistic paths that lead to an above-average income. But dancers, entertainers, actors, photographers, and musicians earn [less than other fields. ](https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/Artists-in-the-Workforce-Selected-Demographic-Characteristics-Prior-to-COVID%E2%80%9019.pdf)Fine arts, art directors, and animators earn, on average, $50,505 annually. More than the US median of $48,305 but below the average in business-oriented creative fields such as marketing, branding, and creative direction. 

As a result, many artists live in below-average rent, food, and safety conditions that affect their well-being. How ""bad"" these conditions can make them feel depends on how good or bad their social circle is doing. Studies have found that absolute income doesn't have a significant effect on life satisfaction. But[ relative income does](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797610362671?journalCode=pssa). Suppose an artist earning 30,000 a year hangs out with others earning the same. In that case, he might not obsess over his below-average living conditions. But dissatisfaction will likely come if everyone around them makes 200,000 a year.

Those ""sad"" artists you meet, assuming they are ""sad"" and not just attuned to their emotions, might be because of their past and living conditions. Not because art is not improving their well-being.

**So it's worth asking, how can you benefit from art?**

The obvious question is to ""do"" more art. Go to more museums, knit, and learn to play an instrument.

This is a valid suggestion, but there is a caveat. For art to bring the benefits we have described, you must be engaged in the activity. Quality of life researcher[ Alex Michalos found](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225498000_Impact_of_Arts-Related_Activities_on_the_Perceived_Quality_of_Life) weekly time spent on any of sixty-six art-related activities didn't predict happiness. But how engaged people were in the activities did. You won't know if you will like a particular creative activity, though. So benefiting from art might be a matter of jumping between artistic activities until you find the one you like and then building a habit of doing it.

""If you hear a voice within you say 'you cannot paint,' then by all means paint, and that voice will be silenced,"" said Vincent van Gogh. The most unfortunate thing that can happen is spending a few hours on an activity you don't like. The most pleasing is that you will have a method to be happy for the rest of your life.

**I'd love to hear about your experience with art. Do you consume or produce it often? What's motivating you to do so?**",1677432496.0

Long story short:  I just got married for the first time at the ripe young age of 60 (she's 55)!  I've had a successful career but was just too scared to get close to anyone.  It's a long story, and if you want details, well, you can read the whole sad story in my comments history.  Whether it was fate, luck, or some kind of conspiracy, the sister of my long-dead girlfriend came into my life.  She broke through the emotional walls I had built up over 3 decades and showed me that I am capable of loving without reservation.  Did that come out cheesy?  Ah, who cares? 

Anyway, she's never traveled outside the US so I told her we'd go anywhere in the world she wanted.  She made a list and we're going to cross off every single place!  We were in Hawaii a few days ago and just seeing her in the sunset, I knew I couldn't live without her.  So, I asked her to marry me, she said yes!  We are honeymooning in Japan at the time I'm writing this!  Pardon my rambling, but she makes me feel like I'm a teenager again and I'm looking forward to actually living again instead of merely existing.

Reddit and Redditors out there, you've given me an outlet for my frustrations, a place to tell the stories I've accumulated, and the opportunity to make a few friends along the way!  But it's time that we slow down.  I just want to let you know that it's not you, it's me, lol!

I made an app that does just this. You speak to it, ex. ""I am worried about losing my job"", and the app will respond with something like the screenshot below.

I'd love to get  feedback -- is this weird? Is it uplifting? So far it's been pretty neat for me, but I need more people's feedback.

Each floor contains some rooms linked together by corridors.
Each room has a big bed with a TV or whatever.
Each room has a balcony with a garden of flowers and you'd be able to walk around your little garden every morning and enjoy sunrise.
Each room comes with a voice controlled machine that talks to you and reminds you of things or it can suggest you stuff or even take care of the kids while you're away by asking them ""what cartoons do you want to watch?"" N changing the TV channels.

I was born 27 weeks premature (I weighed the same as a pound of butter at 1 pound 15 oz!) and spent my first 4 and 1/2 months in the Special Care Nursery. My lungs hadn't had the chance to fully develop, so I was on a respirator for 2 1/2 months-- and I had laser-eye surgery around that same time for something called ROP (Retinopathy of Prematurity). The laser surgery prevented me from going blind, but up until about 8 months ago, I still had to wear glasses with a very strong prescription. (As mentioned in a few interviews recently, I had a life-changing eye surgery back in April/May of last year, that gave me 20/20 vision for the first time ever!)  And that's just the tip of the iceberg!  Long story short: I overcame a lot in my first few years and was a little fighter! So to me, this song is a representation of everything I've been through.

I wanted to share a personal story that I hope will inspire and motivate others to take control of their lives and make positive changes. A few years ago, I was in a really dark place. I was unhappy with my job, my relationships, and most importantly, myself. I felt like I was just going through the motions of life and wasn't living up to my full potential.

But I knew deep down that I wanted more for myself, and I decided to take action. I started small, setting achievable goals for myself each day, like going for a walk or reading a book. As I began to accomplish these goals, my confidence and self-esteem began to grow. I also started to surround myself with positive, supportive people who encouraged me to pursue my passions and dreams.

Eventually, I made some big changes in my life, like leaving my unfulfilling job and pursuing a career that I was truly passionate about. It wasn't easy, and there were definitely some bumps along the way, but I'm now living a life that I'm proud of and excited about.

I want to encourage anyone who's feeling stuck or unfulfilled to take the first step towards changing their life. You don't have to make big changes all at once, but every small step counts. Whether it's starting a new hobby, reaching out to old friends, or even just making your bed in the morning, every small action can lead to big changes.

I hope that my story can inspire others to take control of their lives and make positive changes, just like I did. Let's all support each other on this journey and remember that we're all capable of achieving great things.

Thanks for reading, and I'm excited to see what positive changes you all will make in your lives!

Warmly,

One day, while he was in the middle of a particularly difficult experience, he heard a strange noise coming from outside the bathroom window. Curious, he peeked out and was surprised to see an old clown hopping around on the sidewalk below.

The clown was singing a delightful song of nonsense words, and his energy was infectious. The man found himself smiling despite himself, and he felt a sense of joy that he had not experienced in a long time.

The clown noticed the man looking out the window and waved cheerfully, inviting him to come outside and join in the fun. At first, the man was hesitant, but the clown's enthusiasm was contagious. He took a deep breath, gathered his courage, and stepped outside to join the clown.

Together, they hopped and danced to the rhythm of the clown's silly song, and the man felt his spirits lifted. For the first time in a long time, he felt truly happy, and he forgot all about his bathroom troubles.

As the sun set, the man said goodbye to the old clown, feeling grateful for the unexpected interruption that had brought him such joy. From that day on, he made a point to seek out moments of joy and happiness wherever he could find them, and he remembered the kindness of the old clown every time he went to the bathroom.

In the end, the man realized that happiness could be found even in the most unexpected places, and that life was too short to waste on worries and troubles. He learned to cherish the moments of joy and laughter that came his way, and he was forever grateful to the old clown who had helped him find his way back to happiness.",1676583788.0

The building was also decorated for Valentine‚Äôs Day and I thought of being cynical and write one to myself saying ‚ÄúReally buddy? Alone again.‚Äù But as I walked up the stairs I got the idea to make valentines for people. I made around 8 or so on heart shaped paper. I handed them out to some girls. I went back upstairs to make more. I asked the lady at the desk if she had any more heart shaped papers I could use and she gave me a stack of them. I wrote ‚ÄúHappy Valentine‚Äôs Day!‚Äù On all of them. I handed those out to more girls. I went back upstairs and made 20 more valentines that were just on construction paper. I handed those out to more girls in the building. The reactions of the girls on my campus were great and seeing them smile as I gave them something for Valentine‚Äôs Day made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. I know this is small but I also know I made Valentine‚Äôs Day better for them. I‚Äôm happy I didn‚Äôt write myself a stupid letter making fun of myself.,1676414291.0

My husband‚Äôs family never does favors for free (I get it) and even then, they won‚Äôt do any favors that would inconvenience them in any way (also understandable). My husband‚Äôs car broke down so we had to carpool in mine to work. He both work an hour away from home, right down the street from each other. His family all live within 5 min from our house. The problem with carpooling is that he works 7-4, i work 9-6. Our baby needs to be picked up from the sitter‚Äôs at 5:30 at the latest.

So i called my brother who lives 20 minutes away from my house, an hour + 20 min away from my work.

When i was younger my mom always said that my brother was a ‚Äúgift‚Äù for me. I never really saw it that way as a kid, but now that we‚Äôre grown‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs nothing my parents have ever given me that i cherish more than my brother.",1676382049.0

This is super early into our relationship, I know, I mean we still barely know each other, but from the little I do know about her I honestly think I might truly love her.

A little more than a year ago, I broke up with my ex-gf who I was together with for a year before that. Despite me breaking up with her, I had a lot of fun and enjoyable life experiences with her during our time together, and ever since we broke up I met a few more girls here and then, but we never had the same connection like I did with my ex, and they never appealed to me like my ex did.

For the first time, this girl I'm seeing right now, I like her more than I did my ex or anyone else, I think she could be the one. I keep saying this hesitatingly because it's still super early and we have much to learn about each other, but I am really hopeful we could build an amazing long-term relationship together.

She still doesn't have my reddit username, but I can just imagine that eventually I'll show her my Reddit profile and she'll see this post where I talk about how amazing she is. :)

We'll have to see, only time will tell.",1675857272.0

I've only been with her a week, and she can be kinda rough and frustrating, but I've never been so sure or happy in my entire life.

I've been stuck in a long cycle of being down on my luck, having issues with relationships and severe depression. My heartache started last February when I had to let go of my cats for a deathly allergic roomate and had them rehomed to my absolute dismay. My mother stopped talking to me and my entire relationships and financial stability in ruin.

And three weeks ago, I had an abortion I regretted (and still do) greatly that hurt me very bad, as I felt I had lost something that I couldn't fathom not being able to love, but had to let go because I and my partner were not in the place or able to take care of it. This specifically destroyed me and I had almost taken my life because it was too much to handle with the guilt I felt

But then I got Yumemi (my puppy) and I've never been so in love. Not only did things look up for me with getting her, but this adorable little girl literally saved me from myself. The love I have for her is immense and the week, almost two come tomorrow, had been the happiest things have ever been for me, and the way my life so positively turned around getting her makes it all the better.

I'd do anything for this puppy, which means I'm going to push on, and grow with her. Sorry if this was ranty or edgy, but here's a photo of Yumemi (right) with my roommates Chihuahua, Concha (left) and some more photos (including her first walkies and my fave picture of her first pup cup)",1675491748.0

We met on tinder somehow, first date went great and the rest is history over 3 years later. 
I've never felt so comfortable with anyone. I have so many odd quirks, so many weird things I can't do or don't like. Yet I'm so comfortable being open about my weirdness and have someone who tries to accept and compromise with me on the things I can't or don't want to do. Someone who has given me such a solid foundation to a relationship. No lying, nothing suspicious. Just love, trust, respect, and consistency. 

He helps me take care of my grandparents, he supports me through school and a career change while he was going through his own, does the tedious daily tasks (like cooking and cleaning) that I sometimes don't have the patience or energy for. Takes care of me when I need it but also knows I'm independent. His friends are amazing and he easily gets along with mine. Hes also handsome as can be and exactly my type üòâ How could I be any happier! 

He realizes things he can work on for both himself and our relationship. Prioritizing mental and physical health as well as trying to be better at communicating (which we both are working on)

I was sick today and had to go home early, missing my last two lectures of the day.

He has never crossed any boundaries and always makes sure I‚Äôm comfortable with whatever he‚Äôs doing that‚Äôs a bit out of the norm.

It still does.

He makes me feel so good about myself, whether it‚Äôs just randomly calling me pretty or practically fanboying over my art. He never fails to make me smile and laugh.

He‚Äôs the first notification I check for in the morning and no matter what time or day it is, I‚Äôm always looking forward to hanging out with him.

I am asking because I (27F) virgin who has lived a very stressful life most of my life, with not much life experiences..
spent most of my life at home, with almost no social life studying all day.. and only had 2 six months relationships.. my mom always told me to wait till marriage to do anything that I want to do, such as travelling with my partner, sleepovers etc.. this made me very lonely over time as most people wasn‚Äôt living that life still and didn‚Äôt want to date me.. or even befriend me as I had a different mindset 

I am still studying and living with my mom.. and doesn‚Äôt have the freedom and money to do what I truly want.. like going out to parties, activities with friends etc.. 

I am naturally extroverted but I‚Äôve been living a very introverted life for as far as I know.. this left me with mental health issues, no friends..

I haven‚Äôt lived the life that I wanted to live at all and has been so unhappy for the past 13 years.. I am finally graduating this semester.. and I met a gentleman (28M) a year ago who asked me to be his girlfriend about a month ago.. 

We‚Äôve been together for 2 weeks and yesterday he expressed his desire to have kids in 1 year.. while I feel like I would need at least 5 years.. only because my body probably wouldn‚Äôt allow me to wait for 10 years.

He also would like to marry me first of course. But I am so tired from studying, switching careers and all that I do not mentally feel ready for kids at all. I want some time for my self and for us.. to rest, live life, find happiness, and better prepare to have kids.. before bringing them to the world.

If I have kids anytime soon, I feel like they will prevent me from finally living my life.. as they will constantly need me. And the fact that I never truly been happy in life makes me scared that I won‚Äôt know how to make them happy.

My partner on the other claims that he is always happy and has much more life experiences than me.. travelled around and had great life experiences with his friends and previous partners and lived his life much more than I did. Maybe that‚Äôs why he feels ready today.

Am I exaggerating? Are my worries valid?

Being restless means you feel the need to constantly move, can‚Äôt calm your mind, or both. It can also come with hyperactivity, anxiety, palpitations, agitation, or not being able to sleep(**insomnia**).

Being restless means being unmotivated and having trouble focusing on or completing tasks. For example, when you‚Äôre restless you may find yourself unable to focus on anything for very long and find yourself unable to get anything done. Other times, being restless means feeling anxious or nervous without knowing why. For example, you may feel restless and anxious when you‚Äôre at home, but when you‚Äôre at work you feel perfectly fine.

Sometimes people feel restless when they‚Äôre unmotivated. When you don‚Äôt feel like doing anything, you‚Äôre often said to be ‚Äútoo restless to sit still.‚Äù This isn‚Äôt the same thing as feeling anxious instead, it‚Äôs a kind of low energy and a lack of motivation. Sometimes people use the word ‚Äúrestless‚Äù to describe being unable to relax or unable to stop moving.

## 12 Common Reasons for Feeling Restless And Unmotivated :

#### 1-You Don‚Äôt Have a Clear Goal:

It is hard to stay motivated when you don‚Äôt have a clear goal. It would be helpful to have a goal that you could see yourself achieving. Once you have this goal in mind, you will be more motivated to work towards it. If you don‚Äôt have a clear target, it becomes much more difficult to stay on track and push yourself. Having a good aim will help keep your motivation strong, as well as see the progress you‚Äôre making towards your goal.  
To increase your likelihood of success, set small goals that are both manageable and challenging.

2-Pursuing many goals at once:

People who say that we can achieve anything we want in our lives do not mean that we can achieve all things simultaneously. If we have multiple goals, we need to achieve them one at a time. Working on too many things simultaneously can lead to feelings of restlessness and dissatisfaction. It is important to choose your goals wisely and to avoid multitasking if possible. Doing things one at a time will lead to greater success.

#### 3-Not Getting Enough Sleep:

Not getting enough sleep can make you feel restless and unmotivated. Make sure you get enough sleep each night so you can feel more energetic and motivated during the day. When you don‚Äôt get enough sleep, you‚Äôll be tired during the day, you won‚Äôt be able to focus, and you won‚Äôt want to do anything...[**Read More**](https://viemina.com/12-reasons-why-youre-feeling-restless-and-unmotivated/)",1675005397.0

Change is inevitable. One minute you may be living in a difficult moment and the next you may be living a happy one. Remember that everything is constantly changing. Change is inevitable in any field, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it has to be a bad thing. Learning from your mistakes, as well as your successes, is crucial for growth and improvement. Embracing change and making it work for you can be the key to happiness and success in your life and your career.

**15 Ways to Embrace Change in Your Life :**

**1-Identifying change :**

If the change impacts you negatively, do not run from or attempt to hide the discomfort. Instead, name the change. The ability to identify the emotions elicited by a change can help you to accept the change more quickly. If you find yourself feeling stressed, frustrated, or anxious, take a moment to consider what is causing those emotions. Acknowledging the discomfort will allow you to understand what parts of the situation you can control and what parts you cannot.

**2-Remember that change is necessary and ordinary:**

It can be difficult to accept that change is simply a part of life. However, if you can keep this in mind, it may help you to better deal with change, especially if you are currently facing an uncertain transition. Keep in mind that change is often necessary, and this can help change your mindset.

**3-Look at the situation optimistically:**

It can be difficult to see how change might positively impact your life; usually, people default to considering the negative consequences first. But there‚Äôs no use dwelling on the negative try thinking about the opposite instead. When facing a change, it can be helpful to make a list of all the potential benefits. This can help you to stay positive and focused on the potential outcomes. The people around you may also benefit from the change, so it is worth considering how they will be affected. Whenever you need motivation, refer back to a list of the positive changes, both short and long-term, that this will bring about in your life.

**4-Keep a diary:**

It is useful to take notes about your thoughts, reactions, purposes, and dreams when you start your journey. Writing in a diary once a day or once a week will help you see your story. This will help you deconstruct, reinvigorate, and love your life.

**5-Preparation:**

The goal of the preparation stage is to get yourself ready for the change. This means doing the mental work and planning so that you can take the steps needed to make the change you want. By the end of this phase, you will truly believe in your ability to change.

**6- Visualize the change in your mind**...[Read More](https://viemina.com/how-to-embrace-change-in-your-life/)",1674862453.0

363,How to boost your mood with simple and easy ways,26,10ki6xs,happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/10ki6xs/how_to_boost_your_mood_with_simple_and_easy_ways/,2,"  Having a bad day? Feeling down? We all have those days. Life is unpredictable and it can be hard to stay positive. It‚Äôs normal to experience low moods or feel overwhelmed with day-to-day tasks. In these uncertain times, it can be difficult to find joy and peace. The constant worries and anxieties of everyday life can leave us feeling exhausted and overwhelmed. But, it is important to remember that our mental and physical health are connected and that being in a good mood can help us stay healthy and optimistic. Fortunately, there are a few simple steps we can take to boost our mood and cultivate more joy in our lives:

## 1-Get up early:

When setting your alarm, aim for 15 minutes before your usual wake-up time. You'll be able to plan your day better and be more productive with this extra time. Allowing yourself this extra 15 minutes in the morning can make a huge difference in how your day progresses.

## 2-Go outside:

Even though it sounds simple, being outside in the fresh air may make all the difference. Our bodies were not made to sit in front of fluorescent lights all day. You'll feel more at peace if you get some fresh air. Taking some time to enjoy nature and step away from the stresses of everyday [life](https://youtu.be/S6ntQQ68c54) can have a significant positive effect on both our mental and physical health. Whether it's a walk in the park or a hike up a mountain, immersing yourself in nature can do wonders for the soul.

## 3-Workout:

It's likely that you've heard that exercise releases endorphins, which provide the familiar and cherished emotion of happiness. Yes, it is true! Turning your day around might be as simple as going for a walk or a run, or working out with weights to release stress. Not only does physical activity produce endorphins, but it can also help alleviate symptoms of depression, reduce stress, and increase self-confidence.

## 4-SMILE:

It may seem far-fetched, but research suggests that forcing a smile triggers an increase in positive emotions, as the muscles used in a genuine smile release endorphins that interact with the brain to make you feel good. So smile and laugh. it's easy.

## 5-Treat yourself:

What do you find enjoyable? Is it a book? a tasty hot beverage? Chocolate? To escape that rut, reward yourself from time to time. After all, there's nothing wrong with taking a break and rewarding yourself after hard work.

## 6-Pet your animal:

Take a moment to pet your pet, whether it's a dog, cat, or some kind of bird‚Äîwhatever pet you chose to have. You feel happier and less stressed after petting an animal. After all, what's there to be upset about when your pet is beaming at you?

## 7-Give a hug:

It is scientifically proven that hugging someone we love for a few seconds makes us feel happier, safer, and more cherished. all of that in under a minute! (But be sure the person you're hugging wants to be held, or you might be in trouble.) This simple act of physical contact can have an enormous impact on a person's mental state, reducing stress, calming the nerves, and providing a sense of security and comfort.

## 8-Take a nap:

Taking a nap might sound counterintuitive when you're in need of a mood boost, but according to a study from the National Sleep Foundation, it can actually be beneficial. It's because a nap gives your body and mind the opportunity to rest and rejuvenate, which can help reduce stress levels, improve your mood, and increase your energy. It's important to keep the length of your nap in check, though, as too much sleep may leave you feeling groggy and sluggish. That's why it's important to choose the right length for your afternoon siesta‚Äîa quick 20-minute nap should be just right for a mood boost!

## 9-Have some mood-boosting foods:

Eating certain foods can help boost your mood and make your day a bit brighter. Whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats are all important nutrients to add to your diet to help with mood regulation. Foods like dark chocolate and walnuts are especially helpful in releasing endorphins, which can make you feel good.

## 10-Drink more water :

Making sure to drink plenty of water can also help you stay hydrated and energized throughout the day, further contributing to your mood.

## 11-Put on your favorite dress:

Wearing something that you feel comfortable and confident in can bring about a feeling of happiness and even help boost your productivity. Wearing some of your favorite clothes will instantly lift your spirits and make you feel more prepared for the day, even if you spend the entire day at home.

## 12-Keep up with hobbies:

Occupying oneself with a hobby is a really beneficial way to remain content and motivated. A hobby may be the honing of a skill, a craft, or simply an enjoyable pastime that enables one to relax and take a break.

## 13-Get More Sleep:

When one is tired, they are not themselves, and partial sleep deprivation can have a huge impact on one's mood. Sleep is essential to lead a healthy and successful life.

## 14-Have a quick tidy-up:

Make sure to reserve some time, even if it‚Äôs just for five minutes each day, to tidy your environment as it will be beneficial for your mental health.

I was tired of having my GT 1030 PC which was struggling to run games made past the mid 2010s which was extremely frustrating for playing new games with my friends. Alas,  at the end of the summer I had saved up $2000 dollars and bought all the parts for my pc. I build it and nothing. No signs of life at all. Did some diagnosing and thought I had found the reason why it wouldn't work. A defective part. Was so certain of the issue that I returned the part I ordered and got a replacement. Still wouldn't work. I was so certain I did it AGAIN! STILL WOULDN'T WORK. Was so mad that I gave up and for about a month was very down. I sacrificed hours of good times with friends for something that didn't work? I thought about it everyday and thought that I had just wasted a summer in one of the best times of a human life due to no responsibilities and less accountability. Don't want to sound cheesy but I genuinely felt depressed. Eventually I started to forget and over time it started to matter less as in school I was doing good. Great friends, the highest grades I'd had in my life so far, and enjoying life in general. However as Christmas came around, there was one thing I wanted. To fix my computer and put that chapter behind me and be able to move on. My dad offered to help and a couple days after Christmas we took it to a repair shop. I don't know what the issue was, and frankly I don't care as I have finally moved on from this difficult part of my life as the PC is working and I am currently typing this from it.

I have some great things going for me: I was born with a fully functioning body (besides allergies) and to two amazing parents who, although they both have mental health challenges, love me. I had access to public education as a kid. And I'm really smart (not a genius though, but pretty close) 

But other things were tough right from the get go: I have autism for one. I couldn't enunciate enough to be coherent until I was about eight (I still struggle with being heard right to this day). At that point,  I was diagnosed bipolar because I tried to kill myself. I believe part of this was due to trauma that happened when I was four. Regardless, my brain had stopped regulating emotions and, from that point, I was either trying to rule the world (with full confidence that I could) or trying to avoid humanity and sleep until I passed away. I was still forced to go to school where, although I received top marks without caring, I refused to conform and became the target of my peers and sometimes my teachers wrath(this would continue until I graduated.)

After that I was repeatedly hospitalized for being a danger to myself, or not being able to take care of myself. (16 times) 

BUT here's the good part:
Life is good! Things are still hard, my meds don't help 100% and I'm struggling with housing, but even when I'm down, I love life! It's the little things that truly count. A leaf from a tree, dipping your fingers in a stream, finishing an art project, a smile from a stranger,  or having just enough money for Starbucks hot chocolate and being able to tip the change. You might ask why do all these things make me rich if they have no measurable value? Why does this make up for the hard things?  Because I chose to give them value.  When we are grateful, we give value to the things which the universe has given to us, and that makes us all the richer. Maybe the key to happiness isn't getting more, but placing more value in the good things which we do have.

I talk with them a ton, and we all just generally have a good time. They‚Äôre all so kind and thoughtful and interesting and I love them all.

i got his contact info and let him know id probably take him up on his offer. something about the whole experience left me all giddy and smiling. its just good to see good people doing good things for others. even if it seems too small to matter or too big of a nuisance, to the one needing the help it could mean the whole world.

I had a shitty immune system, extreme irritation, self-harm, paranoia, occasional hallucinations, etc. And my parents were considering supporting me for the rest of my life and not sending me off to post-secondary. Thankfully, my school advisor heavily pushed for it and said to give it a go, since my grades made the bare minimum for acceptance. 

After moving out for university, however, I landed my ass in a very chilly apartment. It was really fucking cold, so I had to bring a bunch of extra blankets. The weight was oddly comforting and helped me sleep. Within a week, just about every mental issue plaguing me was gone, and afterward I realized I hadn‚Äôt been seriously sick for an entire year. When I went back home to visit though, some of my symptoms came back. Anyways, I realized most of my symptoms were chalked up to sleep deprivation because my parents‚Äô house is too hot. After they turned down the thermostat I was back to normal. 

I‚Äôve been sleep deprived for 17 years and everyone thought it was mental illness. I‚Äôm so happy that I‚Äôve been ‚Äúcured‚Äù. I‚Äôve gained an appetite for the first time, my skin is clear and not scabby, and my mind feels so clear. My physical health is getting better too, as I‚Äôm no longer as sickly and put on healthy weight. I‚Äôm ecstatic and feel amazing, and have been acing my exams without any special accommodations.

Looking back, I think my first inkling that this wasn‚Äôt a mental illness was that I was like a different person on vacations, when I got to stay in a heavily air conditioned hotel room all day and got proper sleep. But as I got older and struggled more with school, I couldn‚Äôt afford to go on vacations anymore. Better late than never though, I‚Äôm just thankful that everything is sorted.",1673940705.0

So a while ago I [28F] started talking to someone [27M] via Reddit chat. We immediately hit it off and had a lot of fun talking to eachother, with deep and long conversations. We told eachother real personal stuff though, things you don't easily tell people in real life. It's Reddit so it's all anonymous and we're never going to meet.


I'm from a tiny ass country in Europe (Netherlands) where Reddit isn't super popular, so you don't often meet people that are on Reddit (although it's increasing) or even know about it. I felt completely safe sharing all this personal stuff with a stranger, because he was just that, a stranger. It might've turned kinda flirty at some point. No harm in that right? It's all anonymous.


After talking for a while he said something regarding the weather at his location, which was stunningly similar to mine. The realisation kinda dawned on me, so I asked where he was based. Lo and behold, he told me he was from the Netherlands. I sat there looking at my screen for a good bit. I couldn't believe it. How big is that chance?


We'd been communicating solely in English at that point, as one does on Reddit. So I asked him which area, which turned out to be the same as mine. We live 30 minutes apart. My job is close to his house. So, I answered him in Dutch and let him know just how close to me that was.


After getting over the initial shock, we kept on talking and eventually exchanged numbers. Both deciding to lose the anonymity, we started to get to know eachother, kept on talking for hours and hours on end. So, after deciding he was thrust worthy, and he probably deciding the same for me, we decided to meet up.


A lot of tension had been building at that point, but we also already knew things about the other that we'd only told our best friends, or in some cases no one. That's a real different starting point then one normally has when going on a first date.


Well, Reddit, it was amazing. We had so much fun, sparks were flying everywhere and it also turned out we have the same interests, some of the same hobbies, we ran in the same circles and, while our paths were wildly different, are now in the exact same phase in life. 


Over time, we started to figure out we also want the same things in life, have quite the same outlook on life and what we want life to be like, and we really can talk to eachother about anything. He's also smart, kind, insanely funny, considerate, caring, loving and also he's very, very hot. 


I felt super safe and comfortable with him from the start, and I not only started developing feelings, I was falling madly in love with this man who ticked off every single box, whom I met through f*cking Reddit, of all places. Who's going to believe that? 


I somehow never doubted he felt the same. I was looking for a catch, something wrong, but somehow everything felt and was right, even more so when we were together. We spoke about our feelings, with the added bonus of knowing things about eachother that not many people knew. 


And then, Reddit, he called me his girlfriend for the first time, and it was the best feeling in the world. A bit after that, I almost blurted out ""I love you"", but caught myself just in time. I thought about it, and realised I felt it, meant it. But, I also knew about his past and while I'm not going into that, at that moment I didn't want to put too much pressure on him.


So I waited, and almost blurted it out a couple times more. I knew this was some sort of russian roulette, which could only end up with me blurting out ""I LOVE YOU"" at a very inopportune moment. 
Reddit, I'm here to tell you that after a couple of days, HE told ME first. Oh, the pure and utter happiness I felt in that moment, I'm still relishing in it. So I told him I love him back, and the love we shared in that moment has to be what life is all about.


Right now, we're building the deepest connection I've ever build, and also having a connection that's so deep, so intense, that I've never had with anyone else. It feels like I'm right where I'm supposed to be, and I love him so, so much.


So I've got to thank you Reddit. Not only for being my source of entertainment, advice, lessons, laughs, tears, frustration, sadness, outrage, happiness, cute animals, funny animals, and everything in between. But also for changing my life in the most meaningful way, and having me meet my amazing boyfriend (I mean really, what are the chances? I tried to look it up, and there's like a 1 in 1500 chance someone is from the Netherlands, but there's so little data that I have no idea what the chances then are they're from the same area as us, so yeah). 


Truly, from the bottom of my heart, thank you.",1673171410.0

She doesn‚Äôt use Reddit she will never see this but I just wanted to write some stuff about my friend Celia. She and I became friends due to me learning her language in my own country and becoming ‚Äòpenpals‚Äô with her. This continued and eventually we met on an exchange visit. Since then (5 years ago now) we‚Äôve gotten closer and closer and now I‚Äôm living in her country for a year to further my studies and I get to see her a lot more. 

We have so many common goals and interests as well as a lot of differences too and we‚Äôve spent the majority of our friendship being apart and not even necessarily in regular contact however I know she is there and she knows I am too. It‚Äôs really great. 

I don‚Äôt know how to explain it and maybe someone else can relate but she‚Äôs the kind of friend that makes me feel so unbelievably happy and fuzzy and warm the majority of the time. It feels like the closest possible thing you can get to true love on the platonic side of things.

In reality this is nothing more than a false sense of happiness, because true happiness is like anything in this world worth of value: MUST BE EARNED!

We as humans are built to solve problems and need obstacles and resistance to overcome and grow in order to reach our peak potential in life.

Thank you!* ‚ù§Ô∏è 

My father is the ""classic"" misogynistic, golden child AH.

His parents pretty much worshipped him and ruined him to the point where my Aunts and Uncles have cut him (*and us*) out of their lives, last time i saw them was when my little Sister was born.

He runs his own company, so i think it's pretty save to say that he has never heard the word ""NO"" in his life.

Mom, little Sister (17) and myself (28) are/were essentially his ""servants"".

He'd sit in his chair, drink beer and order us around, Scream and yell at us, Mom was afraid of him, Sis and myself too + we grew up that way and all 3 of us HATED it.

I've begged Mom to divorce him for years but she didn't want to because she didn't want to share custody with him and leave us (and later just Sis) to be treated like crap when we'd have to go to him.

I absolutely understand why she didn't and appreciate her wanting to protect us even if i didn't agree with her method.

That all changed December 24th.

Bf(32) and i have been together for 1.5 years (*roughly*) so this is was our first Christmas where we celebrated together.*Small note on BF, He is not afraid of anyone and HATES disrespect with a passion*.

We walk into my parents house and Dad is in his chair while Mom is working on dinner in the kitchen, Bf goes to Mom to greet her and complimented her on the decorations (*massive smile from Mom*) and he greeted Dad 2nd.

That pissed off Dad but BF has ALWAYS greeted my Mom first unless Dad is significantly closer to him, Dad has complained to me about it because he is ""the man of the house and should be greeted first"" and more BS like that.

But BF has told me that this is how he was raised (*By an amazing woman,* *single Mom of 2, Older sister and him*) and he's not changing anything and i don't see why he should.

BF took an interest in Mom's cooking which smelled AMAZING and i saw Mom light up like i have not seen before, Answering questions, explaining things, sharing tips between them (*he is a really good cook too*), Absolutely lovely to see.

We sat down in the living room, Sis came downstairs and joined us, had a great time together and pretty much ignored Dad who was glued to the TV as per usual.

Mom asked if anyone wanted something to drink and BF jumped up and said ""You've worked hard on the food, It's your time to relax, i'll get it"", he took our ""order"" and went to the kitchen, Dad wanted Beer.

Bf asked him what beer he wanted since there are a lot of different ones in the fridge and dad said (*in an angry tone*) ""Just grab one, i don't care""

Bf comes back with a bottle of wine and 2 glasses for Mom and myself in 1 hand and Sister's drink in the other, Went back into the kitchen to grab the beer and his own drink.

Put the beer on the table infront of dad, Dad stands up and yells ""That's it, i will NOT be disrespected like this in my own house!!!""

Mom, Sis and me just ""shrunk"" but BF turned around and said ""I asked what beer you wanted and you said just grab one, What's the problem?"" Dad: ""It's not about the beer, i got served last in my own house?, You will NOT disrespect me like that!!!""

BF: ""First off, **I** got served last, in fact, i've not even put my drink down, and what did you want me to do? Did you want me to (actually did airquotes) ""disrespect"" your wife or your daughters instead? I have 2 hands, both were full"" and he turned around and sat down.

Dad tried to respond but just stuttered and pretty much ran upstairs, BF continued the conversation like nothing happened until Dad slammed the door and BF said ""Well, That door is shut"", broke the tension and we laughed.

It was like THAT was the moment something changed for Mom

A bit later we sat down for dinner, I went to go get Dad, told him dinner was ready and he snarled ""I'm not coming"", we used to beg him to come down (*not the first time he's pulled this stunt*) but after seeing BF stand up to him, i just said OK and went back down.

We had an amazing dinner with Mom, Bf, Sis and myself.

Afterwards we sat down in the living room for the gifts, Mom went up to get Dad again and came back down not even 30 seconds later and sat on the floor with us to open the gifts.

We had so much fun opening the gifts, Laughing, Drinking, throwing wrapping paper at each other, just having fun without a care in the world (*which i've NEVER seen Mom do*).

Hours later BF and i were heading back home, Mom pulled us both in for a MASSIVE hug (seriously, massive ""Mom hugs"" are something else) and thanked us for ""The best Christmas she has had in YEARS"".

While driving home, Sis texted me a picture of her and Mom, on the floor watching a movie surrounded by a mess which is weird because Mom always had to clean and keep everything ""perfect"" or dad would yell and call her (or us) lazy.

But Mom was ""cleaning it tomorrow"" (HELL YES MOM!!!!).

That all leads to today,

Mom called and asked if her and Sis could come over to discuss something.

They arrived and.....WOW!!!

Mom has had ""simple"" mid back long hair, no color, no ""flavour"", just as simple as possible for as long as i've been alive,

But now, Shoulder length ""bob"" with some ""lowlights"", absolutely STUNNING!!!

All the sadness and fear on her face, GONE, Still Mom, but an absolutely GORGEOUS version of Mom.

She told us that she's going to see a divorce lawyer on the 9th and will try to"" find a place and move out as soon as possible.

After a long discussion on how she wants to do everything, we asked her, why now?

She said (*and i'm proud and so fucking happy she said this*) ""At Christmas something changed for me, To see ""BF's name"" stand up to dad like THAT, And the way BF always treats you, your sister and me with so much love and respect,

BF actually treats me like i'm my own person and i have not felt like that in a long time, With you 2, i'm Mom, Don't get me wrong, i absolutely LOVE being Mom for you 2, but i'm more than just Mom, I was either Mom or Dad's wife (*which is true, he would always introduce her as ""My wife, name"", NEVER ""Name, my wife"", It might not seem like a big deal, but to her it is/was*)

I have not been ""Mom's name"" in a long time, I've had enough, i'm not letting him treat me like this anymore, i'm not in love with him anymore, in fact, i haven't been in love for a very long time, i don't even have love for him anymore.

But Sis is old enough now and with the 2 of you and ""Bf's name"" with me, i can do it"".

I'm so damn proud of my Mom for standing up for herself now,

I'm so damn happy that my BF was able to make her feel like her own person again when he didn't even try.

I'm so damn happy that Mom, Sis and myself NEVER have to be treated like shit by that man again.

I'm just so FUCKING HAPPY!!!!

IF you feel like you're stuck in a similar situation as my Mom, YOU CAN GET OUT, YOU CAN FEEL LIKE YOU AGAIN, DO IT!!!

Find the love for YOURSELF again, whether that is because someone else showed you that you're worth it, because you read my (and Mom's) story or because you found the love for yourself, within yourself again.

YOU CAN DO IT!!! Find YOU again, and BE HAPPY AGAIN!!!

So it kinda caught me off guard when I was already saying thank you when he gave me the change and saying goodbye and he just looked at me and told me I had very beautiful eyes. And that was it, it wasn't like he was asking my number and saying this to charm me, this cute guy just wanted to tell me that he thought I had very beautiful eyes simply because.

And afterwards I just caught myself smiling for a bit every now and then thinking about it. I'm almost kinda disappointed that he didn't ask for my number since he seemed cute, but it still feels really nice to get a respectful compliment like that with no goal behind it and not just guys catcalling or telling you nice things to get your number or to get into your pants.

I came from a horribly abusive household, my mother legitimately wanted me dead. But,

I started dating a guy towards the beginning of this year, and every moment of it has been joy. He helped me gain my freedom from my abusive mom, and is currently helping me learn how to adult in general.

He respects every weird little boundary and oddity I have, he doesn't mind knocking on the door when he comes into our room to let me know he's entering, he doesn't mind when I have days where my skin feels icky and I don't want to be touched(I'm autistic this happens kinda often). He very happily eats the food I cook for him.(I'd say I'm a decent cook)

Every moment of every day feels like I'm living a dream, and it's all because he genuinely wants to see me be happy and grow as a person.

Because of his love and respect, I've had the motivation to take care of myself, I've lost nearly 80lbs (I'm 223lbs now wow!) And I've started eating real food that I am supposed to! (Many dietary restrictions)

Coming up on the new year with him just makes me feel even more excited to finally be free, because I get to live that freedom with him by my side. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",1672501775.0

Its a Fantasy Adventure novel about two characters named Sandis and Rone living life on the run by a mob-group of slavers.

I got finished with chapter 20, I've got maybe 20 percent of the book to go, and I am broken in the best possible way. To sum up whats happening Rone and Sandis are practically homeless and on the  run, and are trying to find a way to escape not only the slavers but also to try and find a better living situation.  Rone's mother is in prison, and he just learned that she's going to be executed in a few days. He learned this from a very rich man who works with the mob, who offered him a ridiculous amount of money and his mother's freedom in exchange for Sandis. 

Sandis is a sweetheart who ran away from the slavers in an attempt to find her long lost uncle, and to hope for a better life. She was initially cold, not knowing how to really interact with anyone, but blossomed to this lovely person who just wants to do the right thing. She doesn't realize it but she fell in love with Rone, and is being more and more vulnerable with him.

Rone has feelings for Sandis too, but has agreed to  turn her in for her mother's safety, freedom, and security for a better life. He's torn apart inside and is hiding it from Sandis and has to deliver her in 2 days to the mob; they practically go on a date together on their last day before Rone turns her in and you can see how much Sandis trusts Rone and loves him and  how broken Rone is over what he's doing and it's all JUST SO DAMN GOOD I COULD FEEL TEARS STARTING TO COME RONE DON""T DO IT

I literally couldn't continue reading it was too heartbreaking after a certain part where Rone is about to deliver her and Sandis could sense the mob and gosh damn I'm just having a great time!

So, I used to have a really great playlist of music when Spotify was first getting popular, and I remembered listening to so many of the tracks on repeat together‚Äîthe playlist was ""night music"" inspired by one evening of my twenties when I realized everyone at a party I was part of had come down from their drugs or substances of choice and/or sexual encounters and/or long stories that traced the room as though they were wisps of hashish smoke. I looked out the window and watched the wind blowing a flashing red traffic light back and forth, and the streets were absolutely still and silent. I was so glad to be alive that moment.

At some point, I deleted the playlist, knowing I'd ""liked"" or favorites all the tracks, and made a much better, larger, more coherent playlist. However, there was this ONE SONG I forgot to like.

This song, mind you, has no lyrics, isn't all that popular or by a big name artist, and even humming the opening tune isn't all that useful because it's a bunch of leaps of fourths and fifths in a piano.

I tried for years to find this. I went through every playlist. I searched message histories. I had Spotify make me playlists based off what I listened to adjacent to it. Over and over. Nada. Until tonight when I was taking a walk through the cold and snow, determined to get ice cream before I fly away from my hometown I visit on Christmases, and I thought I saw a familiar seeming artist name. I gave them a listen, and was like ""oh rad, this is a cool sound they have"" and then a piece of album art struck me, followed by the track's name below it. I had absolutely no memory of any of these until that moment, when I had memory of **all** of this.

And that's how I found the song *Pinch of Peer* by Kettel, and let out a gigantic ""YESSSSSS FUCKING YESSSS HAHAHAhaha"" yell at night in a quiet suburb, and felt like I could roll in the snow with excitement.

Now it's no longer that exciting having listened to it a bunch, but the relief of such a long effort to remember and find it...I swear I still have some sort of aura or afterglow from that moment of total, pure joy.

My husband and I have been married for about a year. I moved states to be closer to his work and family. We left my house I'd bought in the other state and were long distance tripping to fix it up a couple times a month for the last 8 or so months and it has been completed for the last 2.

We ran into numerous problems with that along the way and recently had to pay a big chunk of change due to my oversight in all of the house buying paperwork and busy-ness. We have been more stressed now than ever before but now that the house is done, everything (that we can possibly think of) is paid and taken care of, we are about to move into our in-laws newly renovated basement for a while while we save up for a home. 

We are so incredibly lucky to be in the position that we are in. My in-laws are nothing short of wonderful and they are such a blessing to me and of course to my husband. 

We will both have about an hour and a half to two hour commute every day into the city and last night we slept at my in-laws and this week are doing a sort of ""trial-run"" with our commute into the city for work. Luckily we both work 9-5 jobs 10 minutes away from each other so it just made sense to take one car. This has been one of the most daunting ideas in moving in with them so we have been sort of putting it off in the name of convenience.

THE CAR RIDE WAS SO MUCH FUN! I know it's still kind of a novelty right now and won't always be as fun as it was this morning but I feel like in so many ways we are coming out of the woods! Luckily, my husband is just a beautiful human being and our problems that we have had in the marriage have all been external but it's been stressful and put a strain on both of us. Transitioning into tackling things together while being newly married has been quite the task but I have always believed I could not have designed a better life partner. 

Once we get established and start saving for a home, we will finally start talking about starting our little family! We both want kids so badly and have just been waiting for the right time and it feels like we are inching up on it. I want to cry I am so happy. 5 or even 3 years ago, I could never have imagined that this is what my life would look like right now and I am overjoyed that our hard work and dedication and investments are beginning to pay off!

I am hugely blessed and just needed to get this out there since I'm new to the area and haven't made any friends that I could tell. I hope everyone is having a beautiful day and a joyous holiday season and end of this year! I love you all! Thank you for listening to my happy rant! :D",1672241619.0

Because of my setup I‚Äôve had a hard time getting the rock sound I really want, but I treated myself to a Marshall amp (nearly cried when I first started playing with it) and finally had the sound I was looking for. I finally got to attempt some songs I‚Äôd been wanting to play and wow. First song I played was back in black (of course) and started to try black dog. Well today I got the black dog riff and was basically sprinting around my house showing my roommates the video, sent it to my mom, posted it, everything. Then my roommate started to play bass for shout at the devil so we sat down and did it together, which we haven‚Äôt successfully done before. It felt incredible. I finally feel like I can embark on the journey of rocking the fuck out. It‚Äôs extra special too because I got my guitars from my dad who passed away late June, and I barely evened listened to rock except for when he played it until now.

So I booked a 16 day trip in Europe across 9 countries in early December through Contiki. I went into the trip hoping to meet a lot of new people and see/experience a lot of things in Europe and sure enough I experienced and met a lot of interesting and friendly people that I spent 16 days travelling with. I met this wonderful girl, let‚Äôs call her Grace, on the first day of the trip and we sat next to each other on the bus. As we talked and talked throughout the bus trip, I become very fond of her and would spend the next few days of the trip with her, not exclusively but part of a small group. Days went by and I had started to develop feelings for her. Now I‚Äôve never been in a relationship before and I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm quite inexperienced with the whole flirting ‚Äògame‚Äô because my way of dealing with these kind of feelings is to just ‚Äòsit‚Äô on them or just flat out ignore them. However, I‚Äôve been on a bit of a ‚Äòspiritual‚Äô journey this year with regards to self love and self discovery so I thought what the hell I‚Äôll shoot my shot as I probably have a very low chance of seeing her again after the trip finishes as we all go our seperate ways. So if it happens, it happens. 

Grace had a her birthday coming up soon and we‚Äôd be in Rome together to celebrate it so I decided I‚Äôll buy her a thoughtful gift and tell her about my feelings for her but at this point I didn‚Äôt know what to get her. About 4 days before we got to Rome, we were in Prague and I was visiting/seeing the infamous Charles Bridge with Grace and a bunch of other people. While we were there Grace kept going on about how the Spider-Man Far from Home had a scene on this bridge featuring Tom Holland and Zendaya. I‚Äôm a vivid Spider-Man fan so I knew instantly what scene she was talking about. It was the scene where Tom takes Zendaya out for a walk on the bridge and then tries to give her a gift and confess his feelings for her. This was my light bulb moment, I knew what I wanted to do now. We were going to be in Venice in a couple days and I know in the movie Tom Holland buys a black dahlia flower necklace for Zendaya. So I thought I‚Äôd try to kinda replicate that and try to buy the same necklace for Grace.

So a couple days go by and we end up in Venice. At this point I‚Äôm so excited because I‚Äôve never done something like this for anyone before and for once in my life I‚Äôm actually trying to do something about my feelings for someone. Anyways, straight after the tour of Venice in gondolas, I head out on my search for the necklace on my own. I went into every glass shop I could find as I was walking around the streets of Venice but I couldn‚Äôt find exactly what I was looking for. Hours go by and it was soon time to leave the city of Venice yet I couldn‚Äôt find anything that I was looking for but thankfully half an hour before we were due to get in the ferry and leave Venice, I found a shop that had a beautiful necklace that had a black flower as the central piece and I knew as soon as I saw it that it was the one. It wasn‚Äôt exactly like the one in the movie but it looked similar enough so that she‚Äôd know where it was from and the meaning behind it. So I left Venice feeling accomplished!

A day later we‚Äôre in Rome, finally the day had come! I was very excited and but also quite nervous as this was in the realm of the unknown for me. I mustered up the courage to ask her to see her alone. We met in the lobby and I suggested that we go for a walk outside. So we went on a walk, I asked how her day was going and what she got up to today as we had a free day in Rome. Soon after that conversation I told her that I got her a birthday gift and promptly handed her the wrapped box with the necklace. As she opened it, she realised what the necklace was and where it was from almost immediately. She stopped walking and asked ‚ÄúIs this a black dahlia necklace?‚Äù and I promptly said yes. She opened up her arms and asked me for a big hug. It was one of the best hugs I‚Äôve ever received and then I told her about my feelings for her. She told me she kinda knew already from other people (I told a few other people on the trip) but she wasn‚Äôt really looking for anyone at this point as she had a really bad break up earlier in the year. She had also started to distance herself from a bit from me prior to this day but I didn‚Äôt really try to think of it much. Anyways I understood her perspective  on the matter and thanked her for her honesty. On the way back to the hotel she told me she felt bad for saying no and I told her that she shouldn‚Äôt feel bad about being completely honest with me, it‚Äôs for the betterment of both of us. 

We then proceeded to distance ourselves a bit from each other for the rest of the trip to give each other a bit of space. I didn‚Äôt let this rejection ruin the rest of the trip. In my mind I wore it like a badge of honour. I‚Äòm so proud of myself that I did something like this for someone special even though it didn‚Äôt work out in the end. Now I feel like telling every one of my friends and the whole world about this so here I am! Every now and then I‚Äôd watch the Venice and Prague scene from the movie to ‚Äòfeel‚Äô the butterflies again because I went out and did something very similar to the movie.

Thanks for reading all this if you got to the end. I appreciate you!",1672061383.0

We eat food, played some Jackbox, and did a tradition called ""Find the Christmas pickle"" which isn't what it sounds like. Her parents hid a pickle ornament in the tree and had us all look for it. Her little sister found it and got a gift card, and everyone else got ""runner up"" gifts. They gave each of us a sharpie coloring set. I excused myself to use the bathroom, and went to ball my eyes out. I didn't expect to get any gifts this year, and even more overwhelming was that I didn't expect to feel loved by anyone but my partners and our close friends. I realized these people had really accepted me as part of their family, and something I didn't realize was partial became whole again. Once I came back from the bathroom they began handing out their ""Family Gifts"" and explained to me that they give gifts from each other on Christmas Eve and get gifts from Santa the next morning. Her mom gave me a look like ""smile and nod for the little kids"" and I did. As they passed out gifts, they gave me a big box. I said ""Who's this for?"" And my girlfriend said ""You, silly."" I cried the second time because they gave me a brand new air fryer, which was such a thoughtful gift for reasons that I won't lengthen the post with. I thanked them profusely and we went on to eat ice cream and watch Elf. It gets crazy from here. I told my girlfriend I'd like to head home soon so we can have some alone time, and before we can leave, her mom asked to pull me aside into another room. She pointed to a huge sack filled with gift-wrapped boxes and said ""Santa dropped off your gifts early so you could take them home."" I immediately knew these were for the small girl within earshot, so I said ""Oh got it, thanks for holding onto them."" Me and my girlfriend got the bag into the car and I said ""I hope your dad helps you get that back inside later. It's heavy."" She looked so confused and said, genuinely, ""Honey, these are yours. We're taking them to your house."" I stared at her for a second, just waiting for to say she was joking, but she didn't. I immediately broke down sobbing in her arms.

Yesterday I heard I got accepted in to my dream college I‚Äôve been trying to get in to for 2 years with a lot of ups & downs (mainly downs) 

I FINALLY DID IT!
I got the news a month earlier than expected today, so it really came out of the blue. Now I‚Äôm in bed, it‚Äôs 4:30 am, and I feel warm & fuzzy all over after lying awake all night. It‚Äôs finally dawned on me that the live I‚Äôve wanted to have and fought for will actually happen in a few months. I‚Äôm actually crying with happiness. Didn‚Äôt even know I could do that.

On top of that, I think I‚Äôm starting to develop a crush on this girl I met through mutual friends. I don‚Äôt know her all too well, but it feels AWESOME to experience teenage-like butterflies after years of not trusting anyone after my gf of 3,5 years cheated on me, and moved in with, a guy a month before lockdown.

AND I‚Äôm seriously getting into working out, and loving every minute of it. I feel healthier than ever, mentally and physically.

Guys, it‚Äôs finally my turn to be happy. And for the first time in a long while, I can finally say I‚Äôm so incredibly excited for the future. I can‚Äôt wait for what‚Äôs in store for me!",1671853057.0

 My fianc√©e has just been riding horses for a bit over a year now and was recommended at the yard she goes to as a rider who could part-lease a horse belonging to one of the owners. 

 This might seem like a small thing if you‚Äôre not horsey but it‚Äôs huge. It takes a lot for an owner to want to invite someone to take care of their horse. They‚Äôre expensive and incredibly fragile animals. I know of the work and effort she‚Äôs put into riding over the last year and I‚Äôve seen her on horses and seen how she is with them. I do tell her these things but I‚Äôve been riding longer and I‚Äôm an instructor myself. Me being her fianc√©, I think she thinks I‚Äôm incapable of being honest about her riding sometimes. I see the progress she‚Äôs making in a short amount of time and I‚Äôm incredibly proud of her for that. I learned as an adult and I took way longer to achieve the knowledge and feel that she has already. She makes me so proud of her! 

 I‚Äôm just happy because it‚Äôs a mark of her progress. I‚Äôm proud because the hard work is paying off. It‚Äôs a wonderful opportunity and one that will make our own dreams of having a yard and working together in the industry more achievable too. It‚Äôs a huge step in the right direction for her.

I never really paid attention, and I‚Äôm not going to lecture anyone on the topic.

I was watching a show last week and someone mentioned ‚Äúliving a life with meaning‚Äù. My life is in no way meaningless - but still, the comment stuck with me, and kept popping back into my head during quiet moments of solitude. I decided to make a difference in someone else‚Äôs life‚Ä¶ a stranger. I did research for a couple of days, then approached my wife with the idea of sponsoring a child. She was completely on board with the idea, so we went for it.

Being D&D players, we decided to let the dice determine our fate. We rolled dice for the child‚Äôs gender: even a boy, odds a girl. We rolled even. We then rolled two 6-sided dice to determine age. We rolled 8. So we‚Äôd sponsor an 8 year old boy, but where?

We live in the US, so we decided on Mexico, for a couple of reasons. We decided that if we ever wanted to visit the child in the future, Mexico would be much more realistic for us than going to Africa or Asia. Also, my wife was already learning Spanish, and that could prove very useful.

I‚Äôm incredibly excited about this experience! I‚Äôve sent an introductory email to the child we‚Äôre sponsoring, with a couple photos of us and our dogs, and can‚Äôt wait for our first response.

In the title I said this has already changed my life‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs one way it has: the child‚Äôs family lives on about $70 a month. While we‚Äôre by no means rich, that‚Äôs mind blowing to me. I‚Äôm looking at every purchase differently now. I spent $29 today on a small bag of puppy food. That‚Äôs almost two weeks of income for the child‚Äôs family. It‚Äôs very sobering.

I spent most of today exploring his village on google maps, watching YouTube videos about the region, and reading Wikipedia and other articles. His village is pretty small, but is known for its export. It‚Äôs absolutely fascinating, exploring this other culture, and seeing where this kid goes to school, church, and shops.

We‚Äôve pledged the default $39 a month to start, but will probably increase it later. If you don‚Äôt have experience with any of this stuff (like I didn‚Äôt) that money goes into a pool with the money from other sponsors. That pool of funds is then used to improve the community by providing clean water, food, school supplies, etc.

I‚Äôve learned a lot about how these kinds of programs make a huge impact on these kids (I‚Äôll spare you the numbers), but wasn‚Äôt prepared for the impact on myself. I‚Äôm thinking about this kid constantly, and it has done something to me deep down to know that I might be having a positive impact on his life that may severely alter his future for the better.

Since I‚Äôve written a book here I‚Äôll stop, but not without saying this experience has me feeling wonderful, and I‚Äôve only just begun this journey! :)",1671520137.0

This is going to be a little long-winded, and I'm not sure where to start, so (apologies in advance), I'm going to start in a dark place.

About 6 years ago, I found myself at what turned out to be the tail end of a very unhealthy marriage. I knew something was wrong, but I hadn't connected all the dots yet. I didn't grow up with language that accurately captured abuse in all its forms. Throw in a heavy dose of conservative Christianity  and I was left with a toxic soup of ""if he doesn't beat or cheat,"" there's no escape unless someone dies. Even though it felt uncharitable, I was praying it would be him. Then it occurred to me that I could make it be me, but I had two small kids and leaving them alone with (let's call him) #1 felt cowardly.

There was a ray of light, though, in this dark period. It just so happened that I gained a new colleague that year: the sweetest, most supportive person I have ever met. I was immediately drawn to his soft, gooey center, and it didn't hurt that he was good looking, too. I never let on how I was feeling because, after all, I was married and he was an honorable man. 

Then one day, I had a particularly distressing conversation with #1 while at work. Normally, I would have gone down to see my best friend, K, over my lunch break, but she was in a meeting, so I came running back up the stairs, only to encounter (let's call him) #2. When he asked what was wrong, without even thinking about it, I vomited out all my inner turmoil. Then he said something that caused me to reevaluate everything. He told me that no one should hurt me like #1 was hurting me. I'd never looked at it that way, and that paradigm shift is what ultimately enabled me to gather the courage to walk away from #1. Granted, it took more than a year before I left #1 for good, and another before the divorce was final, but #2's kind words were the push that I needed in the right direction.

I wound up changing careers that summer, and #2 and I fell out of touch. After my divorce was final, though, I called him to thank him for his kindness. We called and texted intermittently for a while, but it was always just a friendly back and forth, smalltalk and the like. The more we talked, the more I fell head-over-heels for him. I hoped that he'd show some kind of interest in being something more than just friends, but when he seemed to get more, rather than less distant, I started a dating profile and hit it off with a really great guy. 

#3 and I dated for about a year before we got engaged. Then one day, a little more than a year ago, #2 asked how things were going and I mentioned how swamped I was with wedding planning. He responded with congratulations and disappointment that it wasn't him. I died inside a little that day. That was the last time we ""spoke"" until about two weeks ago.

#3 and I wound up breaking up, then reconciling, only to break up again just after Halloween. I'm very grateful for my time with #3. I grew a lot, and he helped put back together some of the pieces that #1 had torn apart, but ultimately, it was not a good fit for either of us. The way we broke up stung a lot, and I mentioned to another friend that I was ready to give up on dating all together, but inspired by my friend's example, after that conversation, I decided to revive my dating profile. 

Well, the day after I created my new profile, who popped up as a potential match, but #2! He was using a pseudonym, but I hoped beyond hope it was him. It was! And I was completely honest about how I had felt and still feel about him.

We've gone on two dates now, and are planning to see each other again, soon. I'm trying to keep my expectations in check, but I'm so excited I could burst! I just had to share this with SOMEONE, even if it is anonymous Internet strangers.",1671491485.0
