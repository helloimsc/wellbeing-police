Today it did, but the best possible way I think. I don't know how long she was off her medication, but the last few days it grew much worse than I had ever seen. When she was upset she was rambling about things she hadn't since she first developed schizophrenia. 

I had to call police to take her. I wish I hadn't watched this all unfold but I did. I am incredibly thankful for the officers that helped today, they did everything they could to calm the situation. Unfortunately my mom was too far gone and they had to use force. If I had not mentioned exactly what was happening and what to expect I think this could have gone so much worse and that scares me.

However I'm just happy she will get the care she needs, and I will make sure it remains that way. Much of my family has given up on her, but I will not. 

Schizophrenia in all forms is horrible and deliberating without help, and I pray everyone suffering from it can one day be free from it.",1678068922.0

28,Very Worried,4,11jhnfo,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/11jhnfo/very_worried/,7,"Someone I care about very much has been having trouble with his mental health, and got diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia last month. In just a few months he's gone downhill, fast. He's taken the diagnosis very hard and refuses to seek treatment or acknowledge that he really is sick. Sometimes he has flashes of insight, but they're gone quickly. I know this is common, and I even read a book about how to effectively talk to someone who has this problem, but another problem is that I haven't even been able to talk to him enough to use the strategies in the book. 

We were close before, but over the course of the last few months he's distanced himself from me more and more. At this point he's pretty much refusing to speak to me at all. At first he apologized and felt guilty for being distant and said he'd be more present, but it's just gotten worse. Aside from some supposed ""good days,"" where he makes more sense and says he's fine (he's not, but he seems comparatively more fine than before that), which are increasingly few and far between, he's in a constant fog of psychosis. He's been posting incoherently online and pretty much just talking to himself about his delusions, but the worst thing is that some of the things he's been posting are potentially indicative of him planning something dangerous. He's displaying a lot of anger, comments about being disgusted by humanity, talk of being put on a watchlist and ""having a duty to do,"" etc. He told me not to ask him about it. 

I just love him and it hurts that he won't speak to me, because I really want to offer him support. His behavior is scaring me right now, he's deteriorating quickly, and I'm pretty convinced that something bad is going to go down soon. I want so badly to do something to calm or help him, but he won't even speak to me anymore. 

Is there anything I can do but just watch this happen?",1678059198.0

38,TW - talking about brain tumours,2,11jjoxw,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/11jjoxw/tw_talking_about_brain_tumours/,1,"I‚Äôve created an alt account to post in this community, as I‚Äôm talking about some sensitive information to do with someone else, I hope that‚Äôs ok. I‚Äôm looking for advice / support / opinions / experiences or anything this community might be able offer with what we‚Äôre going through. I‚Äôm sorry this is a bit long.

My husband had a seizure a couple of days ago and we‚Äôve found he has a brain tumour on his left frontal lobe. His prognosis is good, and we‚Äôre fairly positive about how his treatment will pan out. One of my concerns at this point is this - in the past he‚Äôs mentioned a time when he was younger where he went through ‚Äòsomething‚Äô. He is really hesitant to talk about it, as it was an awful time for him. I try not to press him on it. 

But with what has happened now, I did ask about it again and he revealed that what he went through is a sort of ‚Äòtemporary schizophrenia‚Äô that is most common in young men at the age he was when he had it. Some googling turned up the term ‚Äòschizophreniform disorder‚Äô, and with further googling I found that brain tumours, especially where his is located, are more likely in people that have experienced psychosis of some type, and sometimes tumours are misdiagnosed.

From what he‚Äôs said, he never sought help or got treatment. I don‚Äôt believe his diagnosis was official, although I could be wrong about that. He‚Äôs always been very close about that time, and yesterday was the first time he used the term schizophrenia to describe what happened to him. 

My dilemma now is this - we haven‚Äôt mentioned this part of his history to his doctors. I think it could be important but I‚Äôm not sure. He really doesn‚Äôt like talking about it, and I don‚Äôt want to add unnecessary stress to him at this time. On the one hand, maybe it won‚Äôt make any difference because they need to remove the tumour anyway. But then I think it could be important even if we can‚Äôt see how at this time. I‚Äôm wondering if I privately have a word with a nurse or doctor, but then I worry that I‚Äôm breaching his trust.

I‚Äôm also worried that removing the tumour might somehow ‚Äòbring back‚Äô the schizophrenia. I know that brain surgery can cause personality changes, but I don‚Äôt know if what I‚Äôm worrying about is even possible or if I‚Äôm being ridiculous.

I‚Äôm not really sure what I‚Äôm expecting from you all, I don‚Äôt expect you‚Äôll have any easy answers for me. Anything you can offer is appreciated.",1678064406.0

extra info: We live in the UK. She has a care coordinator but they're pretty much useless and hardly visit/contact us anyway. I always have to chase them up. I did ask about a carer that could come help but they said no because she's mentally and physically capable to do it herself (which is obviously not the case)... 

I have tried to prepare things for her like a hot bubbly bath with all her clothing, towel etc ready for her - but she still refuses everytime. The furthest she'll go is doing a strip shower.

They're saying they'll just report me again and get me taken to the ER, which they did based off illogical claims they had, like ""banging head on wall"". Seriously, how would they know what i banged on a wall if they aren't spying, arent in here, and why would they be believed over me explaining it? Its not like i would announce it if i had. I also was accused of pacing, as if that makes sense to start with, people walk around to clean, use the bathroom, look for lost keys, etc...

With the cops bias and how she did a big no-no saying ""go to the ER or I'll get a warrant for a 2 week evaluation"" I kinda have a fear of being recorded outside doing something that a paranoid person would do. They're also not going to look for themselves to see if there is one or not, so I can't even try to see if it is a delusion or harassment. Its like, the #1 requirement to be a delusion, it has to proven impossible and every attempt to do so is met with someone trying to stop it. 

Record audio? Unless sent off its edited, deleted, or the cops can't hear it even if others do. It also has to be edited because its only loudest when cars are going by, and their voices are distorted, slowed down, and stupidly hard to record (I'm thinking white noise) on a pixel 6. I don't have good audio recording equipment, and for a phone the Pixel has a good mic, but its not THAT good. I'm also not big on spending a lot of $$$ on things I don't really have much use for, so a mic I'd need to hook up to a PC or amp or something, is just ridiculous considering the tampering with audio and files already mentioned. There's no guarantee, and even then, cops want video proof of people who know to not be seen by my eyes, and definitely not a camera. Even though i saw them before he told them that, they wont investigate themselves unless i literally get 100% incriminating evidence. Example: they can use a bug if i said yes, but rejected that in the start because they said they had no reason to. 

So who the heck would be who you go to to prove it when you can't risk doing it yourself, because accusations made by random people who don't know you are believed over your explanations of what you're doing? I can't look around outside by myself for this alleged speaker, cops aren't going to check traffic cameras, IDK anyone who knows tech anything, and I'm not sure if they're actually messing with some Bluetooth thing or not because it sounds ridiculous. I'm also very hesitant saying specifics here, as thats not something i wanna get others worried about as a thing their neighbors can do on a budget. Like, prove its not real beyond ""didn't hear it"" from someone who hasn't first claimed hearing loss, and then I'll believe it, but its the refusal to even try thats showed me its definitely not all in my head. One officer says they came by sneakily and heard nothing, but then never asked me if i heard anything that night they did it so how is that proof I thought I heard something, when i never said i had? It's not 24/7, and especially not at first last spring, if he even did come by theres a HUGE chance it was silent. If they heard me speak to someone not there in 2022 with headphones existing, well id rather know why they were hanging around evesdropping under windows as thats not legal in itself in my state. 

Seriously, who are you supposed to get help from? These ""voices"" have literally been laughing because Im pretty sure i can't afford a private detective so dismissed that ages ago, but that can't be the only option for ""need police service when they're being too ignorant to help"". Like, im glad my payee unblocked legal services but like... Unless there's an affordable option thats not going to be possible, and if they don't think it worth their time/don't take you seriously, whos to say that they'll not just take your money and then not do anything, since that's what everyone else is doing so far without the money aspect. Heck, I'm also concerned that IF one exists who's going to take (example) $50, these guys will double it so he sides with them, as they've been good with the manipulation aspect of it all. Seriously, trying to write while the people next door laughing their butts off and confusing you is nearly impossible, so I'm sure this is a stupid mess, but there's a point there somewhere to explain what I'm asking about. 

By all means it'd help just to have a few people confirm that hallucinations dont hide from people and run away, shut up, or sound like idiots who have speakers stuck somewhere outside your house then intimate you to not look for them, would be good enough lol. Their fear of not being caught is just... Too based in reality to not be someone with a motive, gaslighting and trying to mess with me. Especially when they're saying ""it's the government"" and I've never been a conspiracy theorist, but I do believe someone who is a government worker could be a jerk for their own reasons. Considering how a cops relative or whatever broke in and stole last year, i could see a cop lying to his coworkers who would have otherwise helped, but I don't believe its the collective desire of the police department to harass me, nor is there an order by anyone to do so. (I've also only had one officer ever meet with me, except one time when these hackers changed my phone password and i lost the password, so I'm suspicious of him being who's discouraging everyone from helping, but idk why. Still odd, huge force for a tiny town and ive only seen one officer ever. Was also told he doesn't have to use his body camera, by someone who was impersonated so who tf knows at this point, but something ain't right and idk who you go to prove anything like that.

No family or friends of mine are schizophrenic or experience flattening and never offer much comfort.

I'm just so tired of it. I don't feel what I'm meant to feel and I hate knowing that. Ever since I started my medication it's been like this. Not to say I don't like my meds, I do- I'm a paranoid schizophrenic, and it's worked great to fix a good portion of my positive symptoms. But the flattening is just so much.

I don't feel love, happiness, or grief like I used to. I didn't cry at my step mother's funeral, I hardly felt anything while there. My leopard gecko, a littke rescue who meant the world to me, died after months of taking him to the vet to try and help him and it's like it didn't even register with me. 

And with my boyfriend, I have moments where I feel no connection. It's like, in that little span of time, he's a stranger and his affections are some kind of nuisance. It is such a confusing and upsetting thing. I've explained this to him but I still feel so bad. And it isn't something I can fix. We just have to deal with it for the time being.

Public settings have always been a challenge, but now that I'm older and work in retail, it's become a task to fit in. I have to play up the smiles and sweet greetings and happiness so much. It's an entirely different person, and I know it isn't real even while doing it. It drops the second I don't have to do it anymore, and I go back to feeling generally empty.

I talk to my therapist about these problems, and right now it's just what I have to deal with while we try different doses and types medication (currently on 15 MG Zyprexa and 175 MG of Effexor) to see what clicks. I know it might get better and I'm happy with the progress I've made, but I just feel like an emotionless freak compared to those around me. 

Obviously I'm not emotionless, but you get the gist. There's a lot more issues I face in the day to day, but that'd be all too much for a reddit post.

128,Sister's Relapse After Change in Diagnosis from Schizophrenia to Bipolar,4,11hxwhw,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/11hxwhw/sisters_relapse_after_change_in_diagnosis_from/,1,"My sister had her diagnosis changed about 3 months ago from Schizhophrenia to Bipolar 1, and her medicine changed from antipsychotics to Lithium. Since the change in medicine, she has complained of discomfort, appetite changes, and had frequent mood swings. 

  
We could feel her instability as one day she will lash out at the family saying she doesn't need our support anymore and she is working on developing a support system on her own, and the next day she will be gentle with us and say that family support is the most important. She started to talk weird saying she is a messenger of God and she is starting a spiritual warfare journey. What makes it complicated is that she has a 2-year old son and she claimed one night that evil spirits possessed the boy and she spent 4 hours battling the demon but finally won the battle and saved her son by asking the spirit to go to heaven. She lives away from us but after hearing that incident, we immediately went to her place and took the kid to our house and to also let her rest because she claimed that she has not been able to get good sleep with the boy making noises at night. 

Another thing worth pointing out is that she is also a single mother as the Father is not in the picture after learning that my sister has schizhophrenia. She went on for 2 more days alone and still hallucinated a lot and did not get much sleep at all, finally she agreed to get admitted to the psychiatric ward when we checked in with her and she was almost going to fall seemingly from multiple days of not sleeping. The doctor changed the diagnosis to Bipolar with Psychosis. It has been 2 weeks in the psychiatric ward and she has been discharged and now staying in the family home, but everyone is a little anxious because she has a history of violent psychosis and even in her own place she actually destroyed her bed frame. She is under control with antipsychotics now (15mg Aripiprazole, Lorazepam and Lithium) but she still says she sees Mary and Joseph appearing in front of her eyes and that she has telepathic powers to communicate with people she wants to contact. Another layer of difficulty is that she is infatuated with her therapist and professes her love for him, and she creates stories in her head that he is in danger or doesn't exist and she needs to go and save him because he doesn't respond much to her. My dear mother is 70 and also a single mother, and she has to juggle between caring for the 2-year old boy and managing trips to the hospital and therapist for my sister. Me and my other brother are there to help out occasionally but we are working full time and this is taking a toll on everyone. It does not help that my sister doesn't particularly show gratitude and still being very demanding and rude but we understand it may not be her actual intention and it could just be the mental illness messing with her.

  
I am looking for a babysitter in the short term to help alleviate the stress in the house but I have concerns that my sister will not be ever stable to be able to bring up the kid in a conducive environment as she herself has a very poor lifestyle. She doesn't have a sense of hygiene, loves junk food, doesn't clean up after herself and has generally poor financial literacy. She does not listen to advices from my mother and always thinks that we are too naggy and trying to bring her down. We have tried many ways of talking sense to her in the gentlest way possible but realized it works against us because when she goes out in society and speaks to other people, they will be brutal towards her not knowing she has a mental condition and call her obese/dirty. She cannot tolerate criticism, but yet does not want to do anything to prove people wrong. She also cannot take stress and although she is back home, she has very limited capacity and it doesn't help when the boy misbehaves, and she will shut down. I would appreciate it if anyone has dealt with similar situations to let me know how you manage this situation. Everyone is very tired at home and worried about not knowing what's the next step to do. When she was initially pregnant, we actually did not support the idea of her being a mother knowing her tendencies of getting in some form of trouble/stressful situation and not being able to plan for the future, but she claimed that this is probably her only chance of conceiving (she is mid 30's) and she did not agree to abort the baby anyway. The scary thing is during her recovery she said that after she recovers, all spirits will leave her body except one more unborn spirit which will be the current kid's younger brother. When she told that to us, I had chills up my body and we (the family) didn't even want to think of the possibility of raising another kid of hers. She seemingly isn't able to plan for the future and it takes a toll on everyone around her.  
Sometimes I feel bad for thinking so but I think it's better to put the kid up for adoption because our household is clearly not the most conducive for his growth, and I cannot see a bright future of this kid in our household when we need to juggle caring for my sister and always monitoring what she does. But of course this isn't possible because my sister would never agree to that.

Some context: My sister had her first psychosis in 2016 after attending a meditation retreat. She came back from the camp and immediately we knew something was wrong. She could not eat and would often look up and blink a lot very quickly and each time that happens, it feels like she switched personalities and acted very differently. The nightmare came when me and my mom were trying to calm her down, and she ran to the kitchen to grab the butcher knife. As I was with my sister I immediately ran with her to the kitchen and fortunately between the kitchen and the main hall there was a door separating the two areas and I was able to close that door and lock it while shouting to my mom to GTFO of the house. We called the police and ambulance, and when all units arrived she was disarmed and transported to the hospital and admitted to the psychiatric ward, tied to the bed as she was hyperactive and very restless. She was then diagnosed with schizhophrenia and put on antipsychotics which seemed to work well for the past couple of years until the change in diagnoses a few months back.",1677932320.0

Once I went into treatment for 6 months, I discovered that my schizophrenia was created from adolescent trauma and overstimulation from stressful environments.  So I designed a daily routine that is centered around safety, quietude, positive input and balanced mental / physical engagement. Once I fine tuned this balance of stimulation and concentration, I was able to engage with my creative projects and feel like myself again. This breakthrough came after 10 years of struggling with this illness. Recovery for me came down to environment, people & thoughts.

He was the kindest person I knew, would never hurt a soul. He began experiencing symptoms when he was 17, senior in high school, about to graduate. 

He was my half brother. We didn‚Äôt grow up close because our dad left his first wife for my mom. My brother began experiencing symptoms around this time. To this day, my dad feels tremendous guilt believing he was the cause to his schizophrenia. 

I come from a family of Mexican immigrants. Mental illness is very much stigmatized, and many families are simply ignorant on how to handle or ‚Äúdeal with‚Äù situations like this. I know that‚Äôs triggering to say, and I‚Äôm sorry. 

Because we are half siblings and I was conceived by ‚Äúthe other woman,‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt close to this sibling. He wad 15 years older than me. 

Anyway, I grew up scared of this sibling. He was always talking to himself, and screaming at his voices. I have vivid memories of him being in the backyard and screaming at his voices while The Smiths or Depeche Mode was on full blast. He would say the voices were mean to him and told him to kill himself daily. That he was stupid. Everyone hated him. He believed them. 

He would get arrested often, and ended up living in a group home. He took monthly injections. My poor sweet brother would try to work and tried to go to back to college. 

Last week, he went missing. We were so scared and tried every day to find him. The police tell us his body has been found today, and that we will have to pay for an autopsy if we want to know how he died specifically. 

In the last few years, he became violent, refused to take meds, and started taking crack. I truly believe it was to relieve his symptoms. 

I‚Äôm not sure what the point of this post is. My heart is breaking because I know he deserves so much more from life than what he got. If perhaps families that are low income or without much resources were educated in schizophrenia and early intervention. My dad is in his 80s and cannot forgive himself for perhaps being the reason why my brother got so sick. Another one of my siblings has also been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.

&#x200B;

I'm not sure where else to turn to, and I could use some advise.

&#x200B;

I will refer to my friend as Sam in this post. Sam is a good family friend that had been diagnosed with schizophrenia over a decade ago. I actually had no idea until a couple of years ago when her father needed someone to talk to and spoke with me and my dad.

&#x200B;

Recently her symptoms have gotten worse. My parents had visited her parents about two weeks ago for dinner and Sam had lashed out on my parents. Last week I received a call from her, and let's just say the comments and her tone were completely out of character.  I tried calling Sam about three days ago but she doesn't want to talk, and I don't want to push. 

&#x200B;

I think it's relevant I mention she is mostly lacking trust in others. Her parents mention this lack of trust includes doctors, and she has not been taking her prescription lately. She had been caught trying to dispose of her pills several times and is now asked to take them in front of her parents so they could see her take it. This has apparently exasperated her trust issues and she is suspicious of her parents insistence on taking her prescriptions. 

&#x200B;

I'm hoping someone can offer some advise on how I should approach this situation. Should I try keep reaching out to her, or should I just wait until she's ready? When she is ready to talk, how do I go about trying to suggest taking her prescription? Should I even make that suggestion? Because on one hand I think she really does need it, and on the other hand it might seem pushy and she could grow wary of me too.",1677909627.0

So, I come from a family with a lot of generational trauma. My mother raised me as a single mum because a psychic channeler told her she was going to find her soulmate within a month, she met an autistic criminal gang member with 5 different names and decided she was going to have a baby with him, despite him telling her he wasn't going to help her raise it. So you can kind of see the problem already.

She has severe persecutory delusions against my grandmother, who adopted me away from her, and severe delusions of grandiosity that she's some kind of goddess who cannot do harm to anyone, and she will get extremely angry if you inform her that she has done harm to someone. This includes me. She also seems to have a delusion that I want to be ""friends"" with her, and that since I'm ""friends"" with her, I ""owe"" her for raising me, since we're ""equals"". Despite the fact that she had me at 19 and her ""raising"" me consisted mostly of physical abuse and unnecessary poverty, since she always squandered all her money on clothes she never wore and then refused money from my grandmother to help her raise me. She also broke my wrist as a baby but that's a story for another day.

Basically, my mum is the stereotypical ""schizo"". What the hell am I supposed to do?! She sometimes shows up at my house uninvited and lets herself in, believing that she has a right to enter since she owns me as her daughter, I can't avoid her and interacting with her is a sure fire way to ruin my mental state for upwards of a month. Does anyone who understands what it's like to be in her position have ANY idea how I can deal with her? She's the sole reason I'm now diagnosed with DID but she still believes that she's done no harm. It's becoming increasingly hard over my life to be my own individual rather than just ""daughter of crazy woman"".

(p.s. I must disclaim that I understand that majority of schizophrenics aren't like this. My mother also has BPD, but on top of that she is just a fucking terrible person, no matter what disorders she has. It's taken me a lot of my life to learn that disorders don't define someone's personality, regarding others' and my own.)",1677878774.0
156,Advices to keep your illness in check so you live better quality life.,2,11hi38t,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/11hi38t/advices_to_keep_your_illness_in_check_so_you_live/,0,"It's now more than 10 years since I got diagnosed, to be honest it's mostly untroubling with occasional yearly hospitalizations. So far I got 2 stretches of 2 years, so total of 8 for the past 11, be it I had to learn some coping mechanisms along the way to reduce hospitalizations. I must admit the first were 3 months all the rest 20 days total and by day 10 I was pure gold again, it's just the law around here to keep me at lest 10 more. I was told my quality of life will deteriorate while on the contrary it got better since first hospitalization almost to the point before that, but anyway it wasn't peachy even then. Here is my list for new starters:

1. **What I've learned is meds helps. So take them.** Can't vouch for others but my dosage is bare minimum, and I don't even take it all the time. Should be on 12 hour cycle morning and evening, mostly battling with my insomnia, so I take them just at night to put me asleep. I found out I need to constantly visit psychiatrist on a monthly basis to regulate the dosage, which is annoying. **I don't recommend anything I personally do with my medication patterns, I lack PhD in the matter to be an expert.**  This is  what I do and mostly get by just fine. Mainly hate getting dizzy, and cant hit doctors constantly to readjust dosage, I need to get in line with 20 other patients each time...Arm yourself with the knowledge what to do when you skip accidentally taking them, as it will happen over the span of the rest of your life or until a cure is present, which comes first.
2. **Make a habit to do reality checks.** This is a magic trick I invented for myself! As with most people you got diagnosed with this illness later in life, and you didn't grew up with it. So you've got strong understanding of what objective reality feels like from past time experiences. This is a technique I've invented for myself to be able to tell if an episode is behind the corner. I use scale of 1 to 10, if I feel the objective reality is weirder than 4, meaning 5 is about on the border of an episode. I start taking full cycle of morning and evening dosage, although I am not a fan of morning till noon dizziness. If I did, I sure know under the counter drugs have way more enjoyable effects.
3. **Cut off recreational drug usage.** Meaning Marijuana, and I don't really recommend taking at all anything else beside that. If you do take it, in case you live in a place where's allowed by law, like some states in U.S. Lesser strains might have less of an impact, I find life enjoying as it is to experiment with such things. Anything that shift your perception of reality will re-arrange your mentality too much. Once a year I get some pleasure with Sativa to be honest, because I like to clean, tide and dust the house when I smoke, or solo slow dancing in my room on something gentle. Anyway, I found out you won't get stable mentality while using recreational drugs. Stand by my word and don't recommend doing it. Get a hobby. Something that's interesting for you to enjoy. It's far less dangerous. Drawing is a good start. As your perception is twisted, with time you might get very interesting results when you get skilled at it. That's why one of the therapies in mental hospital is drawing. It elevate stress. I recommend [pixeljoint.com](https://pixeljoint.com) instead.
4. **Keep a healthy lifestyle.** Or at least a bit more healthier. People with that illness got trouble with addictive substances because they use them as coping mechanisms. Anything that can provide additional endorphins would do good. I like walking. Running is also fine, doing yoga and hitting the gym on occasion would get fantastic results.  The thing is that it need a bit of time to feel the effect, the reason be it from scientific standpoint the protein that carry endorphins to the brain is 100 times smaller than the molecule of the endorphin, it take a while to carry it to the brain. There's a video online that present it almost as if it's a guy casually walking while carrying big balloon with him. In essence, I know that physical training is counter intuitive because it's tightly connected with feeling physical pain. People struggling with schizophrenia already feel emotional pain almost all the time, and more pain to add feel a bit overwhelming.
5. **Balanced diet is preferable too.** I am not here to lecture you what good food means for your mind and body.
6. **Social connections.** Due to the illness expect your social circle to shrink to 0, that include family. Sometimes even family members struggle to be your friends anymore because you become a burden. Inability to hold a job due to stress can put economical strain on the family and then it gets ugly. If you're able find at least 1 family member, 1 friend or paid specialist that understand your problems. Later one is preferably Cognitive Behavioral Specialist and the right choice among all of them because he's paid to listen to you, while all the rest will show you the finger at some point. Although some people state it's psychology hokum, it's not. My thoughts were confusing and cutting out, I had hard time thinking, until 5 visits with that Cognitive specialist helped me realize it's alright bad thoughts to come around and it's far easier to let them pass, examine and let them fly the f\*ck away. That specialist is dealing with finding root of problems and adjusting your mental point of view upon the problem you have. It won't magically fix the problem, you just know what is the root of it so you can find strength to oppose it. Think of it as a weed in your backyard you can't get rid of. More about social connections is that with time passing you should find new activities where you can gather more friends. You need to keep the social circle as wide as possible. Your doctors and fellow patients you meet are not part of your social circle. Doctors are obligated to be in the role of the friend, while the patients you meet have no other option. And don't bug out on people, it's hard to not have a life but pretend you do, and keep tab on them from time to time, nobody has the time for you. For what it's worth people can't find time to pray to their own god, what about you.
7. **Sleep.** Try to keep your sleep pattern in check. You need to sleep at the same time, and same amount of time each night, no matter Saturdays and Sundays. That's your goal. You're in deep sleep debt. More deprivation is making things worse. It's hard to tell you to increase sleep when you feel tired as this can again throw you off balance. It's a gamble here. You lose when you don't sleep, sometimes you lose when you sleep more than you should, and it's always fine to sleep same amount everyday.
8. **Travel.** Abstain from long travels, prepare short preemptive hospitalization by your own will beforehand so you're sure to be ticking alright when you leave. Be prepared especially if you travel east by plane and skip more than 2 time zones. An article online found an intricate effect on circadian rhythms that if you skip more than 2 time zones by plane when you arrive you might get a bit delusional and get unexpected mood elevation. That's why Brits love going to the Black Sea in Bulgaria, as it's 3 time zones which is plenty 1 zone extra and is dirt cheap of a vacation by their standards no matter the price they have to face. My illness happened when I traveled more 3 time zones east, in the summer heat of August, while being heavily stressed from long work hours. Not sure why, but if there's too much events happening at the same out of the blue your brain can't process everything. You got reduced capacity to digest information. I guess too much surfing on internet could shorten the attention span and your brain feels like it's watching a movie but be able to get 1 frame out of 25 per second because poor connection is halting the stream of data and it can't follow the story on display. I guess if you spend some time reading books that will fix the problem, as this requires stretching to read long wall of text and keep fresh understanding what is going on.
9. **Keep track of time.** Although you don't realize it you need to be aware of passage of time. A ticking wall clock will also help with chasing bad spirits. Your subconscious mind will be able to track time by the harmonious ticks of it. I've never tried using a metronome, I am strongly suspicious it will help. If you can't afford one or don't know how to use one if be anything special at all you might put a task for yourself and put exact time limit, when you finish with it, try to tell how much time has passed without looking a clock. If you're able to accurately tell you can even endure an episode without much damage. I happened to have one that led to nothing much. I put a task to myself to go on a walk for exact hour and got back in 55 minutes without knowing how much time it will be required for me to roam that exact pattern. Reality were shifted but mainly my thoughts were out of normal order. I felt delusional but didn't act on it. Which is next...
10. **Do not act on strange thoughts**, they tend to lead to strange outcomes that will put you in a hospital, with time you'll be taking very heavy meds in high dosage pretty much all the time, and this will lead to you not taking them, shortening time between hospitalizations and thus treated as walking danger. All strategies I've mentioned are coping mechanisms that help, but you must be able to tell in advance when brown matter is hitting the fan. Reality checks help because when you're delusional you can't really tell you are, that's your reality now. But if you check it beforehand each day how it feels like, you know what to expect, you know that you're delusional and by how much.
11. **If you got any addictions, try to find accountability partner.** An addiction would count as any compulsive act you do to cope with stress. From drugs and alcohol trough gamble and sex. I personally try to keep my caffeine intake to a cup before noon, as half life of caffeine is 6 hours, which is how much will be left at 6 PM, if I want to sleep well I should get rid of most of it from my system by 10 PM.
12. **Abstain from suicide, it's normal phenomenon.** You're both stuck in a rut and depressed by same problem that lead to same outcome and has no solution. Should tell you that I found out for myself the need to end your life is actually something nomadic people solved quite easily, because it's nothing else but a feeling for general change. Nothing more. That's why they just packed whatever they had and problem was solved. So if feel the need to end it, be aware you won't get extra points on the day of judgment. Go on vacation or visit nearby town, change the scenery for a while, go with your relatives to see a cousin and go fishing, find something to do that you never did before, even something you might not like, maybe visiting an art gallery, you surely might not like it, but it's just one of the things you've checked on the bucket list. What kept me over the years from this act is when I imagine what will follow, a funeral and broken faces looking down in a hole. You don't want your relatives to do that before the natural time comes. Nothing helps until the general change in your life is present, but at least you fought it off it will be years before you have the urge to do something like this again. And you know how to show it the way out. But that change will come, be sure. No rush to the Evermore, you'll have eternity to browse around the endless beyond that is afterlife, where everyone and every living thing that was is there already. Imagine the eons of life packed in one place. You'll forget where's the entrance at some point I imagine. Don't worry we'll get there. Suicide help lines are a thing you should know.
13. **Depression is leading cause of point 12 in the list.** Clinical depression is something the pills try to keep you away. I found out for myself that if I start binge watching some series, and feel I don't wanna do anything else I am facing the faceless void of depression. Someone might argue that meds are the only way out of it. But there's more natural remedy. That is to start tasking. Wake up ""I will stare at the f\*cking ceiling for 5 minutes..."", Done, I will take the trash out, Done,  make 1 cup of black hot steaming dirt and drink it, then clean the cup...Did you notice it? It's all small trivial tasks, but you need to keep track of them. You trick your mind you're playing a game, and your mind like games. It's counterintuitive but that way I've snapped out of heavy 2 week depressions in a finger snap. Hot showers help, but I must tell you cold showers are the real deal. I've been doing those and making joker faces in the mirror out of happiness after. If you want cut the crap and shove yourself under the cold shower, it works like magic! Depression is a void of feelings, you get numb. You can't find your worth for whatever reason and it's all the same. Shove yourself under the shower now!
14. **Prepare for shift of seasons.** I did not invent this it just happens when Summer meet Autumn and Winter meet Spring more trouble are coming. That's partly because Autumn lead to depression being a sad season knowing winter is even more bleak and uneventful, while you have hard time adjusting for the spur of Life that Spring brings and the crazy Summer that follows with it's immense heat. Keep your brain cool, as you probably got problems with ventilation of the CPU in your head. That's why my doctor said to be aware of summer heat and stay in the shadows as much as possible. Global warming is your enemy. It's not that much of the heat as also the quality of the air. There's too much CO2 and whatnot since past 20 years. I can physically feel it. The blue in the sky shifted it's colors to somewhat gray.
15. **Breathing practice leads to better circulation.** I've noticed over the years that with my smoking habit my breathing became uneven, I need no PhD to know this lead to less than perfect blood circulation which deprive the brain of proper oxygen flow. Mediation is something I can't stretch out enough. But it helps so much, it's only hard to stick to it. Because of trivial reasons like time obsessions. Like why I need to do perfectly nothingness and how it will help me at all achieve whatever, you might ask? Well, for one, the blood circulation and your breathing pattern, to do the meditation practice you need peace and quiet, this leads to finding such a time and place where it's possible to practice it, which you'll see is at best 4-5 o'clock in the morning, while 99.99% of people in 100 miles radius are asleep, because our society is lazy, and people can't just leave at 6 o'clock in the morning and leave their kids alone before school. And finally how meditation help is by locking your brain in his own domain where it most like it, the wake state of dream world! Dark nothingness of shapes drawing in your mind. Until at some point you start seeing white puffy clouds of bliss forming and going who knows where as if Indian Shaman has lighted up the piece pipe. Be aware it takes at least 3 weeks consistent effort of lets say 10 minutes a day to feel any difference as meditation rewires your brain, and this machine has complicated code patterns.",1677884800.0

He told no one in the family he chose to do this. When I moved back into state and saw him for the first time, he looked gaunt, haggered and not like anyone I know.

Flash forward to spring 2022 and he gets in trouble with the law. I suspect he left his front door open accidentally during one of his episodes and didn't notice it because of his preoccupation. He accused the neighbor across the street of breaking in. He went to their home and knocked on their door with a gun (how he got this is shock to me). That's aggregated assault with a deadly weapon, a felony.

We were able to get him a lawyer and get him into an AMAZING probation program that esstientally would remove any felony from his record. Additionally, it's a special mental health probation so they're more flexible because they understand what these folks are dealing with.

Then, in August of last year he stopped paying his rent and was evicted. Then he was homeless. I tried guiding him the best I could but he's so angry and doesn't listen to anyone's opinions, especially women's. He FINALLY got into a place in December that was a really good deal, and his disability monies would cover his rent.

Yesterday he calls me and told me he was arrested for violating his probation.

I know he has been drinking, but I really suspect he's doing drugs as well. He looks so weathered I can't imagine alcohol alone could do that in such a short amount of time.

I really love my brother, but this is so hard on me. I'm the only one he trusts in the family now (because I treat him like a fucking human being even if he is a dick sometimes) I know what he's dealing with is immeasurably harder than anything I have to. 

I just don't know what I can do or should do to help him. I've offered AA or to find him some support groups like this where he could talk with other people going through the same thing, men he could have a good friendship with.. He just blows me off. He says he's antisocial one minute, then moans about how lonely he is. I can't keep up with his thought patterns. I have to keep a journal when talking to him so I can write down what he says then try to figure out what things were said to me vs the other voices he hears. 

Sorry for the long post, I'm just totally gutted. I feel absolutely helpless to do anything for him and the criminal justice system is not going to help him get better either. Any advice or just stories of how you've been able to turn things around would really give me some hope right now.

I honestly believed my psychiatrist diagnosed me in order to help get various resources and benefits from the government. I was interstate last month and had a decent job, I fell into psychosis and tried to kill myself 3x before being admitted to the psych ward for 12 days. My Mum was actually the one to point out that in the last 10 years I have had 11 admissions to the psych ward, all for the same damn thing - psychosis. My primary risk factors are both stress and lack of sleep.

I'm 33 years old and I honestly feel that my condition is getting significantly worse as I get older. It seems that after each psychotic period I find it easier to fall into psychosis and the symptoms are more intense. I don't know what ""stage"" I am in, but I do know that having been charged with a criminal offence being heard in 4 weeks has caused significant stress that triggers my brain to enter into this state of mind that I hate so much. I spent all last night pacing in circles around my motel room and talking to myself, just getting angry and things.

It just doesn't matter what I seem to do, I continually fail over and over. I have recently come to terms with my diagnosis and have given up trying to live according to the high standards I thought I'd be able to manage. I've signed over my government benefits to my Mum because I am terrible with money. 

I'm on Abilify as an AP and whilst it's the best medication I can tolerate, it still seems and times intolerable. I get severe EPS side effects, major tremors and also significant akasthesia that I end up needing to take Benztrop for. I also take Concerta and Tramadol for various issues. 

I am beginning to feel like my situation is just hopeless. I'm currently in temporary accommodation and waiting for a social housing place to be allocated. I lost my job, got criminally charged and tried to commit suicide 3x just over the last month alone. I am really concerned about the charges and really don't want to go to jail. I will lodge my defence of mental health - hopefully the judge sees that I'm genuinely struggling so much.

I was in denial because I didn't think I was the stereotypical schizophrenic, only to then become homeless, dependent upon welfare, crap personal hygiene despite doing my best, talking to myself - yeah, I am almost now the definition of a stereotypical schizophrenic. I saw myself in the mirror the other day and I can't believe how much I've let myself go.

I have been taking antipsychotics for around 7-8 years. I recently came off them and was feeling SO good! Until I took mushrooms, then, my schizophrenia was a hell hole. (I know, doing mushrooms while schizophrenic is one of the dumbest things you can do). I feel like theres something in my body, but I know its not real... like when I spit it mimics the way I spit through my body. I feel like my life isn't great right now because of the depressant effect of the antipsychotics.. When i'm off them, I feel like a normal person again. My sexual desires are so much better, i'm not depressed, i don't twitch, and I don't feel like pacing all the time. Idk. What do you guys feel about this? IDK if it's even helping at all.

I'm not really familiar with the disorder but I had a partner who ticked some boxes, and I'm kind of worried about his situation and mental health. 

First of all it was religious delusions. Strong belief that God had a big mission for him and that he had to do something extraordinary in the world, a mission assigned by God. I remember that when we were together he would continuously tell me that God communicated with him and told him how we could fix our relationship. 

Specially when he was ill (had fever) or he had smoked weed, he would literally have real hallucinations, most times involving Jesus or angels, and a sense of inner fulfillment when experiencing those hallucinations. He literally told me he saw angels going towards a high tower and Jesus and his disciples sitting around a table, with him. 

Fear of persecution was a constant issue with him. If he was driving the car he would think people behind him were following him. If he was working along the street he would think anyone behind him was following him. He would get absolutely paranoid and be sure of that, it would trigger extreme anxiety and fear in him. 

He also had other type of delusions in which he was sure he would become very rich and various cults would try to recruit him.

He had a job interview at a Chinese company and for whatever reason he was sure those people were spies. He called the CIA to inform about it and he was angry that the CIA never contacted him back to collect more info. 

He was also very paranoid with me, continuously distrusting and attacking me for perceived slights or delusions of me cheating on him. 

So I'm not attempting to diagnose this person but I'm kind of worried that if he continues untreated this can develop into something more and something worse. I don't know if I should warn his parents, or just let it go. I also don't want to assume things that are not true and I think this community can help me clarify doubts around this illness.

Just saying it out loud, or typing it, makes me feel like my life is over, and I need to know if I need to admit myself for life, if I'm overthinking it, if it's my OCD and if anyone else has experiences with this.

Prior to my diagnosis, I have never been a violent person, I've never even been in a fight or hurt anybody. After about a year and a half, maybe two years into my diagnosis, I randomly started getting these intrusive thoughts that would arise in many different situations, thoughts about causing harm to others. I had a kneejerk reaction to it and got really worried. I started Googling my intrusive thoughts and found many articles about OCD and ""harm OCD"", whereby people who suffer from this can get all kinds of disturbing intrusive thoughts that they don't want to act on, but become fearful of ""what if"". I've taken all kinds of sociopath and psychopath tests, and I have no indications of either.

I know I have OCD, I ruminate a lot and obsess about thoughts. The more that I try to push the thoughts away, the stronger they become, almost to the point where my conviction is starting to waver and my brain tells me I'm lying to myself or that I don't truly disavow those thoughts.  
It's a constant back and forth tug of war.

Sometimes the thoughts disappear completely for periods of time and I almost forget I ever had them. I kind of chalked it up to OCD and stopped worrying about it.

&#x200B;

I'm afraid that I am becoming, or have become, what the media portrays schizophrenia to be. That I'm dangerous, a monster, psychotic. I know the statistics, I know that people with schizophrenia are much more likely to be victims of harm or to harm themselves, than they are to harm others, but sometimes you do see it on the news. I don't want to have violent thoughts, I have enough sh\*it to deal with right now. I'm currently very overwhelmed by symptoms and have been for the last 5 months. I'm also not on any medication - yet. I'm going on meds for the first time in a week or two.   
Hopefully the meds will help?

This got better and better with time but I was feeling so anxious because I was trying to quit overthinking everything. Today I realize that I am again fighting against this, but it's the next step.

229,please help urgent life help,1,11g9gdd,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/11g9gdd/please_help_urgent_life_help/,2,"Well first my diagnosis was schizophrenia visual and audio at 15. I had no what soever any early symptoms. I had been smoking weed since 13, so I don't think that it would have triggered it, it just came out of the blue one day the audio. My first actuall first visual hullusination was on k2 I smoked with my neighbor guy that, and I was smoking it and I hit it about 3 times and on the 3rd hit I coughed normally like I would on weed exactly when I coughed I saw a big black green square box. And it was on the top left of my eyesight and it was big and got smaller and went away withen the span of 2 seconds. But after that everything was back to normal, I had never had any audio or any more visual hallucinations until 2 years later. I had ended up loosing my friends after I had a fight at school I was so mad I left everyone long friends since 1st grade. It had coused a lot of stress and alot emotionally not because of me but ANYONE would have felt depressed after having a lot of friends to never talking to anyone. So I think maybe that took a huge toll on my life and caused me to go somewhat crazy and only in my own world isolate. I have always been masculine and try to be a ""Man"" so my mind had always been somewhat ""tough"" but the voices ended up being a force way to hard fore to have control over. I was better off going with the flow and not try and be a ""thug"" because there were to many voices to just shut you down emiditly like 4 different people within 5 seconds talking smack back. So it was tough taking a step back but it was for the better. If I had not done this I would have just been mad every second of every day battling not one voice  but a bunch of different types of ""people"" voices, so pick your own battles I guess. To the visual hallucinations. When I closed my eyes it was a very light green like I had glanced at the sun quick but it just stayed there. After years the hallucinations started to switch to a bunch of different green circles. Fast forward to present day I hear voices all day like it I would say a thought to someone I would hear a respond back instantly even if it ts not that person. So I can do it on command, but it just goes all day no matter what, talking to it or not it will always be a voice and it sounds like exactly like a normal person.the voice is anywhere in the sky it can be anywhere but it's always in the sky I will hear the actual voice and then it changes to a ""vibe"" type voice that says the same thing and it's like a shadow. So I think we'll now I'm hear the voice and the shadow so I can hear it and see it so it seems like any normal person would have heard the voice because the voice became a shadow, so I think I just happen to be able to hear it before anyone and I can hear it in crystal clear voiceI think everyone can hear it and see it so but I am not forrusre because it's a delissun and I will personally never be able to determan if everyone can hear it or it's just fucking with my head and showing it to everyone. THAT IS THE BIGGEST STRESS THAT I DEAL WITH. I feel like everyone in the world noatter what language can hear the voice but it would not t make sense because there are billions of people that don't speak English so it would just be a English voice for everyone to hear everyday and it would not make sense for someone to just hear English voice for there rest of the life for somewhat responding to my thought. Doesn't make sense but it's TOO Believable NOT TO BELIEVE. So it's a thing right in front ofy face that I can see thinking everyone can hear it and see it to believable and I VANT MAKE UP MY MIND WICH ONE IS RIGHT. And you don't just go to the voice and say can everyone hear it they would just say yes or no doesn't matter response they could be trolling. I'm too scared to ask anyone in real life if it's true because if I did I don't think it would be genuine and they might think I'm just slow and I never got it. I think why didn't my parents teach me about voices or how to respond it could have been just a silent thing that obviously no one talks about. I always think everyone else's parents told them somewhat something, and my parents never made it a point to talk about it to be real if everyone can hear it or see it or not.  So it's just a constant mind fuck, that I can choose which one is real if everyone can see it and hear it and I ended up just getting past by and nothing sayed to me. And Michael Jackson song saying ""I always feel like somebody's watching me' it is insane and it's gotten to a point that if everyone can ""see"" and ""hear"" the voice in the sky and feel like someone's watching me SO I CAME TO THE ASSUMPTION ( SHIT I MUST BE FAMOUS )  for no fucking reason. Sounds insane but feels so fucking real I feel like I took on the pressure of the world and I'm the one with it on my back so the struggle of stress is unimaginable. To be a famous person is insane to deal with mentally. But imagine being the ( Most famous person in the world ) is a hole different ball game. It's not just some guy to be here and leave a week later. I have been trying to hold it down and Its a lot of stress. ( BUT ) I AM A VERY HAPPY PERSON NATURALLY. So I'm not struggling with depression, but to much fucking anxiety and emotions when your ( the most famous person in the world ) I can't even go out in public anymore I'm too afraid when I walk past someone THEY KNOW MY ENTIRE LIFE STORY. So it's weird walking everywhere and it feels real cause when I walk past anyone ( ESPECIALLY IN VERY CROUDED PLACES ) I just feel singled and out I have to be the guy that's there that NOONE KNOWS / BUT EVERYONE KNOWS. I'm not even the same person I just feel like now I walk everywhere everyone knows me and it just SO FUCKING Awkward. imagine everyone there has heard of you. Your not just somewhat a local ""famous"" person, I'm the most famous person in the fucking world. The person on the inside is the same person as a kid.

I do not know what it is, as if the moment of comprehension or the concept of delirium, although in psychoses I understand that I am in it and what I think is delirium, but it is strong and every time I probably feel that I am starting to believe more and more that this is really so, because when I try to get out of psychosis I do not it turns out right away, too much stress. It helps to get rid of psychosis for a while, for example, joyful events in life, a sincere conversation with friends or family, but then I start to remember and return to the so-called bad thoughts, delusional thoughts.

The most interesting thing is that I used to be very susceptible to psychosis and how it starts (I felt that my head was starting to hurt and an inexplicable feeling of delirium), but now for some reason it has weakened, although there were no normal days before, but there were days full of stress and complete delirium with psychosis twice a day.  

And when these good days occur without stress and psychosis, then after the good days, psychosis begins with very great stress, and this psychosis becomes difficult every time to perceive that it is not real

In addition to this the most fulfilled/useful feeling in a long time.  Well respected job for SWIM's self worth + the opportunity to help others.  No wiping cheeks or cleaning up messes either just counseling groups.  SWIM is beyond grateful.

I just wanted to share a positive story about SWIM, I'm excited the SWIM's opportunity and wanted everyone to know if there is time on the clock, there is still time to for something to possibly work out.  One of the most dissapointing weeks turned into the opportunity of a lifetime.

God Bless everyone and Good Luck on their Journey.

287,would it be unethical to have kids?,4,11eqpew,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/11eqpew/would_it_be_unethical_to_have_kids/,35,"i've heard differing opinions. i really want to be a mother, but the thought of it scares me for multiple reasons.

**1.) my kids would have a genetic predisposition to a high schizotypy.**

i am diagnosed schizotypal, and many of my immediate family members as well as near and distant cousins from one side of my family are on the schizophrenic spectrum. personally it scares me to think of the idea that my kids will one day experience psychosis, as it is terrifying and life-altering... and depending on severity can really impact ones ability to be successful and happy. if i have kids, am i setting them up for an unhappy, miserable existence? i would say i'm happy to be here, but it hasn't always been that way. do i really want to watch someone i care about so deeply face the same challenges i have when i have the opportunity to prevent that? is it selfish to want children considering my diagnosis?

**2.) postpartum psychosis**

i am absolutely terrified but *maybe* willing to risk the idea of experiencing a psychotic break after giving birth. it would not be the first time that someone in our family had to be hospitalized for mental health reasons postpartum. i am worried that i will have to leave my little family for a while to get well mentally-- that my husband will have to take a long paternal leave from work and care for the baby. i know it would be alright because my husband's mother would step in while i'm gone, but again selfishly i don't want to miss that critical bonding period with the infant and spend all my time while i'm gone worrying about the baby's care.

**3.) medication teratogen**

i'm a bit less concerned but still concerned of the effects my medications will have on the fetus as it develops. i have read up on teratogens and know that the best case scenario is often to have the mother removed from all medication altogether as to not harm the development of the baby. i know that given the case of psychosis and many mental illnesses, many mothers are left on their medications despite the possible negative effects. has anyone on here taken abilify and had any negative consequences of remaining on their medications during pregnancy? i am also on prozac. without my medications i cannot function. is there a way around this?

**4.) drowsiness, caffeine intake due to medications**

that brings me to my next scare-- while i am on abilify i am overwhelmingly tired *always.* it doesn't matter whether i take them during the day or at night, i fall asleep everywhere all the time without the use of caffeine. in the event of getting pregnant i would want to cease all use of caffeine to not negatively influence the growth and heartrate of the baby. this would make me virtually unfunctional-- not even considering the fact that being pregnant-- growing a new human inside of my body-- would be additionally exhausting.

**5.) negative behavioral impact// scarring my children**

lastly but certainly not the least of my concerns is the idea that i may have a psychotic break or episode in front of my growing children later in their life. a child psychologist once broke down for me the statistics of the children she sees that are super impacted by the awful mental health of their own parents, whether managed or not. i fully intend on living for my children-- i will always be medicated and managed to the best of my ability as to not expose them to my illness. management, however, is not foolproof. i'm terrified that my own illness will develop into my own children's future childhood trauma. what if i do have to be admitted while my children are growing up? does anyone have experience with a psychotic parent and if so... how did it impact you?

i really want children. i am fully convinced that if it weren't for my mental illnesses i would be a wonderful mother, but that isn't something i can just brush past.",1677635133.0

He finished law school but then apparently failed the Bar exam and his life pretty rapidly declined after. He is now a 33 year old male so he would have been about 25ish when this stuff may have started. At this point I was not close to him so I do not know his situation at this time.

His family and and I all believe he has to have some kind of mental illness. It could just be anxiety/depression. It could be a personality disorder. It could be a combination of factors.

The complicating factor is sometime after graduating college and before taking his bar he started drinking excessively. He has been a raging alcoholic now for at least 5 to 8 years.

We don't know if the mental illness caused the alcoholism or vice versa. Given the amount he has been drinking, it seems nearly impossible he wouldn't have some chemical imbalance in his brain leading to anxiety/depression.

When I read the symptoms of Schizophrenia he definitely displays some of them. He claims he has seen psychiatrists and they told him he was fine. How common is it for individuals with Schizophrenia to be assessed by a psychiatrist and not properly be diagnose as having it? 

He has never exhibited or mentioned any sort of hallucination (audio, visual, etc). It could be argued he may exhibit signs of delusion.

I saw things that didn't make sense like a African pied  crow outside my window, a helicopter disappearing in mid air and mice in  my house running impossibly fast. I heard people talking but I couldn't  make out what they were saying. I thought I had to do everything the  opposite of what I wanted to or else bad things would happen to me. I  thought that I had to chose between my family being tortured or me and I  chose myself so that meant I was going to hell. I ended up in the  hospital and I thought they were going to dissect and torture me. I've  been a lot better since I started my medication and don't have as many  bouts of dread as I use to. I still have thoughts almost every day  though that bother me and nightmares. I think that things that I enjoy  will be forms of torture after I die. I worry that people coughing, cats  on leashes, sirens and other things are either signs I'm going to hell  or some kind of warning that I'm on the wrong path.

Smoked weed to deal with everything then got into a very bad psychosis at age 18 after my caregiver (my grandfather) died.

It is very hard for me to make friends let alone find a girl who cares for me or hold down a job to take care of myself. I am in a very low point in my life and I really dont know what to do.

I am trying lowering my Promethazine dosis and couldn't sleep for a while and the first time I have no voices (internal and external). Furthermore, I had minimal negativ effects on caffeine today and I am committed to quit smoking, because I don't want to get thrombosis. It's hard on my APs and it will take time to really quit.

The first time he was manic with me, from September 2020 to Jan 2021, I stayed with him for months, until the night he assaulted me, Jan 3, and I left. And he eventually went to jail and became himself again. I moved states away and he never left my mind.

We ended up getting in contact again last April. We started dating again and he was so perfect. So caring and attentive. He remembered the smallest things about me. We had so much fun, even when it was a rainy week and we had to stay inside. Just being in his presence was a gift.

I came up to his place this Feb and the month was great. He got a little paranoid at night, but that was something we were working on as a partnership.

And then he became manic...about a week ago. This is day 5 of no sleep.

His paranoia and delusions started clouding his brain and he became angry and didn't listen to anything I had to say. Anything and everything was confirmation that he was right. I wanted to leave, but he told me that if I truly loved him I would stay and listen to him rant and listen to him being an asshole. So at night, I would sit on the floor and let him. He'd talk about his past and how he saw the world. He would say that I'm cheating on him just like his ex, that I was this terrible person, etc etc. I wanted to defend myself. I have never cheated on him! I would never cheat on him! I am not his ex! I am not his past! But when he looked at me, I know that all he saw was all the bad in his life and all the bad that would ever come. So I stayed silent. I'd bow my head, sometimes I'd whisper the truth just so that the universe knew my side.

We shaved his head together. We threw treasured memories away together, his phone, his pictures of his kids. He would tell me how much he loved me in one second, how I was doing so good listening to him and being there, and the next second he'd tell me that he knew that I was sleeping with his underage son. How horrible of a person I was. How disgusting I am and should be ashamed of myself. Don't worry, I am.

He did call the cops on me who escorted me out on Sunday. I am back home. I slept the whole day.

He texted porn to my sister, saying that that was me. Before I blocked him on everything I could, he sent nasty messages about how terrible I am, how much of a wh\*re I am. He put up 2 facebook posts that I was in porn and that everyone should feel sick to their stomach.

I am sick to my stomach.

Because I am so in love with him, I am so in love with him, I am so in love with him.

But this isn't him, this is Kram, his name backwards. I compartmentalize and blame his alter ego...

But I am so in love with the true him, that I know that I am going to wait for this to pass, and this too, shall pass. Right? Right? ....right?",1677550249.0

That's because my brain¬†


Is wired much differently


Than the typical woman's


To start, I am like a ghost


Socializing I often disdain


But, that is just how I be


Yet, just cause I'm distant


Doesn't mean I'm broken


I just don't fit in the mold


Of those who are normal


Many think that I'm weird


For the art I make in pen


And I frequently get told


That my juggling's musical


Yes I have a big ol' beard


Because I'm not standard


I believe in strange things


Like aliens or the Illuminati¬†


Emotions are outta control


Making life much more hard


But, still I stand with kings


Even if you think I'm crazy

354,Concerned for my wife's uncle,0,11dslq0,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/11dslq0/concerned_for_my_wifes_uncle/,0,"My wife's uncle suffers from various mental illnesses, schizophrenia not the least of them. While in utero, his umbilical cord partially separated from his mother's uterus, and his umbilical cord wrapped around his neck during his birth, and he was deprived of oxygen during the birthing process. He suffers from mental retardation (low IQ), schizophrenia amd religious delusions. His particular psychopathy takes the form of believing he was/is part to knowledge of ancient Satanic organizations actually running the world behind the scenes. Unfortunately, his father, my wife's grandfather, is ALSO a religious fanatic. His late mother suffered from persecution complexes, probable schizophrenia, and abuse (both physical and sexual) as a child. When they discovered her brother was sexually assaulting his children, she said ""just keep quiet about it, it's what fathers do"". My wife and I (and my wife's sister whomever a licensed Marriage and Family Counselor) are fairly sure he (back to the Uncle) was abused by the scumbag as well, and has repressed it. 

While he was young, he suffered very significant psychotic episodes, including episodes where he apparently planned on attacking his parents. Instead of seeking mental health care for him at the time, they sought help from their Pentacostal Church, who told him he was demonically influenced and possessed, which fed even more into his psychosis. Fortunately, in the last 15 years, they have actually sought mental health care for him. He is 58 now. 

Frustratingly, he - of course - resists any and all mental health care that isn't the Church, or exorcism or faith based. My SiL, the Mental Health Professional, designed a Carr package for him that included lots of counseling and recommended LOTS of pharmaceuticals to get his brain chemistry at least SOMEWHAT under control. Unfortunately, he lies and misrepresents his taking his meds, and won't unless forced to. He often claims the meds ""keep him from hearing god"" and other nonsense. 

He cycles from tolerable but unpleasant to be around to downright worrying, on an almost clockwork schedule. He has been repeatedly fobbed off on various Christian systems, schools and Churches my his family. He believes somehow he will be one of the biggest and most important pastors in the world. He worries me in that he is obsessed with being married, and exhibits growing resentment and jealousy toward me and my wife (his neice) and my SiL and BiL (his other neice and her husband) saying things like how ""unfair"" it is that they got married before he did, and how it ""went against God's will"". He has convinced himself that, when his father passes away (his father, my Grandfather-in-Law, is 88), that he will be the ""patriarch of the family"" and we will ""have to do what je says because that's God's Will"". I've pointed out that 1) I'm a 44 year old retired Navy Vet and he will NEVER be in ""charge"" of me, and 2) even by his own Bible, his ""authority"" (if he ever had any) would end with his sister, my Mother-in-Law, because his neices (my wife and her sister) are married and no longer in his ""family"" by Biblical standards. Doesn't seem to effect him much, he keeps saying he is looking forward to being the ""Man of the House"". He is a mostly sweet person, but once he gets on ideas in his head, he has a very hard time letting go of it. I have very little doubt that we are going to have a confrontation at some point about it. My problem is that I have very little patience anymore from having dealt with him for 24 years. Fortunately for him, my Brother-in-Law is almost a Saint when it comes to patience.

My main worry now is that I have a daughter who is 8 now. I'm increasingly worried about exposing her to his increasing psychosis. He is mixing all his good together in his refrigerator, throwing away lots of stuff that don't belong to him (my MiL has had to lock several rooms in their house - he lives with her and their father, to prevent him from throwing away expensive inventory ""just because""). I can't have him to my house because he tries to get my dogs (a GSD and SH) to bite him, and I just don't trust him in our house anymore. He won't take his medication that moderates his behavior. He is singularly unpleasant to interact with, as EVERYTHING is about religion with him (I'm an Atheist Anti-Theist). 

I'm also worried about not only my daughter around him (see the history of sexual abuse against him, and his really odd comments about being ""guaranteed"" a wife by god). I even keep my eyes on the local police blotter in case local women go missing. He exhibits behaviors similar to several serial killers I've studied in the past. I'm honestly scared he will do something bad in the future, and feel powerless to stop it or prevent it. I strongly believe he needs to be in a mental health care facility, but that would never happen as long as his father and sister are alive. My wife and SiL somewhat agree he needs to be in a care facility, where he is supervised and controlled. 

Has anyone had any experience with this kind of schizophrenia combined with religious delusions? I'd be thankful for any advice. 

Thanks!",1677546387.0

So I know someone who has had paranoid schizophrenia and anosognosia for the past 20 years. Every couple of years he has been in a clinic for several months and has often tried to avoid his forced medication. 
To my understanding, when this person is always convinced that their delusions are true, and that what they experienced in psychosis was true, this does not mean that the psychosis is still going on and always acute. He is under medication, at least Aripiprazole and Amisulpride. To my understanding, the psychosis is not still going on if he doesn't acutely experience unreal events and story lines and threats, although I know that things are not black and white, hallucinations cannot always be repressed 100% and people might still perceive some subtle things that don't change their behaviour significantly or dangerously. 
I think I'll have many more questions to come, so people with first hand insight, I am really hoping for you here! I am quite disappointed with what the doctors seem to offer in his case. It seems like they don't even bother to look closely and try some hope.

The reason why I ask is by the way that his family says he is unpredictable and dangerous, but I strongly disagree. They are quite toxic people and so he doesn't let them know his true thoughts. Whenever he starts blaming them for his delusional beliefs, they think psychosis is back, and I disagree.",1677508400.0

Alas, the ice cream swallows the ears of these men, melting their eyes and ears, rendering these cries fruitless.

the beginning she told me about how hard it is for her to do day to day activities while dealing with her schizophrenia. I love her because she‚Äôs kind and understanding, but also have strong opinion about things. 

We talked about a lot of things, and this is where im having a hard time understanding her. She keeps ranting about how the government in her country is corrupt and she hates any government with her guts. Then when she‚Äôs sick, she doesnt want to take any kind of medicine because to her any medicine is bad for our body in the long term, yet she still take her schizophrenia medicine. She claimed to be a very scientific person, but she refuse vaccines. She also think that her country shouldnt help ukraine in the war because according to her they‚Äôre very corrupt and dont deserve help. Im at loss. How can i love someone with whom i always disagree with. But hearing her stories and her background i feel like it makes sense because her whole life, everybody disappoint her. Her father, the government, the doctors that doesnt give her explanation about her schizophrenia.

While she is respectful when we disagree on something, her reasoning doesnt make sense, and when i pointed out, she doesnt want to engage and state her case. I feel like its better to just let her say her piece and listen to her, rather than to pointed it out.

I dont know what to do. I guess i just want to understand her perspective on things, but it can be hard since she has a problem with communicating her thoughts. 

Any help is appreciated! Thank you!",1677407266.0

It‚Äôs constant, kind of like 8 billion minds thinking their own things all the time. (Don‚Äôt forget about animal minds and beyond).

It‚Äôs super fast, we can have conversations instantly. (Usually I find I hear the end of an argument, which is the most negative part).

If you happen to hear a conversation that ends in anger sometimes you can change the replies/reactions/voices of people just by knowing what happened, and also asking everyone to change their reaction. Sometimes it will go quiet, almost like your mind doesn‚Äôt need to talk about it anymore.

All of these were fed by evil voices in my head telling me awful things and berating me. An example on my end, I kept calling people and trying to apologize for things that I ‚Äúdid‚Äù that never happened, probably the most drastic was calling female friends or ex‚Äôs to apologize for harming them sexually (I would admit if I ever SA‚Äôd someone, but I haven‚Äôt). It‚Äôs not worth getting into why I thought these things since it‚Äôs all psychotic drivel.

Anyone I called to apologize to expressed concern for my mental well-being, and all told me I was crazy and they explicitly told me these things never happened.

- seeing my face turn to look at me/movements in the mirror in the corner of my eye black swan style. 
- I often hear almost speeding car-like unintelligible shouts in my ears as I go to sleep, going quiet to unbearably loud to silent in the span of 3-5 seconds.
- felt like I've been unable to truly trust anyone for a year (but trying not to think too hard or I'll spiral)
- have moments a few times a week, where I get this sudden sense of impending doom; a deep, unnerving fear and dread that nothing matters, it'll all going to end and I don't trust myself (like, will I flip out/run away/cry/do something *stupid* stupid) ‚Äì this often leads to a hyped up sense of energy in spite of feeling paranoid, nihilistic and incredibly desperate/lonely
- feel the need to touch certain objects a bunch of times so they're 'right', or apologise to objects if I hit them too hard because they could possibly feel the hurt
- felt the compulsion to pray/say a blessing to something or someone if it dies/gets hurt (like roadkill, hearing about a tsunami, etc); '*I'm so sorry, I hope you're ok*', '*please be ok, please please please*' kind of phrases
- a fear of being crazy, hurting people, becoming a murderer/predator/abuser/narcissist; intrusive thoughts about doing said things
- intrusive thoughts about injuries, or taboo things; feeling grossed out and needing to do a body tic of some kind to 'ward' it off/neutralise it
- seeing things (landscapes, pictures, physical objects, elements) and feeling the texture in my mouth (i.e. a sparkler feels fuzzy and electrical, a cloud feels like thatched cottony floss, a mountain feels like a big weighty object resting on my tongue)
- I've suspected people were recording me, to the point of dressing in different rooms, locking my bedroom door (inside and out) whenever I wasn't in it, and checking for cameras every night with a flashlight in mirrors and tiny holes in the walls.
- I've been hyper-paranoid about being chased, hunted, stalked and murdered by both real people and demons if I'm in the house by myself (even in a safe, daytime period).
- I've had immense trouble sleeping for months, felt like I was breathed on/touched, like someone was hiding in my room when I went to sleep (even after double checking and locking the bedroom door).
- shaved my hair off, threw out all my belongings so I had it 'simple' and wasn't 'cluttered' (bedroom looked like a prison/hospital cell); a deep urge to run off and live like a monk, or get back to the 'roots' and real 'meaning' of life
- maladaptively daydream/excessive imagination and dissociation/escapism

I'm undiagnosed, but likely have autism, adhd and a history of bipolar/schizophrenia in both sides of my family (+raised in a narcissist's household). 

I'm often seen as 'chill', 'lowkey' but friendly and nice to people I'm close to. No one suspects that I deal with this stuff, just that I can get a bit antsy about certain things like burglars. I also generally feel like I can handle it all, even in spite of seeing and hearing weird things occasionally in the day; I also think I had some form of this stuff since I was a kid, honestly. ü§∑

Yet as of yet, I never have come across such a thing.

Is there a reason for that? Does the internet simple like to make those scary powerless stories more popular? Or is there some sort of emotional component, where hose hallucinations are a manifestation of negative feelings so it is hard to not feel the negative feeling?

I've recently been diagnosed with schizophrenia, about three months ago I think?, and I haven't been taking it very well. See, I don't believe that I'm schizophrenic and I decided to stop taking my meds because of it. This is the fourth time already.

I can't focus in class. I can't focus on studying. I'm always arguing with the voices. My mind is blank. I can't feel emotions, I stopped caring about my friendships, I stopped caring about school. I feel like it's because I'm schizophrenic, but a part of me, the part of me that doesn't want to believe it, is trying to find other reasons. Maybe I'm just stressed out, maybe I'm just depressed, hearing things is normal, etc. etc.

I've thought about taking a gap year. I feel that if I really am schizophrenic and I keep getting off my meds, I'll keep losing control over myself and will ultimately fail my major. I feel like if I take a gap year to get my sh!t together, I'll figure things out... 

I'm in Nursing school which requires a lot of drive and focus, things I currently don't have. Most of my day is composed of me losing focus because of either 1. me arguing with the voices, 2. the voices getting so loud I can't pay attention, 3. not feeling any emotions,  and 4. believing nothing is real, so nothing really matters at all. A part of me thinks it's because I'm off my meds, but most of me believes it's not.

I don't know if it's a good idea though. I can't bring myself to tell my family, and if I tell them I'm taking a gap year they'll be so disappointed in me. I don't know what to do. I completely lost sense of who I am, so I don't know what to do.",1677352089.0

note i have full insight now, even in things i believe, cause i always overanalyse. 

* depression, with decreasing motivation and finding it harder to have fun. like severe executive dysfunction that keeps getting worse. things seem hopeless with increasing ambivalence and apathy. like i don't even shower everyday or garden anymore and when i do have fun its not the same as when i used to. (i can't cope! how do people do it!) with short periods where it gets better.
* withdrawal im feeling further and further away from people and its getting harder to relate ect isolation withdrawing into my own head. 
* decrease attention span an distractibility, irritability, moodiness (internal mood swings) lack of concentration, tired easily fidgety more ridged and sudden stop and start movements, fluctuations in everything, all or nothing mentality(either really funny or serious) struggle for balance in anything, 
* on and off sleep problems and vivid dreams. bad sleep, and sleep inertia.
* racing thoughts or randomised thoughts always aloof from others, and jump from topic to topic. also slow or fast talking, as well as echolalia, i stim a lot more than normal recently. also words sometimes come out jumble accidentally. like i grass the mowed ect
* cognitive, seeing facing on things good pattern recognition, good imagination and , bad memory and bad at complicated thinking i loose my place/cannot concentrate! bouts of brain fog. can't find the right words ect (this fluctuates)
* increase in anxiety, stress and paranoia. so iv been getting overwhelmed more easily ect feels like the world hates me + increasing suspicion of peoples motives and think i know what others are thinking sometimes. paranoid of what other people think of me or there thoughts or that they may know something they can't possibly know.(its not mindreading though) ect. hyperaware, and think people are looking at me/anxiety that the birds are laughing at me ect of course i know its not true but...
* weird beliefs/thinking/intrusive thoughts. believe demons are destroying my life since i was little its so easy to see i see there dirty hands everywhere the also insert thoughts in my head and try to manipulate me, they gave me signs they want to give me schizophrenia or other disease and i have to not accidentally submit. i have special communication with the spiritual world and have been told many things i often telepathically speak with them, and discovered truth. im so sick of this the demons run and hide when God helps though! im open to change though. and they aren't quite fixed yet. i am alwas being observed by something like God or other spirits that i can ""sense""
* overvalue ideas magical thinking ideas of reference weird and changing theories and belief unstable sense of self.
* im 18 yo male. i take 20 mg prozac for ocd
* hallucinations/illusions iv only ever actually hallucinated a few times. but my visual snow and distortions are getting worse i see flashes and specks both white black and see ""lightnings"" with visual disturbances(patterns and shapes) worried im loosing my sight but i still got clear vision. outlines of things that aren't there ect things in corner of my eye illusions, thinking i saw something move ect.
* daydreams /imagination. imagination as good as reality, constantly accidentally daydreaming and dissociating. fixed staring until things begin to warp. heavily emotionally effected by what i imagine cause it feels real kind of.  so the dream/reality is blurring.
* perception/personality fluctuations, changes and weird emotional experiences. constant music at back of my head. drdp things often feel weird or not real sometimes. 
* possibly have had blips and mild stress induced psychosis earlier last year. want to run away so bad. i hate my reality. 
* quasi-delusions
* i keep getting a low/moderate  score on schizo tests and possible/prodrome symptoms.
* if i have schizo can it hurry up i have no patience...

**Alice's Raven**

&#x200B;

//

The books told me to look for her, but Alice had the glass.

Her finery and wit and charm, a writing desk, a kind of class.

A raven teaches Hatter with a quill, a cup and things gone past, how gentle, clever scissors, often used, enable free-thoughts, roaming.

No need for Doctor‚Äôs time, atoning.

**Madness Ventured**

//

Sweetest, foolish Angel.

No greater a fool. No sweeter or stranger.

Stubborn fought defeat and a pledge to heroism.

Afraid, still, confronting the danger..

No agreement to truth.

No blindness, yet wander.

A moment with lightning, pursed lips..

A knowing! Come forward, young hero, a flame.

There will be time for such tragedies, be honest in ventures and actions yet taken.

An angel is never forsaken.

482,Help: Diagnosed Family Member,1,11by9f3,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/11by9f3/help_diagnosed_family_member/,1,"Hello, I am writing for help or advice on what to do. To preface this, I live in the UK so UK systems apply. My cousin has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia for around 6months now, and has been perscribed medication (though i'm not sure exactly what medication this is, as i'm not particularly close with him and everything i know is based off what i have heard from other family members). As far as I know, either he is not taking his medication or it is not working. Recently he started a fight in the street, but because he was polite to police officers, they let him off with a warning, despite his mother begging them not to let him go because he needs help. Last night, he texted my mum some very out of the ordinary texts about our family. This is the part that has never happened before and has sparked even more worry for my mum, his aunt. He has been showing more violent tendencies, and has been barred from many local pubs in our area for starting fights. 

I am looking for advice on what to do. His doctor has diagnosed him and given him meds, but we are unsure as to how this can be controlled, as he loves alone and has no one to make sure he is actually taking them. The police don't seem to care much either. We really don't know what to do or who to talk to. Because he is an adult in his 20s, we can not make him do something he doesn't want to do, and he has refused to help himself when it has been mentioned that he needs it.

In a nutshell, has anyone else in the UK ever experienced a family member with paranoid schizophrenia, who has been getting violent and refuses help, and managed to get their family member help in the end? Who do we go to or talk to? How can we convince him to get help if he isn't interested? We really want him to get better, for himself and those around him. We know he has it in him, as he used to have a great routine, exercise, diet, and really looked after himself. But in the last month this has spiralled and he is drinking more and more and not exercising or eating healthily as he used to love doing. Any advice, anything at all would be massively appriciated.

I think that in my particular case, it would be a good idea to try and go off meds. Paraphrasing the reasons I gave my psychiatrist, I believe it‚Äôd be something worth a try because my symptoms are not severe and I have good insight. They gave me a concerned look and answered ‚Äúwe‚Äôll see‚Äù.


I feel like once you‚Äôve been labeled schizophrenic, it‚Äôs often hard to be taken seriously. But I do not want to stop meds by myself, as I believe at least some of my ‚Äúpsychosis‚Äù has been a direct result of either starting or stopping medication, and if I had psychosis for doing it wrong I‚Äôd just be feeding a self-fulfilling prophecy.


I know the old ‚Äúthis is part of the disorder‚Äù bit, and my one argument against that is that I‚Äôve been told that exact same thing about my first bipolar diagnosis and it turned out be in fact wrong.

520,Partner has Paranoid Schizophrenia and feels like I am persecuting them - please help!,3,11as04u,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/11as04u/partner_has_paranoid_schizophrenia_and_feels_like/,6,"Hi All! 

I hope you're all doing well. I'm really just looking for some support and advice. 

My (F32) Partner of nearly a year  J (M35) was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia / schizoaffective disorder at a young age. He has a history of self harm / suicidal thoughts, spent time as an inpatient, has been to counselling (but not anymore), and is on medication. Additionally, I have late diagnosed autism and a history of my own depression/self harm issues. I‚Äôve been to counselling too. We are both full time employed, I live alone and he lives in his family home. 

We've been struggling the last couple of weeks, with arguments and misunderstanding each other. During one argument he said he was sick of my bullshit - even though by this point I'd apologised for causing the argument and was trying to make things right. He also called me nasty and selfish. After the fact I said to him I didn't like being spoken to that way, because it felt like an attack on me as a person. He said he was justified in how he spoke to me because I pushed his buttons to get him there. I said that I did not wish to be in a relationship where it was ok to speak to each other like that and we left it there. 

During last night/ this morning's argument, he told me that I was 'emotionally draining the life out of him'. (I called him yesterday evening because I was having a panic attack, and fighting the urge to self harm. This is not a common occurrence and has happened maybe twice in our whole relationship). The comment that he made about draining the life out of me hurt a lot. I acknowledge and accept our relationship probably is draining at times for him, but the phrasing of it felt like a direct comment on me, again. 

During the night he texted me to say he didn't want to see me this weekend, to take some time for himself. So I let him know that I thought that was a good idea, and I'd booked myself an emergency counselling session and made a plan to go see my family to get some support for myself, so I could be supported without placing any extra burden on him. I also let him know I didn't think it was ok to speak to someone you're in a relationship with that way, and the counselling would be helping me sort my feelings out about that. (I have a hard time connecting with my emotions due to the autism so counselling helps me figure out what I'm feeling). I was honest and said that I was questioning our compatibility. 

From there it all went really down hill - he says I am abandoning him, making him out to be a monster, using him as a scapegoat, and getting together with my family and counsellors to talk about what a bad person he is. He says everyone abandons him and that he always ends up alone. The fact I want to see my counsellor is suddenly all about him/us, not me wanting to talk about the things that lead to my panic attack. 

I know this is the paranoia - he often sees the worst in me and my motivations in a way that isn't accurate, (though he denies that and says he just sees people how they truly are): and accuses me of not looking out for his needs, while not seeing that I actually put mine aside a lot to support him. I'm sure there are times when I'm not as supportive as I could be, but I feel there is a difference between unintentionally doing things wrong, like when i asked for extra reassurance on something he‚Äôd already said was ok, which made him feel undermined - and choosing to say hurtful words to your partner. I have reached a point where I can no longer tell what behaviour is due to his diagnosis, and what is just who he is on a personality level - although I realise there is likely a large amount of cross over. He does say sorry for how he speaks to me - but then always justifys it by saying i pushed him to that point. 

He told me this morning he thinks the world is a horrible place, he feels alone, and wants to die. He's ripped off a bracelet and necklace i got him, and won't speak to me or take my calls. I alerted his mother whom he lives with to the suicidal talk because I could not get hold of him and I was very concerned for his welfare. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I am trying really hard to support him but at the same time stand up for what I need in a relationship, as I have my own support needs outside of the norm: Please offer any advice you can about loving someone with paranoid schizophrenia because I really do want to make this work.",1677247073.0

Like seeking meaning in cloud formations or the way a tree looks like, etc. After a comment that gave me the hint to go to a doctor, I admitted that I already was, and I am treated well. I am under treatment and it is working well. 
I was just interested in getting a tip, if there is any philosophy actually dealing with that idea that the things we sometimes interpret in this world could make any sense.

The post was banned from the philosophy group and the moderators said, there are no academic sources for it, that's why my post doesnt fit in. I asked: why can't you let the community decide and give me answers on whether there are philosophies for it.
They said, academic philosophy doesnt adresses my question.

I am not delusional. I am under treatment and it works. But it felt like the group only allows 'healthy' people to post in their group.
I kind of feel discriminated by that post ban.

Maybe you made similar experiences? 

I mean, maybe it's not the best idea to be in philosophy while being schizophrenic, but thats who I am. I always had an interest in philosophy and I would argue that my illness only expanded my views on this world.

Do I hear voices? 
This is a hard one to answer, yes and no idk. I hear my own voice sometimes but it's not my thoughts (I think). My words will overlap and go over each other at times and It'd like I can hear my normal thoughts, hear myself saying stop to the ""voices"" while others are still overlapping each other. Sometimes when this is happening I can hear lines from songs playing over and over and over again (usually Jim Morris on saying ""Mr mojo rising"") or a whole mix of them. I can go from these being moderate to the point where I can't recognise my thoughts or hear them, and they're not there 24/7.

Idk if this counts as ""voices"" but I was walking around somewhere I wasn't comfortable with and didn't have my earphones and was determined I could hear people whistling at me from behind. 

There's also been times where I've felt myself filled with fear and dread cause I could hear the stoned on my driveway crunching as if someone was walking on them, coming to get me in the middle of the night. And I would keep hearing it, until I got to a point where I told myself they would be at My door by now but my brain is constantly arguing with me saying the opposite of  y reasoning. 

Do I have delusions? 

Again this is a hard question for me to answer cos to be honest idk if I'd be able to know. One in particular I can say was a delusion was when I had myself completely and totally convinced that my mum had my Facebook logins, and was reading my messages and even though I was able to prove myself wrong, I'd keep on checking which devices were active on my account, and changing my password. Another I just remembered while writing this is that I would belive that there was someone hacking my phone, and every letter I pressed whole typing was being sent to someone else's device so they could read what I was writing and laugh at me. 

When I was younger (6-7) I remember and always have, having a conversation with a fat man in a black suit with a hat, hands crossed telling me when spongebob died his heart lay on the bottom of the ocean.  

My whole life I've been determined I'm being watched, have always been on edge cause of the fact but as I got older I've kinda learned to live with it (I'm 19 now) but it doesn't ease the fact, it still causes me a great deal of anxiety 24/7. 

There was a point I was smoking a joint and caught glimpse of the moon, and was determined it was gonna explode and I could hear the pop, over and over again until I managed to distract myself but after I did I was still really uneasy, it made me feel like I was up too high.

Constantly thinking someone is going to stab me, and it can be anyone from my best friend to random people looking at me on the street. This one happens all too often for me to list examples, but some are;

My friend just last night fainted, and when he kinda woke up he had a really weird look on his face, and I was convinced he had lost his mind and was about to start stabbing the shit out of me.

I was sitting with My other friend one time, and she let me know her boyfriend was en route. I don't really like her bf but we were civil, and when she told me I could see in my mind him coming through the house and stabbing me in the side of the neck with a steak knife 

I will also frequently think I am being set up, when someone like a close and trusted friend messages me to meet up or come over, ill have it in my head sometimes they're trying to set me up. 

Everything I have listed isn't constant 24/7, it's as if it comes in waves, not even good days and bad days more like good hours and bad hours (at times).

Do I have hallucinations?

Again (sorry) this one's hard to answer so I'll do my best. 
In terms of hallucinating, sometimes I'll see little black dots forming on walls, flat surfaces or even the sky and my TV. They come and go rather quickly almost like its an illusion and once I look at it it'll disappear.

To this day, idk if there really was a spider crawling up my headboard, but when I saw it I ran away and refused to go into my room for a few days. Not long after this, I saw the same exact spider running up my covers towards me and again refused to into my room for a few days, unless it was ti grab something essential but I was quick as fuck in and out convinced it was gonna pop out again. The reason I'm writing this down is cause recently I had a dream the exact same spider once again, was right in front of my face n woke up in terror.

Other things idk how to list 

A lot of the time I can't recognise how I'm feeling, and I try explain this the best I can. I don't know the difference between feeling shitty or down to feeling totally relaxed. 
I'll have mood swings, and not even know it until I randomly think about previous days but I'll never be able to recognise when my mood swung. 

So I guess my question is, should I be worried I may have schizophrenia or some sort of personality disorder? Or is it just bad anxiety? I've already began seeing a doctor, but this post will help cos whenever I sit down and try to explain things, 99% of what I need to tell them will vanish from my brain, and on the same day I'll be telling myself I'm not unwell and I probably don't need the doctor and I'm worried they're going to tellcme that I'm completely fine and it's a waste of time, but I'm unsure if that's classed as a delusion or not. 
And for everyone reading this, if this is schizophrenia and people are out there living like this my heart goes out to you all, yall are strong as shit, even stronger in My eyes if I'm not schizophrenic.
I'm even paranoid everyone reading this is gonna comment that I'm just wanting attention or they're gonna laugh at me but I trust from what I've seen in other posts it won't happen?

I've read through this reddit a lot and i see so many people openly talking about the ""positive"" symptoms they experienced and know how to recognize them as such.

I didn‚Äôt know i was psychotic at the time but people around me including family were pretty convinced that it was, it included delusions of grandeur and posting a lot of cryptic messages to people i didn‚Äôt know very well, as well as being worried that people were trying to copy my appearance and steal my identity (there was more than this but i‚Äôm not going to list it all). This lasted around 2-3 months.

To get to the point, i never really sought medical attention for this because i went back to *normal* after this and haven‚Äôt had an episode like that since then, but since that episode i have suddenly and rapidly developed symptoms i didn‚Äôt previously have like situational mutism and inability to care for myself (I didn‚Äôt shower for a week last week) and started harming people close to me. I never really cared about it until I found out my maternal grandmother has paranoid schizophrenia. 

Is this something worth pursuing since i haven‚Äôt had a full episode since then? I don‚Äôt really know how I‚Äôd explain this to a doctor without them just pushing me back on antidepressants.

1. Paranoia, I constantly think my younger siblings are trying to hurt me and cause me pain
2. Auditory hallucinations, I constantly hear people saying my name and knocking on my door, when no one is there
3. This is difficult to explain, but I have a guardian spirit, he is difficult to see, because he is mostly translucent, but he has very pale skin, and dark hair, I don't know his name, he never speaks, he always calms me down when I hear the voices and knocking
4. I've heard that schizophrenic people believe they are enlightened by the universe, and I've always thought I understood a second meaning behind everything, a way that everything is connected that I don't know how to explain to other people
5. I can't have window curtains open, they have to be closed, or someone will see inside
6. Leaving my room is scary, since my spirit prefers to stay in there, and rarely leaves, I don't like to go away from my room, though I do still feel safe leaving during the day, not at night
7. Sometimes my spirit leaves my room at night, it's terrifying, I don't know when he'll come back, it feels almost like sleep paralysis, though not quite as bad

Those are the reasons I think I might have schizophrenia, but there are a few reasons I think I might not have schizophrenia

1. I'm fifteen, most people don't start to develop schizophrenia until at least twenty
2. I'm autistic, and a lot of these things could be explained by that
3. I think I'm schizophrenic, and from what I understand, most schizophrenic people refuse to believe they are schizophrenic
4. The guardian spirit I mentioned feels real, but I understand that he isn't, and sometimes it seems like I just use him like some people use a stuffed animal, or a dream catcher, to scare away the dark 
to clarify, I'm not scared of the dark, I'm afraid of the voices in the dark, and the knocking (the knocking is scarier than the voices)

(Ableism Ahead)",17,118avcf,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/118avcf/dont_worry_youre_a_good_little_psycho_ableism/,11,"This just happened a few hours ago; I don't have therapy until next week and journaling about what happened didn't really help, so hopefully having a community (theoretically) listen to me will.

Some context: I'm a university sophomore who moved across the country for school with my partner. We live together off-campus; I go to school and he works. I haven't really made any friends, but I do talk to my classmates and eat lunch with a small group I met in freshman year (I call them my ""classroom friends,"" due to the fact that we never get together outside of school) I'm fine with this -- I've never felt lonely without them or anything -- and never really had that ""genuine"" connection with any of them, if that makes sense.

The group I spend the most time with consists of about 6 people, not including me. They are all aware I am schizoaffective. They are also aware that I despise terms like ""schizo,"" ""psycho,"" and/or casually referring to anyone using psychiatric terms. Two of the people in the group are diagnosed with OCD and BPD respectively, so we've always been in agreement that using clinical labels as informal adjectives is disrespectful due to our shared experiences with this happening.

The subject of today's situation is ""Diane."" I never really liked Diane; she's quite performative, a little pretentious and has said some rude things in the past, but in a na√Øve/unaware-that-I'm-being-rude way. I grew quite close to her last summer after she reached out for help with managing auditory hallucinations, which she reported having. A few weeks later, she shared that she was being tested for schizophrenia. Being the only psychotic I knew IRL, I was excited to finally know someone who could understand me/my disability. She never got diagnosed with schizophrenia and was openly disappointed about that, but I told her that didn't matter since her doctors know she experiences psychotic symptoms and can be treated regardless.

Before today's morning lecture began, Diane was talking to two other people in the group. I wasn't really paying attention, just setting up as usual and preparing my stationery, notes, laptop, etc., so I don't know exactly what their conversation was about. I do know they were gossiping about someone and perhaps looking at some texts, but the details are beyond my half-listening capabilities. I do know that suddenly, Diane exclaimed, ""Oh my god, she's such a psycho!""

I looked up and quickly, automatically told Diane to not to use that word. She turned to me, paused for a moment, and then replied, ""Oh, don't worry! You're a good little psycho!"" before turning back to resume the conversation. One of the others (the one who has BPD) noticed the pure horror on my face and said, ""If someone doesn't like a word, you shouldn't say it around them."" That felt even worse! I just sort of turned back to my things and sat there in shock.

I still feel stunned, and almost as if I was treated like a dog. I can almost picture Diane patting my head and praising me for being a ""good little psycho"" in that high-pitched voice. It hurt so much, especially coming from someone who is psychotic and had agreed that clinical terms are disrespectful. I'm just....in shock, and I feel terrible for not standing up for myself more. What did she mean by ""good"" psycho? What did that person do to be considered a ""bad"" psycho? Is it normal for a psychotic person to falsely brand others as psychotic? Is that person even psychotic!? (The answer is no.)

I really wish people would stop using ""psycho"" and ""schizo"" to refer to non-psychotics, or anyone for that matter since it's meant to be derogatory. I've always cringed when I hear it (mainly online), but I know it won't matter one bit if I speak up. My diagnosis will always be the ""evil/violent diagnosis"" to the layperson, and I hate being reminded of that. I don't know what I'll do about Diane, but I don't think I feel comfortable being friends with her. She's said some mean things before and just generally acted disagreeable, so I think that was the straw to break my metaphorical back.

Thanks for reading if you got this far. I'll be okay, especially once I talk about it in therapy. I just needed to write everything out and post it to the world. I really like that I have this alternate medium here if I need it. Have a great day, everyone; stay safe.

Edit: Just wanted to clarify that when I say ""high-pitched voice,"" I mean the sort of cutsey/baby voice people use when talking to a pet, not Diane's actual voice! ",1677000482.0

Sometimes it seems like I've done this so often that the original memory is no longer there and engaging in the nostalgic activity seems futile but I still continue to do it.  Occasionally it will even seem like a worse experience, because I'm remembering the a difficult time instead of a good time.

648,Anyone at residual phase of schizophrenia?,7,1183jf1,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1183jf1/anyone_at_residual_phase_of_schizophrenia/,8,"It's been about 7-8 years since I had schizophrenia and major depression, and I think I'm at the residual phase. I don't have any symptoms on regular days, but they do come out sometimes when I'm really stressed out, so I try to get my stress level down low as possible as I can.

About 5 months ago, I was really stressed out, because of work. It was not going well at all, and I was really stressed out, because I was the one who was running it. My sister owned a cafe/bakery and I was working there as a part-timer, and she wanted to open another branch of her cafe/bakery. When she told me that I asked her if my friend and I try to run it, and she agreed.

It's funny, but I threw up on the first day, because I was so nervous even though I didn't have any customers yet. After first day, I also cried a lot while working, because it was just so hard working full time again after a long time of just working few days a week.

The business was going okay, and I managed myself to get up everyday in the morning and go to work. It was quite fun running a cafe.

The problem began to show after about 6 months of working. I ran out of my energy. I was tired all the time, and I started to care less and less. For example, I was keep getting to work late, I swept the floor less times, I cleaned the tables less, and because I was exhausted, the vibe I was showing to my customers were getting worse and worse.

All that led straight to the sales. It was keep going down, but I didn't really care about that and thought to myself that it will go back up automatically soon. That's not how business works though, and after few months of sales going down, I started to get stressed out, because it went out of my control, and that's when my symptoms came back. I started to hear voices, and sometimes get delusional.

One day I drank alcohol, and slept early. I woke up in the early morning when it was still dark, and I saw a devil standing in front of me. I was not scared or anything, but I got a realization.

I got a realization that the devil doesn't know what ""wrong"" is or notice something when something goes wrong, because the devil is wrong himself.

I thought that was exactly like me. Ever since I had Schizophrenia, something inside me has been turned around and went wrong, and just like the devil, I don't notice it when something goes wrong.

I thought I had to kill myself in order to kill that devil, so I tried to overdose on my medication by taking them all at once and drink alcohol at the same time, but I slept-walked after I lost conciousness, and passed out on the street, so someone called 911.

I woke up in the hospital, and I'm ok now. My sister was by my side at the hospital the whole time, and she couldn't stop laughing, because I was keep telling doctors and nurses jokes and keep telling some stupid stuff when they tried to talk to me when I was unconcious. My sister told me that they were in the ER, so they couldn't laugh out loud, so they tried their hardest not to laugh.

But anyway I'm all good now, and as soon as I was able to walk again, I went back and worked hard again. I was grateful that I was alive, and still doing good till this day.

I wonder if anyone is at the residual phase of schizophrenia, and if you are, how are you managing your life? because my only plan when I had symptoms was to get better. My only goal was just to get better for a long time, and now that I'm okay, I have to face and get back into the reality. From delusions in my head back to the reality where real things are.

I make music as a hobby, and I made a song called ""Devil"" after I saw the devil and the inspiration that I got after seeing the devil.

I feel a lot of pressure in that if I don't remind her, she might not take her medication and might not brush her teeth and have a psychosis again or have expensive dental problems.

I've told her many times I want her to initiate taking her medication and brushing her teeth on her own, but this doesn't seem to happen and the pattern repeats. The pattern is that says she'll do it at 9:30pm, and then when 9:30pm comes she feels like sleeping and says another 10 minutes, in the worst case this has gone on until 11pm. I've tried to get her to do it earlier, like 8pm.

I mean she's been doing it, so I'm happy about that. It just takes a lot of my energy every night.

I think it's not good if I don't remind her, because of the risk of psychosis or the risk of dental problems that could be costly to fix. At the same time, I don't like feeling pressured where it feels like all the weight is on my shoulders for her basic self-care. I understand that her symptoms perhaps is what makes it harder for her to remember to do these things or to realize the importance of doing these things, because not doing these things would cause bigger problems.

696,My Husband :(,3,117q38q,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/117q38q/my_husband/,24,"I believe that my husband may be suffering from schizophrenia. He has been having paranoid delusions that have been going on for the past two to three years. During the first year and a half, he was taking high doses of adhd medication which I believed was the sole reason for his delusions as he was barely eating and sleeping. I think he does have adhd. He was diagnosed on the extreme end of the spectrum of adhd but those medications did not help him. As a side note when he was young, he was diagnosed as bipolar and I‚Äôve read that they have many similarities.  Since February of last year, after several attempted breakups, he has stopped taking that stuff and we had a good run until about 3-4 months ago when the delusions started to resurface. I‚Äôm not sure if the medication triggered all this but I do believe that he already had  underlying mental health issues. His mom is a schizophrenic and claims to have adhd and said that her hallucinations started around the age of 30. My husband is 31. He also has several bipolar kin on his moms side of the family so i do think it‚Äôs  genetic. And no I do not believe he is back on those  medications.

As far as the delusions, he has paranoid delusions that I‚Äôm cheating on him and prostituting. He will spend hours daily trying to look me up and find secret accounts and profiles. He believes that I have secret devices around the house where I speak to other men, he hears me go to other rooms whispering to these men, that the same cars pass by our house several times a day who are the men I cheat with, that men hide outside of our home, that me and the neighbors stare at each other from our windows. He will run outside several times a day yelling at these ‚Äúmen‚Äù and then come inside and say awful things to me and then laugh at the fact that the men do not defend me. He also thinks that my mom who lives in another state is in on this and that she‚Äôs the one pimping me out. He thinks we all sit around and make fun of him. For the record I do not and will not cheat on my husband. He will also speak to himself when he‚Äôs upset. It‚Äôs exhausting trying to defend myself hours daily. He harasses me and has meltdowns whenever I leave the house. He calls me names everyday and is generally verbally abusive. I tried to go along with his delusions twice just to see if he would back off and he went into complete rage and still brings up that I‚Äôve already admitted to being a betrayer. 

I have been asking him to get help and speak to someone about all his but he refuses. He thinks I‚Äôm a narcissist and gaslighter and trying to paint a picture that he is crazy. He doesn‚Äôt think His behavior is out of place at all because he has such a strong mind. I have reached out to his family but that has not been helpful. He has no family in the state we live in so I‚Äôm concerned about what will happen to him if I leave. We have been together for over a decade and I love him he is my family and I want him to get help. However I am 31 weeks pregnant and concerned about our daughter who he thinks is a product  of betrayal.

Then I remembered that I actually used to take an antipsychotic, briefly, around 13 years ago. I was not psychotic, to my knowledge, but I did have an incident when I was 17 (I'm 31 now) where my mental health got pretty bad and I was hospitalized, and afterward prescribed Geodon for awhile. I don't *think* I was psychotic, but I also feel like the exact details of my diagnosis were hidden from me. I'm very fuzzy on the details but I ended up going off of Geodon and back to Sertraline, and then off meds entirely. Geodon turned me into a zombie, it tranquilized me and I was falling asleep constantly everywhere. That whole year is almost a blackout for me. I didn't even know until years later that it was an antipsychotic notorious for its side-effects.

But my prophecy from the lord goes
""There will still be toys and construction cites, hence no joy to come from them.""
The core of living and our nature to refuse death till given to us holds such ungradeful beauty. Such standards can't be held to comprehension.

But in that side is to be a fruit without it's skin.
To sit and not be taken in.
It was such a crinkling, sour, battery pungent tasting but unrested pain to be though of. Such pain of eternal rejection. Life but no energy. A place that's alike binary 

Been 4 months sence that warped to dream it just brings shock at any moment of breaking reality. No place to seek rest but for our foundation and our armor.

Figured I'd share my story with those going through tough times.  There were many days and nights when I did not think I would make it, but I am proud of where I am today.

In hindsight, I was always a very strange little kid; kept to myself had weird niche hobbies, wasn't popular in high school and such, etc. Often would have intense deja vu all the time, misremember things, and whatnot, especially in my teenage years. My symptoms didn't present heavily until I was in college, running with a bad crowd, and abusing psychedelics and other substances for awhile to cope with depression and anxiety. Eventually, it all came to a head, lost track of reality and ended up in a ward, got diagnosed, hopped on treatment, whole nine yards. I thought my life was over as I knew it, all my goals and ambitions of a stable relationship, academic success, a good career, life, etc. were over. I thought I was a failure and unlovable and not fit to exist in this world. 

I fell into a deep depression, unsure of what would become of myself, living day to day just to survive, with no goals or ambitions or hope. It felt like I was working 10x as hard 5x as fast, struggling just to keep up with my peers who seemed to have no trouble living average everyday lives; getting into relationships, doing good in school, going to parties, having fun, getting internships, making plans for the future. I felt ashamed of who I was and felt like my life was worthless because of this condition that was outside my control.

I write this now after having graduated with my Bachelor's degree in the top 10% of my graduating class a semester early, debt free, with a full ride to a T20 law school. I currently work at a small office job in the meantime, nothing fancy, but more than enough money to pursue my hobbies such as playing music, collecting books, and painting Warhammer figurines. I have a small group of friends who I am close with, and a beautiful significant other who accepts me for who I am and whom I love very much.

I feel as if I should call the board of health, but he is not well and I don't know what else to do.

My friend is 57 years old and lives in an apartment. He has written off all of his friends for various reasons. Several, he believes, set him up to be murdered a few years ago because he was assaulted. 

He believes he is ""gang stalked"", that all clouds are chemically generated, that license plate numbers are symbols to harass him, and that he has chips inside of him. 

I try my best to be understanding and take him out every few weeks so that he has some social interaction. He resents his brothers and parents, who he claims abused him worse than children of the holocaust. 

He actively prays for the death of his former friends and claims nobody is a real Christian besides him. I've known his family for years, and he was never abused. He is extremely anti-my race, but I knew him years ago before he was this ill, so even though he will comments to anger me, I ignore them.  If we go to a store, he will make weird comments to the female employees and give strange names if asked for an order name to embarrass the people. This resulted in someone (allegedly) spitting in his food at a Taco Bell, and he blamed the gang stalkers. He has told me I am not allowed to mention any good fortune that comes my way because I only do it to anger him. 

Many are probably asking why I hang out with this guy. I've known his family since the 1970s, and he was a very good person when he was younger, and I can't give up on him. I get angry, but I have to remind myself his life must be terrifying.

I recently went into his apartment, and there is no working plumbing, there are oil heaters plugged in all over the place, and about three feet into the room is junk (books, newspapers, etc... piled up to the ceiling. Every room is so cluttered you can barely walk.

He cooks over a sterno/open flame and won't use a stove or refrigerator. I am worried there will be an electrical fire, spill sterno, or an emergency, and he will die in a fire. 

I want to report him to the BOH so they will do an investigation, but I feel this is making his life worse. Nobody should have to live like this, but I don't know if it will send him into some breakdown. He is terrified of the police, the court system, etc. That being said, if there is a fire in his home and he dies I would never forgive myself.

It just sucks when my husband is sharing something he loves and I am flat faced and trying to explain I also enjoyed it.

I have a great half-time job that I've been at 1.5 years. When I first started, my boss wanted to pay me under the table for the first three months to make sure I was a good fit before adding me to payroll. However, I barely survive living paycheck to paycheck and that extra $100-$200 in taxes is actually needed to make sure my bills are paid so I have asked him to keep me under the table and he has no problem with that. He sends me some kind of legal form each year that I'm supposed to use once I file my taxes.

Anyway - there is a medical/dental/behavioral clinic and pharmacy here that goes on a sliding scale for patients with no health insurance. I just started using them about 5 months ago and I have been telling them I'm unemployed so I can be on the sliding scale where my 6 monthly medications are around $70 instead of $300 and doctor appointments are only $25. I know this is not right and I always feel really bad about it and I've been thinking about showing them the document my boss sends me each year to prove my wages but I'm so scared I won't be able to afford my medications or counseling appointments.

""Are you with them?"" He asked my friend last week and he didn't know what he was talking about so he absent mindedly said ""yeah"" and the guy replied ""I figured as much. It's okay. I'll learn how to shoulder it all""

Yesterday at work this guy said ""hey I got something cool to show you"" and pulled out a 45 revolver and my friend was terrified. He opened it and showed that every other chamber had a bullet. He said the reason for loading like that is so the demons hear the click before the bang. He said the gun is only for the demons. He then jokingly held the loaded gun to my friend's face and said ""click"" so he has poor gun discipline. 

He's afraid of notifying the police or anything because if they approach him and he acts normal, then he'll know that it was my friend and he'll be in danger. 

These are just a few of the things he's told me. He's worried about going to work now. 

He's worried about me posting this because if he's on Reddit he might See it and hurt him.

Any advice? I don't know if he can be reported or if doing so he can talk his way out of it. Or we have to just wait until he gets so crazy that he does something and then respond. 

My buddy has tried ignoring him and not responding, not making eye contact but it has been getting worse, so he's been trying to be super friendly and happy and cheerful around him so he'd like him so if he snaps then he'll be safer.

My AP (zyprexa 2.5 mg) makes me very depressed and tired, and I lost interest in things i used to enjoy..

I told her that I have paranoid schizophrenia on the first date. It's been working out quite well so far, but recently I've been decreasing my meds and a lot of symptoms are coming back. Last time I did this the symptoms started to decrease after a month or two, so my therapist and I agreed to wait and see how it goes. 
My girlfriend is a very caring person but she also struggles with anxiety. She's not really scared of me but about the things I experienced which makes her worry about me. It's difficult not being able to share the things that are going on for me without making her worried. So it's this strange situation where the scary things don't scare me anymore but just hearing about it makes her scared and worried. I also cannot share a lot of important things with her, since she will try to argue with it or put me down if she thinks it's delusional. 

Do you have any tips for her about how to support me? Do you have any tips for me about how to deal with this?

I was hopeless& suicidal just two weeks ago. So heres my story i was diagnosed 6 months ago and i have been on 5 different anti psychotics before i found something that made me feel like im okay with being medicated for the rest of life. Like it no longer am scared of my diagnosis,i have hope to live a full life. Needless to say my journey did not start this way.

So i was originally prescribed risperidone which made me extremely nauseous i mean i was seconds away from getting a feeding tube because I literally could not keep anything down. It also gave me a stabbing pain in my back the made it impossible to sit or walk. And the pain persisted the entire time i was on the medication. The best way to describe it was extreme period pain but in my back that lasted for entire 48 hours i was on this drug. Clearly this wasn‚Äôt the right fit for me.

So that when i was prescribed Olanzapine where which at first was my saving grace. I could finally eat and my back pain magically went away i was so grateful. This medication was extremely sedating which allowed me to sleep 10 plus hours through the nights which amazing seeing usually have sleeping issues. I felt healed which was great until it wasn‚Äôt. That when i stated to  inflate like a ballon not like fat but water weight. I was so swollen to the point where sitting felt painful like i was about to burst. Thats were i went to my local walk in where my doctor urged me to discontinue the medication as my swelling was an indication that my heart was being negatively affected by Olanzapine. So i took half his advice and simply opted to stop taking antipsychotics entirely instead of switching to something else that helped. I unfortunately relapsed into psychotic episode three months after i stoped Olanzapine and was re admitted to the psych ward.

Thats where i was immediately put on abilify which just straight up did not work on me at all like most of my psychotic symptoms were still present on abilify. Thats when i switched to ivega also known as paliperidone and rexulti. So i went from 1 pill Olanzapine to being discharged on 4 different medication. 2 antipsychotics, 1 antidepressant, and one anxiety medication commonly prescribed for sleeping. I know thats alot of medications. During this time i was supper grateful my psychotic symptoms were no longer present. But there were major downfalls to being on this many medication. For one i became completely anhedonic the best way i could describe it is someone turned off my ability to feel emotions mainly joy & pleasure. This when i started to develop medication induced acne and in 6 months made me gain 70 pounds which destroyed my self confidence. I also made me walk weird and in capable of socializing. Like i went down to a family wedding not to long ago and everyone was constantly asking me whats wrong they all caught on that i was medicated during the short period i was down. 

I Iived like this extremely depressed before i worked up the confidence to talk to my doctor switch my medication to latuda and its 2 weeks and my anhedonia went away i feel things like joy and also i was no longer sexually numb. Im starting ozempic soon for my weight gain and im hoping this medication switch will clear up my skin and restore my confidence. I feel normal like my old self again like all of sudden the reality of me probably having to be medicated for the rest of my life doesn‚Äôt make me wanna cry and curl in to a ball. Im no longer suicidal or wishing i was diagnosed with terminal cancer instead of schizophrenia. I have hope like i can go on to live my normal life. All this came from finding the medication that worked best with me. So i wanted to get on here and stress a life on antipsychotics isnt a death sentence if you advocate for yourself and being willing to find what works best for you.

My best friend (28) has been having a prolonged psychotic episode for a week. Their parents, who are not great about mental health to begin with, got them ""medicated"" but turns out it was just Xanax after a doctor diagnosed them with generalized anxiety and depression. They had already received these diagnoses years ago and this is definitely not just that. It seems pretty consistent with what I've been reading here: They are hearing voices, believe people are spying on them, leaving cameras in the house, tracking through glasses and contacts and jewelry etc. Finally, after they said the voices were going to try to get them to kill themselves, their parents had them do an overnight stay at a hospital where it sounds like they will finally receive some real antipsychotic medication, at least just to get them through this episode. Ideally proper therapy will also come next but that's TBD, again, I don't trust the parents to prioritize that like they should. 

My question is: for people who have been able to get through an episode, what did the transition out of that feel like? Did your symptoms still linger but you knew they weren't real, or did it feel like coming out of some sort of fog? Did you still feel like people who had helped you get treatment were your enemies? Did you want friends around or did more people just introduce chaos? Were phone calls helpful, or did you find them invasive or triggering ? Did you find it helpful to get a change of scenery or was consistency key?

I was diagnosed with unspecified non-organic psychosis lasting three months, so I had a psychosis that wasn't drug induced and that just came on as I entered adulthood. I am lost and my parents are lost to, they do not know what is wrong with me, I have depression but it is undiagnosed but my care workers seem to think I qualify for a depressive or some sort of mood disorder. 

My GP has also said I have Autism Spectrum Disorder although I just think depression gets in the way of my social skills. This is all I can gauge about my mental health as a diagnosis takes 12-18 months to go through therefore I have no interest in applying for a mood disorder diagnosis. As I gradually taper off Olanzapine (anti-psychotic) I can feel the disconnect from reality again, as it was in Psychosis, I feel as though I may have another episode in the next year which would really suck as I would be studying for my degree.

# Some key facts:

I have been molested by my next door neighbour as a child for years which stopped when I turned 14 (20 now) and my family seem to think it's a 'trauma' but I really don't feel as though it's very traumatic.

I have no history of Schizophrenia in the family. 

I do have history of Depression in the family.

I do not do any drugs nor do I drink alcohol, nicotine and caffeine is my vice

# The Big Question

**Is my life over?** Obviously only time will tell but out of pure speculation what do you think? Will I have another episode or will my Psychosis be one and done and I can carry on getting my degree?

Fight the stigma. This is a biological illness, yet many of us, labelled high-functioning, have to keep it a secret from those who don't know. Keeping my crazy to myself is draining. Not all of it is bad. One side effect of the meds that I am taking is that I don't enjoy music anymore. Or is it the natural progression of my SME. Smee. I have a smee. Sounds slimy.
This is how I now think. Can't focus for too long. And that is maybe a strength I have that doesn't fit the predominant ideology. I don't like capitalism. I am just curious about it. How much of our suffering is caused by the societal burden - a burden we are too broken to bear. Who the fuck knows. My psychiatrist surely doesn't.
So I have to embrace the fact that I don't fit the norm. And I often do want to just be average. Normal. A breeze of fresh air. But I also want to preserve the good parts of my insane self - and I know he exists because I was he for a good 3 years. The outside the box thinking, for one. The random associations that run in my mind, as if on a conveyor belt. And it is annoying they are so random, when I am trying to focus and work. The excessive sleep, the anxiety, the depression, the subtle cognitive changes, like when often missing the context on simple things, or twisting it making it more paranoid and unsettling. 
It is tiring to deal with this on a daily basis. So I put on a brave face, grin and bear it, and go with my day.
I wish society were more accepting of people who like to talk to themselves out loud. Sometimes the conversation makes sense. Sometimes it doesn't. I need to remind myself that I am mentally ill. And that I need to fake normal. Play a role, is all. After all, I was chosen for this (grandiose thinking is a feature of both mania and schizophrenia, both smees). That was a joke. Now let me unleash my good crazy. Crazy enough to try to recover intact. I am aware that some parts of me may be irretrievably lost. Some good ones too. But there was plenty of bad, like my propensity to yell. Not a good look.
I also need to resocialize. Speak to people in a way they understand. As a mad person. Maybe owning the name is the answer, like the term gay.
At any rate, I want what I post here to be as true to my experience as possible, and let go of the need to convince people I am normal, when I am not. And that, in and of itself, is a good thing. It is the pain that I don't appreciate, the mockery of it. How degrading it feels. And some of it is the debt of the society back to us who don't conform to the norm, for having over the centuries  burned us at the stake, chained and whipped us, literally eviscerated us, mutilated our brains, all supposedly for our own good. Current day treatments are not too far off, considering the very debilitating effects of the drugs we have to take to stay 'sane' which often make me wonder if it is all worth it. Maybe I need to be little bit crazy. To survive. Seal. The Arctic. Climate change. Greenpeace. Al Green. Al Franken. Oh, the places you'll go. Green eggs and ham. Hammentaschen. Oyfn weg, steht a boym, steht er oyfgebogen.
Yiddish. German. Hitler. Godwin. Don't lump me with the violent kind. With the Nazis and fascists, just because I am part of their demographic, only there as info to sell us stuff.

I haven't explained my situation since my introduction a long time ago, and never in-depth, so I'll explain it from the beginning.

I experienced a disembodied voice at first, but in time, what I would refer as a *personality* (rather than a voice) coalesced. I did not understand what it was, but I was not concerned as it was neither hostile nor controlling like stereotypical schizophrenic voices are.

In my search for answers, I found a subreddit called r/Tulpas. Its community told me that I was what's called ""plural"" - someone who has more than one personality in their brain. As I understand, it is not a diagnosed condition itself, but is a neurodivergence that includes, among other non-disorderly things, DID. This sounds quite different from my diagnosed schizophrenia.

I believed them then, and I still do now. No matter what anyone has told me, my stance has not wavered, but I have pondered on the matter more than is healthy in recent months.

There are certain concepts or ideas that can be difficult for some people to comprehend or accept, and in some cases, they may induce distress, anxiety, or even psychosis in susceptible individuals. Some examples of such concepts include:

1. Existential nihilism: The belief that life has no inherent meaning or purpose. This can be a difficult concept to accept for some individuals, and it may lead to feelings of despair or hopelessness.
2. Simulation theory: The idea that reality as we know it is actually a simulation or a computer-generated construct. This can be a challenging concept to wrap one's head around, and it may lead some individuals to question the nature of reality and their own existence.
3. Solipsism: The belief that the self is the only thing that can be known or verified to exist. This can be an isolating and potentially distressing belief for some individuals.
4. Paradoxes: Certain logical paradoxes, such as the liar paradox or the sorites paradox, can be difficult for some individuals to understand and may lead to confusion or cognitive dissonance.

It's worth noting that not everyone will react in the same way to these concepts, and some individuals may find them thought-provoking or even fascinating. However, for others, these concepts can be destabilizing, and it's important to seek support from a mental health professional if you experience distress or other mental health symptoms in response to these or other concepts.",1676680932.0

But not everyone with schizophrenia is able to do this. So I wonder if I actually have another condition and my doctor was wrong. 

When the voices first started I was in an apartment. I thought it was my neighbour yelling at me. So I moved to a new place and then that neighbour was yelling even worse and more constant. So I moved back into my mom's. Unfortunately though the voices just got worse. They would talk about what I'm doing and always critiquing me. I went around the whole house unscrewing random screws and putting flashlights in tiny holes thinking there was Spyware from the neighbour's. I even put blankets over the ceiling fans because I just knew it was in there. I would get so frustrated with my mom because she just couldn't hear the yelling. And I finally accepted that it wasn't real, it was probably in my head. I am on medication now but I did that realization without meds. So how could I be schizophrenic when I can rationalize?

In 2015 I was homeless and staying on the MSU campus, often sleeping in the library and the union building or my car or the 24 hour McDonald's nearby when those were closed.

I still think of the library and the union building as my home away from home and I grew up in the city and still live nearby today. That was where the shooting happened and it feels like my safe place is gone.

I've been crying everyday since the shooting and I've had really bad headaches since as well. I have schizophrenia and my symptoms have gotten worse over that time,  I was looking at Facebook at my dad's profile picture where he's smiling and I started crying and then heard his voice in my head talking to me. I'm on meds so I don't hear voices too often nowadays but he called me right after and I told him I love him and that I was just hearing his voice in my head and it seemed like telepathy.

Everything is a bit overwhelming I just feel heavy in my head and I don't think I've been thinking right I've been thinking that I'm a saint and my purpose on earth is to help others. But I feel like every time I try and show compassion on reddit to people in a hard place they end up attempting suicide and I feel like I didn't say the right thing and it's my fault.

I feel like I have to be sorry for venting about my own problems, but I know that's not something to be sorry for we all need support sometimes.

It would really be helpful if anyone can direct me to the right place. 
Question at the bottom. Can skip the background. 

Some background:
I have a sister diagnosed with schizophrenia last year. I am her only care taker. Parents are narcissistic so they are not an option to rely on. Relatives would rather believe in black magic than mental health. 
I have built up pretty stable life for both of us away from them. 
She has audio hallucinations. Medication helps but under stress she starts hearing voices again which tells her to commit suicide. She is bit stable now and started on therapy too. She forgets things and does nothing some days. Also, under slightest of stress/worry she starts lying to me to get out of any situation and I understand that is because of how our parents have been. 
Taking care of her all alone all this time has been extremely exhausting. I am 26f and she is 23f. I have only started to have financial stability. And for last 3 years done everything on my own without any help from of any kind from anyone. 
I am planning to pursue a career out of country and now it seems like her moving with me will be impossible. 
I don't leave her alone unless I don't have other option. 
She also seems to have some sort of romantic relationship which I found out accidentally. I have notified both her psychiatrist and therapist and as per their advice left it for them to handle.

I wanted to know if a person with schizophrenia can live alone? And if it's possible how to slowly prepare them for it.?",1676611481.0

She has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder.  I believe paranoid schizophrenia with major depression.  Every month right before her period it seems that her premenstrual hormone changes allow her schizophrenia to blast right through her medication.

You may remember me from a post I made a few months back, I came here because my family thinks I have Schizophrenia because of the ""signs"" I show and the things I tell them. At first I was worried, but then I had a few days where suddenly I thought there was nothing wrong with me at all and that everything that happened to me (the aliens impersonating my family, for example) were just coincidences. 
But the next few days, this week specifically, have been getting worse and worse for me. The doors in my home as well as the ceiling fans move on their own, and nobody else sees it. Three nights ago I had a miniature panic attack because I thought my family were calling the psych ward on me, and the next day I had another mini panic because I thought someone broke into the apartment and was looking for me so they could kill me. I heard his footsteps, so I hid under the blanket until he left. According to my family, nothing happened that night. Last week I believe, I was scared that the construction workers who were working on the building I go to school at were going to drill through the wall to try to kill me. And today, while I was doing schoolwork, I had a sudden severe fear that there was a serial killer inside the cabinets who was planning to kill me. I checked all of the cabinets and nobody was there, but I was still scared. 
I don't know how to stop this and it's all getting to overwhelming and scary... Is there a way I can stop this naturally? I am afraid of getting evaluated because I don't want to be sent away from my family...",1676591530.0

She has never had these hallucinations before and we possibly believe it could be due to stress.

Originally she would see figures as she drove in the car at night time in the dark. They would be human figures that stood still on the side of the road.

We originally thought that these hallucinations were due to her bad eye sight as she needs glasses. She went to the local opticians and told them that she had been seeing figures and they perscribed her some glasses to wear whilst she drives. However this has not changed anything and she still sees these people when she is driving.

Throughout the past month or so these hallucinations have gotten worse and she now regularly sees this figure who stands on my street outside. She now also sees people when she is not only driving but walking around in the day and night time. These figures have also began to start moving whether it be a person doing the gardening or a tall figure moving its legs but stationary at the same time. In addition to this, they also sometimes appear in colour as well as black and white and now wear articles of clothing such as a green hat.

Furthermore she now has seen these figures with their hands on the window looking into the room and also inside the house standing over the bed and in the corner of the room. She has also stated that she tends to find that once she sees this figure once it will appear several times during that day.

She does not hear any voices but only sees these figures. They also vanish when she approaches them too close and knows they are hallucinations and not real.

I‚Äôm not a part of this sub, but I‚Äôm here because I don‚Äôt know what other sub I can talk to about this issue. My mother in law is an amazing woman, I love her, she‚Äôs always gone above and beyond for her son, me and our 3 kids. The past couple of years she‚Äôs been talking about people watching her from electronic devices. She refuses to share Wi-Fi passwords with people, even us and when we bought her a smart tv, she put it in storage because she swore someone was watching her. She has two phones, an iPhone and a flip phone. She mainly uses the flip phone with a bandaid covering the camera. She leaves her iPhone in the garage most of the time. We figured that it‚Äôs probably just her not knowing how electronics work, but today she said something that truly worried me. 

She said that she went out to eat at a restaurant the other day and she usually leaves her purse with her iPhone at the table with her husband while she goes to the bathroom. This time she forgot and took her purse with her. When she noticed she took her purse, she decided to leave it in another stall while she went to another to use the toilet. I told her if she has her phone in her purse no one can see her, she said that they can see through her purse! 

We (my husband, i and her husband) have tried talking to her and explaining that no one is watching her, but she insists that God told her they are. I‚Äôm scared of leaving my children with her now. What if she starts to think they are sick and gives them medicine that they shouldn‚Äôt have? Which is something she did once. 

She‚Äôs never gone to the doctor for this, she refuses to, but my husband thinks the medications she takes daily are causing her to be schizophrenic. What can I do to help her? I don‚Äôt want to have to keep her from being alone with my kids, they love her so much.",1676586840.0

Cognitively, she is around the level of a seven-year-old. She was reared with her sister, who is now 19. They did everything together, we're inseparable, and we're each other's best friends.

The 19-year-old graduated high school, and enlisted in the Navy. Shortly after, the 21-year-old was diagnosed with schizophrenia which I think came about from the two of them going separate directions in life for the first time. The 19-year-old got married and they now live across the country, while the 21-year-old lives with us (myself and parents).

It's like a never-ending death of a part of the 21-year-old, and she's oneds and therapy already. The rest of us are getting mentally worn out while constantly having to occupy her mind with other things to do to keep her from hearing the voices in her head. It's the same thing every day, scores or even hundreds of times per day, the 21-year-old asking the same questions repeatedly. Some days are good, but most days are horrible, and it is extremely mentally taxing for all of us. 

Remember, as I mentioned before, she has microcephaly so it's even more difficult to deal with this other mental condition than it would be with someone who is cognitively normal.

Paranoid Schizophrenia is usually the result of some sort of trauma, the mind recoils into a defense mechanism and shifts the way it behaves to avoid any perceived threat. Although the mind becomes ill there are some benefits to it's state for eg. a greater sense of what may happen in the future. The brain anticipates events at a faster rate than a normal functioning brain. Often piecing past events together to calculate future events and fill in the blanks of what may possibly happen. Although there is a certain level of gambling in this situation you will find that historically many Schizophrenic minds have indeed anticipated correctly. The feeling of being watched through technology is a strong example of this. Surveillance became more widely known in recent years as a norm, quite a while after the average paranoid mind perceived it as a threat.

926,The Switch,5,113rohr,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/113rohr/the_switch/,9,"Recently there was a day where I thought everything was being directed at me in some type of way. I hadn't had much sleep and hadn't taken my meds in the previous 24 hours. It started with having gotten back on Facebook to prove something I believed I was said to have lied about, seeing countless post after post by people from across all different communities I'm part of, and getting wrapped up in paranoia that every single person I knew was out to get me. Everyone was taking the opportunity to make fun of, accuse, and call me a liar.

I went for a drive to clear my head but as I did every single song that came on over the radio (from my spotify no less) was a message for me to give up and kill myself. The worst part was that one of the first songs to play talked about ""Going out like Elvis"" and I had joked to my exs gf the day before that that would be how I would die (not going to explain in detail, but not the drugs).

As I keep driving, I feel a pull on the steering wheel around each curve. I live on a long peninsula and it's the only thing I drive up and down (mostly). It's a one lane winding road alongside a large bay in Northern Michigan - so snow. I was absolutely terrified. I was convinced someone had control over my car and was trying to make me pull the steering wheel into the lake to make it look like an accident. I'm not sure at this point if I was pulling the steering wheel myself or what.

I get back home after this experience and I tell my ex (we still live together) about it but as I do - he is playing songs from youtube on the TV. It just so happens that every song that then plays is about being watched, giving up, and that someone was coming. This playlist was full of songs from the 80s, but it was as if every part of the music video had just been made that very moment to send me signs throughout the music videos, mostly telling me to kill myself. I kept trying to let it go, but each next song would get worse. I sat there wide eyed and unmovable. Fucking terrified.

I can't remember what else happened but by the time I convince myself that if all of this isn't real - then I've lost my fucking mind and need to go to the hospital - it only continued to get worse on the way. My ex began to drive me to the hospital but we first had to drop our daughter off at his gfs house. I live in a very small town in a remote, tourist location so I drive the same roads and often don't drive more than maybe 15 minutes at max at a time... if at all. As we drive, every single sign I see, every license plate, and even yard signs that had been up for months were all now direct messages and/or threats. Cars turned at exactly the right moments to make sure I saw them and some even tried to hit us... so I believed.

Of course, as we drove, all of the songs that came through on the local radio were also targeted messages. The radio DJ even made some comment that I just knew was meant for me. Every one in the entire town had orchestrated this. Even the radio DJ knew that we were in the car at this very moment (while cars with cryptic license plates still pass or almost ""try"" to hit us). While this may sound all very outlandish, there was no convincing my brain otherwise in that moment. Everything aligned and my eyes were wide - watching and waiting - taking in every perceived threat as absolute.

When I arrived at the hospital and they began to triage - I notice the board with the names of all the doctors on duty or that work there or something. I easily recognized over half of those last names because of how small our town is and how active in the community I have been through my school. When the intake guy told the triage lady that I was to go to room 27 - it was confirmed. The hospital was in on it too.

They take me back to a solitary confinement room with nothing but a hospital bed. At least I had that, compared to some other places I had been. I read the numbers on my hospital bracelet. Suspicious, too. As I settle into the room, I glance out at the nurses station and I see a whiteboard with the numbers 33427 - Flint (Gold) written down on the bottom right. I am 33 years old, my birthday is on the 27th (hence why the room number bothered me) and I had received a lovely card from a 5th grader I mentor that was written in yellow (my favorite color) that stated I had a heart of gold. Now... this? She was in on this too? Did her parents tell her to write that? They were surely in on it, too.

When the on-duty counselor comes to visit me I attempt to explain what had been happening but I could barely move. I must have looked exactly like a scaredy cat. A literal scared cat. I was entirely catatonic with my arms wrapped around my legs sitting in the fetal position. She asked if I felt I could even trust her - to which I replied, ""No. Not at all."" and it was one of the saddest things I ever had to say and/or feel. That even at the hospital, I was not safe.

I had deeply believed that all of this was related to the man who assaulted me in 2015 that I fought in criminal and civil court against. He had hired private investigators to follow me during the years leading up to the trial in both cases and included over 5+ police officers in his character witness list. One of which was the retired chief of police of that location it happened in and another witness was an FBI agent. He would be the only one with that power, ability, and the most want to destroy me.

At the time, I had been threatening to release all of the documents of the court cases in a fury of proving everything I had ever been accused of lying about. This was the driving factor as I was sitting there back in my apartment listening to the youtube songs that were clearly egging me on so that I would post everything and he would have every reason to come murder me. How could I go to the police? Literally. How could I go to the police. How could I ever trust them. And in my area? Let's just say I had a lot of reason to not put any trust into our small local area police force with reason to believe they were already involved, out to get me, and possibly part of this - especially when the radio DJ was in on it, too.

I couldn't trust the police. I couldn't trust the hospital. It was fucking terrifying. I sat there in that barren room on the bed just staring at the wall, praying. Not wanting my life to end. Just wanting to be believed. To stop feeling like this man will someday come and kill me for fighting against him and being so vocal about it. Or maybe the countless others I've pissed off along the way standing up for the things that I do or just the toxic things I have said or done throughout the years. I realized the long, long list of people I've not only done wrong but who would actively want to hurt me. I began to see clearly all of the ways I've put giant targets on my back.

As I sat in that room, the TV was loudly playing in the room next door through the walls. It was a muffled sound, but the music was intense and dramatic at times and it made me feel absolutely insane as I laid there screaming in my head for the music to stop. At one point, I heard it. A voice from somewhere whispered, ""You're just complaining"". How. How did they say that. How did they get to me. Was there someone in the hospital that was part of this just beyond the other side of that gate thing? Whispering it through the cracks in the walls to make sure I knew that the hospital was also involved? Let's not forget the times I had ""complained"" about my treatment at this hospital considering the rare vascular condition I have and the blood clot/asthma threats that had been chalked up to mental illness. The hospital was surely in on all of this, too.

These were all of the thoughts that cycled throughout me. I couldn't move. I felt like I could barely breathe. And I surely wanted to die even though I didn't/don't. It felt like it would be the simplest solution to everyone's problem. Especially if this was what my life was to become. If none of this was real - I had gone absolutely insane. Terrified is the only word I have to describe the utter horror I felt that day.",1676557154.0

First time I took seroquel, god it felt good, I got sooo relaxed and it knocked me right into sleep. Slept for 13 hours that night. But noticed the dosage was too low since I got psychotic symptoms every day for that week. Noticed it came in the late afternoon/beginning of the night. And after that first night of knocking me out it didn't knock me out that well anymore. So my sleep got worse.

The doctor upped my dosage. And also prescribed me a pill with prolonged effect to see if it lessens the psychotic symptoms. Right now I've taken that pill for the first time yesterday night so I'll have to see how it works out starting today. Just called the doctor again because I wanted to discuss my exhaustion. He thinks it's not because of the meds because I'm not feeling sedated(reacting slow) but because it's from the psychotic symptoms and bad sleep.

It sucks because I literally can't get myself to do anything. The doc said I need to let the meds do their work and see how it goes. Hope I feel better in a couple of days/a week.

This wouldn't be a huge issue if I wasn't in the process of coming to terms and still learning about my diagnosis. I'm starting question my ability to study on a higher level. The reason being that it takes a lot of energy out of me to process and attain abstract information. I feel as if I can grasp the concepts discussed in class, but when I try to solve the mathematical problems or during the examinations I am unable to bring forward what I've learnt quickly and efficiently, and trying to explain a mathematical concept verbally is hard since I can't seem to get my thoughts in order.

I spend most of my time listening to a ton of music, writing poetry and/or song lyrics, rapping or singing.

I thought was sounded kinda profound, so I thought about it. Let me tell you what I found.  


The intrinsic qualities of something lead to it's destiny. Human destiny has already been written through our nature.   


Civilization was destiny, because humans like to feel safe and ultimately they build better and better systems to keep them safe. From the moment that a tool was first crafted by humans their destiny was to build better tools.  


The nature of technology is improvement. Technology over time always improves, even if that improvement is very slow. It is because our nature is improvement that we seek improvements in our tools too.

&#x200B;

The nature of mankind is conflict. Every single country has been at war at some point or another, or suffered internal conflicts. We're even combative in our personal lives sometimes too.

  
I don't know when but the world will end in a massive war, because given enough time humans will always start one that leads to them using their most technologically advanced weapons and the weapons keep getting more advanced. On a potentially very long timeline weapons technology will lead to the end of the world.

I have an incredible job, a great new apartment, great friends 

After years of trauma my life is finally going well 

Then things start to go wrong 

I meet a guy at a pre game in a neighborhood where I live 

This isn‚Äôt really relevant but his dad is a well known billionaire - this is true, verifiable 

Around this time I also start doing acid. I am 25F. I had been sober from using heroin for 2.5 years. 

I hangout with the guy four times. At the time I am doing a lot of acid, I do it four times over the course of ~two months 

This is my first time having sex in years 


I do make this guy mad, I do some mean things, but I can‚Äôt get him out of my head 

We have a sort of falling out. I go with him to one of his burning man events and we have sex, afterwards we fight over text and have a weird phone call where he says 

‚ÄòWe could have had a relationship but you didn‚Äôt want that‚Äô 

Then things go kind of dark. I become obsessed with him but I am generally ok. I send a lot of weird texts. Thousands of them. 

Two weird things to note: this guy did say on the phone he had one relationship in his adult life, and doesn‚Äôt appear to date much 

On November 31 I perform this uncrossing ritual thing I found online 

Then I hate him - the texts become mean and angry 

Is that related? Who knows, but the texts change a lot

Angry, mean, talking about my past trauma 

He finally blocks me after I had sent him thousands of texts  

He has an event on January 1st. It‚Äôs now been two months of no contact from him and me sending hundreds of weird texts 

The week before Christmas a voice appears in my head 

The voice says I am going to be broken to become a sex slave wife 

That I need to know my purpose which is pleasing him sexually - lots of very odd sexual things 

Example: I will let you fuck my throat for ten hours 

This is not normal for me - I considered myself borderline asexual before this 

I begin masturbating compulsively, telling myself I can feel him doing cocaine, lots of weird things 

He questions me on some of the weird texts I sent him 

I am very private about my past. I don‚Äôt tell people things like ive been to rehab, I used to work as a stripper - after the uncrossing those are the kind of texts I sent 

This becomes a massive nervous breakdown 

To the voice in my head that claims to be this guy, I mention a friend of mine from work who is fairly attractive 

The voice starts saying my friend, is hotter than me 

He is taking her as a sex slabe instead, she is better than me and I will be killed 

At one point this even turns into an argument on my friends height - she is 5‚Äô10‚Äù, I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù, he is around 5‚Äô8‚Äù 

‚ÄòI can‚Äôt take her I‚Äôd she‚Äôs 5‚Äô10‚Äù‚Äô

I am thinking this is pschizophrenia

I have never experienced anything like this and I am terrified

This devolved to become a Lot worse 

I have conversations in my head 

I feel very strong emotions, emotions of others 

I eventually just lost it 

I am so scared, I don‚Äôt want to be insane, I have a lot to live for 

I am also concerned this could be DID - set off by the acid use and me having sex again after two years of avoiding it 

The emotional part and me having long conversations with these ‚Äòvoices‚Äô - I do also sometimes miss them - makes me wonder if this is DID instead 

I have a history of dissociative symptoms and long term CSA, but also a family history of schizophrenia 

I am scared",1676531494.0

I think that people that don't have what we have try to understand ""insanity"" from a perspective that they don't have, and as a result they don't truly understand what it's like to have a brain prone to psychosis, so it's easy for them to think that they are ""crazy"" when they feel sad, or maybe lack of confidence and remembering the words of bullies is like voices to them?

It's been so difficult to watch him go through this. When we met months ago he was very affectionate and very interested, but he went through a psychotic episode recently that was difficult to watch him go through, and was recently diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. I have been worried sick about him, but I want to stick around and be supportive; it's not his fault he's sick, and he's such a wonderful person. It's been difficult to see him so scared and having all this emotional turmoil, to have feelings of guilt and inadequacy around his condition, to deny treatment, his cognitive deficits and agitation. And now he says he's feeling better, but he's withdrawing from me noticeably and seems to be emotionally detaching from me, despite saying he really wanted to be with me before. I'm scared this illness is both taking him away from me and that things are going to get worse for him. He was diagnosed and saw a doctor for that, but I don't think he's pursuing any treatment. I'm so scared this illness is going to take him away, and I'll lose him forever. He's the most wonderful person I've ever met, and I love him very much.

I would definitely see a therapist to help me with all this, as I intend to stick around if he'll have me, but 1.) idk if he will and 2.) I can't afford that right now. I just need someone to talk to, I think, someone with some level of insight.",1676512090.0

It was actually pretty traumatic. I felt like I was getting interrogated by the police like I did something wrong. He asked a lot of questions about my symptoms and the basics.

anyway, i feel like my brain thinks in branches. i struggle to articulate this, but the best way i can describe it is that ill have an idea, but the idea has all these branches, which also have their own branches. so this idea comes to me with a hoard of non ‚Äòinner voiced‚Äô information. and then i connect it to other ideas and my brain just goes down this rabbit hole of comparing so much information at once, but most of the information is in the background, but definitely there, just many many things being represented by one idea. 
^ i think the process of creativity is similar to this. when being creative, you have an original idea, but then it disperses into different branches of related ideas, so that theres tons of concepts per thought.
^or maybe even how different words represent a subset of other words. but instead its like tons of information is represented by a few bouts of information.
often i struggle to articulate because i think that my ideas already have so many things tied to them that come along with them, but thats not the case for other people. ill look back at conversations and understand that they got the wrong impression from what i was trying to convey.

when i get sent down these rabbit holes. it feels like i cant turn my brain off and its miserable. its like my brain just becomes this uncontrollable racecar and i cant stop having thoughts. this typically happens to me when thinking about philosophy or psychology. it feels like my brain is thinking chapters in seconds. i have tons of ‚Äúepiphanies‚Äù during these racecar modes that i cant stop writing down no matter how stressed and exhausted my brain is. this typically lasts multiple hours.

i feel like this ‚Äòbrain style‚Äô would be one similar to having schizophrenia because of the way my brain shoves so many different connections onto me. (correct me if im wrong), it seems like a lot of what the illness is, is the brain improperly reading information and plugging in information thats similar to it in its place. i have episodes of extreme paranoia, which i think i can acknowledge is wrong even at the time but doesnt stop me from being paranoid. i have some auditory hallucinations, that come to me when im very paranoid. last night i was very paranoid and essentially fear paralyzed in my bed for no particular reason and my stomach growled and i thought someone was talking to me (not saying anything distinct) and a huge wave of fear struck my body. 

i have a lot of anxiety in my body at all times. i make toast daily when i need an easy meal, but still jump and get a surge of fear anytime the toaster pops the toast out. im very jumpy.

theres been a few incidences of being very paranoid and having visual ‚Äòhallucinations‚Äô like being afraid the shower curtain is breath ing, thinking someone on a hike who was holding a basketball had a rock and flinched hard bc i thought they were going to bash my head with the rock, and driving at night, seeing shadows behind light poles as ‚Äòmonsters‚Äô. my body is often surged with freezing fear when things like this happens. 

random extra information: i have a vivid imagination, vivid dreams- which i can sometimes feel pain in, and overall i want to say that im a happy person. i would consider myself an optimist.

anyway, thats about it. sorry that this is so long.",1676519168.0

I just want to get some encouraging advice here and tell you about myself, because there is no one else.
 

One day a psychosis happened, because of a random thought that said to kill a loved one, it caused stress in me, I actually thought that I wanted to do it, and not that it was just nonsense, I began to be afraid of thoughts, and the person on whom these thoughts were, I could not from to get rid of them until another psychosis happened, after which something unusual began to happen to me: I began to understand when I have a state of psychosis, I realize that I have delusions and hallucinations, but I can't get rid of them, then comes a state when suddenly everything goes away and, as it were, the reality of what is happening returns, but I don't remember what happened before, I feel a surge of energy and high mood because of nothing, then everything starts over again every day, then I found a way to get rid of this state, I realized that I'm constantly talking to myself or with with a voice in my head and I believe him, and I decided not to believe the thoughts, and skip them, not to fight so much with psychosis, and it worked.

But this worsened the situation and I stopped noticing that I was not behaving as before, I was no longer reacting to delirium, I was not afraid of it, sometimes I saw a flash in my eyes, the movement of objects, and that all vital energy was gone and everything became meaningless, even communication with people, I lost friends. I am afraid to ask for help, then everyone will find out that I have a mental illness that is not being treated, they will put me in the hospital, they will expel me from the university, I am not in the USA where I understand the disease more, and my parents will not tolerate it, they said that if something happens to my health, they will not have enough they can't stand it and they won't believe me (I tried to tell them this several times, but they yelled at me and said that I made it up, and it didn't get easier for me for long)I don't have the funds for treatment myself, maybe I made it all up or it seems so to me, but something is happening to me.

Giftedness is often associated with high intellectual ability, creativity, and a strong desire for knowledge and understanding. However, it can also come with challenges, such as heightened sensitivity, perfectionism, and a tendency to feel isolated from others who may not share the same interests or abilities.

Schizophrenia is a mental health condition that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. It can cause symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disordered thinking, and social withdrawal. It is a complex and multifaceted condition that can impact a person's ability to function in everyday life.

When someone is diagnosed with both schizophrenia and giftedness, it can be challenging to navigate the strengths and challenges associated with each. On one hand, giftedness can be a source of strength and resilience in the face of the challenges that come with schizophrenia. On the other hand, the symptoms of schizophrenia can be particularly difficult for someone who is also gifted, as they may be more aware of their own mental state and more sensitive to the changes in their perception and thinking.

It's important to work with mental health professionals who are knowledgeable about both schizophrenia and giftedness, and who can provide personalized support and treatment to address your unique needs.

Certainly, here are a few examples of successful individuals who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia:

John Nash - an American mathematician and Nobel laureate who was diagnosed with schizophrenia in his 30s. His life was the subject of the book and movie ""A Beautiful Mind.""

Elyn Saks - an American law professor who was diagnosed with schizophrenia in her early twenties. She is also an author and advocate for mental health.

Lionel Aldridge - a former American football player who played for the Green Bay Packers and was diagnosed with schizophrenia later in life. He later became an advocate for mental health and wrote a book about his experiences.

Peter Green - a British musician and founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia in the 1970s. He continued to make music throughout his life and is regarded as one of the most influential guitarists of his generation.

It's important to note that schizophrenia can affect individuals in different ways, and success may be defined differently by different people. However, these examples demonstrate that a diagnosis of schizophrenia does not necessarily mean that one cannot lead a successful and fulfilling life. With proper treatment and support, many people with schizophrenia are able to manage their symptoms and achieve their goals.

Sure, here are a few more successful individuals who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia, along with brief descriptions of their achievements:

Jack Kerouac - an American novelist and poet who was diagnosed with schizophrenia later in life. He is best known for his novel ""On the Road"" and is considered a pioneer of the Beat Generation.

Syd Barrett - a British musician and founder of the band Pink Floyd, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia in the late 1960s. He is regarded as a creative and influential musician in the psychedelic rock movement.

Mary Todd Lincoln - the wife of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia in her later years. She is known for her involvement in the political and social scene of the White House during her husband's presidency.

Nashit D. - a Pakistani-American physician who was diagnosed with schizophrenia in his 20s. He later earned a medical degree and has written about his experiences with mental illness to raise awareness and promote understanding.

Meera Popkin - an American actress and singer who was diagnosed with schizophrenia in her 30s. She has performed on Broadway and has been an advocate for mental health and destigmatization.

I'm not in a good place right now, my anxiety is through the roof, I can't shake the belief/feeling that God is mad at me, that I'm doomed to hell and that I'm being punished for all of my mistakes. 

Has anyone else ever felt this way?",1676419235.0
994,How could i know if my issues are due to DID or Schizophrenia,0,112yt2z,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/112yt2z/how_could_i_know_if_my_issues_are_due_to_did_or/,7,"I am pretty sure i have DID and i know that some symptoms can often be mistaken, but on an old psych eval it is clearly stated that i am at high risk for schizophrenia and show multiple traits, it doesnt divulge into it more and just says it should be investigated further by a specialist but i never ended up doing a follow up. 

I am pretty sure of DID, even without a diagnosis but the question is, how can i know that the traits from the psych eval werent just misinterpreted DID. What are the actual differences between the two that i could look out for?",1676470044.0
995,Stigma sucks,36,112c3eb,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/112c3eb/stigma_sucks/,23,"I had an appointment today to see about getting some volunteer work, you know, since I have been in recovery since the start of November and have reached a new state of well being where I feel capable of doing it. Sat down with the lady that was taking the ""interview"" and explained to her that I wanted to volunteer in the area of mental health. I explained this was because I suffer from mental health issues and have my own personal experience on the matter. She kind of lead the conversation towards how I had become mentally ill so I explained I am paranoid schizophrenic because of a traumatic experience that involved a nasty crowd and drugs. I was being polite and honest about my past and every question she threw at me. Towards the end of our chat she started stumbling on her words and decided the volunteer position was a big maybe because of a few factors such as her boss attending to her sick dad in hospital etc.  
 I could tell that she wasn't keen for taking me on, either because of my diagnosis or because the word drugs cropped up. It made me realise that there is still a lot of stigma surrounding schizophrenia and addiction even in places that are there to help disabled people find employment.   
  I wont be going back to try and get the volunteer work from them, I know my worth and how well I have faced my challenges lately, like becoming clean and forming a healthy routine that is not self destructive but also appreciated by others.   
 It's just disappointing to see that the stigma is still well and truly alive even in those circumstances. I feel like I've been tarred with a brush that has no relevance to me. I just think its their loss as I would have done a spectacular job given the chance, regardless of my condition or past.",1676398521.0
996,I am the target of a family member's delusion: how should I react?,2,112ufpu,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/112ufpu/i_am_the_target_of_a_family_members_delusion_how/,3,"Hi !

My uncle has strong schizophrenic traits. He is not followed by any practitioner. He moved to a different country but comes back home sometimes. 

We always had a good relationship. Then he moved away and we lost touch. His condition got worse. He sends me violent and aggressive messages that make no sense. Apparently, I am not the only one in the family who gets messages from him.

He's currently in a sending-messages-frenzy and I don't know how to react. I haven't replied yet because I'm at lost. I don't want to be mean to him, I would like him to stop being so violent. I even got a death threat a few years ago. Back then, I tried to call him because I thought that he would never say those horrible things aloud. He didn't want to answer the phone and kept texting and emailing me.

I have to admit I am also a bit scared of making him angrier with my words or by blocking him. I'd like to appease him. 

Thank you for your insight 

Tl;Dr: a family member is including me in his delusion in a violent way, and I don't know how to react to deescalate the story in his mind.",1676454807.0
