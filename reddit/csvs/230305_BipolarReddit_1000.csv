0,Welcome to BipolarReddit! A Message from the Community,293,kr9uh4,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/kr9uh4/welcome_to_bipolarreddit_a_message_from_the/,0,"Welcome! This is a community focused on supporting people diagnosed with bipolar disorder. If you are bipolar, we‚Äôre glad you‚Äôre here. We are a judgement-free community that wants to see all people diagnosed with bipolar disorder achieve enduring health and balance. 

As you explore the discussions, here is a primer on how this community works.

* Most people who post and comment on r/BipolarReddit have already received a medical diagnosis, including bipolar type 1, type 2, schizoaffective or cyclothymia. If you have not yet sought a diagnosis, we encourage you to meet with a doctor, discuss your concerns and solicit their diagnosis. However, you are welcome to read and ask general questions in your pursuit of health.  
* A medical diagnosis can only be given by a medical professional. If you are concerned enough about your mental health to ask if you are bipolar, that is sufficient reason for you to seek a medical opinion. None of us participate here in a medical capacity, and no one here can or will tell you if you are bipolar. Those kinds of questions are not for this subreddit.
* We like to be precise. Terms like mania, hypomania and major depression have specific definitions, and we ask you to familiarize yourself with the medical terminology. We have created a wiki for (and authored by) people with bipolar disorder, based on the DSM-V. Please [review the definitions](https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/wiki/index/definitions). **Important Note:** The terms mania and hypomania are often conflated, inaccurately. Please be exact in your use of these terms when posting and commenting because it helps the community understand the severity of what you are experiencing, which helps us give you the best support. Mania is a medical emergency that typically requires hospitalization. We understand that it can be hard to know exactly what is going on in the moment. Just do your best so we can better understand you. 
* We invite you to [explore the rest of our subreddit‚Äôs wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/wiki/index), which has valuable information and resources this community has compiled. There are some common questions for people with bipolar disorder. Before posting a question, please look through the wiki to see if your question has already been answered.  
* Harassment is not tolerated, and this subreddit is actively moderated. Do not post anything that is hateful or hurtful to others‚Äô path to health. Robust discussion and strong opinions are most welcome, but keep it kind. If you see harassment, report the post or comment and use the ‚ÄúMessage the Mods‚Äù button with any background information, if you have it. Please do not engage. We will get to it as quickly as we can. 
* If you are not bipolar, you may want to visit r/BipolarSOs or related subreddits. This is not a place to discuss bipolar on behalf of someone else or seek opinions on whether someone else is bipolar. The one exception is if you have an urgent help question and need a fast answer (e.g., ‚ÄúMy SO is diagnosed bipolar and is currently psychotic, what do I do?‚Äù). 
* We don‚Äôt do memes, art or other popular media. Such posts will be removed. We are purely focused on support through discussion.",1609886701.0

Firstly, my joints and chest hurt a lot. But that's something I should bring up with my doctor. Though my doctor doesn't really understand most things I bring up to him.

I'm feeling really lazy on seroquel. Like I am not doing anything. I'm eating way too much. I have no self control. I just don't have any will power. It's like my brain won't listen to me. I did notice a flicker of responsibility today where I almost started doing a class assignment but usually I can't even do the first step because the laziness is so bad and the task feels daunting.

The reason I know this has to do with the medication is cause on my last medication I wasn't as lazy. I had some serious agitation on Latuda but I was more motivated and organized, and was able to keep up in my academics. 

I was so close to my degree and now I am dropping out of school because I can't do a single assignment. I can't even leave my bedroom honestly. But I really don't want to stop seroquel because my mind feels really calm.",1677992295.0

When I go hiking, I feel I am transported to another world. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs any particular world, just one of intense beauty. I can look into the canopies of trees in wonder‚Äîactually I can do that in any slightly tree‚Äôd area, even a parking lot. But when I am actually IN nature, as in hiking or the like, it feels transcendental.   


It doesn‚Äôt matter if I‚Äôm depressed, manic (well, then it‚Äôs a much more intense trip), stable. Nature always makes me feel intensley connected, and so joyful that I often cry.   


This does wear off, for instance if I‚Äôve been hiking for several hours, but each time I go hiking it is about an hour‚Äôs worth of pure euphoria.

I am not trying to act like ‚ÄúI am so special and others aren‚Äôt‚Äù‚Äîit‚Äôs just that others often seem quite confused, amused, or disturbed by my behavior.

Wheras I seem to take in every light and shadow as if it‚Äôs a cinematic masterpiece. Every bird song, god forbid there is running water nearby because I will just about break down in tears. I also tend to focus on the minutae more than others. I think I feel the same exhuberance seeing the leaves sway in the wind and the light flicker in and out as others see at the peak of a mountain.

I've been to a psychiatrist recently and they informed me I have a unidentified mood disorder, when in reality I know it is bipolar, I have all the symptoms but when she went over the symptoms I lied to her, so now I'm in a mess. My father was a known bipolar,  who also was Manic Depressive, which leads me to believe the increased chance that I am bipolar. Here is what I'm going through right now
Anger, not just like a tiny bit but like terrible terrible episodes (that's what I think they are) this is the description of a normal episode for Me- screaming, crying, swearing, hitting anything I can, hurting myself hurting anything around me (mostly inanimate objects) I don't feel in control, anything I want to say just comes out, I have no filter and control is lost. 
Irresponsible behaviors (keep in mind I am 15)- I have started smoking marijuana, sneaking out, drinking alcohol, honestly doing anything I can do without the thought of risk in mind.
Unusual appetite - idk if that's a symptom- but I usually eat very little during the day and binge at night
Unable to show emotions when I want too - the only time I can cry is during a episode other than that I can't cry and I'm starting to not be able to feel happy either, something happy happens and I smile but something inside of me like a rock in my stomach reminds me that I'm still sad and mentally unstable
I can't go a day without having an episode and recently they are getting worse, I've had increased drive of (TW: SH MENTIONS) self harm which I told my parents and psychiatrist, neither took concern.
I am on medication: Seroquel

I want to taper but I have no idea how.

I have this thing where when I‚Äôm driving I get a lot of anxiety in certain kinds of locations. Basically places that are really dense and slow and chaotic  like shopping centers, college campuses, and downtown areas. 

Navigation software typically makes this problem worse for me  because when I am traveling in an unfamiliar area  I will have to rely on the GPS to find me things like stores and restaurants, and I have no warning typically until I get to the place of what kind of place it‚Äôs going to be. And there have been more than a few times when my GPS took me to a very uncomfortable location in search of a cup of coffee or something and before I even got there I was bugging out enough that I no longer wanted to even get there and just needed to get out of the dense area, but there‚Äôs no way to do that Because the GPS doesn‚Äôt have a mode for avoid dense areas. So I try to tell the GPS to take me somewhere, anywhere, but half the time it just takes feet deeper into the dense area because it thinks that‚Äôs a more efficient route then backtracking to the highway or whatever. 

I tried talking to a few friends and posted on Facebook about this, and the reply was really just people making fun of me because what the fuck is wrong with me that I can‚Äôt handle being in a shopping center or university campus and just suck it up that‚Äôs normal life and you‚Äôre being such a stupid little snowflake. 

Personally I hope to believe that people are allowed to have their own needs and anxieties  end it would be really nice if the people around us could acknowledge our concerns and help support us rather than just telling us that we‚Äôre weird and shouldn‚Äôt care about that thing. 

But, I really don‚Äôt know why it is that I care about this. Is it a bipolar thing? Is it just something related to my own personal trauma? Really, I guess the reason it matters to me at this point is that this problem has been so persistent and so frustrating for me and so completely ignored by the service providers out there but I am starting to really think about saving up some cash and paying a programmer to write me a bug out app. 

I want a piece of navigation software that does one thing and one thing only: gets me out of the dense area  that I am in, and onto the nearest highway pointing outward from the area of high population density.

I really don‚Äôt think this should be a difficult algorithm at all, considering that most navigation algorithms already have awareness of the different sizes of roads out there. It would really only need to find the quickest route to the nearest road with a higher speed limit than the one I am on, and then from there again to the next largest road. There are probably open source Lego pieces that can be put together to do this pretty quickly, but even a basic phone app is still multiple thousands of dollars at the cheapest. I could probably get someone in India or Mexico to do it for a couple thousand dollars, but I don‚Äôt want to invest if it‚Äôs really truly something that I alone care about. In my work as a disability attorney, I have from time to time at Clients report to me but they also had anxiety in certain driving situations, but among my clients  the usual response is simply to work on driving less rather than trying to find a way to make it more tolerable. I fear that the combination of this symptom combined with the lifestyle habit of traveling frequently might be too small of a Venn diagram for there to be any interest at all.

Any reading suggestions? Any TLDR from someone who may understand the reason this would exist and not be depression +  schizoaffective or something and why that distinction would matter?

I am going to try and speak to the doctor and/or my psych again but I just don't have a great relationship with them- no big drama and not me saying ""they're out to get me"" lol but honestly they're just mpre the phoning it in type at a big messy clinic for poor people and that's all I got right now, and I struggle to advocate for myself in real time even if I prepare written questions etc. In my defense a bit again, they know about this problem (we've discussed it specifically and also it matches my other top diagnoses CPTSD and autism Level 2) and never offer me more information beyond basic sentences ""this is your diagnosis, this is your meds now"" etc.

Background: I have definitely experienced multiple episodes of what I guess you'd call acute psychosis, full on delusion/hallucination with a big fancy story to it like I'm a liberating alien goddess and lasting a week or two or less. Aside form that, my life pattern fits BP2 on the more depressive end of the spectrum and with several brief hypomanic periods a year mostly characterized by reckless behavior, megalomania and increased paranoia but no actual delusions. Unless it would be those psychosis episodes, I've never had mania, clearly only hypo. So I don't think I'm misdiagnosed BP1.

Does this make sense or sound familiar to anyone?

I forget about it all the time but along with CPTSD they also said I have DPDR and possibly OSDD (?? lol yeah I know that's a big bomb to drop I jsut don't know anything about it and it was talked about a whole bunch but last I saw my paperwork it wasn't on there idk) and I know I dissociated and maladaptive daydreamed a lot during my child trauma which seems to lean in to the idea of my psychosis not being bipolar- having an external cause/being the result of conditioning if that makes sense but I know the way I'm looking at it may not be right.

I've been taking the same meds and stable to depressive for the last 2 years, I haven't had a psychosis episode for 4 years and that was triggered by a personal tragedy and lasted only 4 days until I was put in inpatient and meds cleared it up quickly. Looking back at how most of my psychosis happened during a period of regular abuse I don't know if I've ever had an epiode that didn't have a direct trigger in my life, they don't just happen. To my understanding that is another distinction from much, although not all, BP1 mania.

So the concept of BP2 with psychosis makes sense for my specific situation, it just doesn't seem to be a credible diagnosis and I'm just confused.

My hypo symptoms don‚Äôt cause any major negative consequences. It drives me crazy, but I‚Äôm not spending money I don‚Äôt have or destroying my relationships.

A little background, for many years now I‚Äôve been dealing with depression and anxiety, found little success on the depression side of things. But after being diagnosed with ADHD I started looking into the condition more and saw a lot about the comorbidity between ADHD and bipolar disorder. And after reading about bipolar 2 and a lot of anecdotal posts/stories on Reddit and other sites, it makes sense to me that I would have it as well, given how many things I can relate to and that my father is schizo affective, it seems likely that I might have it.

My therapist seems hesitant to talk about the condition, I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs doing her due diligence and making sure it‚Äôs not something else first. But I did talk with my DR and he agreed to let me try Abilify both to see if it does something for the depression but also I suppose to appease me because it‚Äôs also used in bipolar treatments and that‚Äôs something I told him I wanted to try, that way I could help to figure out what my problems are and find the right treatment.

All has been going well with it so far, it‚Äôs only been a few weeks. But lately I have been feeling a lot better than normal. Which is what leads me here‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs hard to tell what‚Äôs ADHD and what could be hypomania correct? I don‚Äôt want to jump the gun, but I‚Äôm aware that lower doses of Abilify can trigger hypomania in people. (2-10mg) I‚Äôm taking 5mg daily.

Every so often I will get my lifestyle habits etc in order and quit alcohol, get exercise and dietary changes, it will last for days to weeks and I will start to feel energetic and alive again. The weird thing is i find feeling like this **harder to deal** with, the excess energy, hyper mood and normality becomes too much and then I will start the old habits again go back into my shell where I feel normal.

I have normalised feeling like shit and somewhat feel safe there, its the feeling good and energetic that overwhelms me and I can deal with it. It nearly feels like self sabotage and I always reset and relapse. Also to add, that emotions, trauma and memories become way to hard to deal with when I don't have alcohol to block out.

Imagine my mindset now, and then add horrible pain from my anal cavity , having to soak my ass in warm water 7 times a day, not being able walk or go anywhere, and eating a liquid diet or not eating at all bc bowel movements will be nightmares.
I‚Äôm afraid during this surgery my mental health will reach dark places I‚Äôve never been to before.

Today I got in an argument with my boyfriend. It went on for hours. I truly cannot take it. I‚Äôm already depressed and suicidal, I can‚Äôt handle having a horrible fight with someone I love. We were supposed to have a fun day. We went to my favorite park and it started in the parking lot. We turned around and went home. My dog was so excited for the park. She had to sit there listening to us arguing. She‚Äôs deeply affected by my emotions and energy. She‚Äôs been off all day since then. It breaks my heart.
Another day ruined. I feel like I have been given this gift of life and it‚Äôs wasted on me. Listening to black flag later alone, all I can think of is that I‚Äôm truly damaged.",1677715320.0

Thank God, I‚Äôm finally off the Seroquel. This past year has been one of the most difficult years of my life because of my mental health. I was in two hospitals, and finally had to go to Mayo clinic to get a second opinion. They had some really good advice actually!

Anyway, last hospital visit I was there two weeks until finally. I was on 800 mg of Seroquel and 20 mg of Haldol. I have no idea how I was even awake or walking around but that‚Äôs what it took to make me stable. Of course I started sleeping a ton and I gained a lot of weight. Also lost motivation for things like exercising, reading, etc. 

After being stable for a while, my psychiatrist started cutting back my Seroquel. Finally don‚Äôt feel like eating constantly and I‚Äôm not as tired and lowly motivated. Only on 2 mg of Haldol! Thinking about going back to work part time and starting to exercise again!

Anyway, there is someone who is very significant in my life who doesn‚Äôt understand how hungry Seroquel makes you and how these meds can fuck you up. If you feel comfortable sharing, I would really appreciate you commenting and saying what Seraquel and/or Haldol did to you in terms of making you, hungry, sleepy, and lowly motivated.  Please no advice about how I should cut this person out of my life.  They drove me all the way to Mayo and are there for me in many, many ways. I hope that this post can be about education.

TLDR: a person very important to me does not understand how Seroquel and Haldol made me gain a ton of weight and turn into a zombie for like six months.  Can you please explain how this happened to you too?",1677705734.0

121,My Bipolar Journey So Far,6,11f0dvl,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/11f0dvl/my_bipolar_journey_so_far/,1,"Hey everyone! Thanks in advance to all those who might eventually read this....I just wanted to say thanks to you all! This community seems really supportive of each other, and I'm really grateful for that. Not many spaces like that are left on the internet these days. Anyhow, I wanted to share my story just a little bit and maybe get some extra opinions. I had always knew I had pretty bad social anxiety. Growing up, especially when I was younger( it's gotten progressively worse) I always got extremely nervous around other people. You know the classic symptoms: going to great lengths to avoid social events, making up the same old tired excuses to not attend parties, etc. I couldn't stand large crowds and I always got the idea that others were somehow ""watching"" me when I was out in public..even in places like the grocery store. I always thought they were judging me or silently making fun of me, etc. 

I've been working since I was 15 years old, trying to help provide for my family because we grew up pretty poor. My first job was at a McDonalds as a teen, and I worked there through high school up until I had a falling out with my family, and I moved out and lived with my grandparents. I quit that job, and had a period of time I was unemployed for about 5 months. Got another job at the local dollar store by my grandparents home, and quit there after two weeks. I moved back in with my family, and we reconciled our differences. I got a job at the local Wendy's as a closer for the restaurant. I worked there for a year, and it was at this job that I guess looking back my symptoms sorta started developing. I was chronically late, and I mean super late. Idk why, just I couldn't bring myself to actually be there on time. Some days I just felt too tired to get outta bed to be there at my scheduled time, others I was on top of the world and thought I was too good and didn't care. I would call out of work for weeks at a time even! Just making up excuses so I wouldn't have to go in, etc. Looking back on all this, I'm ashamed really. I quit Wendy's after a year, and got a job as a pharmacy technician. I became convinced over time that my boss was out to get me and wanted me gone. Maybe she did. I was a crappy employee at first. It was extremely hard to concentrate at work, hard to focus, and I felt ""clumsy"" and would forget very basic instructions. Not to mention having to deal with customers and patients and phone calls and stuff triggered my anxiety greatly. After having a blowout argument with my boss, I quit that good paying job at the pharmacy to be a freaking meat cutter at my local grocery store. That lasted about a month, before I landed a job at the local hospital as a switchboard operator. This is where things get interesting....

I began working at the hospital during the very beginning of the COVID pandemic. The stress levels there were unimaginable....I was having to deal with phone calls from ""Karens"", people would call and cuss me out, yell at me, scream at me, etc. I also occasionally had to work the actual service desk in the hospital, and had to confront people who refused to wear a mask and such. I've nearly gotten assaulted over that dozens of times. This all culminated in a panic attack that was so severe I ended up throwing up in the bathroom, and being sent home. I went to the doctor, and they diagnosed me as a having anxiety and gave me lexapro. I've been on it for about three years now. I didn't know I was bipolar at the time, and so apparently lexapro and bipolar disorder definitely don't mix well. At first, lexapro seemed to make me feel okay and definitely helped with my anxiety. Then, about a year and a half or so later, I ended up getting into a huge argument with my boss because I was convinced she'd treated me unfairly. I left in the middle of the night and quit....no notice, nothing. At this same time, I was going thru what I now know as my first major manic episode that I can recall. I quit my job that night because I felt the Holy Spirit told me too...you read that right. During this manic episode, I'd converted to Mormonism and fell into it extremely....like zealously. Before that, I was an atheist hardcore. Ultimately, my fiance helped me get out of the church....and it was like a moment of clarity...I couldn't believe what I'd just done lol. During that time, my whole personality changed....politics and all. I was like a totally different person. After I snapped out of it, I couldn't believe the things I said and did during that time. How strict with the religion I was, how zealous I was, etc. I ended up getting a job at my other local dollar store, before quitting three weeks into it because I needed jaw surgery. After surgery was over, I got a job at a local nursing home as a patient sitter. I lasted two shifts there before I quit. I later tried to get my job back, because I regretted quitting, I got it back, and I worked one more shift before I quit again. I left there to go to McDonalds again. I worked one shift there before I quit there as well!! Now, I've finally landed a really good paying job at my local Walmart and I really don't wanna mess it up. Reading so many other mania stories has finally helped me realize there really is something wrong with me, I'm not lazy, and I need to seek help for this....this does sound like bipolar disorder, doesn't it? I mean it seems I tick every box there is. Thanks for reading this much everyone!",1677666618.0

134,Any other BP people with substance abuse issues feel like they don't fit in at AA? Anyone successfully find moderation with substance possible after getting the bipolar under control?,8,11erlfa,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/11erlfa/any_other_bp_people_with_substance_abuse_issues/,14,"TL:DR read the title of the post, but for background :

I am BPI diagnosed for 15 years ago, stable and out of hospital for 8. In my last manic episode 8 years ago I was drinking heavily and after a stay at the mental hospital I attended a dual diagnosis outpatient rehab program. I really threw myself into it, got into 12 step work in AA etc. I'd had my butt kicked so I decided to do what I was told for once. My life improved dramacally during this time. I found good meds and doctors, got back in shape, moved to a cooler city, changed careers into a cooler career, met and married my wife etc.

But I gradually soured on AA. AA dogma holds that I must believe that before everything I am an alcoholic, my alcoholism comes first. I wanted to be on board, but I couldn't genuinely agree with that conception of reality. The farther I've gone along in my recovery the more I have come to personally believe that the primary issue is bipolar disorder and the substance abuse is secondary and more symptomatic of not having enough good tools to deal with the BP.

Another thing that doesn't really line up for me is the whole idea of needing a ""spiritual experience"" in AA. Genuinely, not being flippant here- I have had spiritual experiences many times, they were usually when I was manic or high on hallucinogens or both. (I still am a spiritual person, but not anywhere nearly as fervent when I'm not manic).

Finally, AA has a weird relationship with psychotropic meds.  It's getting better but there are still a lot of old timers who don't understand how antidepressants or mood stableizers work and will tell you you aren't sober if you're taking pills.  My last AA sponsor told me to pray more when I was depressed.  I ignored him, talked to my psych and got on antidepressants and the depression lifted.  When I look around the rooms at AA I see a lot of people who would really benefit from real therapy and antidepressants.

My attendance at AA faded out gradually until I stopped going.  I am now experimenting with moderation.  Over the past two years I've been using low doses of marijuana on occasion, and every so often I'll have a cocktail and a beer or two at dinner by myself. One or two times I've gone past that amount but hated the hangover a def didn't fall into a pattern or downward spiral. Despite what AA dogma says about if you relapse you will ""pick up where you left off"" and be as bad as you were at your worst in no time, I have as yet had no negative repercussions with this moderate amount of substance use.  

&#x200B;

I have no desire to go on a bender.  I continue to do everything in my treatment plan for BPI and my moods continue to be mild and manageable.

Does anyone else in the bipolar community with substance abuse history relate to feeling a disconnect in 12 step programs and what your personal recovery plan looks like? ",1677637574.0

I honestly don't enjoy any activity mentioned above apart from playing football in my colony ground(which can only be done for 2 hours in a day ).And I believe that if one has something that they really enjoy  the depreession can go away.Which brings me to the main title.When Im about to hit Depression there's nothing I can think of which I enjoy.I used to enjoy video gaming , anime , making memes etc before BP but even though they seem like a small task , it feels like a burden even though I used to enjoy them before BP so I don't see anyway of preventing myself from the Depression bomb that hits me.",1677627607.0

I have a trip planned to visit some friends next month, one of whom has become a romantic interest over the years. Things have gotten more serious hence my trip there. Before I was diagnosed I had a lot of failed relationships and impulsive and toxic behaviors. 5 years later I am still struggling with intimacy but not because of episodes where I'll impulsively dump whoever I'm dating.

My mom (who usually seems to hope things work out for me) said something about why don't I just leave and spend one day with him because it might not work out. She's just assuming I'll ruin this like I have everything else and I'm near tears because it's taken me years to get back to the idea of dating not being an absolute mental health nightmare and I've finally gotten to a point where my self-esteem is not in the gutter as much as it used to be. They keep insinuating that he must be ""up to something'. I just want to reiterate this is someone I have known for a long time. It's really discouraging and it almost makes me want to just cancel everything and give up. A relationship is not everything to me, I've been single for 3 years and have been pretty happy about it and have worked on myself. I just don't see why they need to openly doubt me so much and it's really making me rethink everything and that maybe my self-esteem is a delusion and I'm not interesting and I have nothing to offer.

So I said yes. Though deep inside I didn't really want to. It didn't feel comfortable. I wasn't able to bring up everything I wanted. Part of me feels ashamed about that. In principle I'm for it, but in practice it's uncomfortable.

Anyways, I just sent my doctor 1200 word long email about all the things I wasn't able to bring up and also explaining why I have a distrust about new doctors and take time to be able to open up.

I sent it around 12 am at night after having three beers. I'm not sure if it was a good idea or not. I was completely honest at least.

Sent it to my sister for proofreading first. She's been bugging me about me talking to my doctor lately. She thought it was well written and gets the point across without being overly dramatic. She has a nursing degree and has dealt with worse patients than me, so I trust her judgement.

I‚Äôm only settling for Latuda. I am going into this with the most optimistic mindset I can have, so - I‚Äôm looking for positive experiences & outcomes only! 

My reasoning: 
I did not realize until I got off Seroquel after years, I was living in a fog. I had very little emotion (aside from painful depression), no interests, no color. Sleepwalking.
When I got off it I felt like I was seeing the world for the first time again. Not a day goes by I don‚Äôt appreciate my newfound way of seeing the world‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm terrified of losing that. I don‚Äôt want to go numb again. I just want to not go psychotic every few months haha. 

I hear Latuda is gentle. Not as harsh as other APs. For those it worked for - what‚Äôs it like? Do you feel things just as strongly as you did before?

I'm coming out of a mixed episode and have made plans to visit a friend up north, tacking it on to a trip back home to see my mom and my psychiatrist. I made my travel arrangements with the points I was given when a flight was canceled in Southwest's whole ordeal over the winter holidays. So these plans are not setting me back financially except that I'm staying in a hotel. This is a friend I've known for five years, we talk on the phone a lot and have video called and whatnot. Because we are interested in each other romantically, my parents are ripping me to shreds about ""this is so random why are you doing this right now you need to call your doctor."" They never seem to care about me when I am manic other than to mention how annoying I am. Any time I do ANYTHING fun or for my happiness, they tell me I'm manic. This is not even random, we've had plans to try to link up several times but the timing was never right for me. I am finally ready for a relationship and am thrilled to just go spend time with someone I've been friends with for years, regardless of what happens with us romantically and my family is telling me how I'm going off the rails. 

I get so frustrated with this (it happens often) and my parents refuse to educate themselves. I recently took care of my sister's cats while she drove three hours away (she's chronically ill and is usually unable to drive the 45 minutes to our dad's house, so this was risky for her) to meet a guy she had met previously that week on facebook. Nobody said she was crazy! He ended up standing her up and it was oh poor her we just were excited that she was getting back out there (she's very dependent on always having a partner). It's so unfair that I'm accused of being in a manic episode any time I do something for myself. This happened when I went to visit a college friend too!

Any tips on how to not get so viscerally angry at this would be appreciated. Does anyone else deal with this too? I know it comes from a place of caring but when they refuse to hear me out on my own experiences it does not feel that way.",1677453446.0

It is important no medication changes happen without connecting with a health professional**

But for the sake of discussion I have been thinking about this and experimenting with it a little bit. I have a diagnoses of BP2 and have tried using weed sometimes to help. The problem with me is it seems a lot of medications take away hypomania for me, but generally make me not want to get out of bed. I am from a state where weed is legalized for purchase for 21+. 

I always felt like in my prior experience I would just smoke or ingest any kind of THC and it would be hit or miss; sometimes it seemed like it was the only thing that somewhat helped but other times it felt like it worsened my symptoms. Obviously I understand there are mixed episodes, etc., but I was curious if anyone else has tried tapering specific strains to specific episodes. For example, the main two strains of weed are sativa and indica. For manic and depressive episodes, one would think that it might work to use these as sativa is uplifting (for depressive episodes) and indica is more sedating (for manic episodes). I haven‚Äôt tried this for a super extended amount of time, but there are times where sativa is the only thing to get me out of bed and actually doing chores, etc. 

Is this an idea any of you have thought about or put into action? I am curious as to what your opinions are on this because the reaction I have received from health professionals have been very mixed; some have told me that if smoking weed works for me to keep doing it, some have told me its a drug which makes me an addict in addition to my other diagnoses.

treating ADD can improve the PMS supposedly and possibly my bipolar too? so it's possible my behaviour/mood is dependent on my hormonal fluctuations. [recent bloods confirm i am healthy no concerns.


I cross referenced my period tracker against my calendar of activities and mood tracking. I fit the pattern pretty much perfectly.

Again, I know that I'm the one having the issue. I've tried some earplugs, sleeping with white noise via earbuds, tiring myself out before bed. Because he doesn't deserve to be blamed for something he can't control.

Then, something changed. I did something that changed the course of my bipolar illness. 

Mindfulness-based Dialectical Behavioral Therapy. 

I fought the idea of Mindfulness for the longest time. Especially since the word was weaponized against me by doctors when I was struggling with Tardive Dyskinesia. I was told I was a ""walking ambulance"" and that I was 'a bull in a china closet' and needed to work on Mindfulness. 

Finally, I found a Trauma program and the curriculum was Marsha Linehan's Dialectical Behavioral Therapy. I go to a University that offers it on a sliding scale, the only downside is that my therapists are students and graduate every one to two years. But at 8 bucks a week, the price is right and I've been in it for seven years. 

What I notice is when death thoughts come up, instead of catastrophizing that it's another depression phase that's going to last a year or more, I tell myself that ""I'm feeling depressed today"" and I do things to make myself feel better, like exercise, music, and also am allowed by my doctor to take an extra one of my fast acting antidepressants. I don't know if I'm allowed to mention the name of an antidepressant, but it's a new one, it's a new type of SSRI and though expensive, for me, it acts quickly.

This ""Short"" explains how I now manage what I call the ""symptoms"" of bipolar-related depression. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CLbtgyopSo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CLbtgyopSo)",1677347973.0

Hellooo fellow bipolar Reddit users 

I am 20 years old and recently started taking medication again for the first time in 2 years, I‚Äôm bp2. I spent the majority of my mid to late adolescence in treatment centers so I‚Äôve taken like every anti depressant anti psychotic ssri you could think of. When I turned 18 and finally had autonomy over my body, I stopped meds. 

Obviously that didn‚Äôt work so after two years of that I reached out to one of my old doctors and he prescribed me latuda since it‚Äôs newer and something I haven‚Äôt taken before. I‚Äôve been taking it on and off for a few months. I finally got on a 3 week streak of taking it!! But here is where my issue and question come in. 
 
I‚Äôve been diagnosed with anorexia since I was 14. Although it‚Äôs better now I‚Äôm still not perfect. About 80% of my stomach is completely wrecked from that and some medicine I got prescribed for pneumonia when I was a kid. Taking pills in general is really harsh on my stomach. I struggle with acid reflex and throwing up because of my weak stomach. 

Usually I eat one full meal at the end of the day, then take my latuda. Two days ago I fell asleep early and woke up early. I didn‚Äôt eat the previous day and was having acid reflex so I made 5 vegan nuggies and took my latuda. 

Holy shit did I yak up a storm. It was one of those ones Where you literally can taste the pill coming up every time you heave. Ever since that I have been incredibly nauseous, dehydrated , having cold&hot flashes and headaches. Every time I‚Äôve eaten since (I‚Äôve made effort to eat greens proteins as well as chug pedialyte) I‚Äôve had to sit and do deep breathing for like 20 min to keep my food down which isn‚Äôt normal for me. 

I haven‚Äôt taken my latuda since so I‚Äôm not sure if these are withdrawals or sickness from throwing it up. Any advice about latuda or anything I mentioned would be greatly appreciated!! Thank you in advance my bipolar warriors üòé <3",1677357376.0

lamictals been working really well for hypomanic episodes and for the depressive episodes for the most part but there‚Äôd be some breakthrough depressive symptoms but nothing that couldn‚Äôt be managed tbh. i think i might have to change meds completely tho which SUCKS because i love lamictal. i really need something to help with both hypomanic and depressive episodes and SSRI‚Äôs have never helped so i can‚Äôt go down that route. 

anyone have any ideas of good meds? i‚Äôve read so many good things about lithium but i don‚Äôt have insurance to go do regular blood tests but i was interested in bringing it up to my psych in a couple of weeks. i don‚Äôt want to take more than 2 meds and would love to just take one if possible.

I had just celebrated two years of sobriety so the drug cravings have been pretty bad, been struggling for money just to pay rent, and the weather has been dragging my mood down like crazy.

I woke up one morning feeling good. I had therapy, but didn‚Äôt have much to talk about. I stayed in a good mood for three days. The next morning, my emotions were gone. My chest was light with nothing and my mind was swirling with racing thoughts.

-‚ÄúI should restart life again. Get rid of these friends since they mean nothing to me.‚Äù
-‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt be in a relationship. I‚Äôm not cut out for them anyway.‚Äù
-‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to sell everything and disappear to Japan with my cat.‚Äù
-‚ÄúWho cares about college? I‚Äôm going to start my business like I‚Äôve been wanting to for years.‚Äù

I broke my fianc√©‚Äôs heart with a singular sentence. I pushed her away, rolled my eyes, and got really annoyed when she started getting emotional. Emotionless and cold is what she called me then she contacted my therapist to ask for help.

Turns out I was having an episode and I didn‚Äôt even know it. I became aware of what I was doing and why my brain was doing such awful things. I don‚Äôt want to lose my fianc√©. She keeps me afloat and always has the most patience and understanding with my bipolar. We talked and I apologized and said I would get better. I managed to bring myself down and told her to set boundaries with me when I start getting irrational and manic.

I have caused so much tears and emotional turmoil. I felt like utter trash after coming down and realizing WHAT i was doing to her. My hypomanic episodes cause so my destruction. I‚Äôm not happy. I don‚Äôt have emotions and I never want to say such hurtful things to her again. She means everything to me and I would hate to lose her because of this dumb disorder.

I don‚Äôt get the god complex or physical impulsivity or the pure eurphoria. I get irritable, irrational, mean, heartless, and I go way too fast.

I just don‚Äôt want to hurt the love of my life again in such an episode. She doesn‚Äôt deserve it. I‚Äôm currently in a depressive episode over my actions and all I feel is guilt. I have been showing her I‚Äôm trying to work it out and she has noticed some good progress.

Things that I used to enjoy such as listening to music, hanging out with friends and family, playing video games, exercising, etc. don't bring me any pleasure anymore, and I've lost the motivation to do these activities. I don't even feel pleasure from simple things such as warm showers, eating food, or sleeping. I find it extremely difficult to pass time throughout the day due to me not being able to enjoy anything I try to do, and time seems to move relatively slowly for me because of this.

I've been on quite a bunch of different medications (antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, antidepressants, sleep aids) since being diagnosed with bipolar I at the beginning of 2022 with all of them being unsuccessful so far. I am currently on Vraylar 1.5mg, Effexor XR 75mg, and Valium 10mg (for sleep).

I was wondering if anyone else experiences something similar, and I'm curious to know what others do to cope with this.

EDIT:  

Thank you to everyone who has taken time to respond to my post. I appreciate you all for giving me more hope and motivation to continue trucking on this journey to recovery.

I forgot to mention that despite being unable to experience pleasure from things that I used to enjoy, I don't let the anhedonia stop me from trying things again. I still make an effort to do my old hobbies and spend time with loved ones. At times it does seem a little hopeless or even pointless to even continue, but I believe that healing is a process and that there is hope at the end of the tunnel. Despite the many setbacks I've faced in changes in psychiatrists, therapists, or medications, I haven't lost hope that one day I'll be able to enjoy life again.

Since I can remember I have extreme mood swings , mostly depression , paranoia , delusional thinking and anxiety and in stressful situations It can be possible that I dissociate and be depressed for long time. 

I‚Äôm in therapy and now I finally found a good one ! 
I‚Äôm 24 female and have these symptoms since I was 13 or 14. 

My question is : how long did it take your therapist to get you diagnosed ? And is it possible that it also might be BPD ? 
But I really want to be alone when depressed most of the time so I guess that wouldn‚Äôt fit for a Borderline Diagnosis? 

And another thing is : Does weather also influence your mood and what kind of medication is needed / help for delusional periods? Should I ask my therapist bc she doesn‚Äôt know how severe my paranoid thoughts can be.

Thanks for helping",1677332721.0

I have no idea what to do besides send my psych provider a message and I‚Äôm concerned. 

Before I was diagnosed I was just labeled as being impulsive, moody, irritable, touchy, flighty‚Ä¶you know the usual descriptors.

Once I was diagnosed I could see the patterns looking back and it was pretty obvious. About a year after diagnosis I went into a severe manic episode. Had to drop out of school kind of episode. I wasn‚Äôt able to identify it as one until I was out of it and did a lot of damage during that time. 

Lately, I‚Äôve had to work with my provider on making changes to my meds because of some serious side effects. I haven‚Äôt had a really bad manic episode for a bit but now I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at/just starting. 

I‚Äôve been decreasing my depakote for awhile. Essentially I‚Äôm just on lamictal now and seroquel. Full honesty, I kind of suck at taking the seroquel because it makes me really groggy the next day plus the whole eating everything in the house at 3am problem. The plan is to transition to a different med to replace the seroquel after I‚Äôm off the depakote. I was warned to watch for any mania. For awhile it was ok, no big ups/downs. Then this past few weeks things have been going downhill (or uphill?) and I don‚Äôt like it. 

The impulsive urges are harder to stop. I‚Äôm extremely defensive/irritable when I usually wouldn‚Äôt be. I was convinced I was going to write & self publish a very successful children‚Äôs book. Im still talking myself down from that one, but I‚Äôve got a list of great ideas a mile long. I‚Äôm super anxious and pushing the line on being paranoid. 

I am trying really, really, really hard to fight it but it‚Äôs exhausting.

My department moved locations back in November. I was at the office this morning - I'm usually not there as I work at multiple locations during the day, so I don't know everyone in the building very well. We had professional development scheduled today so I headed to the office this morning. We use the copier of another department housed across the hall, so I went over there to make some copies. There are only two people in that office, one is super nice and friendly and the other can be kind of an entitled bitch. 

When I got over there, the friendly one was there but the other one was not. I started chatting with her a bit, and the topic of the other lady came up. I asked if she knew about an email she had sent my team where she was accusing us of taking the forks and spoons from the kitchen area and not returning them. We had a little laugh about it, and the friendly one said it's hard working with her because her moods are unpredictable. she then said ""I mean, bipolar is probably the better word for it, she's nice one day and irritable the next."" And she had a good laugh.

I was kind of taken aback, to the point I couldn't really react. I wanted to say something like, bipolar isn't a word you should just throw around like that, it's a real illness with real implications. But I didn't.

I can delete this later if its not. 100 mg lamictal a day. This illness runs in my family on my father's side for several generations. I only found out this vital genetic information /after/ having children and digging deeper into it. My great grandmother died in a gutter because of this illness. She had been officially diagnosed and treated, for what its worth. In and out of state facilities. One of her children inherited it, then passed it onto my father, who passed it onto me.

I am an adult, and the expectation is that an adult should have greater self control than children. Right? I try my best to teach my 3 year old how to manage her emotions, like labeling them, taking a moment to breathe, and talking about it when we're done being emotional about it. All the coping skills I learned, in therapy, I try to teach her. She's 3 and sometimes she manages herself better than I do myself. She's going to leave me in the dust in the next decade and I'll still be... bipolar.

I try as hard as I can to manage what's going on inside my mind but it feels like its not enough, and I'll never get to my end goal, which is I guess an unrealistic vision of being 'cured' and not having to constantly fight my own thoughts and then, when I fumble, not be devastatingly embarrassed and ashamed of myself. Why? I had a little outburst last night in front of my partner and I wish I could take it back. I still have that annoying nagging feeling like telling myself ""that's not a proper way to behave!"" Why is it that I can see it happening like a third person, but I can't always stop myself? Why am I still paranoid that I'm driving my partner away and this will all end in divorce? Years and years of assurance that it won't happen, that they accept my diagnosis and they'll stick this through with me, and I still don't believe it? And then, when I don't believe it, I instantly feel like I'm hurting them with my distrust? wouldn't you be hurt, too, if several years of love still keeps getting questioned?

I am an adult, I have 2 kids, a homestead and livestock, a job and a degree I've been /slowly/ trying to finish, I can't keep behaving this way. But I still do. And I am so angry at myself. So angry that I have dark thoughts about self harm today. That I know are completely ridiculously unreasonably inappropriate and I should not do that. Somehow being able to label what I'm feeling makes me feel worse, because now I'm more aware of how ridiculous I'm being. ""I don't have time to be feeling this or fighting this. Spring is coming and I have so much work to do to prepare for and then go through the growing season, and I'm several weeks behind on my coursework."" That's what I tell myself to try to snap myself back to reality. It never works.

As I've gotten older I've noticed little moments of hallucinations just out of the corner of my eye, more lately than when I was in high school. I think back then I almost never had anything like that happening. Maybe just once or twice, fleeting. Nowadays its a weekly thing. Noises, like the kids crying and wailing after they've gone to bed, or visuals, like 'shadow people' at the top of the stairs or in my workplace as someone walking past. Yesterday I swore I saw a kid in a jacket run past the living room window. My partner went outside in the snow to check, and told me it must've been a turkey or some other animal. Last week I dropped a tool on another mechanics foot because I thought something stared back at me from behind some barrels. Good thing they were wearing steel toe. Is increased hallucinations a side effect from lamictal? My doctor doesn't think so, but I can't help but feel its more than a coincidence. I feel like a paranoid tin-foil-hat kind of person more often now.

6 months ago I re-started treatment after yet another suicide attempt and instant regret about how a parent should never behave that way. I wanted to take as little medication as I can get away with (less medicine=less side effects?). I don't want to be on multiple things and/or high dosages. I barely want to have to be on anything at all. But my love for our children and my spouse trumps that last sentence. Should I ask for a higher dose? Should I take the doctors offer on adding an anxiety medication? At the last appointment the doctor mentioned that the hallucinations might be anxiety based, since a lot of it involves worrying about the kids safety or the presence of strangers (I am not a people person). besides that, I am constantly terrified of how my behavior affects my family.  I had this conversation with my spouse last week. They said they're happy with how the medication has helped, that it has made a difference (I don't think so, I still feel like a terrible spouse and parent), and that they don't need me to take a higher dose. Like the joke about the woman at the 'husband store' asking for better, and better, and better, until in the end you lose the entire thing and can't go back. That was their analogy.

There is one bright spot to this post. Rabbits have a surprisingly good grasp on reality. I knew dogs could sometimes tell and be helpful, but I never thought a rabbit could. My daughter's rabbit picked me as his person. He reliably and consistently wakes me up from nightmares, and tries to get my attention when I'm hallucinating or having an outburst or cowering in another room with terrible thoughts. Whether he climbs my leg or jumps in my lap or licks my face or brings me some of his hay. In return I spoil him by keeping stock of every single kind of hay available for purchase and having a hay rack at each litter box in every room with said hay varieties, and every flower, herb, veggie, or fruit a rabbit could ever want, and chew toys in every room in weird locations as 'hide and seek' games for him to enjoy while I'm at work. How the hell can a tiny, domesticated pet rabbit tell when a human is having a nightmare or suicidal thoughts or seeing things that aren't there?

The rabbit interrupted me this morning from harming myself, so I included a piece of thawed mango in his lunch salad. 

&#x200B;

TLDR; still haven't fully accepted this illness being permanent and mostly out of my control. Still wish I had something curable. Still feel immense shame about the thoughts and behaviors I can't control. Might harm myself out of shame. Then also feel ashamed about that too. Thanks for reading.

I *plan* on using THE VIRTUAL BRAIN, and similar neurocomputational software to help me study what I plan on studying.

Well, I have to first get hardware( a computer/laptop that isn't slow) capable of importing data from said super computer, and running TVB on its servers.

I also have to gather some relevant patient MRI/ EEG  data, and lastly, I have to learn to effectively use TVB, and generate computational models.


This is a HUGE opportunity, and an even bigger one for a 19 year old layman(for the most part, but I'm a neuro nerd for sure).

Well, I also have college coming up in a few months.

So I have to learn all this stuff before college starts.


I also just started dating someone again.

So it's about 6 day of Cymbalta 30 mg. I was scared about nausea/GI issues, but thankfully I hadn't it yet. But I have heavy mood swings. 3 days ago I've been talking with my teacher and started to cry in front of him. 2 days ago I've fallen in full blown hysterics: I've been crying very hard, blaming myself and had self harm thoughts. I feel irritated too.
Idk if it's normal and I shall endure it?
Any experiences with Cymbalta?",1677259910.0

I do have 1-2 weeks at a time (usually around PMS) where I can't sleep, wake up with anxiety, extremely depressed, pessimistic, have lots of fun, am socially confident and energetic but with a short fuse and snap at my kids and husband a LOT. Sometimes I am lucky to get the confidence and energy - usually from caffeine or Adderall, sometimes without it. Sometimes it's just a spiraling depression and no ""boost"" in mood, but always agitation/irritability.

I'm typically pretty reserved but I do occasionally get very confident and drop my socially anxious ""mask"". 
For example, I introduced myself to a group chat of strangers that I'm hoping to meet up with soon by telling a self deprecating joke. Normally I'd never actually tell a joke unless feeling an extra boost of confidence and optimism in life. Is this a form of hypomania? 

Does hypomania include a mix of the following?:

-racing thoughts
-ruminating and anxiety filled thoughts -insomnia (although still very tired)

as expected, my sleep got worse but i started being able to function again. a few days ago, i actually quit the lithium as i was starting to plan my suicide and the adderall clearly hadn't helped with the suicidality at all. so back to the drawing board on fixing the depression issue. my psych said i could try the adderall alone to see what it does, with the stipulation that i quit immediately or resume the lithium if it starts making me manic. i figured it was worth at least seeing how it worked without the lithium so i'd have an idea of it for future med combos. 

and i immediately started getting 8+ hours of sleep a night again. which seems to suggest it was either something about the combo, or about the \*lithium\* that was making me lose sleep. obviously i am still mood tracking, but the whole situation seems very odd. the two meds seem to be interacting with me in ways they really should not. adderall is helping me feel more relaxed and get more sleep, where lithium made me more suicidal and restless. i've had lithium before in the past--it always makes me violently suicidal, which people have told me is the opposite of what it should be doing. and now i get adderall making me sleep more, which again seems like the opposite of what should be happening. i discontinued lithium and went from 5-6 hours of sleep per night to wanting to sleep for 10 hours like. IMMEDIATELY. with just adderall.

i can't possibly have \*only\* ADHD, since i've had psychosis in the past both in reaction to antidepressants and independently of them. my mania tracks too well with symptoms of mania to be a mistaken symptom. but now i'm wondering if a comorbidity of ADHD could mean that meds are reacting very oddly with me. i am overall med-sensitive, as well, but i would figure that would make meds react too strongly, rather than the opposite action of what they're supposed to do.

so i'm kind of at a loss. i'm going to give the adderall a few more days to see if it's just a fluke, or if i'm resting better bc the suicidal urges have gone, but i'll be definitely reaching out to talk to my psych about this because we both expected that discontinuing the lithium would mean having to quit the adderall due to stimulant-induced mania. this seems really weird.

It‚Äôs never trusting yourself, or your thoughts. 

It‚Äôs losing the trust of the people you care about most in the world.

I'm diagnosed Bp 1 w/ psychotic fx, but the mania and psychosis hasn't been a problem at all for years, save for one brief mixed episode due to med adjustments. I've just been stuck in this depressive pit that doesn't cease for what seems like two years now, no remission of symptoms or breaks in between, it's like I'm just constantly depressed without any more cycling. I do nothing but cry in bed all day unable to do anything, and I've had three very serious attempts in the past year and a half. Dunno how tf I'm supposed to consistently engage in therapy when I can barely manage to eat every day or not cry, it seems I just wake up wanting to die without any situations/circumstances or irrational cognitions that I need to correct, like it just seems so chemical.

The only time I've had stability since diagnosis was on Symbyax, which lasted about a year, but I couldn't believe how magical it felt to finally be myself again. But it suddenly pooped out and I went straight back to the depression without any warning, and re-introducing it two future times to 15mg/80mg did nothing.  Lamictal 300mg didn't help, Seroquel XR 400mg didn't help, Vraylar 4.5mg didn't help and gave me horrible akathisia, Lithium fucked my thyroid and gave me horrible acne which worsened my BDD, and Latuda 40mg actually seemed to help but the akathisia+sense of panic it gave me at night was so horrible I couldn't whiteknuckle through it anymore (I gave it about a month but I was banging my head and running around screaming). 20mg had tolerable akathisia but absolutely no effect on me. And Caplyta is $900 for 15 days with Medicaid. I just feel absolutely fucked. But ofc there's a million fucking anti-manic meds produced, and while the Depakote keeps that in check for me how tf is it that a condition where the majority of patients spend more time depressed than manic only have like 5 bipolar depression meds developed? Are we merely an inconvenience, a rabid genetic deformity that needs to be put down with anti-manics to keep us from getting too high to cause trouble for the normal ppl? Meanwhile if we wanna kill ourselves we can go fuck right off, it's our problem?

I'm thinking of retrying some of my old shit and just whiteknuckling through side effects (even the Lithium acne if I can get my OCD/BDD in check through ERP therapy), but if that doesn't work it seems all I got left is going back to ECT, or trying TMS and esketamine.

I'm a young adult from the Philippines (cannot disclose my city to protect my privacy) who has been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder Type 1 a decade ago. I get injected with Abilify maintena once a month, and I see my psychiatrist and psychologist monthly or as needed. I'm fortunate enough to have a fantastic support system-- great, genuine friends and understanding family members. However, my problem is that I cannot seem to hold a job for longer than 8 months.


For context, I graduated from college 5 years ago but did not start seeking work until after 2020. My parents run several businesses (Cannot disclose the natures of business since I want to stay private/anonymous) however, their lines of business are not within my interests, hence I have been seeking for work externally, beyond what my parents are willing to offer me. 

I have started a small side-business of my own (cannot disclose to protect my privacy) however, the income that I earn from it is not enough. To make things clear, my parents are still supporting me but I want to learn how to be independent as they won't be around forever.

I have never been fired, but I wasn't regularized by my first two employers and the reasons they gave to me were that I couldn't match up to their expectations for the job.

I am now with my third employer and I have recently been regularized but I was told by my supervisor that I should improve my performance or they would lay me off if they do not see an improvement within 2 months.

To clarify things, I always do the best I can in every job that I undertake and I feel frustrated about myself because no matter what I do, my best doesn't seem to be good enough for any of my employers. Is there something wrong with me?

I know that I can always accept work offers from my parents at their companies as a fallback or last-resort, and I recognize the privilege I possess to have a safety net, but before doing that, I want to exhaust all that I can and find a job that I could stick to.

I don't know how i managed to function or do anything at all like that. I don't know how to be responsible. I was so responsible before. I did things so well. I don't understand. How am i not supposed to throw it all away? It's taking everything not to be impulsive. 

I want to drop out. Even though my choice of field is a very rational and good choice that will help me down the road, i still want to throw it all away. It's just three years, and I'll have something to fall back on. Something that'll give me flexibility and an income. Yet I can't bring myself to care. I don't know how I'm supposed to get through it.

This happens 2-3 times per year for 3-6 weeks. Sometimes more, but that‚Äôs only if there are external stressors. Unfortunately I can‚Äôt work a job because I wind up in this state.

I don't want to be on either of them. I take them intermittently because the side effects of lamotrigine fuck me up (stutter is back!). My dose is also very small - 25mg, meant to be twice a day but I forget so tend to just take it once.  I never tapered up, as I moved doctors and then they just seemingly never gave me the right information. When I asked about it, I got told to keep doing what I was doing. I said I was on a very low dose and they just ignored it. I also went off the sertraline because I grind my teeth on it and my dentist said I need to stop doing it, plus I am not depressed.

I'm effectively unmedicated. Thing is, my doctor doesn't know about this because well, I can't tell them. I don't have a psychiatrist and I only see a GP once a year who weighs me, tells me to lose a stone, and tells me to cope with side effects. Not seen a psychiatrist since 2017 (not for want of trying). I had a medication review and I said I hated the side effects but was told to just deal with it, which wasn't useful. I would like to discuss this with a doctor but it's very hard to get appointments.

I suppose: how can I tell my GP I'm unmedicated? They don't seem to actually care about my health. I know I can taper myself up on lamotrigine slowly and carefully, but I don't want to (lol) because I hate it so much. I cannot think of words. I stutter. My brain is slow. I feel stupid and stulted.

Wondering if I even need medication at all? I've been doing this for about 3 years and only had one hypomanic episode and it was fine once I took some of my old quetiapine. I haven't been on quetiapine for about 5 years but I hung onto it to take it PRN if my mood lurches. I know this isn't sensible, really. But the doctors won't listen to me. I am trying.

Edit: I tried to make the point to them, that even my FULL prescribed dose is not therapeutic, and they said ‚Äúthe prescribing doctor told you what to do‚Äù. I said well, I was manic, and that was several years ago, so can it be reassessed? Because I obviously never titrated up to a therapeutic dose! And now I don‚Äôt know how to. 

And they said no lol

I found out 3 years in too that lamotrigine can make the contraceptive pill less effective and nobody told me. Luckily I didn‚Äôt get pregnant but only found out when a pharmacist asked me if I was aware of the side effect! And no I was not!",1676983120.0

Yet the moment so-called healthy people are facing legal troubles all of a sudden they have Bipolar 1 or 2 and need care.

I am so fed up with society raiding the mental health services for terms and resources when they want them, to be misused and misinterpreted to win an argument or worse snidely using"" You need therapy!""  as a trump card or misdirection, while those of us living with them are always scrambling for insurance and the right care!

I've been dealing with Bi-polar disorder since I was a teenager, and I am perpetually angry over how terms and skills specifically designed for treatment and therapy for mental health  are taken out of context by others to win arguments!

This is why no one is willing  to Go To Therapy, not to heal themselves, or save a relationship or face trauma because society has wrenched therapy from its actual tenants and purpose.

What Therapy is Not:

A place to win arguments.

A system designed for you to abuse or misuse another person for being mentally ill.

Using a persons' health issue as a stepping stone.

People will not engage in therapy with another person if they believe they will not get a fair evaluation or honest feedback.

Also, no ethical therapist can evaluate and diagnosis  any person with a medical disorder or condition If They Have Never  Ever Met, the person and treated them professionally either in private practice or group therapy or know them personally.

&#x200B;

If you've read books and studies or articles on mental illness it does not mean you are now qualified to diagnosis other people with medical skill and acuity even if you are convinced  someone else has a disorder, because of how they act,  that does not mean they have it.

We aren't going to do anything about it, as it's just a feeling we have and nothing to actually go on, plus he wants to apply next time around.

My heart races all the time and I wake up at three am every day. I only am able to get to sleep cause of melatonin and cbd. I quit weed because it was giving me panic attacks.

395,Fitness and weight loss through video games. Plus reviews,1,117i193,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/117i193/fitness_and_weight_loss_through_video_games_plus/,2,"I'm back playing my video games to lose weight. I managed to lose it all before but I gained it all back and more. Its so hard with the meds, depression and so much junk food around with the holidays.

Anyway I'm back using Ringfit Adventure and Knockout Home Fitness on switch to lose the weight and get fitter, along with dieting of course.

Video games are the only way I can exercise because they're really engaging and give you much more motivation than if you're trying to do it all by yourself and cant afford a gym membership. I found I lost a lot of weight and really got in shape the first time round when I stuck with it for a good few months

I'll do a quick review of each in case anyone else is interested and I find these games to be great motivators for weight loss

Ringfit Adventure (Nintendo Switch): This is my number one favourite ever, it includes a leg strap and a resistance ring thing (idk what they're called) that you will use for a lot of the workouts. Its very accessible, it takes your weight and age into account and recommends a difficulty for you and you can set it to easier or harder with a very large range of difficulty from 1-28 I believe and it has assistance modes for if you have trouble with your joints and a silent running mode which is also useful for some people with difficulties. It covers all aspects of fitness from aerobic, balance, muscle training etc. It can be a really tough workout or you can set it to be a nice workout. My mom, husband and myself all play it and think its really great. Also forgot to mention the gameplay is like playing and rpg but using your body and exercise to beat the monsters. 




Knockout Home Fitness (Switch) : I really like this one, you have a personal trainer that gives you a different routine daily and then there's the 3 minute workouts. It's a mix of boxing, kickboxing and fighting workouts but of course you are hitting and kicking the air. I find it to be fun and it's like a nice quick session you can do daily. The trainer is very motivating and positive unlike other fitness games (which I will mention next). For this game though you really need coordination with your body and to be able to keep up and follow the actions which I find to be really hard sometimes with my brain and I have difficulty in general with direction and order of things and choreography type things but I still try to do it and get a workout done. I like it but I can see people getting frustrated with it if they have difficulty keeping up with it but the motivational and positive trainer does help. I think it's great as a quick workout since so far the personal training sessions I've had on it have been 12 minutes long and burning approximately 70 calories which isn't that bad at all and paired with some 3 minute workouts is really great 


Fitness boxing 2 (switch): I believe this is made by the same people that made knockout home fitness but the vibe is different. I only played the demo for it but I didn't like it at all. I didn't like it even though it is almost the same as knockout home fitness because I swear the feedback is so negative when you are struggling when knockout is so positive and encouraging. It really shows how a negative vs positive feedback effects your motivation, just like how we use positive reinforcement with children and animals. It has a demo so that's good if anyone would like to try it


Beatsaber (meta quest, PlayStation vr, pc, etc):  I thought I'd throw this one in as a little mention since I have tried it for moving my body and getting fit. I find it's really good for getting your body moving if you move your whole body while playing and dancing to the music and not mostly flicking your wrist. If you want a bit of workout from it you'd want to play on expert difficulty. Anyway I think it's a good game to get your body moving especially if you might be a bit out of shape and own a vr device. I still have yet to try any of the fitness games on vr since a lot of them require a subscription and I don't like the amount of heat the headset puts on my face and the weight of it.

Well that's my review, I hope it helps people. I will try more like just dance and I'll see what else I can try. If you mention a game on switch I could try it and review it next time since I have access to a lot of switch games. The next one I'm going to try is Let's get Fit on switch",1676921264.0

I am looking to get an assessment soon for what I‚Äôm sure is Bipolar disorder. I am curious of what others went through that made them realize they are bipolar.

some back story, I (20f) have just celebrated sobriety for a year on November 17th. I had to quit because I went through what I feel was a manic-psychotic episode. I was hallucinating, hyper sexual, had persecutory delusions. Leading up to this I went through a breakup. I have not been diagnosed but looking back on my behaviour from age 17-18 I suspect something was wrong. I feel as though I had these episodes more than once. I also have major depression. In my last year of high school I would sleep at school for days and just not move this would last for a few months. 

~At one point I wanted to start an only fans and do porn/become hyper sexual (I am self admittedly a prude and this is out of character for how I feel about sec)
~constantly breakup with my ex-boyfriend and have explosive episodes of anger at him. 
~become paranoid and thought friends were plotting against me
~hallucinated
~I thought I was just the most gorgeous thing and took all these photos- looking back the photos are literally just normal photos I don‚Äôt look as good as I felt. 
~at one point thought my dad did something horrible to me (he did not)
~convinced myself I was a sociopath and that my friends would find out and leave
~had tones of spiritual based delusions and thought I was psychic and just knew things.

During those 3 years I was addicted to pot, I also can report every-time I did psychedelics I went into some psychotic mania, I thought I knew the answers to the universe and would just get super weird. After not smoking and getting on meds I have been stable (for the year).

I have a great half-time job that I've been at 1.5 years. When I first started, my boss wanted to pay me under the table for the first three months to make sure I was a good fit before adding me to payroll. However, I barely survive living paycheck to paycheck and that extra $100-$200 in taxes is actually needed to make sure my bills are paid so I have asked him to keep me under the table and he has no problem with that. He sends me some kind of legal form each year that I'm supposed to use once I file my taxes.

Anyway - there is a medical/dental/behavioral clinic and pharmacy here that goes on a sliding scale for patients with no health insurance. I just started using them about 5 months ago and I have been telling them I'm unemployed so I can be on the sliding scale where my 6 monthly medications are around $70 instead of $300 and doctor appointments are only $25. I know this is not right and I always feel really bad about it and I've been thinking about showing them the document my boss sends me each year to prove my wages but I'm so scared I won't be able to afford my medications or counseling appointments.

Here's my pickle: The main thing I want/need counseling/therapy for is my fucking boss (yes it's an online company and I work from home and have never met him but holy fuck lol).

Ever since then I have been on vyvanse 20-40mg, the lowest dosage of Zoloft 25mg (higher dose makes me manic) and lithium starting at 900 now up to 1500 (main reason for increasing on this one was anxiety idk if anyone else had that). 

Since this all happened so young for me (started on meds when I was 14-15) I don‚Äôt really no what natural me feels like. I have always struggled with addiction and adhd tho while being on medicine regardless of what it is. 

As of a week ago I‚Äôm now weaning off lithium slowly and getting put on to lamictal. I‚Äôm extremely nervous to start a new medication as I didn‚Äôt have any issues with lithium besides minor dry mouth, sunburn rash in the summer, and we think it raised my iron levels but nothing to concerned of. I‚Äôve been on medication before like risperdol, lexapro, and latuda (there‚Äôs other im not mentioning) and I felt like I was crazy on them. I felt all over the place. 

My biggest issue right now is constant anxiety in regards to a fear I have (emetophibia fear of throwing up. Basically I feel I need to be in control of my body) I take klonopin to help with that and my adhd. Which has been hard because my adhd meds now give me anxiety and I‚Äôve tried lowering them.

Hi! I suspect I might have atypical bipolar although I've been diagnosed with GAD, panic disorder and agitated depression. My psychiatrist seems to think that I don't meet the criteria of true hypomania because I'm ""self-aware"" when these episodes happen.

What I experience (usually triggered by stress or overstimulation):

- Extreme anxiety with panic attacks 
- High energy with constant adrenaline 
- High productivity
- Insomnia
- Racing thoughts 
- Feelings of distress and like I'm ""losing it""
- Burning sensations in my skin (arms, legs and back)
- Metallic taste in my mouth


When this happens, I know it's not ""normal"" to feel this way; I absolutely hate it and I'm desperate for sleep (so I rely on benzodiazepines and sleeping tablets until it resolves). I don't feel a decreased _desire_ for sleep, but my body really fights to keep me awake. If these episodes last longer than two weeks, I completely unravel into a crying mess. I've had to take time off work many times over the last few years because of these ""burnouts"".

I have also experienced the ""euphoric"" version of this before (but less commonly). Same symptoms as above except (initially) with excitement, pressured speech and mild grandiosity (saying things like ""I'm solving all of my company's problems!""), but this always devolves into the dysphoric and depressed version eventually.  

I've been struggling with this for 8 years, swinging between agitated depression as my baseline with these ""burnouts"" in between (minimum once a year; maximum four times a year, depending on stress levels).

I've been taking the maximum dosage of Sertraline (SSRI) for about eight months, and while it's helped a lot with the depression aspect, the above episodes still happen to me. When I started taking it, I had an extreme episode lasting about five weeks until the medication settled (I survived on clonazepam to get me through).

My question is: Do any of you relate to what I've described above (as potential dysphoric hypomania)? And were you misdiagnosed with things like GAD before the atypical bipolar was identified?

I just feel like there's more to this than meets the eye.",1676745957.0

There were quite a few people who were seemingly screaming a whole bunch of things that did not make sense, were verbally and physically aggressive, and the way they were slurring when each of them came in made me to believe they were possibly on drugs which probably enhanced their psychosis. I made a post recently about my experiences and although I went in thinking I was dying, I got the help I needed, and actually left with a whole new perspective. I used the word ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù in quote marks because honestly I did not have any other word to describe the things I saw. Looking back now I guess I could have used ‚Äúpsychotic break‚Äù but as someone with BD, Panic Disorder, adhd, etc etc, I honestly don‚Äôt mind the word crazy if it is accurately describing someone‚Äôs behavior. Is this wrong, am I being overly insensitive as someone tried to point out although it wasn‚Äôt my intention? Lmk, googles literal definition of crazy is ‚Äúmentally deranged, especially as manifested in a wild or aggressive way‚Äù.

Last year, I was in a great company where I was a junior analyst but I kept getting more and more opportunities for my personality, ideas and people that believed in me. All of the sudden, it all got to my head when my boss two levels above started doing things that took the limelight away and started talking condescendingly to me saying I‚Äôm just getting started. 

This felt like a personal battle and I went into full destruction mode where I was saying the weirdest shit to my senior leadership team (some very important people) and also sent emails to the CEO and CFO. Mind you these people have their own wikipedias. 

In my head, I thought I would get rewarded for the courage but slowly everyone in the company started distancing themselves from me. I mean everyone. It was almost like I went from a rising star to delusional. 

That made me look for another job which I did end up getting and am still doing well for myself but all this made me cringe and regret everything I did and extremely sad at my downfall at the previous company. I disappointed so many people that believed in me and looked upto me. For the past year, all I think about is that downfall period where I did things I would never do. All those emails, messages, manic texts is crazy to me. 

I‚Äôm atleast now happy that I know I‚Äôm bipolar and I can try to control my manic episodes in the future and potentially use them to my advantage. I still have so much guilt and shame. 

I‚Äôm so glad I found this community. Any advice/thoughts would be appreciated. We‚Äôre all in this together.",1676606782.0

513,Obsessive thoughts,2,1147u23,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1147u23/obsessive_thoughts/,2,"TW Death and dying

I don‚Äôt know if this is a bipolar thing specifically, but this community has been really helpful so I‚Äôm reaching out here. I have bpd, bipolar 2, CPTSD, adhd, and anxiety, in case this speaks to anyone with any of the same. 

I have obsessive thoughts every single day. They can be about any number of things from winning a prestigious award to hurting someone who hurt me. Ultimately, all of these thoughts are around some sort of redemption. 

Once the thought begins, it plays out in my head over. And over. And over. No matter where I am or what I‚Äôm doing. I find myself standing in line at the gas station or in my car or doing any of the other mundane parts of life trying to hold back tears, often failing. Sometimes my brain will get stuck on a sentence and it will do the same thing, replay over and over, sometimes to the point that I accidentally say it out loud. 

I recognize these thoughts pretty quickly and I try to tell myself to stop, but my brain just won‚Äôt. These thoughts are STRONG. They‚Äôre incredibly annoying and unproductive. 

The most recent thought I‚Äôve had has been particularly troubling‚Ä¶. I‚Äôve had a lot of suicide attempts, with my last one causing damage to the corpus collosum region of my brain. Even during moments of stability, I truly believe things are not going to end well for me. Between the drug and alcohol use, the multiple prescription overdoses, and my last attempt by hanging, I am certain I‚Äôm going to come into early dementia. Dementia also runs in the family on both sides. 

I read that Bruce Willis now has dementia and is unable to communicate. The reminder sets in and suddenly I‚Äôm imagining myself with dementia by 50. But then it progresses as I remember I have a neurology appointment for a brain MRI tomorrow, and I think of the doctor telling me I only have 6 months left. Now the real obsession starts. I‚Äôm thinking about being in hospice care at 30, all my friends and family coming to say goodbye to me while I‚Äôm still here, and my funeral. Every detail is devastating. What would I say to my mom? How do I give her the strength to keep going after I‚Äôm gone? What will my funeral be like? Who will speak? Planning little gifts for everyone so they can keep a piece of me with them forever. Heart wrenching stuff to think about. 

I realize these thoughts don‚Äôt necessarily serve me, but I also understand that it may be my trauma brain that causes them. If I can predict something bad and prepare for it, then it won‚Äôt be as bad. 

Ultimately, I want these thoughts to STOP! I want to be in the here and now. I want to live my life as it is and to the fullest. Especially since I have this belief that my brain will go soon. Since we all truly have a finite amount of time left, I want my time left to be good, to make up for all of the time I‚Äôve spent suffering. I still suffer quite a bit, but I‚Äôm doing a lot of good work and I believe there is a light at the end of the tunnel. 

If you‚Äôve made it this far, thank you for reading, I hope this wasn‚Äôt too tough a subject to read. So, how do I stop these thoughts? What tricks do you have up your sleeve for when the obsession comes on? Even if you don‚Äôt have advice to stop the thoughts, hopeful words are greatly appreciated. Today has been heavy.

I slipped in my sobriety and was slightly experimenting to see if I could have alcohol. I was sober for 7 months and thought I‚Äôd be okay to have a couple of drinks out to dinner. It of course increased over a two month time span to having a couple of glasses of wine or drinks a night, until last Friday was my planned last day of drinking. (I could tell my slippery slope was in full swing). It was my grandfathers funeral and I let myself get really drunk. The next day was horrible. I was sick and depressed and the anxiety was awful. Same thing the day after and the day after. I pulled it together yesterday and today with getting back to my routine and exercise. I felt semi better.

I had difficulties all through childhood and into college, ended up dropping out because of them, but found my footing in a good job. I had my first diagnosed episode in 2006 in my early 30s but had been in therapy for a couple of years by then. Classic case of a shrink prescribing Paxil and having a weird reaction (started crying and couldn't stop once I got up to therapeutic dose). Doc had me quit cold turkey and I became manic and completely unable to function. Had to use all my vacation time to take two weeks off from work to come back to earth and when I did my brain was permanently changed. 

I had been in a management position and was due for a promotion with lots of extra duties and travel, but I was barely able to respond timely and coherently to email. I had always been a little shy, but suddenly I was having full-blown panic attacks every single day. Got demoted but stayed with the company because I had been so good at my job before, but I wasn't functioning well. More and more duties were removed from my plate until it didn't make fiscal sense to keep me on (the great contraction of 2007-8) so I was let go. Very reluctantly and with a lot of grief I got on disability. I briefly tried to return to work 9 months later, in a lower-level role in the same industry which turned out to demand much more quick decision making and physical activity than my previous position, and ended up sexually harrassed and overworked and extremely suicidal. I was on a cocktail of the usual meds, which made me very situationally fuzzy. I was stalked and almost mugged a couple of times, which never would have happened before. Embarrassingly I was let go again. 

What followed were a series of therapists and psychiatrists and medications, and many hospitalizations and stints in outpatient programs. I just seemed to get worse and worse. My trauma issues from childhood frequently went untreated because I was told my mood swings were the problem. Meanwhile I became suicidal and borderline psychotic every year like clockwork. That pattern only stopped when I got my most recent p-doc. He listened to me when I expressed concern that the meds I was on were making me worse and agreed to help me get off them and start over from scratch. When we started doing that my hospitalizations became less frequent until they stopped altogether, though I did go to outpatient clinics on and off.

We worked together for about 8 years, until he retired in 2021. At the time of his leaving (yes, it felt like being left because he was the only so-called professional who had a long-term, good relationship with me) I was in a holding pattern, just taking Wellbutrin, Ativan and Ambien with Seroquel as needed (all in tiny amounts that they don't even produce pills for), but I had to quit when my scripts ran out. My primary care physician refused to touch them, and seemed offended that I asked. 

Because of how disability insurance has changed and because so many old school p-docs retired during Covid there are no private practice p-docs who will take my insurance. I was told to contact one of what used to be an emergency med clinic, where you used to go if you lost your pill bottle and needed something until your next scheduled prescription or your doc was unavailable and you needed a quick consultation or you were in crisis. Now they have become who people on disability are to go to. They don't even see people in person, just ask your history and run you through a questionnaire. 

I did call last year and start the ball rolling but when I started to ask questions about being able to choose which meds I was willing to take the doc assigned to me seemed confused and slightly exasperated (I'm not sure because it was all over the phone). I understandably have reservations about taking the wrong meds and ending up all messed up. I have major trust issues and decided to go no further with the clinic.

I am completely isolated at this point, life and friendships passed me by while I was struggling to just live, so if I started to become psychotic there isn't anyone to turn to or to catch me if I fall. I MUST remain in control of my faculties, I cannot afford the hunt-and-peck method of medicating. These days it is extremely easy to lose your apartment and become homeless or simply to get a reputation for being too weird and becoming an outcast... which has already happened because of how stressed out the pandemic made me. I don't even look like myself. 

I'm becoming desperate these days. My therapist (the only doctorate/phd who takes my insurance) is a joke (sorry, but she is. She's ""watched"" me deteriorate for three years and has nothing but her prepared scripts to say... watched in quotations because she hasn't seen my face since the pandemic started). I just got out of a bad involvement with someone who I was hoping she would help me manage, but she does not have any training or knowledge about ptsd or trauma, and I'm afraid that the stress of that whole ordeal physically hurt my brain. I've been afraid to see a doctor about my weird lopsidedness because I don't think I could stand another dismissal of ""maybe you're just depressed"".

I am currently at the end of my rope. I have a couple of choices: call the clinic again and take my chances, or stay on my own and pray for the fortitude to cobble together a management style on my own. Actually, in order to be present enough to navigate the system to be a good advocate for myself and even find the kind of support I need I need to make myself stable on my own. 

Huge ask: what non-med tools do you use to manage your head, what resources have you used to understand what you are going through, and how do you keep your head up?

If you have no advice to give thank you so much for reading this mini-screed. It helps me to try to put my experience into condensed words.",1676581191.0

I'm a Brazilian 42 yo man (he/him and been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder type II at 14. Also was diagnosed with Absence Complex Focal Seizures Epilepsy at 8/9.

About a coupe of years ago, 2018/2019 my diagnostic changed to Cyclothymic Disorder because of my very large bipolar cycle. I clocks at 8 years total, 4 hypomanic and 4 depressive.

Although Cyclothymic Disorder is seen like a minor version of Bipolar Disorder I don't feel like that at all.

I'm hypo now, my depressive cycle ended 2020 after starting in 2016. That was the worst. I lost everything work, M.A. Degree, Friends. And ended institucionalized for 3 months after a suicidal attempt. It was like waking up on a crater with all my life in shambles around me.

To get I worse I got a new diagnosis adding to previous one (Cyclothymic and Epilepsy), Dissociative Amnesia and Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder. Seems like my brain I a wreck, a runaway train.

After that I changed from my academic career to bread baker. Made a lot of courses last year, but now I'm feeling void, longing for a life already destroyed and hearing the clock ticking and counting down time for the next shift (2024).

I'm feeling hopeless and everything seen pointless. I tried to make plans and make time counts, but I know the cycle keeps running and the crippling depression will get me away.

-------------

Hello beautiful people. 

First thing I saw when I got up this morning was a message in the mod inbox asking why /r/bipolar was closed. I ventured over there and, sure enough, the subreddit has been set to private.

A comment on a thread on this subreddit indicated that the mod team is working on an internal issue to the sub, but that's all we know. We were not informed of the closing and we have no knowledge of when it might open back up.

For the time being: If you're here for the first time, welcome. Please read the rules and engage respectfully with the community, use the report button or modmail as necessary, and we'll be here to support you.

*Please keep all discussion of /r/bipolar's closing to this thread, to avoid flooding the subreddit. I will be removing other threads relevant to this issue to consolidate discussion.*

Again, we have no knowledge of what caused the closure, but we are here to support you until it reopens, and further on if you choose to stay.

EDIT: A statement has been released by one of the /r/bipolar mods:

""We absolutely hate having to take these actions of privatizing the sub but, it was, unfortunately, necessary as a result of a brigade attempt.

""We are currently investigating this issue further and are in communication with the site admins in an attempt to resolve this issue. 

""We ask at this time that if you have received any unsolicited DMs regarding dietary advice you please send them to us. If possible, please take a screenshot and send us an Imgur link so we may properly document it.

""This ""dietary advice"" offers suggestions that involve starving yourself and skipping meals. This advice is incredibly harmful, and we do not allow the promotion of disordered eating. The accounts responsible for this brigade intentionally reached out to members that have posted about weight gain as a medication side effect recently. The goal is to target vulnerable members of this community and cause harm, and we will not allow that.

‚Äã

""We are unsure of the total number of accounts that are messaging members, and we are unsure of what other harmful ""advice"" they may also be spreading. We were nearly at a point where we felt comfortable reopening the subreddit but received information that made it clear that it was not an appropriate time. We are currently awaiting input from more of our moderation team as they wake up, as well as from the site admins themselves.""

Hey guys, I posted the other day in an absolute fucking rage. Well I get it now. I know this date comes up every year but it still blindsides me because I think I've moved past it. I saw the upcoming date on a sign yesterday and it all clicked. So for my friends with PTSD as well as bipolar, how do you cope with anniversaries? 

After what happened (this year will be 5 years) I went into a mixed or manic episode, I'm not really sure, where I was having paranoid thoughts and lashing out at people because I thought they were thinking bad things about me. I got hospitalized for a bit. I do have bouts of paranoia throughout the year but it's always worst around this time. I take risperidone as needed because I'm not prescribed benzos anymore because of abuse and I actually brought it to work with me today even though I know it'll make it impossible to do my job. I just can't fathom going through another day like yesterday. I'm not really a crier, I want to cry sometimes and I just can't. Yesterday I was near tears over every little thing.

I'm a hypochondriac AND have bipolar, among other things. I am horrified by the medication side effects or the possibility of more severe effects. I worry about dying every day, or having a severe crash as a result of the medications. I'm also afraid of bipolar itself. The mysteries of mania. The fact that we know so little, and many of the treatments for me are so ineffective.

Every time my muscles twitch or my back hurts I'm afraid that there isn't enough blood flow there, or there's some hidden disease destroying me slowly.

I'm just riddled with fear. Chronic, constant fear. I want to feel secure but I can't be. Both because my mind and the outside world seem so volatile.

I‚Äôve recently had a week long depressive episode, the lowest and longest in a while (my mood has been up and down for a while, normally 4-7 days relatively functional, then the same severely depressed). I‚Äôve realised that I can‚Äôt really remember much of the week. My memory is patchy, and I don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôs the fact I‚Äôm sleeping so much or something else. But in recent years I‚Äôve remembered less and less of each of my depressive episodes. 

This is the same for panic attacks, however. My last major panic attack I had a huge breakdown and cried for hours after. I had a huge rant too, mostly emotional nonsense about my situation, and after coming out of it, I can‚Äôt remember almost anything I said. I roughly remember who was there, but don‚Äôt know at what points some people showed up, and I only have vague memories of what I spoke about. To the point where I had to ask people if I‚Äôd been rude and what I‚Äôd said because I genuinely couldn‚Äôt remember if in my emotional nonsense if I had offended anyone (someone insinuated I did but I don‚Äôt remember it). 

I see a lot about memory and concentration issues with depression, and I certainly relate, but I haven‚Äôt seen anyone really talk about weeks or months being patchy, or only having vague senses of what I said or did during a panic attack. These days I‚Äôm finding my depressive episodes and panic attacks coincide with pretty bad dissociation, but I‚Äôve remember periods of (albeit rather mild) dissociation in the past.

Turned 30 and couldn't get out of bed for 2 days because of how little I've done with my life. Depressive episodes and mixed episodes and anxiety and various physical health problems all year. It was all very lame, lots of suicide ideation and a few self harm relapses.

Did very poorly in my online college classes and had to take a break, which may lead to dropping out. 

I have no actual dating experience and not much sexual experience, and the day after Halloween, my first/only Friend With Benefits told me he had just started seeing someone and broke it off with me. So on top of my health, bipolar and money issues, I'm also feeling heartbreak for the first time, like a goddamn emo teenager.  

Relationship with my parents have been rocky because I've been so depressed and irratible, and they have their own stuff going on.

So, now here I am, Valentine's Day. I've figured out a medication problem that has now made my mental health marginally better...less SI and Intrusive thoughts....but pretty much everything is shitty. I caught a cold and I'm sick as hell and I'm missing a second day of work and I hope I don't get fired because I've got a big pile of credit card debt that is finally catching up to me. My ex FWB posts a lovely post about how much he loves his new girl and I finally have to admit to myself that I guess I had actual feelings for him and now I feel like I'm back to forever alone.

I'm aware this is all very Woe Is Me, but if I can't be depressed when I'm sick on the worst holiday, when can I be? I'm tired of rolling around near rock bottom and waiting for things to get worse.

Nothing has worked for me, or the side effects have caused episodes of hypomania and/or depression, suicidal thoughts, etc.

I applied for a study in San Francisco to see how Psilocybin affects treatment resistant Bipolar 2. I've watched documentaries and read tons of articles about psychedelics being used to treat mental health problems, so I really thought this was possibly *the* answer. After not hearing back for months, I finally received the rejection (no reason given) and I spiralled.

I had the worst bout of depression I've ever had, felt suicidal all day every day, barely ate anything other than the minimum to make it through a day. I was in bed for weeks. I had panic attacks. It sucked. I'm still not quite out of it, I feel. I'm in a weird limbo in my head. 

I don't know why I put so much hope into the clinical trial being my saviour.

Even if you try not to/realize that the issue isn‚Äôt worth getting angry over? I‚Äôm talking that blood-boiling, heart-racing anger. 

It only happens to me sometimes. It‚Äôs not a typical characteristic of my personality. But evvvvery once in a while, I can‚Äôt seem to control how mad I get/what I get mad over and it‚Äôs incredibly difficult to calm down and think positive/happy thoughts. 

My mother was chronically explosive and angry when I was growing up, and abusive. She isn‚Äôt one to go get help so she was never diagnosed, but I do think she exhibited several traits of bipolar, herself. She‚Äôd suddenly get new expensive hobbies, had an affair, had bouts of impossible energy, and though she acted like depression doesn‚Äôt exist, she would get in what she called ‚Äúa funk.‚Äù 
And of course I was eventually diagnosed with bipolar. (She thought that was ridiculous, as she doesn‚Äôt particularly believe in mental illness - ‚Äúdepression is laziness,‚Äù ‚Äúmania/psychosis is just people making poor choices‚Äù) and I wasn‚Äôt incredibly shocked when I found out that it is often hereditary. 

So is this anger sometimes part of it? With my upbringing, I really try to avoid anger and use mindful thinking and techniques to de-escalate those negative emotions when I get them. But sometimes, man, it feels fucking impossible! Once I‚Äôm over the anger I feel so ashamed and like I failed. 
Or is this anger a nature vs. nurture thing? I was raised by anger and so now it‚Äôs in me whether I want to succumb to it or not? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è or perhaps it‚Äôs both.

I got into therapy a year before lockdown started.

during lockdown we switched from face to face therapy to digital. I wasn't crazy about it but thats how went.

I know she respects my opinion and such. when BLM protest was happening, I refused to partake. not that I don't support the movement but I was scared to be involved. we still didn't know how people could catch COVID. it was a different time really. I was also afraid of the people who were counter protesting it.

we had an argument about me not attending. she told me that it was a time to stand up to people. I was in therapy to stop arguing and fighting with people. it seemed so counter to what I was there for.

we had an argument and I told her that she cared more about being an activist than being a therapist.

we didn't talk for about a month. it was pretty upsetting since it was lockdown and I just didn't have anyone to talk to.

after some time she mailed me a gift (a coffee table book) and a letter saying she was sorry. we didn't really make up but I just had no one else to talk to so I started therapy back with her. 

I convinced my best friend to start therapy and she suggested she could be his therapist too.

after about ten months of talking to both of us, she out of no where told us both she could no longer be our therapist. it was very sudden. I was really hurting at that time too so it was very difficult. 

this was about a year ago. I reflect on it constantly. today I found the book she gifted me and threw it in the trash.

There are several reasons. One is that I spent nearly 2 hours with a social worker talking about my history of trauma and all of my issues, they gave me a preliminary diagnosis of PTSD, anxiety, depression. In my own research, CPTSD best encapsulates what I experience so I was like okay that makes sense to me. Then I was sent to see the psych who diagnosed me with Bipolar in minutes without taking a full history. Something just doesn‚Äôt feel right to me about that. I want a second opinion. 

Another reason is that I just don‚Äôt think my symptoms warrant a Bipolar diagnosis and I haven‚Äôt been able to really identify with anyone‚Äôs stories on here. If anything I resonate more with Cyclothymia than Bipolar 1 or 2.

I will admit I do experience a majority of the time what I believe to be a mixed state of hypomania and depression. I‚Äôll feel like I‚Äôm bubbling with energy, thoughts, ideas, etc. yet I‚Äôm stuck and have no motivation to do anything then it fluctuates daily. It‚Äôs like the pendulum that determines my emotional state swings from one end to the other really fast and so fast I experience both. If I do happen to be in one state for a longer time (several days), it‚Äôs the hypomanic state. It‚Äôs exhausting that I feel this way and which is why I sought treatment. 

My last psychiatrist explained to me that while I don‚Äôt meet the criteria to be diagnosed as Bipolar, she recognized I have a hyperactive component to my mood and prescribed to me Buspirone. She felt that an SSRI over time might increase the level of hyperactivity I experience and the Buspirone wouldn‚Äôt do that. That medication worked wonders for me and I was on the lowest dose possible. It felt like the first time in my life that I had agency over my mood swings like I could experience sadness without sinking into depression or any emotion and just move on after the emotion ran it‚Äôs course. 

I really liked my last psychiatrist and felt like she really listened to me so to hear this new psychiatrist give me a diagnosis so quickly and dismiss my fears about the medications he prescribed‚Ä¶ just feels shitty and I can‚Äôt trust him. 

I‚Äôm open to hearing others opinions on this. Am I in denial? Am I minimizing my own experiences? Is my new psychiatrist being an asshole? I don‚Äôt know.

Afterwards I will be in a lot of pain and dealing with it coming from a sensitive place, and it will be a struggle to go to the bathroom. Overall terrible 

I have many concerns about this whole situation. Endless. But one of my main concerns is how my mental health will be affected. I‚Äôm on lithium and have been the most stable I‚Äôve been in a long time for the past 5 months. However even before knowing about the surgery, the previous few months my anxiety has been out of control, and I‚Äôve been experiencing some depression. I‚Äôve ben constantly anxious and panicking and worrying about disaster situations, like what if I‚Äôm assaulted when walking to my car or what if I fall down the stairs and break my neck. Plus anxious about life stuff. My depression had been rough and I even self harmed for the first time in a long time. I don‚Äôt have a psych or therapist right now since I just moved to a new state, but just got healthcare so will be able to soon.
I‚Äôm just worried about after my surgery ‚Ä¶since I will be in a lot of pain in such a sensitive place. And be not mobile or not fully active for months. I‚Äôm worried my depression and anxiety will get worse. I am worried that I‚Äôll be struggling so much that I will be suicidal.

Both of us had just gotten out of long-term relationships and ended up falling for each other even though we were still grieving what we had lost. I was also not diagnosed at the time so I constantly think that maybe I was just chasing the dopamine high that he gave me. A couple of weeks after getting married, I found out he had been sending inappropriate messages to other women, dating back to when we were already going out for about 2 months. 

This really killed all of the trust I had in him. But we were recently married, and I was determined to make it work. I even told him that he may never recover my trust and he should think carefully about whether he wants to be with someone who doesn't trust him. His answer really made me respect him a little less each day that passed. He said that it's not that big of a deal because it's not like he actually slept with any of those women. 

It all came to a breaking point today, when he said that I'm stuck in the past and that's why I can't move on. And I can't help but agree with him, but I also think about how I deserve to be with someone I can trust. And it's not just the lack of trust, but it's a lot of other things that I ignored because I really wanted this to work. This is really embarrassing for me, and TMI for some, but basically he seemed to be scared of touching me or giving me oral. The few times he has given me oral, he actually pauses to spit out in between licks. It's like he's grossed out but he swears he's not. I've had past partners that would treat me like I was the best thing they ever tasted and actually begged me to let them. So his way of doing things made me feel so bad about myself that I eventually asked him to not give me oral again because it was a hit to my ego each time he did that.

I probably seem like I'm rambling right now, but I guess the whole gist of this post is that I wasn't happy in a marriage where I didn't feel like I could trust my partner with my heart or my body. And now I'm wondering if I jumped the gun because of my disorder.

I talk to my doctor at noon tomorrow.  Planning to leave for home in the morning, so I can get checked into the hospital as soon as possible.  Probably should have gone sooner, but the closest behavioral health unit is 4 1/2 hours away, so I might as well take the extra few hours and go home. Because I‚Äôm not letting the cops here drive me all the way to someplace I don‚Äôt know.

I completed the last of my steps for my plan yesterday, I feel like one more bad day and that‚Äôs the end. Planning on telling my doctor that, and telling her that I should have agreed to up my meds at our last appointment.  I hate to up meds before I know that I‚Äôm in an episode, but I‚Äôm learning that I need to adjust at the first sign that I may be slipping.  I know a healthy lifestyle helps, but it‚Äôs hard with work and school.  I know it‚Äôs possible, I had six whole months without an episode a couple years ago and it was amazing.

I don‚Äôt know how school is going to turn out with all of this.  Wishing I had picked a school closer to home and that my dad had let me transfer closer for this semester. I haven‚Äôt done homework in the last week, as all I can think about is my plan. I‚Äôve been to class, but it takes everything I have to focus and my mind still wonders to my plan.

Today I told my sister that I‚Äôm not doing well, and that I might be coming home in the next few days. I haven‚Äôt talked to my parents.  Other than sharing a few days ago that I was having some si. I don‚Äôt want them to worry about me, but at the same time I wish they knew how much I am struggling here.  And at the same time I don‚Äôt want them to know how bad I‚Äôve gotten.  That‚Äôs the part of me that wants to see me go all the way and end it, even though I know it‚Äôs possible to be stable, but it‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve been stable.

My tolerance for episodes is going down, which is good, means I ask for help for less severe symptoms.  But my endurance is also going down and I‚Äôm tired of fighting this.  Also my episodes seem to be progressing faster than they used to, or I‚Äôm just not try as hard anymore. Anyone else notice that happen to them?

I need to find a new therapist, one that doesn‚Äôt make me anxious about telling them the truth. I feel like I‚Äôve lied to my current therapist too much to go back and fix it. But there are not many therapist in this area and I hate tele-health for therapists.

While I've enjoyed a great 5 months of not drinking, and I seldom crave it or worry about it, I have explored options for both of these issues with my psych.

He and I have a very good relationship, he knows everything about me, and I'm extremely honest with him. In the past with regards to anxiety and drinking, he suggested a low dose benzo to hit both. Take one instead of drinking, when I want to go out with friends or whatever (not so much to treat panic attacks). I do horribly with benzos, so I passed, and we tried naltrexone instead. Unfortunately that just made me depressed, even if it allowed me to have 1-3 drinks and go home no problem. It was the day or so after that I'd get really really bleak. Plus even then, I don't totally trust even naltrexone to prevent me from caving totally versus having a few drinks once in a while. Not to mention the ill health effects of alcohol and how those offset positive goals in my life like fitness, working out, my career, healthy hobbies, etc.

I was just recently randomly curious about how muscle relaxers even work, and learned plenty including that Soma has anxiolytic and euphoric properties, while (allegedly) not being as addicting as benzos.

I'm considering bringing up the conversation again, as Soma to an alternative to drinking. For all I know it could also set me off into anger like benzos and some other GABAergic drugs, but at times I consider something like this as a lesser of evils. I've made strides over the years, but if history repeats again, eventually I crack under anxiety and have a drink (which then turns into a week long binge if not more).

If this is a totally terrible idea, I'm accepting of that. I'm not a kid just trying to get my rocks off on pharmaceuticals - just want to explore if this would be a ""lesser of evils"" solution. I'd rather someone say this is a horrible idea; I'm not trying to start a hot debate over trying to get high or something. I'm open to alternative ideas as well. But while my psych is even cool with me trying shrooms for depression on my own as long as I tell him, I don't want to jeopardize our relationship by sounded like I'm trying to be irrational with our progress or take advantage of his trust.

Unfortunately, specifically for a night out, pot or even microdoses of shrooms don't hit the spot, and I end up feeling very left out, cranky, and ultimately ruining an adult night out of dancing. Which I also work on in therapy to get a better long term resolution.

Thanks!

**tldr; basically looking for an alcohol alternative just for a night out every month or so (naltrexone didn't work for me), and my psych has been open to this in the past. Is Soma a bad idea, or has anyone else found something? Please assume this is ""lesser of evils"" to help avoid alcohol which is highly destructive to my life - not looking for something new to have fun with.**",1676308862.0

It dawned on me that in the last 5 years on Adderall, I had done some craaaaazy stuff that I had never done in my life. Such as wanting to watch my husband have sex with another woman in front of me--I went as far as looking up sex workers to arrange one for his birthday, taking pictures of hot women for him at the beach, and more uncharacteristic things. I also wrote a very erotic novel in three months. But what really spurred the realization was the crushing guilt of having a texting affair for three months with my young daughter's friend's father who I found out was a malignant narcissist.  So now I'm swimming in guilt and shame. I'm having a hard time wrapping my brain around how I didn't notice sooner.  I almost destroyed my 20-year marriage to a man I love dearly and put my daughter at risk by entangling myself with a dangerous person.

It sent me down a shame spiral. But I knew it just wasn't me and wondered what happened. How? After doing a little digging I found that Adderall can induce mania in people with Bipolar and met with my psychiatrist ( I had kept all the embarrassing stuff from her over the years and insisted I was just fine.) Even though over the five years I lost 20 lbs, almost becoming anorexic and barely slept. She couldn't tell as we met over zoom once a year. My husband chalked it up to a mid-life crisis and me having a sexual awakening and getting fit.  

Now looking at my life through the context of Bipolar it makes so much sense. The fluctuating energy levels and moods, total lack of self-care, irritability, anger, creativity, a million ideas without one coming to fruition, underachievement, etc  I always thought what is wrong with me? Hence, why I sought a psychiatrist after I had a stroke at 38. (oh yeah I had a stroke in my thirties and almost ended up completely disabled).

During those 2 years did not have really strong depressions as long as hypermania episode. Was quite stable, sometimes was down cause was not in ketosis. I never tried medications, but those years on carnivore were the most stable for me. Did not feel myself perfect but still quite active and without extreme paranoia and anxiety. So carnivore worked, it does not cure me tottally, but helps a lot.

But suddenly i got really painful depression now, carnivore doesnt improve    my mental health for 3-4 weeks already(my blood test results are 3.1 and 1.2 mmol this week). So it seems that i am in ketosis, but it does not help. 

Sometimes i had hard periods, but mostly it was due to low ketone level. Also i found out that overeating protein ruins my ketosis. But this time i dont have any ideas why ketosis is not improving my mental health anymore. Any ideas/experience? 
Please help, its awful to feel like that. Cant understand how i was living for many many years without carnivore

690,has anyone remained stable only on Seroquel?,5,1108i3z,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1108i3z/has_anyone_remained_stable_only_on_seroquel/,5,"Hiya, so basically I wanted to know if any of you only take Seroquel (quetiapine) as part of your treatment. I know Lithium is the preferred med for this illness and I've been on it for over 3 years consistently for bp1 with overall good results.


Along these years, however, I've also had to take a bunch of other medications like zyprexa, depakote, lorazepam, wellbutrin, abilify, haloperidol and I don't remember what else when I've had manic episodes or lack of motivation. Currently what works for me is only 1200 mg of Lithium and 100g of Seroquel at night though.


Unfortunately, there's been a shortage of Lithium where I live and it's been really hard to get it, while I do have some lithium left for a month, my psych told me that in case the shortage continues (which is likely), taking only Seroquel (at a higher dose of 300 mg) might be effective. I trust him but I'm still dubious because of how long I've been taking lithium that I don't know how I might react. Any input is appreciated.",1676181415.0

The med that made me gain weight was abilify. My weight shot up so fast and my self-esteem tanked as it happened.

I was also the type of guy who refused to accept my diagnosis. So I would go off my meds, then when shit hit the fan, I would go back on my meds. By doing that I noticed that my appetite dropped when not on meds, but would immediately increase as soon as I went back on meds. For me, abilify tricks me into thinking that I'm hungry and need to eat. And, I feel that need all day. In addition to that, it makes me crave really shitty food.

If you are trying to keep your weight under control the key is to figure out how much you need to eat to actually stay healthy and energized.

I started out at 175lbs, shot up to 212 lbs, went down to 190 lbs, then back up to 198lbs because I started slacking on diet.

As an athlete, my weight has oscillated in small amounts my whole life depending on the intensity of my workouts. I learned several ways to lose weight for competitions ( I was a jiu-jitsu fighter and had to make weight for competition). YMMV, but the most effective I have found is taught by Jason Fung. Check out his youtube and his book reviews on amazon. I cannot recommend this guy enough.

One of the adverse effects of Abilify is binge eating. My psych did not explain this risk to me when they put me on it despite knowing I had a history of disordered eating and body dysmorphia. They told me it was weight neutral which seems to be a common refrain, but it can cause binge eating in some patients and that is important not to gloss over. I am on the lowest dose (2mg) and have gained 20lbs in about six months on it. I've been struggling to control my eating and am NEVER satiated. My new psych just started me on metformin to try to get my weight under control (I'm still gaining albeit not as quickly) because otherwise the Abilify is very helpful for me. I'm pretty frustrated I wasn't informed about this because if I had known this was a potential side effect of my medication, I would have been able to monitor the situation better and identify it as an adverse effect instead of hating myself and food (super triggering ED stuff). I know other antipsychotics are worse for weight gain so I thought I just had to accept being fat in exchange for being stable, which is something I've seen on this sub, as well. However, that is NOT true and my new psych explained to me there are medications that can help curb the appetite increase associated with antipsychotics like Abilify, including but not limited to metformin. If you are struggling with food on your antipsychotic, please discuss it with your psychiatrist. Maintaining a healthy weight is important to long-term health, and your body image is a mental health thing that deserves attention, too. Don't convince yourself that it's just a ""you"" problem even if you're on an ""innocent"" antipsychotic like Abilify. I was very surprised my psych was so receptive to my concerns because I'm usually brushed off about this stuff even though I'm now pushing into unhealthy BMI territory (I'm short so not much room for me, unfortunately), and I was glad to learn there were options besides going off my meds or switching (especially when the alternatives are worse for this issue or not covered by my insurance). Anyway, just sharing in case it helps someone else. üôè

For those of you who have it, is it really that bad? I try to ease my fears by telling myself if I do get it that it will likely be mild and manageable, and hopefully not too disfiguring.

It experiences the world through the lens that is my brain. My brain interprets the sights and sounds, it creates the emotions, it‚Äôs where impulses begin and where drive thrives or dies. The brain is unstable, it‚Äôs always changing, always adapting, filled with survival mechanisms that are no longer necessary. It creates extreme highs and the deepest lows. It applies these filters, sometimes based on the inputs it‚Äôs receiving from the world around it, sometimes based on past experiences, sometimes on trying to guess the future. Sometimes it feels completely random and sometimes it seems malicious. 

The Self within me is experiencing through these filters. To the Self it is easy to seem like these filters are all there is, that they are the absolute truth and there is no reality but the one they portray. Th Self gets tied up in these and becomes one with them. But there is more than that. The Self is capable of so much more. The Self knows what is best, it has dreams, it wants to thrive and feel and experience greatness. It is capable of consistency, its drive is is a force stronger than anything the brain can produce. When the filters of the brain can be stripped away the Self can shine and lead to positive actions, it can take control of the brain and lead it in a direction not based on habits, on what‚Äôs already known, on incorrect emotions, addictions, negativity. But in a direction that will bring us to find peace, to thrive, to love, to smile, to experience hope and see it fulfilled. The Self is who I am and I let it drown in the filters of the brain. I forget it‚Äôs there and let it become consumed. Bringing the Self out is hard, I can only do it for little bits at a time right now, but the more I do it the better I feel, the more I do it the easier it gets, the more I do it the less filters of the brain are applied and the more I can see.

I don't want to give up tea, but I don't want to exasperate or heck even cause mania.

760,Reflecting on a past mixed episode,2,10yj0t8,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/10yj0t8/reflecting_on_a_past_mixed_episode/,0,"I'm reflecting back on a mixed episode I had for a few months last year. 

At the time, I was really depressed. I had surgery that left me bedbound for 6 weeks, and by the 4th week, I was horribly depressed. No motivation, sad, suicidal, self-harming, all of that.

I can't remember if my manic symptoms started before or after I started abusing drugs. I would mix together a few mgs of klonopin with alcohol just about every day, if not multiple times a day (again, it's hard for me to remember, very much due to the drugs I was abusing). I just wanted to get high and have sex... I had *so* much unsafe sex back then. I was also terribly restless; I was exhausted, but then I could only sleep 4 hours per night.

It got to the point where I had to admit myself to the hospital because I was looking up how to buy a gun. 

The doctor that diagnosed me with bipolar I said they didn't believe the drug abuse caused this episode. I think it was at least partially caused by drug abuse, even though what I abused were depressants (paradoxical reactions and all that). I'm not sure what to believe, and it makes me feel like I'm faking it all, or that my condition isn't as serious.

I just got out of a meeting with my psychiatric nurse. I'm rather upset about it. I'm feeling incredibly manic right now. More specifically, I feel incredibly wired, I can't tell whether I want to bash my head against the wall or go for a long drug and booze binge instead. I feel like God is talking to me through my environment and is watching me all the time. I'm paranoid, easily agitated and I'm having auditory hallucinations at night. It's horrible, but I want to swim in it forever, it is turning into a sick  mental hostage situation with myself. I don't feel like I'm able to take adequatly take care of myself, I want to do drugs, spend my life like it is a big bittersweet party and I daydream about killing myself. I'm simply not a responsible person right now.

This afternoon I've had a meeting with my psychiatric nurse. I have told him all of this. My feelings, my doubts, my worries. I've showed him before-after pictures of my appartement. How a depression dump fest turned into a trendy, squeeky clean revamped and repainted appartment in 48 hours. I've also told him I don't trust myself, I'm currently not responsible enough to stick to my crisis plan and that I need help and advice. 

He told me that if I want to stay in this mental state of being, I simply should try to stay in it as long as I get enough sleep. He can't give me any tips or advice since ""he doesn't know me that well"" . The only advice he could give was to try cannabis, since it works for some people. In all fairness, that is not terrible advice, had I not tell him previous sessions about how I overcame my destructive cannabis addiction 2 years ago. 

Furthermore, I've told him multiple times that I've alienated most of my friends through my depressions, mania's and psychosis. Yet, he still insists I should just lean on my social network. He simply doesn't have any advice, because he ""does not know me that well.""

On top of all that, I have been on a social care waiting list for a month now. I was supposed to get help for my self-neglect. I usually life in a very filthy appartment, I'm underweight, since I'm usually unable to eat and my anhedonia makes it difficult to live life in general. Well.... he took me off the waiting list, since my appartement looks so good now and I'm actually properly dressed for once.

I feel defeated, like nobody can help me anymore at this point. I've tried so many therapists.  I've accepted I probably won't live past 30. I've lost my social network, my job.... I'm close to giving up.

I have never paid for these kinds of services, and I am hesitant to do so, because I do not want to be taken advantage of.

I am not completely on board with seeking help from the realm (whether or not it exists) of magic and mysticism, especially after having had experiences with psychosis. I also do not want to allow myself to believe anything that might bring false hope into my life.

The only problem I seem to have is that when I get woken up on them, in the middle of the night which happens sometimes when my boyfriend can't sleep, I end up having a meltdown? I wake up delusional. 

He ends up having to hold me in place until I stop crying or scratching or you know, you get the idea. I think the hallucinatory aspect is quite strong for me. So everything comes in at once. Voices telling me he hates me, my brain not being able to make sense of my life. I've had a hard life, I didn't even have parents but that's just the start of it.

I actually had an objectively good childhood outside of some extended family drama. My parents and sibling care about me and we are relatively close.

However.

I was born turbulent. From ages 2 to maybe 6-7 I would have insane tantrums. Insane. I couldn‚Äôt explain what felt so horrible, but it basically felt like a mixed episode. I wanted to rip my skin off so I screamed all night until I lost my voice. My parents could never understand what was happening because I simply couldn‚Äôt explain it besides screaming and saying I didn‚Äôt know what was wrong. I spent a decent amount of preschool voiceless from screaming all night.

When I wasn‚Äôt having tantrums screaming for the entire night, I would cry myself to sleep in secret. I have no idea why I felt so melancholy at 3 but I would tell myself it was a good thing. I told myself that if I cried into my stuffed animals enough, they would become real and be my friends. I felt completely consumed by sadness at times.

I also had irrational fears. This may be within the normal spectrum but I always had the same theme of fears - of being watched by something I didn‚Äôt know. I thought moles lived under my bed and would come out at night to watch me. Yes literal moles lol. I also had a period of time where I was scared that leprechauns were secretly following me. This is normal kid stuff to an extent, but I can‚Äôt help but feel I have the same vein of fears now when at times I‚Äôm absolutely terrified of being watched at night or feeling followed by something small.

I eventually learned to tame myself. I always struggled with the same issues but I was able to navigate life in a fairly average manner from. ~7-22/23. I will always be a naturally volatile soul but I was largely able to function and use my brain.

As soon as I hit 23/24 I took a nosedive. Got severely depressed then manic and then many horrible mixed episodes and fears that felt quite familiar. Sometimes I have weird dissociative moments where I am back to childhood. I feel sucked in, I feel 3 years old and unable to verbalize it. It makes me deeply uncomfortable to share that because there is nothing objectively wrong with my childhood and I want to protect my family from any of those jusdgements.

I‚Äôm afraid to take anything that will increase my serotonin (SAM-e) because of my experience with Prozac. I‚Äôm also worried about taking Seroquel when I‚Äôm already exhausted from pregnancy. But I‚Äôve also never addressed my OCD and it‚Äôs becoming pretty uncomfortable to live with. I‚Äôve taken a Benadryl in the past when I needed to stop an anxiety attack. Can I take Seroquel occasionally? Any suggestions welcome. Below were my psychs recommendations. 
-increase lamictal from 100mg to 150mg
-start Seroquel 25mg
-take 2,000mg fish oil 
-take SAM-e",1675916270.0

We share custody of our 12-year-old and things are relatively amicable. Ex started dating right away but I wasn't in a good place for awhile (went off meds) and didn't want to inflict myself on anyone.

BUT I was recently feeling lonely around the holidays and went on a few apps and created profiles, chatted with a couple of people, and then Katie messaged me. My age, very attractive, obviously smart, funny right away. We exchanged numbers, had a nice coffee date, followed by me asking her out again. I had feelings for her fast, which was scary but also made me take a chance.

On our second date we eventually wound up at her place and smoked some weed and made out and it was intense. I wound up spending the night and in the morning I woke up terrified. Surely she would find out I was a sick imposter who paled next to her in every way.

She has a successful career, makes more money than me, has her shit generally together, and is so freaking nice I can't believe it. She made me toast and tea in the morning and told me she likes the way I hold her and kiss her, just basically said all the right things.

I texted her the next day and came completely clean about not being completely over my divorce, bipolar and meds, credit in the toilet, a messy patchwork of jobs making no money, trying to raise a kid, alcohol problems, you name it. Was just totally honest.

I thought that would do it. She'd write me off as a fun time, end of story. But she invited me over again. And then again. She seems to really like me but I still feel like a huge imposter and that I'll just fuck up this relationship--my first after nearly two decades of marriage--like everything else. I'm scared shitless.

I don't even know why I'm posting this I guess it's just looking for some sort of encouragement? I was very depressed in my marriage and now I feel happy but not manic but it's all just WEIRD and I have trouble describing my current emotions to the few buddies I have. My ex isolated me from a lot of my long-time friendships as a control mechanism. 

I have a great therapist, meds that work after taking years to get it right (depakote, effexor, trazadone), and now this seemingly great, new, accepting relationship with a hot woman. Except I worry all the time. Didn't mean to ramble on for so long.

But it's going to be all right, right?

I am not self. dionosing , nor do I have an official diagnosis. Just a prickle of the mind.

&#x200B;

I have no clue if I am Bi-polar. The very idea that I have it is kinda scary, but recently, that kinda changed. I guess I will get into the meat of the story.

Manic episodes.

I think I have been getting them, I think. They seem to tick off the boxes of the symptoms online, at least some of them. People were kinda right online. Its like a twisted sense of happiness, at least for me. Its like the world suddenly became more floaty, and brighter. I could have floated and flew if I could. Its like constant music blasted into the ears and veins, making your feet dance even its 4 am in the morning, and nobody will be around. I had to move around those times. Run , walk , skip. No matter what it is, just keep moving. My heart races and my hands couldnt stop shaking. My empathy just drops to 0 and I no longer see people as people, more like objects. The best way I can describe it , its like Hysterical boredom. 

&#x200B;

And these, at least for me, are extremely bloodthirsty. When I am under this state, I really wanted to kill , or seriously maim somebody. Like I wanted to hold something and either strangle it, or. just use a knife. Doesn't matter, as long as I end its life. Be it animal, or human. Even if I will lose in the example. Just wanted to. spill some blood, or end somebody's life. Its kinda scary. I have yet to act on these thoughts, but I swore off alcohol , drugs, because I fear that I might actually act like this should I have be given the chance.  But those things only remained thoughts, but they are noisy, and never shut up.

&#x200B;

Then, after a few minutes, its gone. 

Thats the weird part. from what I have heard, it has to last for at least a few hours, or a few days. I don't really count this as manic, because not only do the thoughts only remained as thoughts, the epiddes last too short for them to be considered as true episodes. The longest I had was probably about 3 hours, before it just faded into nothing. However, the states just happens randomly, and It can occur Mutiple times a day.

I also don't have the lows part. Or at least, they do not present themselves really obviously or like that.I do have the low thoughts, and the self doubt, and the attributing to being nothing. I do know that the thoughts of suucide do linger for quite bit, but just like the manic stuff, they not only just remains as thoughts, they are usually gone after an hour or two, sometimes within 30 mins. These do not occur so often as. the highs though.

I also do feel really tired, but that is a norm, because no sane person should be sleeping at 7am. Just school work, however. 

&#x200B;

So yea, kinda weird things going on. I have no clue even if this is really worth going to the doctor for, since its timings have yet to clock to the usual timings for both high and lows, so I might just end up without a diagnosis. I do still think that they can be eerie at best, and disruptive to my work at worst. I have immediately settled into work, being knocked away from a high because I saw my deadlines. So I am starting to wonder is this even a manic episode.",1675873145.0

Maybe because I was doing pretty well for several years, maybe I lost my touch, idk.  

I definitely had a mixed episode starting in either late October or early November.  This much is clear to me (well, after loved ones & friends pointed it out lol).  It was bad.  You can look at my post history and see it was bad lol.  For about a month I was not doing not well at all.  I could not sleep, I had a self-harm relapse for the first time in years, I was dealing with what I'm pretty sure was psychosis (paranoid thoughts), I got put on familial suicide watch because I was acting erratic but not quite to the point of anyone wanting to force me to the hospital.  So, that was November.

December.  I thought I was doing pretty well in December for the first week or two!  My sleep got a lil better (it's always bad but, less bad).  I was still feeling very depressed and agitated but if it was an 9/10 in November, it was like a 6-7/10 by December. I was able to focus on work a bit more rather than constantly spiraling and getting distracted by dumb, weird obsessions. I thought it was over, or at least fizzling.  

Well, January was very bad.  Very very very bad.  Maybe even worse than November bad! Yes, indeed I got put on familial suicide watch AGAIN and this time they did very much threaten me with the hospital.  I swear I'm trying but I'm just not doing well right now and I don't feel quite ""right"" even though I'm not, as of the moment, a threat to my physical wellbeing.

I've only ever had one manic episode over a year ago,  which ended up with me in hospital. Honestly, I don't even think I was suicidal at the time, I think I was just afraid my wife would leave me. (I had 4 beers, drove the store, had my car impounded - never drunk drove in my life before that).

Anyway, I was thrown on fluoxetine, then lamotragine,  quetiapine, and finally lithium.

My doctor tapered me off fluoxetine which went well, but then I started getting a skin rash, so we stopped the lamotragine. Then I decided to take myself off of quetiapine as it was making me over eat and sluggish, which in turn was making me hate life. I was also massively unmotivated and generally turning into a blob. 

This is all over a 3 month span and ended 2 weeks ago.

So 3 weeks ago I started getting headaches, which my Doc suspected was fluoxetine withdrawl. I didn't start getting then until I started the lithium, so I suggested it could be that but she wasn't convinced. So I stopped lithium 2 weeks ago and still feel fine.

No ups, no downs, no crazy spending. I'm acting more like I used to. Only thing is, I'm still massively unmotivated, eating like I was on the quetiapine, and not entirely sure why.

I'm not depressed, I'm just not entirely happy.

I moved countries 5 years ago and still don't have any real friend group, and don't climb or do anything social which could just be catching up on me now that I've come out of the storm.

My depression hit mid-October, after my first manic episode, in which I suddenly couldn't feel any joy, no motivation to do anything, and unable to focus and concentrate on books, tv shows, lectures, and sometimes conversations. I had no desire to socialize or see people, didn't drive, and had a deep miserable feeling of dread all the time. I haven't been to work since September (when the manic episode began). It's now February and I'm still struggling with a lack of motivation to do things, a lack of enjoyment of life, and a miserable feeling that leaves me sobbing my eyes out sometimes. I want to escape from reality all the time and often spend hours reading webcomics on my phone. Although there have been some slight improvements such as my desire to see friends sometimes and my ability to drive short distances alone, I'm still stuck with this debilitating feeling of dragging my feet through life. My parents are very supportive of me during this time and are financially supporting me. I take yoga classes a few times a week and a figure skating class twice a week. On Friday Nights I go to my local Masjid (mosque) to see my friends and play games together. But the rest of the time I drag my feet to do anything else. It's so hard to take a shower and I procrastinate so long before taking one. Even when I do manage to complete things on my to-do list like taking a walk or washing the dishes, I still don't feel any better or accomplished. I'm also faced now with the fact that my psychiatrist no longer wants to sign my off work notes so now I would either have to return to work or quit. And since I definitely don't feel ready to go back I guess I have to quit thanks to my psychiatrist not believing the severity of my symptoms. I've been on 2 or 3 different medications (Lamictal, Wellbutrin, and Lithium) for the depression and so far nothing has worked. I'm in an IOP Program currently and I'm starting individual therapy this week. I said all of this to say, how do you get through this? Is there anyone who has experienced what I'm going through?

I haven't read experiences of Rexulti causing hypo/mania, since it's actually used for this very reason.

Has anyone experience something similar with this med? Any thoughts?",1675770385.0

I am a 25, about to be 26 y/o female. I was just recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder (don't remember the type or if I was told it) and I have been taking abilify which I feel like kind of is helping. 

Before diagnosis I just thought I had really severe depression and anxiety. Which I do. Since college, I have struggled maintaining full time employment, struggled financially, it all makes so much sense now. I am now finished up with real estate course work and about to test into becoming a realtor. However, I will surely age out of my dads insurance before I will pass the test and establish employment/ new insurance.. 

I have been told by friends that bipolar disorder is a protected disability but what does that mean? I brought it up to my dr and either I was too manic to comprehend what she said or she didn't say anything and told me to figure it out? What do I do? Sign up for Medicaid? I'm honestly not sure what that is or if I qualify for it... Has anyone else struggled with aging out of parents insurance?

I've been dealing with bipolar disorder since I was 16, and I'll be 36 next month. When I look back on everything I've been through with this illness, there are a lot of things I regret or am ashamed of that I did while manic or depressed or mixed. Like from my first suicide attempt, the sound of my mother's panicked voice when she found me and I was barely conscious still haunts me. During a manic episode, I cheated on my now husband and almost lost him forever when he's been the most supportive person in my life. He forgave me and we worked it out, but there are times I still feel so much shame and regret for what I did. When I attempted suicide again, I did it at work and my brother-in-law (who worked with me at the time) drove me to the ER. He almost lost his job because of me.

But the thing is, I feel like I've learned from the mistakes I've made and the choices I regret making because of my bipolar disorder. When I'm manic and hypersexual, I don't go looking for sex outside of my marriage. After my last suicide attempt, my husband and I agreed that he would manage my medication so I don't have access to excess medication to overdose on. We take extra precautions when I have an episode, like staying at my parents house while my husband is at work so I'm not alone all the time, or my husband will drive me to wherever I need to be so I can't threaten to crash my car. I've learned over the last almost twenty years how to not always make the same mistakes over and over that might ruin my life.

I feel withdrawing from Venlafaxine it has kick started a manic episode.

Will the quetiapine make me more aware?

I‚Äôve felt euphoric, more sociable, drinking more, spending more secretly and openly. Sex drive higher. Which are all great hypomanic. 

Until now to feel more suspicious of people talking about me etc. Started thinking on Saturday night, my friends ex boyfriend (he used to be an top IT guy and he‚Äôs quite vindictive) has hacked my phone because my best friend has been saying things that make me feel she has heard my conversations on my feelings.

Feeling like the dinner ladies are off with me. However I have awareness of this for the first time, could that be the quetiapine?

I am a first year college student currently being treated for depression and cptsd, and currently getting assessed for ADHD and potential autism. there is a family history of severe mental health issues but it's unclear exactly what because my older relatives refuse any help or treatment which is making it super difficult for doctors to treat me. I believe its very possible my mother could have bipolar but it's impossible to know for sure because she refuses all mental health treatment and i am now no contact with her.

Last week i was perscribed mirtazapine by my doctor after trying fluoxetine, sertraline and venlafaxine all with no improvement.

The first week i slept loads however i felt like my depression was cured, i got all my motivation back planned loads of stuff and did loads of worküòÑ, i also felt restless and irritable and like i was being driven by a motor. however after being on it for a week i am having nightmares again all night and feel incredibly depressed again and i am unable to keep up with all the plans i made in the first week of mirtazapine.

I have heard that antidepressants can trigger manic/hypomanic episodes and i am wondering if this sounds like it could be mania/hypomania or if its similar to the experience any of you guys had on antidepressants. Because i dont know enough about it.

It feels like a very unique reaction to antidepressants and i feel quite alone in this experience 

It could just be I did too much and burnt out but idk

Seeing my doctor on friday for a follow up so i will discuss this with her, but any other insight would be appreciated and would help with the appointment !

Her doctor got her on Quetipine 200mg and she has been able to sleep since then. Her therapist has asked her to isolate herself for sometime so that she removes her trigger points and becomes self-dependant.
I have been asked to give her space. But when I move away, I get shouted at for not giving a shit. So we get back in the same cycle. Leaving her by herself puts me under a lot of guilt. I don't know what to do.",1675705569.0

The author, Bessel van der Kolk, seems to have an interesting perspective on trauma informed care and how psychiatric labels are given to patients who exhibit symptoms that are more specifically related to experiences with trauma. Someone might end up being diagnosed with an illness such as bipolar disorder for the purpose of treatment, even though medication can‚Äôt really help with the underlying issues, as it is used primarily to numb the effects.

Curious what you all think, especially if you can relate and trauma has contributed to your own experience with mental illness. Should mental illness be considered to be a response to trauma for some people, and if so, should doctors treat it any differently?

Writing because I started Lithium in November and since then, I haven‚Äôt had a single creative thought or urge. Every time I think it‚Äôs coming, it just fizzles out into nothing. It‚Äôs hard because I was working as a professional photographer for the past year and photography was my entire life. At this point, I haven‚Äôt picked up my camera in three months.

I went to a meet up for photographers last week and I felt like a fraud. Everyone asked why I haven‚Äôt been shooting and said they can‚Äôt wait for me to get back into it. I didn‚Äôt know how to tell them that I just don‚Äôt have the urge, the passion, the ideas‚Ä¶. At all.

I should add, this isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened. I‚Äôm likely autistic and I do have special interests that come and go over time, especially during depressive episodes. In past lives, I‚Äôve been a writer, a musician, a YouTuber, and more. I go really hard with a hobby and obsess over it fully until I completely burn myself out and can‚Äôt do it anymore. I‚Äôm wondering if this experience of having and then losing a creative outlet is also common for bipolar people.

What would you do in my shoes? Do I force myself to take photographs? Or do I wait out the depression? Do I find another creative outlet in the interim? Is this likely the lithium, the mood episode, the autism, or all of the above? 

Will I always feel so passionless? I‚Äôm hoping that come spring, my mood will even out and I‚Äôll feel creative energy again but maybe that‚Äôs wishful thinking.

I'm hopefully gonna have a psych evaluation soon. My mom has bipolar ll and I've experienced a lot of trauma, so there's a very good chance I have it. 

I think summer of 2020 was the first real hypomanic episode I had. I lost my virginity to this guy I had went to high school with and he sold me extacy and we smoked and I ended up having sex with him. I remember mentioning a condom, but my purse was in the living room and I guess he just didn't wanna take the time to get it and just entered me without my consent. I went with it tho, as I was very high and it felt good for a boy to be so into me. (I was severely bullied about being chubby, so I have a lot of insecurities). I ended up having sex with him again that night and took plan b the next morning, even tho he pulled out. I was aware enough that I needed to make sure I didn't get pregnant, thankfully. He ended up ghosting me. 

August 2020, I met a guy on tinder. I didn't personally know him, but I knew of him as he was only about 3 years older, my cousin went to high school with him, he seemed chill. I went to his house a couple times. We fooled around a bit. (He fingered me and I gave him a handjob) One night after that, about a week later, (he only ever invited me over in the night time. I should've known better) I went to his house and we smoked some weed. He ended up pulling out a bottle of vodka and offered it to me. We drank it together, but I got way more drunk than him, as I'm 5'4 and he's a big, stocky 6'2 guy. I remember kissing him, but it goes black and then I remember it in flashes. Him on top of me, heavy. He was extremely big, I wouldn't have let him if I had been able to resist. My cervix hurt so bad and I told him it hurt and he just kept going. I woke up later and had to pee. It was painful and when I wiped there was blood. I said goodbye to him and just left. I texted him later to ask him if he had used a condom, he said he did the FIRST time. I don't remember a second time. At all. I wasn't conscious. I didn't realize what happened to me was rape until I told my friend at the time how it went down and she was concerned and gently told me that it sounded like sexual assault. I ended up blocking him on all socials and I haven't spoken to him since. Now that I'm clear headed, I feel so violated. I hate myself for putting myself in that situation, but that whole summer I was doing stuff I wouldn't normally. I tried acid, extacy, shrooms, almost tried cocaine. I was definitely not myself. 

Now last summer, my air conditioning was out and I think it got so hot, that I kind of went manic, or at least hypomanic, as I was still able to work and perform tasks. I didn't feel euphoric though, I felt like crawling out of my skin. I ended up posting nudes of myself on a different account on here, SEVERAL times a day. I talked to men I would NEVER talk to normally. Perverted men. One man was 61. 

Yeah, I know, fucking gross. 

I watched porn constantly, masturbated several times a day to the point of injury. I was anxious and my thoughts were constantly racing. I didn't sleep much and I was very irritable and snapped at my mom a lot. Now, after slowly coming down and entering my depression, I feel so ashamed of myself and my behavior. The kinks I got into that I would never want in my right mind, letting men treat me like an object, like that's my only worth. 

I truly feel like I have bipolar disorder and so does my mom. Hopefully, I can find out soon what's wrong with me and get myself help. Thanks for reading, I'm sorry it's so long, I just needed to rant. :)",1675554840.0

‚ÄúAntidepressants ‚Äòhave the propensity to destabilize mood, precipitating both hypomanic and manic episodes‚Äô‚Äî**a phenomenon called antidepressant associated hypomania (AAH).** Although this condition is most frequently associated with bipolar depression, it has also been reported in unipolar depression and in non-affective conditions, such as anxiety disorders. The potential for AAH has made antidepressant use controversial in patients with bipolar disorder (BP).‚Äù",1675527831.0

I had my first depressive episode at 10 years old and started Prozac at 11 but was having manic and mixed episodes by 14. I ended up going to a therapeutic high school and spent over a year in a PHP program prior to transferring there. 

I‚Äôve been in therapy continuously since I was 10 years old. I was hospitalized once at 16 after dissociating to the point that I became unresponsive and couldn‚Äôt swallow water even to take an Ativan, and twice more in college related to suicide. The dissociation would make me separate from my body where all I could do was scream while my mom and brother would hold me. The time I got taken to the hospital I was just unresponsive staring at a wall laughing ‚Äúinappropriately‚Äù. 

In college I ended up doing 20 shock treatments and it was a rollercoaster but by the end I found a good medication cocktail and graduated with 3 majors and went on to law school. Law school was rough but I graduated that too, went on to pass the bar, and am now a 4th year attorney. 

I‚Äôm 29 now and have a great life. I take 13 pills per day every day, go to therapy once a week, psychiatrist once a month, massage 1-2 times per month, sleep 7-8 hours per night, meditate regularly, and exercise vigorously 5-6 days per week. 

I have a happy marriage, two kids (twin boys), I own my own home, have two nice cars, and have a great career as an attorney that puts me in the top 3% of earners for my age. I‚Äôm doing two half marathons this year and hopefully a marathon. 

I have bipolar 1 disorder. It sucks. My moods trend toward mania and hypomania nowadays. It‚Äôs been a few years since I had depression. My meds change from time to time to address the swings and work well. But I handle myself better than the vast majority of people with or without manic depression. My coping skills are top notch. No one but my close friends and family know about my illness. 

I spent many years learning how to be mentally ill and the past decade learning how to be normal without pathologizing myself. It‚Äôs a constant battle, I‚Äôll always be this way, but finding the right meds, internalizing the skills I learned in therapy, finding the right coping skills, and living a healthy lifestyle makes a huge difference.",1675483453.0

I've been with my boyfriend for 3 years, shortly after I was getting help. I was upfront about having bipolar disorder since our first blind date. Shocking he stuck around. He's been really supportive and understanding as best as he can considering he doesn't really understand what bipolar disorder is like for me, but he really tries. 

He likes a really clean house, and I do too. I feel into a ""normal"" depression (meaning not super bipolar depression) and kinda gave up keeping the house clean because I had no energy left. So I just couldn't keep up with the house work. It actually took a toll on our relationship for a while, because he was getting frustrated. Finally I admitted that I was still depressed, even though I stopped taking my antidepressant because I just didn't want to take it anymore. 

Once I snapped out of my depression, I got into my ""cleaning away the depression"" mode. Finally our relationship was getting better he was so much less stressed out coming home from an already stressful job, and was happy again. I'm good at cleaning. I cam spend all day cleaning the laundry and putting it away and making the bed and clean the bathroom. But my ADHD doesn't see the dirty dishes and the messy livingroom. He has a hard time communicating what's upsetting him. 

Our relationship was getting so much better and I didn't want to lose it. I finally came up with an idea to help him communicate with me and give me a way to prioritize what needs to be cleaned. He has a giant white board full of his to do list. I like making to-list, mine are really just step by step instructions on what to do so I feel more accomplished. I thought of this great idea. I clipped my to-do note pad to his white board with a pen and a dry erase marker, and wrote underneath it ""baby this is upsetting me. I need you to"" and then number 1 and 2. And told him from now on I need him to write one or two things on the white that he needs me to do, but only 2 because I don't want to get overwhelmed with too much stuff. 

It's really started helping alot. The white board is actually right outside our bedroom so it's the first thing I see in the morning, and I'm able to see what he needs from me. No more confrontation and fights and constant reminders that I inevitably forget about because I got distracted. It's really helped his ability to communicate with me and for me to prioritize and know what the problem is.

I worked up the courage to message a long time friend, to ask if they want to collaborate on art or play a game, to go to the zoo, suddenly decide I'm gonna cook a proper meal for dinner, etc. I also have ADHD and have found that hypomania is the only thing other than crushing deadline pressures that motivates me, and it's a pleasant force vs the anxious pressure one.

935,is it possible to start meds without becoming suicidal?,2,10t0dyv,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/10t0dyv/is_it_possible_to_start_meds_without_becoming/,20,"i am now 3 weeks into lithium and adderall, which like... major props, i am not allergic to either of them, so i'm pleased about that. so i now know of 3 psych meds i can take that i am not allergic to. but allergies aren't everything, and now i'm hitting the fucking wall.

obviously we all understand the concept of depressive crashes after mania, so there's a percent chance that i'm having a bad reaction to the lithium and a percent chance that i'm just swinging into depression because i'm swinging down from my months long hypomanic state. in either case, this is a massive fucking problem.

i am not experienced in dealing with depression. i have had mixed episodes from time to time, but never depression. i've always been in some way elevated. and thus we end up with the issue.

every time i reach a certain point in medication, i start to become increasingly suicidal. i'm currently at the point where i will still have positive moments here or there, because i'm only about 3 weeks in, it seems after a month is when i start to get really bad. eventually i may reach a point where all i will be able to think about is ending it all, like my new favorite hobby just becomes suicidal ideation.

i am... cautiously hoping the adderall will keep me from falling into that pit, but it mostly just seems that now i am emotionally destroyed but able to make myself do things despite that. i'm not any happier, i'm still just as suicidal, but now i have a little ""oomph"" to let myself keep up with my daily tasks. i figured maybe being able to function would make me not feel as sad.

now i just feel very quizzically depressed as i cry and do my necessary tasks anyway. i am still starting to think multiple times a day about killing myself. whenever anything goes wrong, that gets amplified, but i can just be minding my business and suddenly realize that it would be far, far better if i were fucking dead already. i'm trying to figure out if there's anything i can do to sideline this issue before it gets to the horrible state that i expect it's heading towards again.

i still have some mild hope that this is the worst it'll get, that the adderall will somehow keep me from falling into the same black pit that lithium put me in the last time i tried it. but it also makes me wonder, how the FUCK does anyone survive getting medicated down from a manic episode?

if in theory, you're ""supposed"" to be depressed post-hypo/mania, how the fuck does anyone make it out the other side to stable? i want to be able to stay on meds long enough to see if i even \*can\* stabilize, but i get to the point of ""i can't be alone in a room with myself"" \*far\* before i get to anything resembling even mild stability. basically the best i seem able to do is stop meds, wait for everything to go back to how it was, then resume meds and have a brief window of like 2ish weeks where i'm both functional and non-suicidal.

then the suicide kicks in, gets increasingly more all-consuming, and i eventually have the choice to quit my meds or risk that i'll kill myself.

i mean, everyone can't fucking have to be hospitalized for months while they stabilize, can they? i can't fathom anything keeping me from killing myself once i get to that point \*except\* for being hospitalized and physically or chemically restrained. it gets so bad that i start planning, something i have \*never\* done when not medicated, and then i just... quit the meds at some point when i realize what's going on. because i'm naturally hypomanic, this has so far never ended in me becoming more depressed, i just swing right back up and within 1-2 days the suicidality is fully gone and i'm ok with being alive again.

which of course saves me in the fucking moment but makes it prohibitively difficult to get medicated if i cannot even reach stable without first passing through ""so violently suicidal that i know exactly where and when i'd like to do it."" is this just what happens to anyone who starts medication from an elevated state??

obviously i'm like, trying to fucking resolve this shit, but i've got no idea how to get past the suicidal stage. has anyone figured out how to skip the violently suicidal stage when you first start meds? would it be worth asking my psych to try antidepressants concurrently with starting the lithium, like we decided to attempt with the adderall? or is the suicidal stage just gonna happen no matter what, and people usually get hospitalized? i cannot be hospitalized, i am too physically disabled to find another job if i lost my current one. so i have to figure out how the hell to resolve this outpatient.

which is i guess what i'm trying to do. figure out if i can resolve this before it gets to the point where i'm afraid of myself. because right now i'm not in crisis, but i am NOT having a good fucking time.

But also... last night I just started to lose my shit a little. Out of nowhere, I seemed to have forgotten I have a smoke detector on my ceiling. The light from it was FREAKING me out. And I couldn't think of where it could possibly be coming from.

Then someone must have pulled into a driveway behind my place, like they always do, except this time when I saw the light move across my ceiling I was pretty sure it was something related to the other light it was like... idk, in my apartment with me, but somewhere I couldn't see. And the car light looked like it turned red.

To the right you have fiery mania, and the warmth is tempting for a minute. But you know if you fall that way, you‚Äôll succumb to the fire and burn up until there‚Äôs nothing left.

It‚Äôs watching your own every move to look for signs of a switch, terrified that if one comes on, it could overpower you before you even notice. 
It‚Äôs looking in the mirror and seeing a stranger. 

It‚Äôs forgetting the worst things you‚Äôve done until the moments you are crying on the bathroom floor and every mistake comes back to you like a tsunami of all the things things this disease had made you do. What it‚Äôs taken from you. What it‚Äôs taken from the people who love you. 
It‚Äôs knowing those things will never come back. 

It‚Äôs hating yourself and feeling sorry for yourself at the same time. 
It‚Äôs being so overwhelmed with your emotions you feel nauseous. 

It‚Äôs crying spells, and uncontrollable fury, and the biggest belly laughs you‚Äôve ever had (where no one else gets the joke). 
It‚Äôs realizing that the people around you can support you and love you, but they will never understand you. 
It‚Äôs knowing that you‚Äôll hurt them, over and over again. 
It‚Äôs wondering if everyone you‚Äôve ever met would be better off not knowing you. 

It‚Äôs your darkest secret and your biggest weakness.
It‚Äôs knowing you‚Äôre wearing a bomb vest at all times, and praying in every moment that it doesn‚Äôt go off without warning. 

It‚Äôs lonely and terrifying. It will take, and take, and take and never give you everything back. 
It will make you fatter, slower, weaker and dumber. It will take everything that used to make you special and light it on fire, leaving a ghost of who you used to be. 

It‚Äôs pills every morning and every night. Pink pills and white pills and blue pills and yellow pills. You swallow them every day and wish they would fix you, but they only keep the dark parts of you hidden, sometimes for a little while. It‚Äôs leaving the drugstore with 4 orange bottles after the cashier stares at you and clearly wonders how someone so young could be so fucked up. 

It‚Äôs knowing that you‚Äôll always have this darkness inside you, and even when it gets better, you‚Äôll spend every day terrified of yourself. 

It‚Äôs knowing that you are a cancer. Your presence makes everyone else worse off, and worried. It‚Äôs knowing that just by being in someone‚Äôs life you sign them up for dealing with your symptoms, whether they know it or not. 

It‚Äôs wondering how anyone could ever love you. It‚Äôs worrying every day that people will get fed up with your problems and decide to leave. It‚Äôs knowing that you are ‚Äútoo much.‚Äù 

It‚Äôs knowing that it never ends, until it all ends.",1675422781.0
943,Iritation/Anger issues after Lamotrigine,3,10sj4id,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/10sj4id/iritationanger_issues_after_lamotrigine/,3,"Hey. I'm wondering what's your experience with Lamotrigine regarding Lamotrygine. I was diagnosed bipolar in July after I made some crazy shit during hypomaniac episode. Before I was treaded for depression (Vortioxetine 20mg) and anxieaty (pregabaline 150mg). I had long history of unstable behavior and switching from being super active to very depressed, but reached for psychiatrist hepl during episode of depression so it was first diagnosis.

I have started Lamotrigine with 25mg, increased dose by 25mg every two weeks untill 200mg. It was fine for some time. Effects wasn't super strong but I felt better, more stable I would say. There where some short depression episodes back then, but wasn't so strong as before.

It was fine until I started to take around 125mg/150mg. Then episodes of irritation and anger started to happen (few days up to one  week every month). Little things, which  wouldn't cause such reactions before, started to trigger anger. During bipolar episodes I was usually self harming  (substance abuse,  etc.) or hypersexual and irresponsible during maniac. Never irritaed/angry because of minor stuff. Right now I feel urge to destroy things if I canot find some item or easly getting angry with people if they disagree with me, which I try to suppress by isolating myself.

Another thing is I started to feel like my brain is not as active as it was before. I'm rather intelligent person, quick thinker, usally able to make rapid decisions and corelate various facts. Right now I tend to forget words, events and easly loosing focus (even during watching movies, reading). I'm not native English speaker and had bery hard time to write this post, but it happens even with my native language. However, not sure if it could be caused by lamotrigine or e.g. extensive pregabaline use.

On top of that my libido dropped to zero, which I consider sometimes to be good after my hpersexuality caused me a lot of troubles. But there are times when it's problematic, as I'm in relationship right now and feel disgusted by idea of sex with other human beeing. My sex activity right now is occassional masturbation.

I'm pretty confused right now. I will definietly request lowering dose at my next appointment with psychiatrist. I'm even not sure if my assesment is correct or I'm making things up. Please share your experiences, it would be super hepful for me.",1675427200.0

My psychiatrist wants to add Vyvanse to my med regimen (currently just taking 3 mg abilify). The reason for this is to treat weight gain I have had since starting Abilify and quitting vaping.

Case and Point: My depression and mania are controlled; however, I still have racing thoughts.

I recently started sessions with a new therapist to talk about issues that I have never addressed in the past and have been dredging up shit that I have not dealt with in years.

These sessions are helping me, but my racing thoughts are now composed of the traumatic shit I am working through.

I could kill the racing thoughts by getting back on an antipsychotic, but I know I will become a zombie and be constantly sleepy, which with my job, I cannot do.

ive talked to my psych abt it but she says as long as im not going to actually attempt then its not the biggest concern, i know i wont cause im scared of the consequences like permanent damage and losing my job, and when its thrill im seeking having to stay at a place with nothing to do fucking sucks, so idk",1675402582.0

I cried in the parking lot for about an hour because I've been given this fresh start and I've fucked it up already. My supervisor came out and told me she understood and offered to move my desk.

We have so much in common not only in our past but also dreams for a future. We both felt that the other person was the only person we have ever truly connected and loved. Honestly we just felt like we were immediately two pieces to a puzzle. 

I noticed a pattern early on, long periods of depression and long periods of manic behavior in M. Even though I studied psych in school, I thought that I had no right to say anything because I am not a doctor.

In the last few months there have been 3 clear incidences of what I would call possibly a psychosis episode. He became someone different. There was a clear change in how he would speak or type. It was like a complete switch. The one episode that was in person, I literally saw his eyes darken and it was like he truly didnt know me. And although normally M communicates at a high level, his responses to things I said, didnt quite make sense or fit in the conversation we were having. 

I wont go too deep into detail. But what M says during these episodes are basically things like calling me a whore or a compulsive liar or describing me as unattractive or crazy. Its like he truly believes that I had sex with a million people in his head and that I cheated on him or something of the sort. Says that he never loved me etc. 

Also, to note, he was just barely diagnosed as bipolar at the beginning of this year. Because he went to therapy immediately after his second episode with me, that was really bad. So I feel like there is no way he is cognizant yet of how to really live with bipolar, as it was very shocking to him. 

Also, after an episode, he has never love bombed me or acted like it was okay for what he did. In fact he was distraught, said what he did was disgusting, and said that I deserve better etc. 

I know that technically what he has done would be considered abusive. And I dont condone the behavior. But I just feel like he never had unconditional love(which I know for a fact). And he is trying to hurt me to prove that I dont love him unconditionally. And prove that I am a bad person, so he can feel better for how he treated me during episodes. I want to believe that he really does love me and doesnt mean it. But maybe I am delusional for thinking that‚Ä¶ So I am asking you guys, as people who live with bipolar, if he actually believes everything he says during an episode? Or should I just discount it?

Numerous times. I could have edited that into the post there but they never even mentioned it as an option. ü§∑

It's probably best to start by saying he's not a bad person. I've known him for most of my life, and he'd gone through several full makeover personality changes, but certain core features remained. Every so often, we'd stop talking, and it's be years before I was willing to forgive him again. Originally, he was super judgemental of me, mean, and possessive (despite having no romantic or sexual interest in me). Then he became dependant. I naively helped him with the relationships he ruined via obsessive behaviour and outspoken rage, and still he'd always end up blaming me for his issues. Then, a few months later, he'd be in a bad mental state again, and would call to have me pull him out. I'm the only friend he comes to with this because he knows I can't say no to a person in pain, and I actually know how to help. And I wouldn't mind. But he uses me. While I help him with everything, all he ever helped me with was with getting rid of shitty men, which really did help, but he did that out of envy. Again, not out of desire for me, but out of actual jealousy of the amount of time I spend with them instead of him. 

Last time I sent it off, it was because he started a thing with my ride or die best friend and ended up being obsessive with her and letting his rage out on me, to the extent of inducing flashbacks and a full blown meltdown. I had a friend pick me up and informed this dude (whom I no longer saw as friend) that he can talk to me when he gets medicated, and not a second before that.

A year passed. A dangerous person we know was under investigation by the police, and the dude knew where the guy lives, so I gave the police his number, to which he responded by lashing out at me for daring to give the police his number, despite the circumstances. That was betrayal to me. He had physically protected me from this person before and was still mad that I needed his help making sure that that monster doesn't hurt anyone anymore. At this point, he was dead to me. 

Yesterday, he called me. He asked for a recommendation for a psychologist. I gave him the name of my Pdoc and told him to talk to him. A few hours go by, and he's yet again contacting me, asking that I be a shoulder to cry on. This time I refused. I told him he'd gone too far last time, and I need to know that there's something more serious in the works than just psychotherapy if I'm going to get back in touch with him. That I don't hate him, and if he is medicated I'd consider letting him back in. That's the last thing I told him.

I've had flashbacks of this toxic ass friendship ever since he called. Had trouble sleeping despite Seroquel. I kept my boundaries and didn't comfort him, and it feels bad. Worse than the disappointment. The guilt is just debilitating. I just want to have a quiet life, and I'm so fucking tired of this incessant fucking noise. üòû",1675323272.0
