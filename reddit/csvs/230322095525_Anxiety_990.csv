1,Very anxious and uncomfortable after professor made us watch their personal porn video for lecture,410,11xdlc9,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11xdlc9/very_anxious_and_uncomfortable_after_professor/,195,"update: faculty staff responded to my classmates' complaint and said that an ""investigation was completed"" and that  there was contextualization of the porn videos in the syllabus, and the video link was clearly described (explicit). I guess because it was labeled lecture (optional) it's not ""forcing us to watch it""  but it's under the section of materials you're supposed to review... not under extra supplemental links. I feel like I'm going fucking insane

&#x200B;

Copy pasted from twoxchromosomes because it's still pending approval but I need to vent/ get advice asap...I don't know where to even talk about this so please redirect me if there's a better sub for this.

For one of the classes I am taking, we are given a bunch of weekly links to content related to that week's lecture discussion. We are supposed to review all the links before the class to ensure we have good points to bring to the discussion. Well this week, there's 2 recordings of lectures where the professor plays their own homemade porn movie, along with 2 other porn clips. It's semi relevant to the sexuality theme we were talking about within this week but this feels so.... violating?

I don't even know how to feel or how to process. I am kind of numb and just laughing in shock this entire day? But there is a huge general feeling of ""bad"" but I can't identify exactly how I feel. I don't even know how to process this.

I'm very sexually open and non judgemental but I'm really disturbed at the moment. I think the fact that it felt super non consensual to be subjected to things like this with no warning felt extremely violating and I had some past sexual traumas in relation to consent so not sure if this is why I'm triggered.

Yes, some of my classmates are going to the dean tomorrow. But if anyone has any ideas for how to process this / how to move on and not let it bother me, please share. I haven't been able to get any work done today and I'm getting stressed that I can't focus.

As of 6am, I haven't been able to sleep, been panicking and feeling nauseous but I'm still really confused. Is this sexual harassment? How the hell do I cope?",1679396619.0

I get dizzy and sick just thinking about it and I get panic attacks. I'm 20 and healthy (apart from having PTSD) and I know I won't be dying soon, but I can't shake the fear once it comes over me... I think its the fear of not knowing what happens that gets me the most, and the fear of what's after death. I don't believe in an afterlife so I panic as to what it really feels like to just be gone…

Pain started in my right index finger. I thought it was because I write and type a lot so I started to rest it.

The next day, my legs were in so much pain. Now I am just feeling a bit of pain in my back. I am not really active and nothing traumatic happened to me either. I think I just have anxiety in general but these pains are really freaking me out.

I also got blood work done today so I'm waiting for the results. I shouldn't have, but I have been searching up my symptoms online and it kind of sounds like MS, with pain moving around my body.

6,For anyone struggling with fairly severe anxiety episodes - I highly recommend DBT distress tolerance skills.,3,11y2phu,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11y2phu/for_anyone_struggling_with_fairly_severe_anxiety/,0,"I recently started DBT after anxiety and depression became nearly unbearable for me, and the specific distress tolerance skills and suggestions (like hundreds of ideas about specific activities to do when feeling any kind of way) has been the most life changing thing I've learned. I know DBT is expensive and inaccessible to a lot of people, but [here is a link](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/577d2ce937c58194f7d39816/t/60c7e92fa3583448b8c6fa19/1623714139969/dbt_skills_training_handouts_and_worksheets_-_linehan_marsha_srg_.pdf) to the PDF my group uses. The distress tolerance section has a plethora of information and strategies to combat anxiety and low moods, and I highly suggest just taking a look in case anything jumps out at you. My personal favorite is the TIP acronym - cold temperatures like a cold shower or ice pack on your face, intense exercise for a brief period of time like jumping jacks for one minute, paced breathing or breath work (sometimes even fast paced breaths for thirty counts then holding as long as you can), all of which help trigger a system response that physically changes your state. Or very sour candy that distracts your brain for a second to snap out of it. Basically a bunch of tangible ideas to try out during a moment of panic. Just thought I'd share if anyone is looking for ideas. Love you all <3",1679449558.0

(Though I have that too) what I'm talking about is the fear of having something wrong with your teath. Worrying about every speck or black spot that I see.  Checking my gums constantly to make sure that they are ok.  I spend so much time in front of a mirror and a light checking to make sure there are no new signs of any dental issues.  This is on top of brushing my teeth after everytime I eat (usually). It's getting so stressful for me. To the point where I dont really have the energy to do things that I want to do or hobbies.  How the heck do I get this under control? Does anyone else suffer from this.  I think part of my fear is that A) I've had bad experiences in the past with dentists/dental work. B) I've started taking care of my teeth now but I'm worried old problems will show up. C) I don't have the finances for something to go wrong with my teeth.

Im anxious about taking meds in general and dont want to take SSRIs. Long story short, I came prepared and specifically asked for one of two meds (wellbutrin and buspar). The dr + supervising physician refused to prescribe either. One bc im at a high risk of seizures bc family history + alcoholism + other meds... that was the one I wanted most bc it does depression, anxiety, adhd, and helps w nicotine / alcohol cessation. The other one was the only other anxiety med I was willing to try and they said no bc it doesn't treat depression, only anxiety. The hypothesis is that my severe anxiety is the only reason I am able to function with slightly-less-severe depression, so they don't want to prescibe it bc the fear is if they treat the anxiety but not the depression I will quickly spiral into a deep depression.

I haven't felt this depressed in quite a while. I don't want to take an SSRI, and it feels like my only option is that or panic attacks wherein I get so stressed out my blood pressure rises high enough to give me nosebleeds like an anime character.",1679445394.0

Not sure if it helps, but when I am not able to do it easily (say when driving or holding something) I feel a bit worse if that makes sense.

 These habits have developed very randomly for me over time and seem to come out as soon as I start having symptoms of anxiety and anxious thoughts. Just thought I'd ask if any of you have any strange practices you do, maybe even as a coping mechanism or way of bracing yourself when your anxiety is heightened.

My doctor proscribed me some very low dose xanax for 10 days and also some other anxiety meds that take around 2 weeks to start working. I'm hesitant to take any of it though, I don't want to feel dependent on meds and then when i stop taking them, the anxiety comes back.

My long term girlfriend and I broke up earlier in 2022, but we would sometimes keep in touch and see each occasionally. We went to college together, but didnt date in college, so alot of her friends are my friends also. She moved 6 hrs away for a job before we broke up and that was part of why we broke up, along with other things. It was easy being with her from the friends aspect but deep down inside there were some things that really bothered me about our relationship. We always tried to make it work but it just didn't. She ended things with me, but we are on good terms.

She recently told me that she is seeing someone, and ever since then it has bothered the hell out of me and have had all this anxiety since. Its making me think did I make the right decision in pretty much agreeing to break up, to the point we spoke on the phone and she said, sorry but it's over between us.

I have gotten anxiety bouts before but its always about job deadlines or things that once over the anxiety goes away. This is different, I know my relationship with her in a romantic way is over, and the severity of this anxiety is much worse than anything I have felt. before.

Should i consider going to therapy or will just pass in due time? Thought...",1679448281.0

Another thing, I started a new job today and have bad health/emetophobia anxiety. Like to the point of panic attacks almost daily thinking of it. During orientation my HR manager said she has people out with the stomach bug right now. And I immediately started panicking. For me it’s a problem because I know work is work and I need to learn to hold my composure better and cope with my anxious thoughts but I don’t really know how. Does anyone know any extra precautions I can take to prevent getting sick? 

And the last thing, I have been thinking about taking my medication again. I was on 50mg of zoloft and it was helping because it didn’t really make me feel anything at all. It was nice to be numb and not have to worry. I had stopped taking it in august due to a bad panic attack I had about an hour after I took it one night.

I saw soooo many posts on Reddit & TikTok of people with the same symptoms & people posting that this was all anxiety or health anxiety. Because of this, I waited way too long to push my doctor to look into my health issues more. I just diagnosed myself with anxiety because so many others were saying they had the same issues.

5 months later of taking Propranolol, I'm still not feeling much better, I finally said enough was enough & pushed for an MRI. Well, the MRI showed that I have a large, but non-cancerous, pineal cyst on my brain that is causing those symptoms. NOT ANXIETY. I'm now waiting for my appointment with a Neurosurgeon to possibly have brain surgery. I am not trying to freak anyone out, but please guys, get checked. Push for testing if you feel in your gut that something isn't right. These symptoms can definitely be anxiety, but they might be something more. Especially if you're dizzy 24/7...

All of my muscles clench so hard that sometimes my abdomen begins to hurt. It usually appears to be related to feeling cold, but not always. For example, I had a cat attacked by a stray dog a little while back, and before I could do anything to help her I nearly fell to the ground I got these “chills” so bad. I had to sit down and take a bunch of deep breaths before I could function.
I couldn’t even look at her or I’d just start shaking worse. 

I think the correlation to the cold is psychological. I walk into a cold room or get out of my warm bed and it starts, but usually only when I’m worried that it might happen to begin with.

I have always been extremely shy, social + health anxiety, low confidence, never had a girlfriend, no friends since I moved to a different part of the country when I was about 22. Over time I think I have been able to numb it down, creating explanations and reasonings in my mind, and used video games as an escape. For the last 10 years or so, my life have been:

&#x200B;

\- Wake up and eat breakfast

\- Go to work

\- Come home and shower

\- Make and eat dinner

\- Some kind of workout

\- Sit at computer

\- Sleep and repeat

\- Every other weekend I visit my mom, who I spend quality time with and help out since she has a condition that keeps her from doing many things herself

&#x200B;

But a week ago i was hit like a truck with massive depression and anxiety, realizing what my life have been these last 10 years. I feel like I have wasted so much time, especially on the weekends where I was at home doing nothing, instead of going to my mom or just doing anything productive. I got thoughts about existential dread, death and what our purpose really is. I got crushing anxiety about my mom dying and me not spending enough time with her, and also because she is the only person in the world that truly knows me, understands me and that I can be myself with. 

&#x200B;

I feel like an alcoholic over 10 years who just suddenly stopped drinking from one day to the next - now the video games do nothing for me, I can't ""escape"" and I'm lost for purpose. My appetite is very unstable and my mind is racing, especially when I try to sleep, which has led to sleepless nights with my heart racing in panic and having constant disaster thoughts that I can't stop. I keep thinking ""Am I sick? Am I going insane? Do I have a brain tumor?"" and many more thoughts of that kind. I also get this weird feeling somethimes of being ""disconnected"" or ""dissociated"" to the world. I become hyper-aware of my existence and my actions and thoughts and it makes everything feel weird. In this state, I feel like im ""acting"" like myself, when I'm with others - like I'm something unexplainable controlling this physical body or seeing the world from a 3rd person view. Has anyone else experienced this or gone though something similar?

52,Would all this be caused by anxiety?,1,11xzvrj,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11xzvrj/would_all_this_be_caused_by_anxiety/,0,"Hello everyone I'm a 20 year old Caucasian male. 5""9 155lbs. I don't smoke, i don't drink alcohol nor use any drugs. 

So it's been almost 1.5 years that I've developed some strange symptoms, that have really deteriorated my life.

They basically started after i caught covid (i was vaccined prior with the j&j vaccine). Since then, i get heart pains all the time. They happen multiple times a day and usually last a few minutes before they go away. I've been to 2 different cardiologists who ran an EKG and echo and said that everything was fine. I also had a  48 hour Holter monitor that showed some pvc's (200/a day),but docs weren't concerned at all. 

Also after covid my WBC are basically running around the 11-13k range (before that CBC's would come back fine). They were fine before i got infected, but it's been almost 1.5 year that they won't go down. My lymphocytes are also high (45-50) and neutrophils low 35-40). Everything else comes back completely fine. I went to a hematologist and he run some tests for malignancies(leukemia) but they came back negative. 

One of the worst symptoms also is the spasms I've been getting all over my body. They can happen literally anywhere and they always last a few seconds before they go away. I've searched a lot about them and i guess it's most likely BFS (benign fasciculation syndrome). But it never stops. I think my nerve system has been permanently damaged. 

Lastly i get random aches in my stomach and usually at the upper left abdominal region. I've had an abdominal echo and it was fine. But i get random shooting pains along with painful gasses. These are the symptoms I've been dealing with the past 1.5 year. They're all so random and I can't connect them somehow. High WBC usually mean infection, so I'm guessing that an autoimmune disease might have been triggered?

I've also found a lump in my arm. It's been there for 1.5 year as well, i showed it to my gp and he said that it's a lipoma, but it's still there. It hasn't grown but it hurts sometimes. Things like sarcoma drive my mind crazy. It feels like my body is constantly trying to kill me. 

The whole thing is causing me so much anxiety and stress. I thought that things would get better with time, but no, nothing has changed and it's been so long. I'm only 20 years old and I'm afraid that I'm gonna drop dead by a heart attack or cancer. I used to be an athlete but i stopped after all these, because i became afraid. I honestly can't live like this anymore. I've visited more than 5 doctors and nobody has a clue. Any ideas?",1679443386.0
53,How I am *almost* over my Health Anxiety,4,11xm2wd,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11xm2wd/how_i_am_almost_over_my_health_anxiety/,2,"Quick intro:
3 years a go I had an incident in the shower that mimicked a stroke. I came out of it unharmed but it messed me up psychologically. Ever since then my body takes any feeling it gets and goes into panic mode. Now i hate driving, i hate taking a shower, i hate exercising. You name it, if i makes me hot, i get anxious. At onc point i was so anxious showering i had to sit down and hold on for dear life the entire time i was in there.

Now i'm about 80% over it. and form my experience the only way over it - is to go through it. And what i mean by that is you need to face this demon head on. I know its the last thing you want to hear but trust me. If you never face it you will be running forever.

However it will take time for your brain to rewrite its default path ways. So at the moment the default behavior is fear, and to curl up and say please dont hurt me. So your brain interprets it as a threat and will spiral out of control causing all sorts of symptoms the worst of which being a panic attack.

Now next time you start getting the fear coming on try this instead. Say to your fear out loud ""Just kill me then"" ""Bring it on"" ""Lets see what you can do"" and taunt your fear and let what ever you think is going to happen happen. by wanting the what ever it is you are afraid of to happen will make the fear vanish.

Another thing to think. If you were to say have a heart attack it would just happen... whether you worried or not. Worrying isnt going to some how miraculously save you.

At my lowest - the turning point for me was when i just thought i'd rather be dead than to feel like this anymore. and from then on i basically laid down my life to my fear and said just kill me. Kill me now or shut the fuck up. I needed to hit rock bottom so I could rebuild my brain the right way. and for a few weeks i just kept saying ""Kill me now or shut up"" over and over until my brain started using the new default behavior. 

It can take months to retrain your brain and then add years on that to fully forget. but this is what is working for me.

TLDR: Taunt your fear. egg it on. call it out. ask it to do its worst even if it kills you. Let it flow through you and out the other side I bet nothing bad happens

TLDR 2: If you were going to die it would just happen... whether you worried or not. Worry isnt going to some how miraculously save you",1679416190.0

The anxiety I experienced was like nothing I’ve ever felt in my life, I felt as if I was being crucified on a daily basis.  This created symptoms in me that have cause me serious concern, it was usually real light and manageable at first and I thought it was just me going into fight or flight. It starts with a really intense vibration in my hands, and then as it increases it goes into my arms and my hands become paralyzed with this extremely intense vibration.

This went on periodically and never to a level where I thought I needed to go to the hospital, it would usually only last for like 5 minutes.  

Today I went to a colonoscopy appointment and they needed to put me under. As soon as they put in the iv I felt my hand start to vibrate and lock up. It wasn’t bad at first and didn’t mention it to the doctor. They took me into the operation room and all seemed fine until they started administering the anesthesia, the vibration traveled through my arms and into my entire body. I completely seized up and couldn’t move anything at all, everything was locked up to the point where it was physically hurting. I thought I was going to die, I thought something went wrong and I was having to accept that I was going to die it was so intense. I blacked out after that and woke up fine. The doctor came and told me it was all anxiety induced and that he’d only seen something like that one other time in his decade of experience. I just don’t understand.

And a lot of times, I just nervously ramble off topic or take things too literally.

My brain is literally overthinking whenever I speak at work. How do I deal with this? Any advice on how to make small talk without being awkward?",1679413270.0
66,how do i calm down when i get anxious while studying?,5,11xigww,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11xigww/how_do_i_calm_down_when_i_get_anxious_while/,5,"due to mental health i've been slightly struggling with uni studies lately. part of why i'm mentally not doing well is because i've grown up with a rather abusive father and one of the things that he's really forced on me has been to do well in studies, like that's just something that's been going on since i started school

so this brings me to how extremely anxious i get while studying which usually is at home. it can take a while or it can take a few minutes but majority of the times i get so extremely anxious or just straight up have a panic attack in the middle of it. the part that causes this isn't that 'if i don't study well enough and pass this or that exam i'll struggle even more with uni' but 'if i don't study well enough and pass this or that exam i'll en up in trouble by my dad'

ultimately i know it's always gonna be 'study for your own sake, not anyone else's' but after growing up with a father that's so abusive in so many ways, it's hard to not make that association and just break out until i can't even focus on studying

so my question is, making that association or not, does anyone have any advice on how i at the very least can calm down or put myself at ease when this happens while studying?",1679408840.0

So i have been suffering from awful derealization/depersonalisation, anxiety, ocd, and panic attacks for a couple of years now but it’s always come and gone. Ever since last year after going through a traumatic event it’s shifted my entire life to now only being able to focus on my anxiety. there are days that i get better and days where i have bad flair ups. I actively go to therapy and have recently started seeing a psychiatrist and nutritionist to see if i could figure out how to solve all these issues especially the derealization as it causes me to feel so out of it and almost high 24/7 as it has been prevalent for the last year especially now. I have been prescribed zoloft before but I had the absolute worst adverse reaction to it and has made me terrified to start any ssris. Recently my psychiatrist had prescribed me prozac but my therapist and nutritionist advise me against it as they do not think that my case is that severe. Where I am currently having an issue with is the fact that my biggest fear/ocd trigger is not feeling normal such as the fear of weed and I typically stay away from alcohol as I do not like how i feel when I drink. I am so scared to start meds or even vitamins that contain magnesium because I am so afraid of the “high” feeling or derealization feeling but now don’t know where to go from here.

\- My eyes look ugly and intense when I am anxious, and I hate eye contact when like this.

\- Haven't been able to orgasm for many years due to constantly rushing my thoughts.

\- Struggle with eye contact when anxiety is high or confidence is low.

\- Find it hard to show natural emotions, like smile etc. It's faked.

\- I am use to routines.

I want to overcome the above naturally. I do exercise and have gone out on walks each week either by myself or with parents / family. I try various natural supplements that might just help. The latest I am trying is lithium.

I have no excuses anymore. I've been telling myself that once I move closer to a gym, once I get a good daily routine in, once I get a job that starts later, so on and so forth... well the stars aligned and I got a gym membership! No more excuses.

Except I've got some sort of gymphobia. I have always felt this way, even went a couple times as a teenager with my dad. I was freaked out then, too.

I went once with my boyfriend right after I got the membership and I wanted to cry the ENTIRE TIME. I was SO self-conscious, to the point it affected my movements. I wasn't focusing on lifting, I was focusing on being quiet, who could see me, how light my weights were, etc. I stared at the clock, couldn't talk louder than a whisper, clung to his side... It was a massive relief to leave and I subconsciously let out a huge sigh the minute the door shut behind us.

Tried going just to treadmill the other day, walked in and went straight to the bathroom because I was so ANXIOUS! There was only one treadmill being used but I was so worried he'd see me trying to figure it out. I got so shakey and almost started crying again so I left the bathroom and went straight home. 

I know for the sake of my mental health I need to overcome this, even if I find out the gym just isn't for me. This is absolutely my anxiety, particularly social anxiety and body dysphoria. What makes me anxious -

- being near other people working out (?!?!)

- seeing my reflection in the mirror

- using light weights (THEY ARE ALL LIGHT so I am just constantly anxious lmao)

- how long it takes me to set up/figure out a machine

- maybe someone else needs what I have and they are annoyed with me

- someone else using what I want and not know what to sub

- anyone talking to me in any capacity lmao

- my form (I'm new so logically I know it'll be incorrect but other people may judge me)

I'm tempted to shell out money for a personal trainer and a therapist. I'm sick of my anxiety and my body as it is, but I wanted to hear yalls advice.

Since this has been causing me so much anxiety forever, and it directly relates to my body dysphoria and anxiety, I feel like overcoming this is going to be a HUGE breakthrough for my mental health. I'd really appreciate your insight.Thank you!",1679423984.0

Hope you're all doing alright today :) 

I've suffered from overthinking and general anxiety for a while. Being in my final year of university has been overwhelming to the point where I started seeking professional help. My doctor prescribed some beta blockers to me and asked me to take them when necessary - I've not thought of taking them until today.

I think I hit my breaking point today. I have way too much to do and I haven't been able to manage things well. I felt some aches and tightness in my chest and throat, got cold hands and feet, and starting stress sweating (the smell was putrid). I could also feel my heart pounding in my chest. I decided to check my heart rate and I was surprised to find out that it was in the mid 50s. I didn't take my first dose of beta blockers and I'm waiting to speak to my doctor tomorrow.

89,Was this sexual abuse?,7,11xd5ln,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11xd5ln/was_this_sexual_abuse/,13,"I’m (F25) not sure how to write this. I’ve never put down my memories to paper let alone tell anyone. A family member would do certain things between (from what little I can remember) the ages of 7-15. These things made me feel uncomfortable and I asked multiple times for it to stop to no avail. I want to protect their identity so calling them X.

1. X never let me lock the bathroom door when I shower X walks right in and has conversations with me even though the shower doors are see-through. This still happens now at 25yo. I used to lock the door when I was younger but X would use a coin to open the door and would leave it wide open so I just stoped locking the door and forget to every time now. 

2. X have always sneaked up the stairs and burst into my room on purpose. Dispute multiple times asking X to knock. If I’m just out a shower and wearing a towel I’ll always ask X to leave but X scoffs as if I should be less embarrassed and I’m weak for being embarrassed about being naked. 

3. When I was younger if I would touch myself X would take enjoyment from bursting into my room and surprising me and made me feel dirty and mentally fucked up for doing so. X would also watch through a crack in the door (caught them sometimes) before bursting in. 

4. X would ask to see my breasts and say it was to compare mine to theirs and any time I said I didn’t want to I was made to feel silly for being embarrassed like it was no big deal. 

5. X used to ask me to shower with them. Well over the age I needed anyone to wash my hair. Still asking me at 15. X would again scoff if I said no and plead for me to join them as if I was not wanting quality time with them. 

6. X flashes me (still does) and leaves the door to the bathroom wide open when they shower and sometimes calls me over to chat with them on purpose as if they want to see my reaction to seeing them naked. 

7. X would insist on checking me ‘down there’ when I was younger and would put cream on me saying there was a rash but I never saw one. I remember getting older and being adamant that I could do it myself but X got furious with me. 

8. X gets into my bed without asking when I’m in bed or when I’m not and asks me to cuddle them in their bed and gets angry when I say no. 


The next two are hard for me to type…I don’t feel ready but this platform has been really supportive so far so here goes. For content X definitely physically abused me and still emotionally abuses me and I think they are narcissistic.  


9. Growing up and even sometimes now I go into a childlike mind and put on a higher pitched child like voice (this cringes me so much so please don’t say anything nasty about this). Once when I was around 16 I was hugging X in their bed and was in this childlike state. They played into it and said ‘aww my baby, do you want to suck milk’ and I for some disgusting reason that bothers me to this day I nodded and X got their breasts out and I ….I can’t type the rest but I don’t think I need to.

10. Again difficult to put down to writing. This one I don’t know if it’s in my head. When I was younger X would ask me to sit on their lap. I would feel (or think I did) them pushing up their private part on my body. I would feel uncomfortable and would sit in a different position but it would keep happening and I learnt to ignore it. 

Sorry for the left hoy post but because this is not obvious or classic case of sexual abuse (I think) I’m just unsure if it was. I know this person would take it very badly if they knew I was thinking this and I feel like I’m betraying that persons honour or something. 

(Context : been depressed since 11/12  and after experiencing panic attacks for the first time at 25 I finally told a doctor and I’m on a waiting list to get help for pdsd (unsure if that’s what I have) and I don’t know if it’s worth mentioning this if it’s stupid or a lie or if I am even able to).

I have been blessed with the ability to freak myself right the F\*$& out whenever i think about a host of different topics... anxiety. Now most of these topics ive been able to find categories for, and address in that way, by learning about those things, bettering my understanding of them, and really evaluating exactly what it is that im afraid of. For example, i am a hypochondriac, i have lived with health anxiety for as long as i can remember, but its very easy to find out what health anxiety is, you can easily find other peoples experiences, common coping mechanisms, potential causes for this anxiety, etc. This is the case with almost anything i find myself consistently anxious about.

Now,

One of the darkest corners in my mind that i try to stay out of as much as possible, is one that i cant get a lot of information on, and because of this, i don't know how to move forward in addressing this.

This anxiety / fear is triggered by thoughts of existence, reality, the thought of consciousness... trying to wrap my mind around what it is that I'm experiencing just by being alive in the first place. A good example thought of this would be this:

Whether you are reading this on a computer or phone or tablet... stop and take a second to think about what is between your eyes reading this, and the screen Infront of you, now i don't mean the air, pollen, dust, particles etc. that occupies that space, but the f#$%ing space itself. How? why is that there? what is that occupying? how did it get there?

I experience symptoms of derealization / depersonalization disorder that I've observed are closely related to my thoughts like this, Hell I believed when I was 17 until 20 I was falling into psychosis due to my relentless obsessing over the unanswerable. Its not even one specific mind-F#$\* that does this to me, it's the combination of all of them that represent what we call ""reality"" or ""existence"" that i cant tune out, and the more i try to research these things in my life, the more questions that are left unanswered. i can barely hold conversations with people because of how often i just go blank, returning to being consumed with mulling these things over, IN THE MIDDLE OF CONVERSATIONS.

I feel like most people are able to just curb these thoughts as ""unimportant"" or just set them aside because there's no way to answer things like that at the moment. Boy do i wish i could do just that. Thoughts like this are 25/8 on my mind, I mean I DREAM about inexplicable things that could never be answered, and i wake up, open my eyes and wonder what is this plane of existence that I'm experiencing? how do i retain my persona, my memories, my trains of thought, all of my experiences after so many years? How do i face any interaction, any experience, any leaf that lands Infront of me on a walk without my mind jumping to the probability of these things happening? And then wondering how I'm even able to question that in the first place?

This has not been a mid-life crisis, rather it has been a whole-life drain. I have never been afraid of the 18 wheeler next to me on the freeway, yet i have always been afraid of the inevitable heat death of the universe. Why am I like this?",1679416762.0

103,Quick change in anxiety symptoms?!,1,11xsho3,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11xsho3/quick_change_in_anxiety_symptoms/,2,"Hi guys,

I've experienced anxiety for a long time now (26F), I'd say at least 8 years. Symptoms have always been tight chest, heart going a million miles an hour, the occasional panic attack. 

I've always managed it quite well, have a decent job and can interact with people fairly well. 

I've never let it stop me doing anything as then I'd feel like it has beat me.

As of 3 weeks ago (it was literally one day fine and the next.. NOT FINE!), I got on the train to go to work and felt like I was going to throw up. My mouth was watering and heart felt like it was in my throat. At first I thought it was food poisoning and something was physically amiss. 

Even though I haven't thrown up and logic would indicate I'm not going to, it feels like I genuinely am on the verge everytime I am in a moving vehicle. 

I thought it would pass, but it's now just part of my everyday life and I'm finding it debilitating. I'm scared I'll lose my job because of it, which is feeding into the anxiety even more. The only way I can get through a train journey (or any moving vehicle for that matter) is by closing my eyes and putting on Bob Marley through my headphones. It's quite comedic but it genuinely is the only way I can slightly manage it. 

I've never enjoyed the commute and have done it for ages, but now it's became a THING. 

I have to have a plastic bag with me at all times as the urge to throw up is so real. 

Has anyone else experienced a sudden and drastic change in anxiety symptoms, how do you manage them? I'm scared I'll be this way forever.",1679428849.0
104,Constant anxiety and have lost feelings for partner?,4,11xfdhb,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11xfdhb/constant_anxiety_and_have_lost_feelings_for/,1,"Okay so there's a lot for me to go through here, and I have to apologise as it is hard for me to explain things as it's hard for me to even understand what's going on in my brain!

I've been with my partner now coming up to 2 years in May, wonderful healthy relationship where there are no issues whatsoever, I'll preface this by saying I have struggled with mental health on and off throughout my life, mainly being anxiety so I have been on Fluoxetine (anti depressants) for the last 2 years, this has been great for me and has helped me to regulate my emotions and feelings quite well and to what I believe has helped my relationship with my partner to flourish and I have felt genuinely happy.

Anyway, cutting to now... Since the very (very) start of the year, just after new years... (obviously) I noticed a lot of anxiety... although it may of been creeping in a few weeks before, It was as though now I felt it full blast, and my inner voice kept telling me that my boyfriend was interested in someone else, and I was then getting strong feelings of them cheating although there was no indication of this, I think on new years eve I had noticed my boyfriend getting on well with his mates and watching one of his friends who is a girl sing (he's a musician and i know the following sounds daft, believe me) so the next day I kept getting intrusive thoughts of that moment and feeling very sensitive around it, as I'm quite insecure and never sing and I know my boyfriend would love it if I came out my shell more in that way (although he's always telling me how perfect I am) It kept going through my mind that he should be with someone like that...

fast forward a few days, I'm still feeling VERY on edge and feel incredibly anxious when my boyfriend isn't really showing me that much affection, or is in his room for long periods of time... I get very panicky and can't seem to calm myself until I go upstairs to see what he's up to, if he's just sat there on his phone with his door shut I assume that he's not wanting to be with me (even though I think having our own space is healthy and have never had an issue with it before) after seeing him just sat there I'll get incredibly upset and more anxious and feel very emotional, may even start crying and it's difficult to stop, I suddenly view my boyfriend very differently?

I'll also mention now that I was never like this at any other point of our relationship, I just started feeling this intense anxiety since new years, also I'll mention that I'm a very sensitive person and feel as though I pick up on other peoples emotions very easily and that I do that a lot with my boyfriend if he is feeling down about himself etc, I also feel these emotions.

As the days went on I stopped getting these anxious feelings when he wasn't always around, but still felt bad anxiety and feeling depression creeping in, as the days progressed I noticed myself becoming more sensitive to things and even hyperaware? (think that's the word) which would cause more anxiety for me, my boyfriend may say something and I would take it in a negative way and feel offended by it and it would cause a lot of hurt and then anxiety is even worse... I would have a lot of moments of just emotional outbursts of crying and finding it difficult to stop just feeling very overwhelmed and so uncomfortable in how i'm feeling, even gagging from what felt like stress and not being able to eat (I'm feeling this pretty much everyday)

the past month and a bit I've been having internal thoughts such as ""I don't love you"" and other horrible things directed at my boyfriend which cause me so much anxiety and even more stress as I try to convince myself they are just thoughts and not real, having suddenly no feelings towards him? getting irritated at little things but still feeling intensely sad over the thought of him with someone else, this person is perfect in my eyes and I love all the things about them that are considered imperfections, where have my feelings gone? It's been over a month and I'm scared they won't return because I know this relationship when I'm not feeling this way, is so good for me and has been the best thing for my life.

I'll quickly mention that I'm 23 now and had a relationship when I was 14 that brought a lot of the very same feelings up but this happened very early on in the relationship (a month or so) with much breaking up and getting back together due to my anxiety and depression.

I'm sorry for the essay but it's really hard to fit everything in, but this is just the summary of it...

Please can I get real responses with this, I really want to make this relationship work and stop this anxiety and emotional stress and be able to feel these feelings again for my partner... I'd hate to think that it's over now.",1679401681.0

I haven't talked to him about this because this is technically not a his issue and I hate burdening others with my anxiety. He has reassured me everyday and I don't want to ask for more. I feel like this is something I need to figure out on my own.

An Australian named Ben. What was the movie? What was the movie???” and my heart will start racing and my breathing will get shallow and I’ll need to get up and walk around. 
Another example might be for me to see a photo of myself reading and I’ll obsess, wanting to figure out what the title of the book is that I’m reading. 
I might also obsess wondering what a logo on a shirt is, who was that guy that I helped with a flat tire that seemed so familiar, etc. 
You know how sometimes people will hear a song and not know what it is and they’ll say, “What IS that song? It’s going to drive me nuts?” For me it feels like that “going to drive me nuts” thing is for real.

I was all for it, they’re family and I love em, but just existing in this group chat is giving me some major anxieties. It also doesn’t help that I have absolutely nothing in common with any of them.

They said we would be sending each other memes but every meme they’ve sent so far have been the most unfunny monotonous tiktok reaction videos I’ve ever seen. I don’t even know how to respond to them so so far I just haven’t. Now after about 3 days the group chat is silent and I feel like they’ve silently moved on. I just know it’s going back to the usual where I only ever talk to them at family gatherings, which is another awkward thing I’m going to stress about. I really am at a loss of how to handle myself, and I fear that if I eventually get into a group chat of other friend groups it’ll go the same way. I’ve tried joining discords before of varying sizes in the past, but nowadays everyone types so fast and gets their thoughts out in seconds.

I myself have also struggled with mild anxiety or depression in the past, as well as a brief but somewhat severe ED many years ago, but nothing ever officially diagnosed or bad enough to get diagnosed or treated for a part from some counselling. However in the past few months my anxiety have been ramped up to the max, with the feeling of my heart pushing against my chest for the silliest little fears- giving me insomnia or making me feel sick etc. It’s doing as much as I write this.

I have been feeling kind of lonely lately.

There are various types of toxicity, including  emotional, physical, mental, and social toxicity, that can have a  negative impact on both the individual and those around them. Some ways  toxicity can affect ADHD individuals include impairment of focus and  concentration, increased impulsiveness, exacerbation of ADHD symptoms,  and heightened emotional reactivity. To deal with a toxic person, it is  vital to safeguard yourself by establishing boundaries, using coping  mechanisms, keeping your environment organised, limiting exposure,  finding support, and seeking professional help.

It  may be necessary to walk away from a toxic person if they consistently  bring negativity, undermine your self-esteem, demand your time and  energy without providing support, habitually manipulate you, or  prioritize their own needs over yours. Signs of a toxic person include  being excessively critical and negative, attempting to control or  manipulate others, being jealous or possessive, constantly needing  attention and approval, frequent mood swings or outbursts of anger,  making others feel guilty or inferior, isolating themselves from others,  refusing to take responsibility for their own actions, and blaming  others for their problems. It is important to recognize these signs and  seek help if you find yourself in a toxic relationship.

So besides my work life, I have potential academic plans. I love studying, reading, writing. I have so many ambitions with all these things I want to write. I might even publish them. I spend a lot of time-effort on these studies I do on my personal life.

The weird thing is, whenever I go into focused studying, the idea that I will die anyways comes to my mind. I start to feel like this effort is for nothing, that I will die eventually, maybe even soon. I read about these scholars of the past, and see that some of them died so young. What will all this information help me with if I am going to die anyways? Will I have enough time to categorize-interpret-publish so much knowledge?

Anyways, lots of anxious thoughts suddenly rush to my mind about mortality. I had this back in uni as well. I remember when I studied a lot during my masters, I would always start thinking about my mortality and whether all the work I do is even worth it....

Is there a scientific explanation to this? Why would studying in a focused manner put me in such an  existential crisis each time?

Hey there! I hope this is the right place to post about this. I don't know anyone irl who deals with so much anxiety so here we go.

Since last summer I've been dealing with a lot of intrusive/obsessive thoughts about my relationship/my partner/me etc which caused a lot of anxiety. From july all the way through december I felt like I was going crazy. I felt so much anxiety and so much emotional pain to the point where I thought I couldn't function properly. I would've done anything to stop feeling anything at all. And everything between me and my partner was fine, I didn't have any reason to feel like this.

In january I started to feel a bit better (anxiety wise), but I started to self harm again (I don't do this constantly, only once or twice every few months I guess). In january and february I felt so sad and so numb that I didn't care about anything anymore. I think I also experience suicidal thoughts but I am very afraid to die so idk if I actually do experience them. I still feel a little bit anxious and I do experience self harm thoughts here and there but overall I can function decently. 

I've never been to a psychiatrist or psychologist and so idk where I should start. The thing is, therapy is very expensive and I can't afford it right now. I could afford going to a psychiatrist tho, but i don't know if my situation is that bad in order to reach out to a psychiatrist. I am scared they won't take me seriously and that they will tell me to go to therapy instead.

I noticed my anxiety over the past couple months has gotten worse. I used to maintain decently w cbd here and there, but I find that I'm getting frustrated or my fight or flight is seriously kicking in






For context, just shopping in a store the other day. I'm reaching for a can of food and my bf is near me. Suddenly, a middle aged man w a cart barrels through towards me and an employee is inches from me, reaching for items directly below me. I suddenly moved so I wouldn't be touched or run over by this guy w the cart. No 'pardon me' 'excuse me', nothing.



This morning I come to do my laundry at my local laundromat. I usually chat w a little old lady here but she usually gets in my personal space to clean literally crumbs from the floor.



I am putting laundry in and I'm suddenly butt-to-butt with the laundry attendant, a woman comes in w a body bag sized laundry bag and almost hits me w it and I try to back up and the laundry woman is directly behind me, inches behind me




I finished loading the laundry and went to my car for a deep breath. I called my bf to vent and he understands mostly how I feel. I also am starting to feel like an emotional burden to him.



Idk how to cope anymore. I feel like I'm on edge all the time.
Any tips would be amazing. I don't have health insurance so I can't be seen by a doctor anytime soon

Then my friends call asking if we want to hang out with them and I’m like bf is already going out. At this point I freak out. Urgent social interaction and I would have to ask bf for a ride. No I don’t want to bother him. 

I feel stupid that I wanted to go out so bad. But when I was offered another chance to go out I declined because I was too scared of everything. 

I was too scared to ask to go with him

I was to scared to ask for a ride 

I was too scared to go to an unplanned social event

Tomorrow I have a planned social event and now I feel so insecure. It just feels like a cycle. Why can’t I just do these things?

EDIT: next day and I found out he got a ride for once since he’s always DD so I couldn’t have asked for a ride anyway. 

If I had asked for a ride I think it would have been worse because he would have felt pressured to drive me which again would not be great since he asked for space a while back. 

I was feeling like the call was a sign to go out and I didn’t. So I was feeling down on myself for choosing to miss out. But now that I know I probably could not have gotten a ride anyway somehow I feel better lmao

I am 22 yo and I've been studying to become a lawyer for the past 6 years.

I'm on the verge of finishing my studies and I ask myself: what's the point?

How are we supposed to keep living as if things were normal, as if Society was not rushing towards a brick wall?

I've been worried about the environment for years, especially feeling helpless and seeing governments and multinationals not giving a damn.

In order not to be crushed with worry, I held onto the idea that, at worse, our generation would be okay and it's the next one which would suffer the big consequences.

In reality, it's hard to be that optimistic, especially as IPCC reports get more serious and worrying every time they're issued.

The idea that Society is on the verge of collapse feels more realistic as time goes by. I'm scared that it will not be able to adapt to climate change, that we will die or live in a post-apocalyptic world.

I'm scared and I feel helpless, especially as a future lawyer because I don't see the use in lawyers in such a situation. I'm feeling depressed because I feel like my studies are pointless. I don't see how lawyers can be useful to save the world.

Hey all, 
For context I’m 17F and in week 4 of 1L, so have just started law school. 

However, these past three years, but specifically last year was so hard on me. On top of enormous pressure and performing at a ridiculous standard in high school to get into law, my grandpa who had been battling with a brain tumour died 3 days before my first exam. These exams were the ones that dictated whether or not I’d get into university. For some background, my grandpa was like my father to me. When I was younger especially, my dad wasn’t home often as he was constantly working as a lawyer and would get home really late so I wouldn’t see him. As a result, my grandparents looked after me and I spent countless hours with them, and still see my grandma every week. As you can imagine, his death was possibly the most devastating thing for me. Seeing someone so articulate and intelligent being unable to move nor speak to you was so hard, but I had to push it all aside and after burying him in the ground, I went into school - no literally, 30 minutes after the burial I had to go to school for final exam prep. 

Anyways, this was in November of 2022. I got through exams, and for the first time in what felt like forever I felt happy at Christmas. My mind was clear, I was surrounded by family and didn’t have any responsibilities. I even managed to stop anti depressants for my anxiety which had been bad from 2020-2022 but especially ramped up in the period of his deaths to the point where I got through my days with whiskey and beta blockers. 

So I had a brief intermission of calm. I was happy for about 3 weeks till about February this year until it all came rushing back. Anxiety, panic attacks, derealization. Just like that put back on 10 mg of lexapro, which I’ve been on for just under 4 weeks. The trigger? Possibly University. Being back in an educational context with such high stakes and workload such as law may have caused this relapse. But I decided I’d push through, and have one to uni these past four weeks with the help of beta blockers. It’s been probably one of the most difficult weeks since my grandpa died. Exhaustion, unable to leave the house without terrible anxiety and just loss of ability to enjoy anything. I’ve spoke to my therapist and he thinks I need a break from study and need some time to actually relax and process to allow my body o heal. 

Besides the mental strain I’ve been under, there’s also been physical and health issues I’ve been dealing with, being hyperthyroidism, and as of a week ago, iron deficiency. Seems like my body wants me to stop, but I don’t want to. Studying gives me a sense of purpose, of validation. 

I guess all I ask for is for some advice please. This is a big decision for me and I really just want someone to talk to and hear me. Thank you in advance :)",1679359266.0
196,Since December,3,11x3v91,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11x3v91/since_december/,3,"I had a complete breakdown in December, nearly a month to the day after writing my mom out of my life.  I am mid 30s, and my therapist said I have two ptsd triggers from childhood trauma, with my mother being the largest chunk.

The ER trip in December involved barking ""Help"" but feeling like I wasn't the one saying it, and randomly losing consciousness due to hyperventilating, and intense heart palpitations.

The heart palpitations and hyperventilating happened about 7 years ago as well, and I remember doing similar when I was a young kid.

I had another panic attack last week, and my anxiety has been up and down.  Hydroxyzine for panic instances, and prozac to keep me level.

My mind instantly goes to the worst places when my anxiety is high:  it's a stroke, a heart attack, a tumor, an uncurable/unknown disease.

Thanks to therapy, I'm no longer depersonalizing/derealizing, but this just means that staying in the moment involves powering through intense heart palpitations, fear, and cold/hot feelings.

The medication brought back a handful of dreams for the first time in more than a decade or two, but only for a week.  But now, I have had a handful of ""simple"" auditory hallucinations, such as a drum beat, a beeping sound, or the sound of water pouring, all of which are coming from in my head.

Has anyone had a similar mental breakdown after removing someone like a parent?  Work has been a stressor too, but my mom was the trigger, and work was the icing.  For months before this, I was frequently tired and not hungry at all, and always stressed at work, and had a short temper.

I just want to feel normal.  Right now, things are generally ok, but when that spiraling anxiety occurs, it's really hard to break free and feel like I'm staying sane.",1679364839.0

Also experience nausea before any social setting/event no matter how small, every single time. I also have car anxiety where I do not want to drive and am terrified when I ride with others. 

Been on SSRIS for years, they never work. And when I say don’t work I mean I couldn’t tell you if I was taking a tik tac or my medicine, I genuinely wouldn’t know the difference. Been on lexapro, buspar, Wellbutrin and maybe a few others. My psychiatrist finally decided anxiety is the root, not depression so I don’t need a ssri. 

I’m prescribed .5 a day, half or the whole thing twice a day. Took half of .5 for the first month and tbh I didn’t notice anything. Doctor told me maybe I need to take the full .5 twice a day, so I’ve been doing that and still don’t feel like it’s doing much. Am I immune to medications lol??? I still have anxious thoughts and feelings, I’ll say though maybe the feeling of nausea before social settings has gone away but other than that I feel like my anxiety is still very present ): 

Side note, very very far fetched side note, a thought that I’ve had is maybe, just maybe, ADHD is causing my anxiety? And this is why these medications aren’t working? I’ve read adhd can cause anxiety disorders.

Long term Klonopin??

I am a 20 y/o male with fairly bad anxiety. Have tried every ssri in the book none of them work and give me horrible side effects. 

My anxiety is as follows: completely random attacks, feel like I’m dying I went to the er many times. I can’t process thoughts in my head pretty much 24/7 (hard time holding conversation). I will sometimes have attacks with stressful situations at work, but I have an important job so I don’t let those attacks stop home from doing my job even tho it can be miserable. 

I have tried many different ssri, hydroxzyine which works sometimes. The only thing that has worked is Xanax. I’m prescribed 1mg, but I typically break it up and take .25-.5 as needed. The only thing I haven’t tried is a beta blocker which I will try next.

Xanax allows me to have a perfectly clear head. I don’t feel like a retard and trip over my words and feel disassociated when I am on it. I don’t feel sedated or tired I just feel normal. It curbs and prevents panic attacks for usually 6-10 hours. I have been taking it more than I should recently .25-.5 every day to every other day. I do notice some rebound anxiety on the days off but nothing too crazy.

If a beta blocker doesn’t work I will try clonazapam. I really don’t care about dementia later in life. So my question is if these drugs increase my quality of life dramatically should I really avoid them just because of withdrawls? Yes I know their hell but you don’t go through them if you are on em for long term with no intention of getting off.

206,Heart/health anxiety,5,11wzj9e,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11wzj9e/hearthealth_anxiety/,6,"Hi all,

30/m/New York

This post is about my struggle with health anxiety and the fear that my heart is failing. 
Might be a long one but would love to speak to anyone who has/is going through anything similar. 

I have had anxiety for years but have been able to deal with it until recently.

4 months ago I had some chest pain which caused a massive panic attack. The only way I can explain the sensation is that it felt like someone was grabbing my heart and squeezing. 

A couple of days later I went to my doctor and had all the necessary tests. Blood work, EKG, echo etc. All results came back fine, as expected, except for the fact that I have an oddly low pulse (53 most of the time) and the chest tightness remained. 

Over the next few months my panic attacks became less frequent (twice a week) and my chest tightness began to disappear.

I managed this by reminding myself throughout the day of any moment where I was distracted enough to feel normal. An hour or two went by and I would be suddenly be reminded that I’m not dying. I feel great. It must all be in my head. 

I had also started weekly therapy during this time but I didn’t find it particularly helpful. My therapist mostly talked for an hour and guided me through breathing exercises. I think what I really wanted was to find the route of the problem.

More recently, my panic attacks have been worse and more frequent. 
I have been feeling heart palpitations a lot, or more accurately, my heart skipping beats.
I began checking my pulse and counting the beats fairly often at this point, causing more anxiety and more panic attacks. 

Now I’m obsessed with my low pulse and my blood pressure machine. Almost all results show high blood pressure with a pulse of 51.
 
I have just had a heart monitor on my chest for 48 hours and won’t get the results back for another 10 days or so. 

And this is where I am at…
Frequent panic attacks and the constant thought that my high blood pressure and low pulse will either kill me, give me a stroke or make me faint.

Anyone else gone through this?

So from January 24th up to know I have fallen back into my anxious state. 

It all started when I went to the big city in January I hadn’t felt anxious in months and I love the city so didn’t expect it. When I was walking off my train all the way down to the shopping centre I felt my legs and they didn’t feel ‘normal’ not weak but not strong and I was really aware of them and felt like my legs would just fail to walk and I’d fall over. The more I walked the more I started to stress out it got to the point where I felt dizzy and a bit lightheaded cause I was panicking and BOOM it hit I’m think OMG am I going to pass out ! I started to panic and think maybe it was diabetes but I’m a slim 22 year old male with no health conditions but in the moment I was panicking it was horrible so derealised and the fear of impending doom ! And then 3 days later I imagine because my nervous system was stimulated I was at my grans putting her bins out and for no apparent reason 0-100mph panic attack my legs instantly out of nowhere felt weak ish and shaky and so didn’t my arms and I let out this big exhale and I felt off balance and kind of dizzy in my head I rushed out the house into the car and sat there for a minute and I was okay but walking from my car to the house again made it happen mildly. Fast forward to today 20th of June i am still struggling with anxiety. Not the instant panic attack weak legs. This is like a head pressure feeling kinda like I’m tilting my head. Anyway I get this when I go on walk and panic and think I’m gonna pass out or fall over and then I think it’s something serious. I am also getting. It in shops. Although I have been in 4 shops the past few days just to ivercome this feeling. The past two times I had it very mild but made it without a panic attack and rushing out. B  it because of this and headaches ( I want to say all my symptoms don’t hurt and they aren’t terrible they are 3/10  maybe 4.5/10 when panicking in terms of intensity but i still panic thinking I’m gonna fall to the ground or pass out. HOW DO I GET OVER THIS because I’m currently thinking I have a brain tumour. Basically all I want is reassurance that it’s anxiety and it’s not high blood pressure (had blood pressure check at doctors this year after walking there and it was fine) diabetes( I had general blood tests before and I didn’t have diabetes I am also a slim male 22) brain tumour ( head pressure and headaches making me think. Fairly certain I had similar dizziness years back when my anxiety was at my peak and my doctor kept telling me no brain tumour about 3 years ago. Also I’m scared of having low iron but I guess I just eat more iron and I’ll be okay ? Please let me know what you think. I have had 6 heart tests from three years ago up until now and it’s fine!

Thank you in advance

I am also starting to feel my heart rate again to check it and it’s stressing me out and making me more aware of it!

**Mornings**: Wake up feeling shaky and short of breath, takes 30min of scrolling on my phone to get the motivation to get up. 

**Afternoon**: Tension builds up and I feel stiff and uncomfortable for no reason. Or have an adrenaline dump around this time

**Early Evening**: Can be 50-50. Either I feel fine or symptoms start up again and last for a bit

**Late evening**: Right at around 11pm or so some chemical switch goes off in my body and 80% of my issues vanish. It gets easier to breathe, my Heart slows down, and my brain fog lifts. Start feeling much happier too and its very obvious the constant subconscious anxiety has lifted. I have always been a night owl and even before my panic disorder I had weird spurts of energy and motivation in the late evening which made me a productivity machine in the AM.

227,I’m (29M) having bad anxiety in new relationship,2,11x12c1,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11x12c1/im_29m_having_bad_anxiety_in_new_relationship/,0,"I (29M) started dating my girlfriend (24F) around 3 months ago. Almost a month ago we became officially boyfriend/girlfriend, and since then my anxiety has sky-rocketed. 

At the start I used to be pretty confident, always trusted her etc, but now I’m struggling. She has given me 0 reason not to trust her, but I’m always thinking worst case scenario. She is on her phone? Probably talking to another guy. She goes out with her friends? Probably cheating on me. Yesterday we were together in bed and I saw she was looking at some photos on her phone, and could see on the photo reel some pictures I didn’t recognize. The background was red, and that was everything I could actually see (I was without glasses). I immediately started thinking that those pictures are probably with a random guy, and that she is cheating on me. I mean, even if they were photos with someone else (which I don’t even know if they were photos of her/screenshots/ a random thing etc), she can have photos with friends without me thinking this. 

I know this is not healthy, and while I haven’t showed her my anxiety, I’m sure at some point I will mess up and she will probably start distancing herself. I mean, this reeks controlling behavior, right? I even had some issues with my bank that I thought she caused (not at all). This is my second relationship, my first was not great but my ex never cheated or anything, so I’m not sure what is causing this. Could it he that Im insecure? Or just don’t want to lose her? My gf is awesome and I really enjoy our relationship so far. She is attentive, shows interest, always makes time for us, cooks for me etc. I feel loved.

It is worth noting that I almost screw everything up at the beginning, as I broke up with her before we were oficial for another girl. I realized my mistake shortly after and she accepted me back (after apologizing and having a deep conversation with her). I’m constantly thinking that I don’t deserver her after that, and that if I were her, who knows if I would have taken me back. Could this be part of it?

TL:DR: I (29M) started dating my gf (24F) over 3 months ago. She has given me 0 reason to not trust her, but I’m constantly anxious thinking the worst (that she is talking with other people, cheating on me etc). This makes me fear I will eventually become very controlling. How can I address this?",1679357764.0

i currently have one CO detector in my house (a battery operated one), and its in my living room. i recently read somewhere that CO detectors (at least the first alert ones, which is the kind i have) are only effective for about 5-7 years. i unplugged mine and checked the back and saw that the date of manufacture was march 2nd, 2016, which was almost exactly 7 years ago. although the alarm hasnt given the end of life warning yet. i even tested it to see if it was still working, and it was, although there was no green or red light. dont know if that means its not receiving power, or what, or if thats normal. 

its currently 11pm, so i cant really go out and buy another CO detector right now. im just scared that there will be a leak or something tonight, and that my detector wont go off and i'll die in my sleep, along with my pets. i know its extremely unlikely that there will be a CO leak tonight, but i cant help but think about it. i'll probably buy another detector tomorrow if im able to. im terrified right now. i feel like this is such a stupid thing to be afraid of, and im not really sure why ive been afraid of it for so long. any reassurance would be very much appreciated.

238,Breaking up with boyfriend of two years because of my anxiety,1,11x4zx6,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11x4zx6/breaking_up_with_boyfriend_of_two_years_because/,0,"I (25f) have been dating my boyfriend (33m) for two years now. We haven’t really had any problems until my anxiety started worsening about 4 months ago. I’ve had anxiety and depression since middle school and was officially diagnosed with ADHD in January. My anxiety and depression have been at a low for a few years now, which I definitely took for granted. I’m on a couple different antidepressants and got them to a good level. 

About 4 months ago, my anxiety started worsening for no discernible reason. Okay, great, I’m working with my therapist on it and talking to my psychiatrist about it, but my overall mental health is still going downhill. My boyfriend, luckily for him, has never struggled with mental health and has no idea how to relate to me or support me. I’ve been working really hard to communicate with him about how I’m feeling and what I need, but he really just ignores it. 

For example, in January we were out of the country for my work and planned on staying a couple extra nights to make a vacation out of it. Traveling generally heightens my anxiety, especially international travel. A lot of little things happened (including a couple small actions he made) one day that led to an anxiety attack, and he basically ignored the fact that it was happening. A couple hours after I came down from the attack and I had taken a cold shower and eaten a little bit, I talked to him about it a bit. I said “you can correct me if I’m wrong, but it seems like you don’t know how to respond or support me when I’m having really bad anxiety moments like this,” he said yeah that’s true, so I asked if it would be helpful if I told him a couple things that help when I’m really struggling. He agreed, so I said a few things like getting me some cold water, giving me a hug/holding me, taking a walk with me if that’s an available option, things like that. He said he could work with that. Over the past two or so months since then, I’ve had a few anxiety attacks similar to the one I had in January, and every time he basically ignores my anxiety. I’ve repeated my request a couple times, but it doesn’t make any difference. (There are a lot of other similar issues that have been going on as well.) 

Over the weekend, we had a very short conversation (probably 5 minutes max) and half of it was silence because neither of us knew what to say. (None of this is necessarily in order, I really don’t remember the order because it was really emotionally charged and kind of upsetting.) I said I wanted to try to make it work. I asked him if he wanted to try to make it work, and his response was “I want you to be happy, and I don’t want to be taking that from you whether it’s because I’m not putting the effort in or unable to support you, or something else.” Which didn’t actually answer my question (I guess it did in a roundabout way, though). I also asked if he still loved me, and he paused for what felt like forever before saying “yes.” 

I’ve spent more time crying in the past two weeks than I have my entire life before this. 

I’ve been thinking about our relationship a lot over the past couple months. He’s not a very talkative person in general. If there’s an issue, he ignores it completely or makes passive remarks and doesn’t actually bring it up. I feel like not only am I the only one that tries to open communication lines, but that I’m not getting my needs met also. 

I’ve talked to my therapist about it a bunch, and I think I’ve pretty much made my decision: I’m going to break up with him and work on my mental health. 

It feels terrible sitting on this, knowing the relationship is coming to an end. I have some major events coming up at work this week (including a 4 day long audit that I’m in charge of) so I’m basically trying to balance holding off for as long as possible (I.e. the end of the week) and being anxious and miserable about it and having that hard conversation now and being a different kind of upset and not able to focus at work. Either way, I’m not going to be able to be completely mentally present at work, I’m just trying to figure out what would be best for me and also respectful to my partner. 

I’m struggling with feeling like I’m broken and impossible to love because of my anxiety. I know that’s not actually the case, but it sure feels that way. 

Anyway, thank you for listening. All my family lives out of state and I only have a couple friends, none of which I really talk about deep stuff like this with. I just want a hug.

idk one part of me is saying how it would be easier to just not get help and i can get myself out if it since i’ve done it before but another part is telling me to go to therapy. i’m only 15 so this is all new and freaking me out. everything just feel so different and weird and scary. sometimes i wish i could just go back a few years. it’s crazy how bad it got jsut over the course of a few months. i feel like it’s my fault.

Im 26 and started driving since 16

I had a serious work injury over 3 years ago that resulted in my fingers being amputated in the hospital.

I do not drive as frequently at all before

But 2 years mark I notice that I became a little tensed up, anxious while driving

Up to NOW I shake while driving and it only happens when I drive and if it gets bad enough I’ll kinda feel like imma pass out but never have (Thank God)

This is absolutely defeating and horrible for me as I used to drive heavy duty class vehicles w/ big trailers everyday, even heavy equipment.

I use to drive to the ends of the earth and back when I used to work so this is just completely unreal to me how I feel now

Cant even drive my boat with my dad on the lake (although its not as bad as driving on the road)


Now I cant even make it to the store without taking side roads avoiding congested traffic, drive late in the night

Family ask me for favours driving to the store and such and i just get things delivered…. 

Thoughts suggestions?

I always had anxiety, Idk if its just evolving as Im getting older. 

I have bought some aswagandha but haven’t taken it yet as Im trying to push back naturally from using it.

255,Having anxiety and PTSD over being excluded from a reunion. Toxic ex-friend who socially traumatized me was invited.,1,11x38kp,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11x38kp/having_anxiety_and_ptsd_over_being_excluded_from/,0," **TL;DR: Having very mixed feelings over a reunion that I was not invited to but I feel I should have been, plus a former friend who socially traumatized me was invited**

Backstory: I am a pro player at a certain game. I went viral on YouTube and Reddit (different profile). The game's official YouTube channel's video of my gameplay has over 5M views and is the third most-viewed video on the channel. I had worked with the game's PR on stuff in the past and was always welcome at events and such.

I befriended many other players of this game over social media. I deactivated Facebook in early 2021 because I realized my mental health issues were showing and people were leaving group chats because of me and even unfriending me. I decided to deactivate before I ruined any friendships that meant a lot to me. I still maintain strong friendships with many of my fellow players.

For many years, the makers of the game said that they would never do a tournament or any kind of ""bring together the best players"" event because the player base is just too large and because the game is very luck-based (but if you're like me, you can sort of manipulate your odds). This year, a new person was put in charge of the game and they have decided to finally have a special event reuniting ""fan favorite"" players in person, most of whom went viral in the same way I did.

15 people were invited, and I was not one of them. The day the invitations went out, I got several messages from fellow players asking me, ""Did you get invited to the thing?"". Many in the community were shocked I was not, and one of them said ""They're missing out without you"". When I found out this was happening, I started trembling with anxiety for multiple reasons. One being that I was overthinking why I wasn't invited and paranoia that I may be blacklisted (I have been very vocal about the game's flaws on social media). One thing that got me was that around the time my gameplay was posted, I was often grouped with two other great players in promotional stuff and we were kind of like the de-facto ""GOAT trio""; we were the top three viewed videos on the YouTube channel at the time, though a couple have snuck between us since then. These two people were both invited to the reunion event. I am so happy for those who were invited and I'm trying to convince myself that not everyone could get this opportunity, but I can't help but feel hurt and worried.

The ""reunion"" happened today, and I purposefully avoided everyone's social media so I wouldn't have to see photos or anything of them hanging out at bars or restaurants and stuff afterwards. I suffer from FOMO big time. I've flown out to events that friends went to just to avoid FOMO, but I didn't have time to fly out for this reunion even to just stop by and say hi. The event is not being publicized until May, so I'm going to have to deal with this feeling again in a couple of months.

Part of the reason I am anxious about this whole thing is because one of the players who was invited to the reunion is a former close friend of mine. We bonded over the game of course, and his high score blew mine out of the water. We discovered we had a lot in common. He also suffers anxiety and he gave me advice on what meds are better than others; I still take the one he recommended me to this day. We're also both gay, and I found him very attractive (as did many others in our community). Our friendship shattered when I went to visit him in person (across the country) and he showed very manipulative behavior that I was too naive to discern at the time. He purposefully distanced himself from me whenever we were in a room together (e.g. sitting on a different couch) and excluded me from ""parties"" he went to while I was in town to prevent anything sexual happening between us, and lying about them. He had been sending me several pictures of him shirtless and in bed with other guys we knew, knowing it would turn me on, among many other forms of leading me on, but never had the courage to say ""I don't like you like that"". Instead, he let me come all this way and then gaslit me for trying to come on to him, saying it was inappropriate behavior (behavior that he exhibited with other guys right in front of me, and said ""It's different with them"" when I asked). We tried to move on from that experience while staying friends, but then he kept making jokes about me with the other guys and I got tired of it. We haven't spoken in months, and when we did speak, it was only because he had a question about the game.

I suffered so much social trauma from this person I trusted, and his group of friends who seemed like a Mean Girls Plastics clique that acted polite around me but I later realized they didn't care about me one way or the other. I followed all of them on Instagram and only one followed me back. These people ostracized and humiliated me on top of my friend's various forms of mental and emotional abuse. The trauma only started setting in as months passed and I started crying myself to sleep and sort of ""reenacting"" the day everything happened in my head wishing I was more assertive. Now I get PTSD at the mention of his name, and I deleted almost every picture I took on my trip to meet him. So since he was invited to the reunion, I might have declined if I was invited so I wouldn't have to be in the same room as him, because it would have been so triggering for me and I would not have been able to concentrate on the game. That being said, I would definitely be willing to take a day to have a serious discussion with this person over how he made me feel and maybe we could start over strictly as friends, because I do think he is a good person.

I really hope come May when the reunion is made public that I don't suffer any more PTSD. I hope I can find some healthy distractions.

Unfortunately, my excitement for giving this gift turned to anxiety as I became concerned about how such a (relatively) nice gift might be perceived being given to a friend of the opposite sex....

So this became a trigger for a multi-week bout of extremely high anxiety and this person definitely realized that they were the trigger for it one way or another......... and now it seems like they are at the point that they are starting to get a little freaked out and I'm afraid of losing one of my closest friends.

Chest Tightness

Tightness in the front of the neck and under the chin

Light-headedness/Dizziness

Feeling Faint/Like I may pass out

Nausea

These are the symptoms I've been feeling. I don't really seem to have an impending sense of fear or doom when these things happen, but I will say they are triggered by talking about my condition, or just general stress, but sometimes they happen for no reason at all. I have just been sitting watching TV, playing a video game, or scrolling through Reddit and they've happened.

I've been to the ER three times at two different hospitals in the past week with these symptoms (in addition to high blood pressure) and all three times, my blood work and ECG have been normal.

I need to add, a lot of these symptoms got worse when lying down, and got better when sitting up or walking.

In light of that last detail, the ER doctors said ""it's just GERD"" and sent me home with orders for a PPI medication and a Blood Pressure medication.

Well, the GERD has improved, and all the symptoms I've listed above have improved as well but haven't gone away.

I'm seeing an anxiety doctor later this week, and out of an abundance of caution, a cardiologist later next month (soonest they could get me in)

*Another detail: I received a call from the doctor earlier telling me my cholesterol was high and my potassium was a little high from the Lisinopril (BP med) so they started me on a diuretic and a cholesterol medication. As soon as I got off the phone with that news, I instantly started feeling the pressure in my neck and chest... This is what leads me to believe my symptoms are anxiety related.

There's no pain whatsoever, but just a weird sensation that makes me feel like the left side of my head is going numb.

This is the first time it's happened to me. I have been somewhat anxious these past few days (about my health), so I'm not sure if that is the trigger? I don't have any headaches whatsoever. And I'm refraining from googling because I know whatever I'm reading is gonna aggravate my anxiety. But my brain has decided that it's best to jump to the worst case scenario 🫠 I'm trying to keep calm because I know if I let my thoughts run loose, it's going to make me feel worse.

But I'm really wondering if it's the stress/anxiety causing it. My neck/shoulders feel relatively fine, so I don't think it's a pulled muscle or tension.",1679356758.0

291,A month ago I was drugged without my consent (long post)...,1,11wykax,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11wykax/a_month_ago_i_was_drugged_without_my_consent_long/,0,"TL;DR: Dad gave me edible without my knowledge/consent, I had a really bad trip, now I don't know how to deal with it.

Hey, not sure if this is the best place to post this. I'm not even sure what I'm looking for exactly - to vent? To know if someone had a similar experience? I don't know.

Last month I was staying at my dad's house. One night, I was sitting in the living room while he and his wife were in the kitchen nearby. I wasn't paying any attention to them; I was playing a video game on my dad's laptop. I had headphones on, with one ear uncovered because I was also watching The Simpsons. So I didn't know what they were talking about.

My dad came up to me and held out what seemed to be this gummy candy. I don't remember if I asked what it was; whether I did or not, he was just like ""Try it."" Now, the thing about my dad is that this sort of thing isn't unusual; I'm used to him making me try weird foods and such. So, perhaps foolishly, I ate it without really questioning it (it tasted vile). It was only after I had already swallowed it that he told me it was an edible.

Now, another thing about him is that a lot of times he likes to mess with me. Once, when I was a teenager, for example, he gave me a drink and told me it had alcohol when it really didn't. So I wasn't sure if he was lying or not. I knew he and his wife sometimes took edibles, I just...didn't know they had any at the time. I had never done drugs before, and I don't think I would have eaten it if I had known.

After that, he and his wife went to bed. About an hour or so passed, then it began kicking in. I started feeling dizzy, and I got kind of scared, so I went into their bedroom and I asked my dad if it really was an edible. He said ""No."" This was a lie, but obviously I didn't know it at the time.

I decided the best thing to do was try to get some sleep. There was only one bedroom, so I had been sleeping on a mattress in the corner. So I was lying there, crying because I had no idea if what I was feeling was because I was high or if it was all in my head.

My dad's wife was also high, and she started talking to me. I started laughing, things got kind of funny...I started talking about all of my interests (much to my dad's annoyance, as he was trying to sleep), and I said some really embarrassing things (I later found out he had recorded at least most of what I said...well, yelled, 'cause apparently when I'm high I get really loud). I have selective mutism, so I tend to have a lot of trouble talking if I'm not really comfortable (it's gotten better over the years, but my dad is convinced that I don't actually have it or something)...

Anyway, at some point, I fell asleep and had a horrible nightmare. It's hard to describe, but it involved me forgetting everything...my life, my interests, the people I knew and the world around me...I dreamt that my dad knew I was going to forget it all, and I remember the fear I felt in the nightmare. Just that feeling of...""Why? Why would he do this to me?"" I tried to recall faces - mine, my dad's, a musician I have a crush on (yeah, weird, I know)...and everything was warped, grotesque. Everything became a black void (you know that scene in Spongebob where Squidward's in that ""Alone"" place? Kind of like that, except black instead of white). I began thinking that maybe I had died, or was dying, and that this horrible void was the afterlife.

I woke up sobbing and screaming ""Oh God!""/""Oh Lord!"" over and over (and also yelling at my dad ""How could you do this to me!?"" and ""I will never forgive you!"") He and his wife got me up from the mattress and had me drink some water. Everything during this part and afterwards felt like a dream that I was trying to wake up from.

My dad made me some oatmeal and put on some songs by one of my favorite artists (American Murder Song). In my disoriented state, I remember thinking that the first song he put on was familiar, and that if I could just hang on to that familiar feeling everything would hopefully be okay. I vaguely remember singing along to the songs.

After I ate he put on one of my favorite movies (Repo! The Genetic Opera) and left me in the living room. I remember it being on, but it felt almost like I was half asleep or something throughout. I was just anxious and confused, and I was trying to focus on the movie but I kept...I don't know, it was like going in and out of consciousness or something. There's a scene towards the end of the movie where the main character falls unconscious and I remember vaguely wondering if perhaps I was actually her (I'm a guy, not that it mattered to my drugged self) and that I would wake up and the movie would be reality.

Apparently, I also sang along to the whole move, but I don't remember this (my dad came into the room to check on me at some point and he said I seemed to be having a great time, but I know I really wasn't). I do remember, however, that at some point I threw up all over myself. After the movie, I told my dad I threw up and he was mad that I was too disoriented to clean it up myself. By this point, about six hours had passed since I had taken the edible. I remember being so confused I asked him what day it was. After that, I went back to sleep.

The next day, my dad told me that it really was an edible...so I did feel somewhat relieved that it was actually a drug that was making me feel that way. But for about three days afterward I still felt the affects of it...and for about a week or so I kept experience derealization.

My dad's reason for giving me the edible...he said he thought it would make me talk more...which it did, but it was humiliating. Apparently, he and his wife had talked about what was in it before he gave me the edible, but (as my cousin pointed out to me) it's strange to just assume that I'd be paying attention to a conversation that I wasn't even part of, even if I was in the room. So he apparently thought I knew what it was...

I wasn't able to go home immediately (he lives in another state so he had to buy a plane ticket and all that), but when I eventually did I told my mom what happened. She's furious at my dad, though neither of us have spoken to him about it. I talked to my therapist about it recently, but her reaction seemed...dismissive (like, she thought it was cool that it made me talk about my interests, but again...I had no consent).

So here I am, exactly a month after it happened...I still experience derealization if I think about it (parts of the nightmare I mentioned I literally only remembered last night...). I just...I don't know how I'm going to get over this. I don't know if I'm ever going to be able to, for example, watch ""Repo!"" again...just recently I listened to one of the songs my dad had put on and it gave me a weird feeling in my stomach. I'm trying to decide whether or not to cut ties with my dad...(this isn't the first time I've thought about it, to be honest, but I'm seriously considering it now). I just know now that thinking about that nightmare still terrifies me...",1679351917.0

The color literally did not occur to me when I got dressed. I picked it because I felt bloated and it was flowy, and that's as far as my brain got.

At the reception, my boyfriend's mom spilled red wine on my dress. As I tried to dab out the stain, I caught myself saying ""see, this is why I never wear white""--and then it hit me. I spiraled into an anxiety attack and left the reception to go back to my hotel to change. I felt like such an asshole, such an idiot, and I still can't shake that feeling.

I sat in the second-to-last row at the ceremony, at the very end of the row away from the aisle -- thank God. It was a casual wedding. People were there in jeans. No one said anything to me. And it was genuinely an accident. A very stupid accident. But it was also my first time meeting my boyfriend's extended family, and I'm now convinced they all hate me. I can't think about anything else. I feel like such a fuckup, like I'm a bad person.

But the problem is that I haven't written anything. At all. I've collated dozens of pages of general notes, vague ideas and research over the last few months, but I don't have a clue what to do with it, or where to start.

I've written probably hundreds of assessments and essays in my life, and until a few weeks ago, I had not failed a single one of them. But a few weeks ago, my motivation, self-belief and general ability to work (which were all low to begin with anyway) just stopped altogether. I had deadlines for two course module assessments within a week of each other, and I missed both of them. For one of the first times in my education, I had not only failed with work, but I had failed to even complete the work. I missed the first one because I had zero interest in, knowledge of or care for the subject, because I kept procrastinating, and because it's possible that I have ADHD (I don't want to know about this, but I think I have it). I missed the second one because of the same reasons, and because I failed the first one, so it didn’t make a difference if I missed the second one.

Since I got the email last week from my supervisor that I have to send him whatever I've been working on by tomorrow (Tuesday), I've not only not been working on the dissertation, but I've detached myself from it almost completely. I don’t like thinking about it. I keep distracting myself from it (literally and mentally) because I don't want to do it. The subject itself interests me (it was my choice after all) and i’ve done a lot of research (too much I think) and every time I ever doubt my work ability like this (which is every time i’ve ever done an assessment in my three years at university) it usually turns out alright, but I can't see how this one — of course, the most important one — will end in anything other than failure. So I’ve come all this way — from the start of uni three years ago, from the start of reception 17 years ago — and I've always, at the very least, managed to succeed. But now of all times is when it stops.

I’m aware that every student who has ever tried to write a university thesis has had these doubts at some time, or a lot of the time. But that makes me feel all the more incapable. Because those students have all, and will all, get through it, and I know that I won't. I look around the university library that I'm currently writing this in, and all I see is people working; they’re focused, self-disciplined, and content to be here. But I’m not one of them. I know that I don’t belong here, and I don’t like it here. I really don't like coming here. But I come here nevertheless. I'm sitting here wasting more time on something that I don't have to do, that I shouldn't be doing, but I'm doing nevertheless. Because I think a part of me actually wants to fail. I don't know why anyone would want that, especially me; I've always feared failure — the confirmation of it by my university and parents; the consequences of it practically and emotionally — and that's what’s driven me to always succeed with my work in education. I've only ever done that work because I fear the consequences of not doing it. I do it because I have to, never because I wanted to. I've always been like this.

So why am I here then? If you never enjoyed school or college (which i didn't) then why did you actively decide to go to university? Hmm. Maybe because I thought I had to (not because I wanted to pursue a career — I have absolutely no ambition at all). And it was partly because the idea of getting a job after I left college at 18 seemed completely impossible (I've suffered from social anxiety for most of my life; the basics of social interaction are overwhelming to me). But mostly, it was because I didn't think any of it through. I didn't want to think it through at all. My parents thought I could maybe go to this university, so I just said okay. I didn't even look into the university at all, and I didn't consider any others. The reason that I do this is because I hate thinking about the future — short, medium and long term. Whenever people ask me about the future, whether it’s “where do you see yourself in five years”, “what do you want to do with your life"" or even simply “do you have any plans for the weekend”, I’ve always given vague non-answers. I've been like this forever. Probably because I’ve been bombarded with these questions from career advisors since Year 1. But it's also because the future is too uncertain and complicated. It scares me to think about the future in any sort of way. So I don't. And now I'm paying the price. And the future gets closer every day. And I wish I could go back in time, maybe to live things differently, maybe to live them the same. I think about the past (my childhood especially) every day. And every single night I dream about the past too. The other day I had one about the last day of Year 11. I’ve had hundreds like it, all about the last day of secondary school. The thing that haunts me about it is the fact that I don’t remember what happened. All I remember is that I never saw any of my peers again after that day. Because I made the conscious decision to leave them, and go to a different college. Every single dream I have involves my old school friends. Every one.

In case it isn't clear, my recent doubts over starting (let alone completing, or succeeding with) my dissertation are related to so many other things that I have consciously, often deliberately bottled up over the years (and it is years). I know how unhealthy and dangerous it is to do this, but I do it anyway because it's easier, and because it's been the default way of accepting, contemplating and processing my emotions for as long as I can remember. I've never had the desire to tell anyone (including family) about my most vulnerable thoughts and feelings, fears and insecurities, because…well…where to start? Fear of judgement, fear of being misunderstood, fear of being understood, fear of the literal and emotional consequences on myself and on my relationships; the fact that emotions were and are are never discussed in my family, or in the few social circles I used to have (note: haven't had friends for five years). I bottle all of this up. And I'll continue to. But it feels like the bottle is starting to overflow.

If anyone has read this far, you might as well consider yourself the first person who has ever heard anything that is even remotely as private as what I've just revealed in these last few paragraphs. And if you've read this far — and if you are a healthy, ‘normal’ person — you will have obviously thought to yourself, “Yeah, he needs therapy”. But I don't think I do, and I certainly don't want to. There’s a small part of me that desires to let it all out (I could write a book about all of my problems), but I know that would be a terrifying and draining experience, even if it leads to something better. And the desire certainly isn't big enough for me to have serious thoughts about seeking help…from anyone in fact. I think that’s the bottom-line: regardless of whether I need help, or guidance, or advice, or support, or sympathy, I don't think I want it. Not enough, anyway. I think I’d hate myself for seeking it out because I'd feel like a desperately sad narcissist. I know I'm pathetic, dumb, probably annoying, an embarrassment, a failure, a waste of space, time, money and effort, but I don’t think I'm a narcissist. And I know that people who seek help aren't narcissistic, but I would think that I am if I did. So I don't. And I've never sought help from anyone. Not only the serious, personal stuff, but the little, trivial, specific things too. Is it because of a deep-rooted social anxiety, and my complete lack of social confidence, ability and experience? Yes. But like with my other anxieties that I probably ‘need’ help with — health anxiety, fear of the future, fear of the passage of time, the fear of failure, the fear of work, the fear of my dissertation — I don't care about help, or support, or self-improvement. I don’t want any of it because I think it won’t work for me, or that it doesn't apply to me. I don’t want to be helped. And yet here I am writing this.",1679321958.0
308,So upset and sick with anxiety,1,11wx7hn,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11wx7hn/so_upset_and_sick_with_anxiety/,0,"I worked up the courage to go to the dentist back in Oct as I was having some tooth pain on a tooth that had a crown. I have a huge dental phobia I have major panic attacks. I always cry and I always need meds to get anything done.

309,Anxiety has ruined me,1,11wx0ia,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11wx0ia/anxiety_has_ruined_me/,2,"Just a vent tbh .

I've suffered from anxiety my whole life and as I grow older, I feel my anxiety getting progressively worse instead of better. Ironically even therapy scares me as I'm not really one to ""open up"" in front of others in fear of burdening/boring them. Sounds silly but I almost feel embarrassed paying someone to help me who otherwise wouldnt give me a second thought

On the topic of skills, I wholeheartedly believe I have 0 skills. I've always been told I'm smart but no one sees how much time and struggle goes behind good grades. When I'm honest about not being intelligent, understandably people think I'm fishing for compliments.  Even then I think I just got lucky with good questions and random guesses. Literally no achievement I think I really deserved and was more abt the odds being in my favour. Its all due to subliminals and manifestation rather than talent

As well, my social skills are horrendous. I'm so awkward w people and can barely keep a convo going with those close to me. I rely on them to start and keep convos going cause I'm just so boring and unfunny. I have an extremely hard time communicating with males too. Idk I completely stiffen up and come across so awkward. I like art but again I'm not talented at it despite so much practice and was rejected from an art school unsurprisingly. I'm learning to drive and after 3 lessons I still can't move a car without sweating buckets, shaking and struggling to control it, even moving off is so challenging.  I'm expecting to waste a ton of money due to my incompetence at understanding basic instructions and crippling fear. I'm bad at sports, games , mediocre at cooking and just about everything I've tried. Heck I can't even ride a bike

I couldn't list a single talent I have. Anything I'm half decent at is a result of 5x the effort generally needed. For example I'm currently writing an essay thats taken me all day to understand and plan when it was only meant to be an hour task. There just doesn't seem to be anything 'redeemable' for me

My anxiety has made me become more and more closed off from people. I will sit in toilets at school in fear of being looked at. I never contribute to class in fear of being wrong. I sit on the bus with my hood on so I'm not looked at. Even when I briefly had a job, I couldn't work out the basics that everyone learnt in a day. It was very telling that this incompetence wasn't only reflecting in school but other places. Sweating is one of the main symptoms I experience and its created deep rooted insecurities for me

I can stay somewhat in peace at home but I do have struggles here and there. But obviously its not practical to rely on home for peace as I fear I will completely isolate myself this way

315,"should i force myself to talk when i am unable to? //vent, about work and conflict with friend + my issues //",1,11wwmyv,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11wwmyv/should_i_force_myself_to_talk_when_i_am_unable_to/,0,"i was having a conversation with a close friend of mine about work settings because i will be having an internship soon. we talked about standard work things and tips, but then it lead to talking about my anxiety.

i asked, ""if i'm unable to speak because of anxiety, how do i communicate that to them?"" 'them' being my coworkers. for extra context, i think this is a common thing but just in case, my throat closes up to a degree that it becomes hard to and painful to breathe or speak. obviously i need to breathe, so i've learned to tough through it, and even so i was able to get an appointment with someone who may be able to help this issue. as for speaking, that can be even more painful than breathing, so i usually try to tap my throat with my finger and hold up one finger with the other hand to try to communicate that i need a minute and i can't breathe/speak.

i was worried that may not be enough, and i had previously told my friend about my issues. i figured he'd be the right guy to ask, especially since he's training to become a therapist. i guessed he may have some ideas i haven't thought about yet

he told me to tell my coworkers i need a minute to think and to maybe say it directly. i asked him, ""if i can't talk, how do i say it to them directly?"" i'm bad with conveying tone, partially because i'm autistic, so i can see in hindsight that it may have come off wrong.

he asked me if i was just going to leave or stay quiet without telling them what was going on, and he also said that the situation would just become worse. i was starting to get a bit upset and i said that i knew that. *then he told me to learn how to force myself to say it.*

that's where i became really upset. i have no idea if this was justified or not, all i know is how much it hurt. i tired my best to remind him of some of my tics, and how if i'm stressed enough to be unable to speak, forcing myself would DEFINATELY make the situation worse. i told him about how there's been times where i've gotten overwhelmed and anxious, which led to me accidently hitting someone rarely or most commonly myself. sometimes i'll have really bad ones which make me yell, fling my arm beside my head, or slam a fist down on a table.

i then apologized. he then told me that it's unfair, but i have to vocalize that kind of thing. i worked some things out with another close friend of mine, and we both agreed that i should maybe carry around some laminated cards on a ring with common words and sayings to help me communicate. we also talked about telling my coworkers and employers beforehand about my issues, and how i need a few minutes to myself to calm down.

i tried messaging the friend from before, saying that i wanted to talk. i apologized for getting upset and explained that i was hurt by what he said and that i was hoping we can talk about it all. i apologized again. i've seen he's read the message, but he hasn't responded. i'm a bit worried, but trying to be patient with out differing time zones.

should i force myself to talk when i am unable to, especially with some of my issues? i want to believe i'm not at fault, but i feel horrible about getting upset and i'm wondering if he's right and i should just try to suck it up.

**edit:** i also worry that i may have overreacted and blown up over something unimportant. it's just so infuriating and hurtful because i've been told all my life to force myself to do things and to just toughen up and deal with it. i've been called overly emotional and at this point any slight indication someone thinks that way kind of sets me off. i'm sorry if this doesn't make much sense, i struggle putting these things into words.",1679347839.0

325,Did I have a panic attack?,1,11wv9tb,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11wv9tb/did_i_have_a_panic_attack/,1,"About a month ago I (F 25) had (what I think) was a panic attack. I’ve gone through childhood physical and emotional abuse and traumatic events in adult hood (family member has tired to take their life a few times) but I have resisted the idea of getting professional help for myself since I was 11/12 and have only opened up about 90% with my long term boyfriend.

In 2017 I was at an all time low and was feeling like life wasn’t worth it and felt numb to the world. One night after going for dinner with work friends I was walking home and collapsed on the ground. I was conscious but felt so numb my body and mind just gave up there and then. Some people came to help me and called an ambulance for me. When the paramedics arrived the shook me and got me on a bed I didn’t talk but could hear them. I suddenly snapped out of it when they rolled me into the ambulance and started crying. The paramedic pricked me with a needle on my finger to test me for something. It hurt and was unexpected. They said they had to take me to the hospital to check me out but I was sure in my head that nothing was physically wrong with me. I got to the hospital and was so embarrassed and ashamed that I told staff I should leave and I went home. I was so incredibly embarrassed and ashamed and still am. How dare I just let all that happen when I wasn’t an emergency and what if someone somewhere needed help and was dying. I just don’t understand why didn’t snap out of it. 

Fast forward to a month ago. I was at first aid training (ironically) and that machine that pricks your finger was brought out to show us. The instructor used it on his own hand. I remembered immediately what I had done in 2017 and all the feelings of shame, guilt, embarrassment came rushing back. I didn’t think much of it and we moved onto what the readings of the blood would tell you. I suddenly started feeling my hands sweat and a hotness covered my hands and seemed to radiate throughout my whole body and face. I was taking notes and my hand became so weak I couldn’t keep writing. Then I realised my hands were shaking uncontrollably. At this point I was thinking it was in my head but then my heart started racing sooo incredibly fast. I was still sure it was in my head as all I could think about was that I’m not someone who faints at the sight of blood. Then I started feeling like I was going to faint and to my embarrassment I had to stick my hand up and say in-front of the class I was not feeling well. I got up and staggered outside the room and sat on a chair. The instructor followed me , clearly concerned. I then started thinking I was having a heart attack and was about to die. I genuinely started thinking what is everyone going to think if I die right here, my boyfriend, my family. I was telling the instructor that I don’t normally faint and that I felt weird and that my pulse was fast. The instructor took my pulse and told me to slow my breathing (hadn’t even noticed how fast and heavy I was breathing). Soon as he told me that I started calming down and thought if he’s not worried about me dying then maybe I’m not. I started feeling much better after that. At the end of the class he said he reckons it was ‘a little bit of anxiety’. 

Was that a panic attack? Whatever it was it scared me. Since then I’ve had 6 more with varying degrees but the first was the worst. This has pushed me to tell my doctor I need to speak to someone as I’m scared it’s going to happen in public and now I’m being referred to therapy so I’m not diagnosed with anything yet so am clueless.

ive been taking 10mg 3x a day for about a month (with some missed doses in between) and i do feel less anxious, but the way my doctor described it made it sound like it was a fast acting anti anxiety drug that calms you down after you take a dose, rather than one that builds in your system over time. if it matters, i also take concerta and bupropion.

Growing up, I had a difficult childhood. My father and stepfather were both abusive and would often beat me up for the smallest reasons. I remember hiding in my room and praying that they would leave me alone, but it never worked.

My mom was an alcoholic, and she never showed me any love or affection. She was always too drunk to care about anything that was going on in my life. I felt like I was all alone in the world, and I had no one to turn to.

As a result of my childhood, I developed a deep sense of trust issues. I find it hard to open up to people and let them in. I am constantly afraid that they will hurt me in some way, just like my father and stepfather did.

But despite all of this, I refuse to let my past define me. I am determined to make something of myself and create a better life for me. College has been a fresh start for me, and I have made some friends who seem to genuinely care about me.

However, even with my newfound friendships, I still find it hard to trust people. I am always on guard and keep people at arm's length, afraid that they will hurt me like my father and stepfather did.

Sometimes, I wish I could forget about my past and start anew, but it's always there in the back of my mind, haunting me. It's hard to let go of the pain and the memories that shaped me into the person I am today.

I also take Atenolol for my blood pressure. My BP has gotten worse as my anxiety has worsened. The last year and a half has been really rough. After having covid, I ended up with pneumonia and was on oxygen for 3 months. I've always been really overweight and since then have changed my eating habits and been more active. I've lost over 140 lbs since last January. In May, my brother died unexpectedly and my whole world has changed and I have a lot more on my shoulders now. My mom is older and my dad is gone. My sister lives 4 hours away and has not helped with anything since my mom and her don't really get along.  In November, it was like my anxiety flipped a switch and my BP was elevated. I started having heart palpitations. I ended up going to the emergency room in early December. My pulse was really high and I felt really off. They sent me home after not finding anything and I followed up with a cardiologist. He had me wear a holter monitor for 3 days and it came back fine as well. He put me on the blood pressure pill and then the next month, my pcp put me on the buspirone. Since then, I have not felt normal or like myself. When I was so overweight, I didn't really feel my heart beat and now I do. I lost so much weight and now don't know what is normal which stresses me out even more. My pcp has upped my dose of both medications and I don't feel like it's helping. Not only do I still worry endlessly to the point of bawling my eyes out, I also have been having a lot of lightheaded-ness, random pains in my chest, chest tightness, SOB, and I wake up so much during the night now. I also have asthma and since the pneumonia last winter, I have a lot of respiratory issues. Since the last dose increase, my pulse has dropped a lot too.

346,Haven’t worked a job in a year and a half (pitiful rant),3,11whrvt,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11whrvt/havent_worked_a_job_in_a_year_and_a_half_pitiful/,1,"The last job I had was back in October 2021 doing low-skilled IT work at a hospital and I got fired (worked there two months - the longest I’ve ever held a job). 

I’m in my early 20s and it’s embarrassing to admit that but it’s true. I can’t keep a job. I either quit after a short while, or in this instance, get chucked out. 

&#x200B;

Since then I’ve avoided work all together as all I feel is bitterness and shame. Another deterrent is how I’m not good at anything in particular. All I can get are shit jobs where I’m completely replaceable. 

&#x200B;

I’m too shy and anxious all the time, so talking to people is really hard. When I worked at a cinema it wasn’t too bad because there were people my age and I felt good talking to them, but that job went to pieces because management hated me (long story). 

&#x200B;

I’m told to get a skill, but the idea of getting a trade sounds harrowing to me as I’ve worked on construction sites and the people who work there are usually abrasive cokeheads who I really wouldn’t get along with/tolerate. 

&#x200B;

All I’ve done for the past year is read, write, listen to music and occasionally socialise but I’m pretty much alone now. I guess when you’re socially isolated it’s hard to really know yourself, like you can’t test yourself much in a public setting so it’s hard to truly know who you are. I find it hard sometimes. Just thinking about what jobs would suit me, it seems impossible. I know what I don’t want to do, but that’s pretty much everything to be honest. The idea of working a job again, commuting, forcing myself to speak to people who I don’t want to be around, and doing these mundane things feels like death isn’t so bad. Considering the sort of jobs I can get, which are garbage service jobs or low-skilled office one’s with high turnovers. 

&#x200B;

So I’m stuck. I feel really trapped. The job centre is harassing me and I hate going in there as I feel like such a low-life… but on the same token I can barely afford the upkeeps for my car so I’ll have to work some shit job soon I suppose. 

&#x200B;

I’m not on medication or anything, I feel embarrassed typing this out. I’m scared of telling anyone my problems as I was always told they’re insignificant and I should “man up” (even though the same people who told me that complain and talk about how bad their lives are all the time to me and never ask about how I’m doing). So whatever. Seeing a GP in this country is a joke anyway so there’s zero point trying to get help anyways. I tried to be ambitious and maybe move countries but I don’t even have any qualifications, like I don’t have a degree so my options are very limited. I’d love to move countries and just forget about how bad my life sucks here but I can’t do that regrettably so I guess I’ll have to accept my lot in life working these miserable hapless jobs until I eventually murder myself or go crazy",1679315899.0

I’m struggling so much. Here’s my story if you want to stick around to read it. Last year, about this same time I got Covid, probably the worst thing I have ever gone through in my entire life, besides the horrible sickness part, somehow it sparked some sort of new anxiety in me. Before it I never experienced anxiety like I do now, but somehow it came on painfully out of no where. Panic attacks more than once a day, unable to control my thoughts, horrible intrusive thoughts, nightmares, insomnia, constant fidgeting & some anger/irritability for no reason at all. 
After a month or two from healing from Covid (Covid long haul) I was getting better, no more panic attacks, able to drive, get out and be happy. I was okay, till now. One night I woke up a little too early so I decided to stay up instead of falling back asleep for three or so hours, and boom it was back. My mind went straight back to the anxiety, the irritability and pain as before but without the anxiety.
It’s been a few weeks or so now since it started and I feel so tired and mentally drained.
I started some anxiety meds (Buspirone 5mg 2x) and haven’t seen a massive amount of change yet.

We live in the same city, walking distance apart, have a lot in common and have done many things together over the years.

Over the past few months I have sensed a growing distance between us. Whether it is coincidental or not that in this time she has just starting seeing this guy, and that is what is taking up most of her time/energy, but I sense something in our dynamic has changed.

We have mutual friends but they don’t seem to bother/mind whether they feel close to her or not - she’s always been a person who takes ages to respond to texts, doesn’t imitate meet-ups first, tends to receive the invite rather than send them out, etc. I don’t mind that, as she’s not a toxic person, but she always seems busy and our texts to each other are so dry now, like there is nothing to discuss.

She’s very much the drama-free type and hates any sort of confrontation. She is a people pleaser, which makes me nervous that she actually feels a certain way towards me and is reluctant to say so. 

How do I approach her about this without seeming like I’m causing unnecessary drama? Or would you even approach the subject at all given what I’ve said about her?

Been waking up most days shakey and nervous. Most days I’m worrying about my health and can’t seem to shake off intrusive thoughts. I went to the Doctor on Thursday and was told my blood pressure was high, which made me more anxious. Was precribed some for blood pressure and sertraline for the anxiety. Today I’ve been feeling dizzy, it comes and goes and just loosing interest in normal things. Just a general feeling of feeling off or not all here. Also can’t seem to swallow very well. 

I’m starting to exercise more and eating healthier. I’m hoping to see if anyone has any words of encouragement or has had a similar experience as mine. Also, anyone taking sertraline has any side effects? Anything would help rn. Thank you!

As a bit of background, I am currently in therapy for anxiety , depression OCD and for the last six weeks i have been on 50mg of sertraline a day and 2 lots of 20mg promethazine a day. 

since yesterday morning, i haven’t felt great but i atleast thought that the medication was working . was feeling depressed a bit the night before but something was drastically different.

I woke up and felt like i was incoherent but i wasn’t and began to feel very depressed. i put it down to just a bad day and i read online sertraline can cause depressive feelings . i continued on with my day not worrying until the nighttime . 

just before i was going to get into bed ,something didn’t feel right. i started to feel strange in ways i can’t describe and I had these 1 second headaches in the same spot every 5-10 minutes . my memory then began to feel weird and i checked my blood pressure which was normal. 

I then grabbed my playstation controller and headset and put it by my bedside which i never do . i always leave it on my desk. this freaked me out , but then again that could just be down to tiredness .

I got into bed and checked by blood pressure again. all normal. but something didn’t feel right at all. it felt like i was living in yesterday and then i suddenly got this strange feeling and this is the best way of describing it: it felt like I wasn’t conscious but i was at the same time . like to recall my memory it feels like none of that happened except it did . the world felt deaf and it felt like time was no longer linear . i felt as if i couldn’t process things properly, if at all. and thought brain bleed.

I then went to the bathroom and felt panicked but didn’t show it . I checked my pupils and they were fine . i then went back to my bedroom and began to text people ok reddit for advice and said it all sounds like anxiety. 

at this point my brain was telling me that I was forgetting something but i don’t know what, because that’s the whole point of forgetting something . I began to feel like I was in a delirious state and i felt as if i couldn’t hang on to a thought process.

 I was worried as this was not normal for me so i woke up my dad and told him what was happening . at this point when I was trying to read something i searched up on google , the words looked jumbled and i had to read it again. this has never been an issue before and i certainly don’t have dyslexia , so this made me worry .

I explained to my dad that the way I was feeling was not normal, so i asked him if I could call 111 (urgent care number) . I explained to them my situation and i was put on call later to a man who literally asked my father what he thought he should do if i was feeling delirious . at this point i realised it was pointless . he basically said it sounds like nothing physically but i disagreed. 

Exhausted of all my options , i decided to go to sleep. I got around 7 hours and slept straight through and had vivid detailed dreams .

I woke up around 11am after going to bed around 4am. I still had memory troubles but not nearly as bad as the night before . I tried to convince myself I was fine and realised i still felt strange and the letters looked a bit jumbled still. I’ve tried to brush it off all day but still feeling weird. a recent feeling in the past 6-7 hours i’ve attained is the feeling like i’m waking up and suddenly realising i’m doing something while i’m doing it subconsciously . but if i backtrack and i try to remember it all feels fine. just not in the moment. this is the thing that is freaking me out . 

any advice please ? any at all? does this sound like a brain bleed /mental confusion/delirium? or could this be explained by anxiety / derealization /tiredness? so scared honestly don’t know what to do.",1679335328.0

Especially because for some stupid reason I've placed all my eggs in one basket and insisted on becoming a successful author no matter how stupid or hard or impossible it is to do that these days. I haven't even tried to date anyone in over 10 years so though I'd like a relationship, I'm socially inept and awkward. I also have a lot of baggage not just from an abusive father but from two abusive relationships I was stupid enough to get into. At my age with my history, no one wants to even attempt to deal with that nonsense and as I said I'm inept at socializing because of my own problems. I don't have a ""career"" like my siblings. I don't have a family. I don't even have a job because of a permanent disability making it almost impossible for me to work. Though I have written several novels, they more than likely will never see anything resembling profit or commercial success. Most of my days are spent playing video games, hating my life, and writing because I'm too stubborn to give up on that dream despite every single sign telling me that I'm old, it's over, and there's no way I'm talented enough to make it work. 

I know that people will say that I shouldn't measure my success by other people or people around me but let me tell you. It's exceedingly hard to show up to family functions when all your siblings are married professionals with their own houses and you are the loser who has been single for 15 years because she can't manage to get into a relationship that's not abusive and would prefer to stay at home, alone with her cat who's gonna die soon anyway because he's old. If you want to suggest therapy or medication...I've done both. Medication isn't a fix for me and I've tried it on and off for years. Therapy has been a constant in my life since I was 18 so if you can possibly imagine it I was far worse than \*this\* before now. If anything I could \*possibly\* say it's a miracle that I've come as far as I have with recovering from abuse, dealing with addiction, an eating disorder, and my anxiety issues. Yet, at the same time, I desire things that I'm 99% sure I can never have and I know I'm running out of time. Is there any way to cope with the fact that my life just isn't going to get fixed and I'm pretty much doomed to waiting the clock out for the next 30-40 years if I'm somehow lucky enough not to get cancer or some other terrible disease?",1679288321.0

I don’t typically share on here and I’m unfamiliar with Reddit but my partner suggested I give it a go. I experienced something this morning and I believe it to be related to my anxiety. 
I woke up and started completing my typically morning routine, all was well. I came to the end of the list of things I have to do in my head. I left very sick to my stomach. I’ve been trying to become more aware of my anxiety symptoms and have noticed they often show as tummy issues. Typically physical, both feeling like I need to vomit and poop my pants. I ran to the bathroom and vomited. I had to reach out to my boss and explain the situation. I woke with children. I was also informed and asked about my colleague, whom I work with directly, they were possibly going to be out for the day as well causing a staffing issue. 
I feel guilty and a lot of other emotions about the situation. It feels like I let my team down. I also have a tendency to think and help others without thinking about  myself in the process.

I’ve been following this community for a while, and I just wanted to share my story and maybe meet some people going through or who have been through a similar situation. I've never felt more alone in my life and I feel like I'll be heard here. 

I’m 21, and growing up wasn’t easy. I carry a lot of trauma and guilt from seeing my mom sick pretty much my whole life and growing up in a toxic environment. I always took care of my mom from a young age which made me very attached to her, and honestly, even though she was sick, she was really the best mother I could’ve ever asked for. fast forward, after a lot of treatment and a lot of struggle, my mom recovered :) and 2022 was one of her best years. she was very healthy and started doing very well. It was the best year for my family and me as a whole. unfortunately, that came to an end, and she suddenly passed in November 2022. That came as a big shock to everyone because she was so healthy. no health problems, regular tests, she was perfectly fine. Everything for me came crashing down. I've always had anxiety, and due to that anxiety, I was vaping heavily for so many years (6 to be exact) until February 6th, 2023, came around. I had one of the worst panic attacks ever, and now I'm dealing with so many symptoms. Got so many tests done because I was having so many stroke-like and heart attack-like symptoms. Tests came back pretty much all normal, and I got diagnosed with a panic disorder and health anxiety. My psychiatrist thinks due to my mom passing away so suddenly, and I also have an underlying fear for myself.

I'm writing this because I've never felt so alone. I feel like people close to me don't understand what I'm going through physically and mentally, and I just want to be my old self again. All these symptoms started so suddenly, and I'm scared almost every day, not knowing if I will wake up the next day or what might happen to me. I'm scared my own body will fail me.  I'm tired, and I'm tired of feeling like I'm in this alone. I'm trying my best to correlate everything with anxiety, but it's so hard. 

Thank you so much for reading if you did read all of this. I will be okay, and I will get better. I'm slowly starting to see progress.

I’ve been dealing with the most crippling anxiety for the past 6 months or so. I’m on my own, there’s no one to help me and I need to take care of my family but this anxiety has me feeling stuck and unable to do anything to help myself. It’s debilitating and cyclical, the anxiety stops me from doing what I need to do and then I have increased anxiety from neglecting the things I need to do. I feel utterly stuck. I tried lexapro but after just two doses I felt like I might need inpatient treatment or something, it made my anxiety 1000x worse. I locked myself in my basement and cried for 4 days. It scared the shit out of my kids and terrified me. I know that can happen for the first couple of months when taking SSRI meds but it was so awful I never dared to take another pill. I have a rx of Wellbutrin but I haven’t dared to try it, I was traumatized by my reaction to the lexapro. I can’t take benzo drugs, the last thing I need is something habit forming and addictive so those are out of the question. My anxiety is the worst in the morning. Every day I wake up in fight or flight mode, I can’t overstate how awful it is. I cry all the time. I don’t eat, like, ever. Obviously can’t sleep and when I take sleeping pills I have terrible dreams and wake up crying. God it fucking sucks. I can’t afford therapy, there’s no way I could pay for that right now. I use the box breathing technique a lot and it helps a little. I’ve tried meditating but I really suck at it. I’ve tried the little trick where you think of 5 names starting with each letter or the alphabet but it makes me more anxious for some reason. Im not religious though I wish I was. I’d pray if I believed. This is long guys, sorry about that. I’m just so desperate for some advice. I’ll try anything you’ve got, nothing is too silly. 
TLDR: tips for reducing bad anxiety w/o medication would be appreciated.

two years ago, i (16M) was sitting on my bed watching a movie, nothing special. suddenly i remembered something, pretty sure that's what started it and that's probably what's called a ""trigger"". 
I remebered that i was supposed to be meeting my crush after not seeing her or even talking to her for 3 years. i have severe anxiety, so that made me anxious, like really..really anxious. i couldn't breathe properly, i was panting so hard i literally couldn't catch my breath or even SEE. i quickly got out of my bed and tried to move around my room, hoping that this isn't what i think it is. but it only got worse, the inability to breathe has become intolerable at this point. i got out of the room, kept walking around the apartment and trying to calm my self down. i sat on a chair and tried to recollect my thoughts and hopefully ""be back to normal"". But still, it got worse. I know that people who experience panic attacks say that during the attack, they feel like it's almost certain they're going to die. but i never really felt any of that, so i'm not sure if this was a panic attack. I kept panting and i was unable to breathe or move. i fell to the ground and my hand was shaking and doing involuntary movements, like slamming itself on the ground and hitting it. i dont remeber trying to move my hand since like i said i could barely even move. it literally moved on its own. my head started doing the exact same thing, weird and involuntary movements. i didn't know what to do, i didn't want to ask for help cause i felt like what's happening isn't actually real. and that it's all in my head. Breathing kept getting harder and harder, and i just couldn't stop thinking about what i'll do when i meet her, what i'll wear, what i'll say, the way i look like, my stupid frizzy hair, my insane acne, my insecurities and stuff like that. it was making me so anxious and i never experienced something like that so i was scared. i felt like crying but i haven't cried for as long as i can remeber, i cant cry anymore, so i couldn't. i tried my best to get up from the ground and try to take a shower, i thought it might help, but i couldn't since i was so damn focused on my breathing and the fact that whatever it is that's happening to me WONT FREAKING STOP. just to tell you how bad it was, i was like this for about an hour. like imagine not being able to breathe, see or move for a whole god damn hour. eventually i was able to stand and walk so i hopped in the shower hoping for this to stop. while showering the breathing still got worse until i finally calmed down and everything stopped as suddenly as it occurred.

If anyone knows if this is a panic attack, or what the hell that is, i'd love to know.

382,Anxious of my stepdad,1,11wlafr,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11wlafr/anxious_of_my_stepdad/,3,"I am a 19 year old female and currently living with my mother and stepfather. As long as I can remember, I've always been anxious of my stepdad to the point of fucking paranoia that he will scream at me over something. It used to be even worse when I was younger. He would often scream and slam shit around over the smallest incidents like if I forgot to do a chore or if I left a small dirt spot on a dish. He would often call me stupid, lazy and pathetic for it and that I don't do things the way he does it. Like ok I get it I'm mentally slow and a fucking retard no need to rub it in.  Even if I haven't really even done anything he always acts like I'm just a giant scum of the earth and seems annoyed with me. One result of this is that I would always tend to lie and hide things from him in order to protect myself. I have no idea that whatever I do will trigger him or not. I just feel like anything I do will anger him and cause him to yell at me and cuss me out whether it's rational or irrational that he would. As a result, even if I'm not even lying he thinks I am with little evidence I'm lying causing unnecessary drama. Whenever I did lie or hide something he just thinks I lie because he thinks I enjoy lying and getting away with shit but it's not the case I'M FUCKING TERRIFIED OF HOW HE WILL REACT AND YET HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT He thinks and accuses my personality thinking I'm spoiled, lazy and entitled which I can admit I can be a bit lazy, but how the hell am I entitled and spoiled? He apparently likes to think that I think I know everything when I'm not doing things the way he likes it which is not the fucking case. I tend to constantly be in my room when he's home and I barely come out unless I really need to use the bathroom. I don't even eat much since he's almost always sitting in the kitchen table and I'm extremely nervous to even be seen by him. I don't want him to know that I'm home. I feel like every interaction I have with him just turns into a scream show. If I ever make a dumb or clumsy mistake he yells. I even told him how he makes me feel when he yells and he just says ""well if you stop doing stupid shit and lying and hiding all the time I wouldn't have to get mad and yell idot. I don't give a fuck if you're scared this is all on you so stop blaming me because you're """"scared""""!"" He never cares about how I feel and just thinks I need to stop being so sensitive and scared all the time. Whenever I used to cry from him yelling he would scream at me more to ""stop crying. This is all on you"" So for years I had to force suppress all my anger, hatred, and fear around him then he wonders why I never come out of my room and talk to him. He often would complain how I'm always in my room all day and never come out and do anything besides work and school. I just want to be far away from him as possible. I don't want anything to do with him at all. I don't know if this is what parents should do to their kids and I'm just being overly dramatic or if I'm emotionally traumatized by his emotional abuse towards me. He has never touched me in a sexual perverted way, but he has spanked me with a belt multiple times if I accidentally screw up something or lie or hide something. Though I do have a lot of paranoia and anxiety around him, it hasn't affected my close relationships with others. I do have bad social anxiety and tend to be really shy around people and having trouble making friends, but I've always been a shy kid even before I met my stepdad. The difference was I was still pretty happy and expressive around my family back then. Now, I always tend to hide what I feel around them hence my stiff robotic demeanor. If I show any sign of anger or frustration he'll take it as I'm having an ""attitude"" then it always turns it into a damn scold and lecture when it's literally the last thing I fucking want from him. The only people I talked to about this was my boyfriend and my biological father and that's it. I always wasn't sure if I'm just being too sensitive and whiny since I always see parents yelling at their kids about things, and their kids just tolerate it everytime with not much fuss. My mom doesn't really yell at me, but she always agrees with what my stepdad says. She just says ""your stepdad has done many things for us like taking you to Disney world, buying a house for us, paying the bills and food for us. You should still love and appreciate him"" Yeah, well it's hard to do that knowing all he does is terrorize me. I can't stop shaking. I have gotten to where I just don't know how much longer of this I can take. I am just right on the verge of just packing my shit and just live somewhere in the woods until I can find my own place. I have a part time job to help me save money to find my own place. The anxiety and anger only just keeps getting worse the longer I stay here. I even have occasional fucking nightmares about him. Right now, I'm scared to seek help. I feel like something is wrong with me emotionally, but at the same time I sometimes question if this is normal and I just need to grow up and get over it, or if I actually need help. I feel like I don't even know my own mind or myself sometimes. I'm never sure of literally everything. My parents never understand me, and I've been too afraid to even talk about my emotions with them since they aren't the most emotionally supportive so I stay constantly guarded and never open up. Then they always wonder why I hardly ever smile or show much emotion. For one, I stay guarded and two I often feel so jaded I just stop caring about life and many other things. I feel like I'm just sort of chained up with my mouth shut forced to just take any bullshit that comes to me. There's not really any other place I can go besides work and school. When my stepdads home I always try to call into my job and work long extra shifts to get away from him. They're controlling about where I go how long I can be out to places, so I feel like work is my only other effective get away. I'm sorry if this is long and I'm sure you're gonna keep scrolling, but I really just want to know if this is normal and I'm the one being mentally crazy or I don't even know.",1679324998.0

We were mutually one of the only people we would see during lockdown/isolation, watching movies together and a few times sleeping over. In a normal case I would have liked to make a move, but due to the circumstances of the pandemic and the uncertainty of the situation, I didn't want to risk making her uncomfortable and losing that connection. Besides, I felt I had no actual reason to think she might feel the same way back.


She comes from far away. Like, 10 hour drive far away. The summer before and during the first pandemic year I drove to her town to hang out for a week with her and other friends from our school who live there, but mostly her. I thought I was always fine with knowing she probably doesn't feel the same way, I genuinely enjoyed driving all that way just to do something fun, but I guess it was pretty clear I had a crush on her. 


Over the last year our lives got busy and we didn't connect much, she moved across the ocean for grad school, but when we did talk I'd get an ""I miss you!"", ""Wish you could be here"" or ""Come visit!"". I interpreted this a certain way and made it an effort to try to talk more through FaceTime whenever we had the chance. I finally realized I had an opportunity to tell her how I feel so one day I told her. I said I enjoy being her friend but at some point those feelings became more than just friendly. Her response wasn't an affirmation of her mutual feelings for me, but it wasn't a total shutdown either. She never said she doesn't like me back, and never told me she couldn't, so I think part of my brain is still holding on to some sort of hope. Since telling her we still spend hours on FaceTime occasionally. 


I went to a party last weekend with some mutual friends who know her from her home town where I learned some things and was presented with some opinions that have been messing with my head ever since. I sheepishly joked to them that I have a big crush on her and their responses sorta surprised me. ""Oh we know, it was super obvious"". Well now that I look back at it, I guess it was. ""We don't like how mean she was to you and how she always leads you on."" I became confused when they presented me with this. I never felt like she had been mean to me, but the more I reflect on it the more I start to see their point.


What I learned after however was what really made me feel sick to my stomach and is the reason I need to vent with this post. We all have a mutual friend, let's call him Mark. Mark is a fundamentally good guy, he is an extremely intelligent guy, but Mark is a guy that will hit on and try to sleep with anything and more often than not comes across as an overconfident creep. Mark is the antithesis of my social anxiety, and someone I envy because it always seems to work. It turns out that last year Mark went to visit a bunch of them in that town 10 hours away and ended up sleeping with the girl I've had a crush on. 


At first it really shocked me. She had been one of the girls who complained about him in our residence. I almost couldn't believe it. But I also recognized that it really doesn't concern me. She was never my girlfriend, she doesn't have any allegiance to me, she can sleep with whomever she wants to. At the end of the day we're just friends and that's all we've ever been. Logically I have no influence on it or any grounds to be upset.


But emotionally I am hurting so much and I feel guilty for feeling this way. I couldn't sleep for 2 nights because my brain would just wander to the thought of them. I can't stop thinking about it and it's making me anxious. And now I'm realizing that I need to pull back from this friendship because deep down I still want more. Yet were we ever to become more, I don't know if I could get over the fact that she was with Mark. It's not something I would ever make her feel bad for, or shame her for, but it's not something I could forget. I'm going to take a step back from the friendship, and it's going to hurt for a bit, but I know in a little while I'll be okay. For now I'm just very sad that I'm going to lose a close friend in a way I didn't want, and feeling pathetic for being affected this much.",1679324937.0

If it would make just one person feel better it means the world to me!

Here is it:

""Here I am, performing surgery on my own soul. The surgery room is my mind, and I am the head surgeon. The scalpel that opens tissue is my desire to become the best version of myself, the scissors are my desire for knowledge and expanding my consciousness, the needles and sutures are my discipline in precisely targeting hard-to-reach aspects of my soul. The retractors that keep it open are my commitment to the healing process and sticking by it, and the suctions that remove debris are my positivity in removing toxicity and negativity in all their forms. The nurses and assistant doctors are my family and supportive close ones, and the skill that flows through my hands is my own power of will exercised by the teachings of the great minds that contributed to human knowledge and legacy.""

393,Should Lexapro take away all anxiety? Do I need something stronger?,1,11wk24i,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11wk24i/should_lexapro_take_away_all_anxiety_do_i_need/,2,"Hello everyone! I have a long history of anxiety - it first started flaring up badly as panic attacks in 8th grade and has manifested in a bunch of different ways since then (now in my late 20's.) I never took medication for it until 2019, when I moved to a new state for a job where I knew no one and was so incapacitated by anxiety that I could barely function. At that point, I started Lexapro. I never really knew if it was the Lexapro or just time passing, but after a few months I started to feel okay and haven't really been anxious between then and now (ignoring all the insanity with the pandemic lol). 

Well, I felt brave enough to accept a new job recently in another new state where I don't know anyone. It's a state I've always wanted to live in, and work I've always wanted to do. The problem is, I'm terrified of experiencing the same anxiety I felt when I moved to my current state (throwing up daily, not being able to eat anything, crying constantly, basically having to shut my body and mind down and zone out just to escape the waves of anxiety rushing through me.) I thought this time, since it's been a few years and I've been in therapy the whole time and I'm on Lexapro and I have a cat who's my best friend, maybe the anxiety wouldn't re-surface.

Spoiler alert, I haven't even moved yet and it's already here!!! I'm working my new job remotely for the first month and I'm supposed to move in mid-April. I already can't stop crying and I'm freaking out about how awful it's going to be once I actually move. So my question is: should I expect Lexapro to completely remove this anxiety? Do I need something stronger? Do I need those medications that are ""in case of emergency""? I've never been prescribed any of those because doctors always said they're habit forming and bad for you. At this point I'm disappointed in myself but wishing I'd never accepted a new job just to avoid all of this. I hate that anxiety has to get in the way of following my dreams but maybe that's just how life is for me??",1679321764.0

I'm (27F) fighting with anxiety attacks on and off in the last few years and it seems to get worse so I try to seek out help from people who also had similar issues in the past and managed to find a solution without medications.

Sometimes I get an anxiety attack from health related issues (unfortunately I have a slight hipochondria which makes it hard to ignore some health problems which are might not even be real) and when I get an attack it causes me some kind of  weaker episodes for days, where I start to feel my stomach, which turns into diarrhea (sorry for being graphic), slight shaking, feeling dreadful, on the verge of crying and most importantly I feel lightheaded. These symptoms get better with time if I tough it out but the woozy feeling and slight headache keep on for hours, sometimes the whole day. 

Recently I started to check my blood pressure but i have a certain fear toward the test itself, therefore I always get a high result on the first check. Even though the following ones are usually lower, because of the first higher one I get anxiety and from there I am not able to calm down, and come the afformentioned symptoms. I really have a hard time with this and although I already booked an appointment to look into this with a psychologist I cannot seem to find a solution to calm down the dizziness and headache.

There is a chance that I'm also struggling with high blood pressure but it doesn't really add up with the dizziness for me.

you just know you're done when the breakup no longer feels sad but is actually COMFORTING. 

here is the bad part tho.

just want to clarify that I DID NOT BELIEVE ANY OF THAT SHIZ, not even a bit. 

it is just so concerning that when i did not reply, he said that he is going to see me one day and return all my things. 

IT TRIGGERED MY HYPERVIGILANCE. i really dont want to see him anymore and it made me so much anxious just thinking about the fact that he'll show up at my house one day and ask me to be back with him. i don't want to experience that embarrassment again with my family or friends. 

sadly, i had to break no contact to tell him that i will be running an errand near his place so whatever it is that he needs to return, he can give it to me by then. if he cannot meet me up at this time, just throw it away because i probably don't need it anymore. he told me that i am not in the position to utter commands and order him around, he'll do it at his own way and if i want to throw it away, i should do it myself. i know i shouldve expected this from him, the same man bitsh that is begging for me to come ack just a few days ago and he went out of his way to tweet that i have always disappointed him, so why should he expect anything meaningful from me.

416,Thinking of deferring law school due to mental health and burn out. Need support.,1,11wexvw,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11wexvw/thinking_of_deferring_law_school_due_to_mental/,0,"Hey all, 
For context I’m 17F and in week 4 of 1L, so have just started law school. 

However, these past three years, but specifically last year was so hard on me. On top of enormous pressure and performing at a ridiculous standard in high school to get into law, my grandpa who had been battling with a brain tumour died 3 days before my first exam. These exams were the ones that dictated whether or not I’d get into university. For some background, my grandpa was like my father to me. When I was younger especially, my dad wasn’t home often as he was constantly working as a lawyer and would get home really late so I wouldn’t see him. As a result, my grandparents looked after me and I spent countless hours with them, and still see my grandma every week. As you can imagine, his death was possibly the most devastating thing for me. Seeing someone so articulate and intelligent being unable to move nor speak to you was so hard, but I had to push it all aside and after burying him in the ground, I went into school - no literally, 30 minutes after the burial I had to go to school for final exam prep. 

Anyways, this was in November of 2022. I got through exams, and for the first time in what felt like forever I felt happy at Christmas. My mind was clear, I was surrounded by family and didn’t have any responsibilities. I even managed to stop anti depressants for my anxiety which had been bad from 2020-2022 but especially ramped up in the period of his deaths to the point where I got through my days with whiskey and beta blockers. 

So I had a brief intermission of calm. I was happy for about 3 weeks till about February this year until it all came rushing back. Anxiety, panic attacks, derealization. Just like that put back on 10 mg of lexapro, which I’ve been on for just under 4 weeks. The trigger? Possibly University. Being back in an educational context with such high stakes and workload such as law may have caused this relapse. But I decided I’d push through, and have one to uni these past four weeks with the help of beta blockers. It’s been probably one of the most difficult weeks since my grandpa died. Exhaustion, unable to leave the house without terrible anxiety and just loss of ability to enjoy anything. I’ve spoke to my therapist and he thinks I need a break from study and need some time to actually relax and process to allow my body o heal. 

Besides the mental strain I’ve been under, there’s also been physical and health issues I’ve been dealing with, being hyperthyroidism, and as of a week ago, iron deficiency. Seems like my body wants me to stop, but I don’t want to. Studying gives me a sense of purpose, of validation. 

I guess all I ask for is for some advice please. This is a big decision for me and I really just want someone to talk to and hear me. Thank you in advance :)",1679307899.0

418,Anxiety around checking phone,2,11waxvc,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11waxvc/anxiety_around_checking_phone/,1,"I find that when I have something that requires me to check for a new notification/result I want on my phone, I can't stop checking. Does anyone else have this issue?  


For me its property websites, dating apps and job websites. In my life at the moment, all of my main goals rely on this checking - I'm 32, single and live alone and work as a remote freelancer.  


1) I want to live with other people so that I feel less isolated (in my case this means buying a property). So I check the property websites constantly.  
2) I want to date someone as it feels like it will help with isolation. So I check the dating apps for new matches and messages constantly.  
3) I want to find a new work contract as my current one leaves me with not enough to do so I focus on my thoughts too much (and I need a slightly higher income for the house purchase). So I check job sites for contracts constantly.  


I try and tell myself to check them all once a day at a fixed time and then no more, but I find this almost impossible to do. Throughout the day I get distracted and excited about the idea that there might be a new contract/house/message that could change my life for the better and be a great opportunity, and I can't help myself but check. When I do it get that momentary satisfaction, but then I feel anger or disappointment when I don't get what I want. And it is almost inevitable that I don't, because I only checked a few hours/minutes ago. Then I do it again a bit later, and the more I do it the more I get anxious. Its a vicious cycle...  


excitement ---> momentary satisfaction of checking ---> anger/dissapointment (when I don't find what I want) ---> anxiety (obsessing over the thing I just checked) ---> excitement  


At night time I often can't sleep. I may keep checking, or just lay in bed and tell myself that I'm a failure because I'm not achieving my goals, and I'm a loser and that is why I'm single, I'll never find work because I'm incompetent, etc... I really feel backed into a corner, like all of my goals are blocked by these external factors outside of my control.  


The checking is motivated by a genuine desire to improve my life, so is not inherently bad in moderation. I tell myself I'm not a failure as a person, or even in the social terms of success, eg. I'm intelligent, hard working, built my own freelance business etc... I tell myself that these problems are just temporary, and that in 6 months my work situation and house will be solved. Right now several stressful life events are happening at once and I don't have enough support around me.  


It would be good to develop a better mental relationship with the 'checking', in the past I have avoided most social media etc... for similar reasons to do with checking too often (I could avoid these sites as they weren't critical to my life goals). I have weekly therapy and have spoken about this issue and the suggestion was to try and check things only once per day at a fixed time.  


Would love to hear other people's experiences with this.",1679294073.0

420,*Serious* I was harassed/profiled while walking alone a couple of years ago. I’ve been having random yet disorienting flashbacks ever since.,0,11werlx,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11werlx/serious_i_was_harassedprofiled_while_walking/,0,"I’m hoping to gain some reassurance & perspective to help me develop a healthier, and less scared/upset frame work, and some support from others by discussing the situation I’m about to share. 

All helpful and insightful advice/support is appreciated. TW: the story involves racial bias and street harassment. 

I (F 20’s) was walking by myself in the Summer time in the downtown area of the city I live in a couple years back. Ironically, I was on my way to a therapist appointment of all things. At this point I was receiving therapy/treatment for CPTSD, Agoraphobia, ADHD, and Autism.

I was about two blocks away from the therapist’s office, when I noticed the sidewalk was being blocked by a group of people, eight to be exact. 

There was no way of getting around them without stepping into street traffic, so I politely said “Pardon me, I just need to squeeze through.”

I waited a few seconds for them to move off to the side since I didn’t want to accidentally/rudely walk through the middle of the group, even though there was enough room to do so.

Not only did they not move, but as I proceeded to walk past them without shoving through, they were already collectively leering at me when I was about a block away from them. 

I could tell they didn’t want me to walk near them from a block away, but perception isn’t always reality, well, except in this case.

Out of the group, 5 of the people berated me. One lady proceeded to get angry and yelled without hesitation “Uhh huh, yeah, all you wh*te folks be acting the same.” I was shocked but ignored it and kept waking.

While lady 1 is yelling, lady 2 is saying almost at the same time “all you ugly wh*te b*tches are the same, so f*cking entitled.” Man 1 shouted “Dumb cr*cker!” At me, while lady 3 echoed the “cr*cker” remark. Lady 4 said “Don’t be walking up in here unless you want your a** beat.” 

All of this hostility because someone they perceived as different, or perhaps maybe a threat for existing in the same space as them even just for a second while walking on a public sidewalk is something I can’t comprehend, especially as someone who is notably multi-ethnic/multi-racial but is otherwise wh*te presenting.

I understand and empathize when it comes to history and epigenetics, and the realities that a majority of BIPOC folks endure in their daily lives. There’s a lot of internalized oppression and hurt. I completely get it.

However, now my mind and body are perpetually disoriented. I don’t know how to proceed if I were to ever end up in this type of scenario again. 

I didn’t do anything that commanded the amount of hate and wrath I received. I kept it pushin’ and minded my own business.

To this day I can’t get myself to walk in that part of town again. I already struggled with mild (now severe) agoraphobia at the time and was working towards getting through it, but this scenario (and other scenarios) put me right back in my shell. 

I’ve survived so much violence and bullying throughout my life. My body is physically sick from years of abuse, neglect, and displacement.

All I can think is “How can anyone be so vile and harmful towards someone who simply and politely said pardon me while trying to get somewhere?” 

I’m not a reactive person, and as someone who’s been through violence and abuse on all fronts I knew to just walk away and to create distance.

I guess what I’m asking is, how can I best handle/process racial bias/hate/street harassment if it were to happen again?

If anyone has had a similar experience, or solid advice please share.

P.S., this is **not** your place to be racist or hateful towards me, or anyone in the BIPOC community. I also hope the mods are ok with me asking for support/clarity on this as long as the comments are dignified.",1679307306.0

429,Sobbed in front of multiple strangers at work today (warning: long),3,11w6oog,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11w6oog/sobbed_in_front_of_multiple_strangers_at_work/,3,"I (22f) am a college graduate who has had some trouble finding a stable career, so right now I'm working two part-time jobs. During the week I'm a cashier at a restaurant, and on Sundays I work for a pet welfare organization taking care of cats and handling the adoptions. We're a separate organization, but we have our adoption centers in a large chain pet store.

I thought the cat job would be perfect for me, as I've had cats all my life. But the adoption center I work in is really cramped, and it's in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of the store. People can see me through the glass, and there's constant noise. I've had meltdowns at my other job before, but it's easier to access the bathroom to hide, plus there's usually someone there to help me out. At the pet store, I'm by myself.

Today started alright. I covered for somebody yesterday and was quite overstimulated, but I figured today would be calmer, and for a while it was. I finished cleaning the kennels and had done a successful adoption earlier, so now I was just waiting. One family (a very pregnant woman, her husband, a four-year-old boy and a one-year-old girl) showed up, and I let them enter the visitation area to meet some of the cats. They explained that they had just come from another one of our locations and were looking for a cat for their daughter's birthday. A little strange, since she was just a baby, but I told them about the temperaments of the cats here, and that we did have a policy that families with children under 5 must adopt a cat 6 months or older. I also said that applications do usually take a day or so to be reviewed. They accepted and began playing with a few in one kennel. 

One cat, Sabor, is extremely friendly and playful, and jumped down instantly when I opened his cage. The son seemed to really connect with him, though being a kid he wasn't super gentle with the cats. The little sister wanted to take a look, but then she tried to climb inside the kennel. The parents held her back, and as soon as they did she began *screaming* and crying. Keep in mind this is a very enclosed space, so I (and the cats) had our eardrums blasted. She kept trying to climb into different cages, and every time her parents picked her up she'd unleash more piercing wails. They're still asking me questions, all the while the boy is also running to different cages asking me to open them. I'm shaking a little bit but keeping my composure and answering them.

Sabor is flinching because the girl is literally screaming in his face and trying to grab at him. The mom said, ""oh he doesn't like the noise, maybe we shouldn't get him"". But the boy really liked him, and the mom said ""but I think he'll acclimate once we get him home"". I'm a little flustered and I say ""oh yeah maybe, just fill out the application and we'll see!"" I realize now I should've been more firm that I wasn't promising them anything, but it was hard to really concentrate.

They left (with the girl still screaming) and five minutes later come back. She's got a phone now and is occupied, but now the boy is getting antsy and begging his parents to get Sabor. I directed them to the online application and ran to the store's warehouse to call my supervisor. I told her that the family meets all the policy requirements, but I don't know how I feel adopting when they have two (soon three) noisy small children. She told me that Sabor came from a hoarding house and agreed that the noise may be stressful for him, and that he couldn't go home with them today.

I relayed the news to the family, and the little boy began crying. His dad comforted him while I explained the situation to his mom (not about the kids, but that it would just take a few days for us to make sure Sabor was healthy enough because of his past). I apologized profusely and clarified that I wasn't telling them no, just not yet. I even told the little boy ""don't worry, we'll keep Sabor right here until he's ready."" The mom told me ""it's okay, he's just emotional"". I told them that we'd contact them in a few days and they left. I began tearing up a bit, both from the stress of the noise but also I genuinely felt bad for making the boy upset. 

But it didn't end there. Minutes later, one of the store cashiers came up to me and said, ""there's a lady who says that you won't give her a cat. I just wanted to know your side of the story first."" And that's when I just broke down. I was sitting on the ground (where I thought other people couldn't see me), struggling to get words out and heaving sobs like a fool. Worse, the pregnant woman had returned and was standing right outside the center. All I could say was ""sorry, sorry, sorry"" and I just booked it to the bathroom, where I sobbed and texted my supervisor what happened, and then my boyfriend for comfort.

My supervisor assured me that I'd done the right thing, and showed up so that I could go home. Soon, however, I found out the woman had gone back to the other location to ask ""what was going on"". Apparently she said that her son's heart was broken and that they were promised a cat (not true), only for me to turn them down. She said that I was ""acting weird,"" ""clearly filling in for someone else,"" and - here's the kicker - that I was ""profiling"" her (she was white...). She didn't yell, but she did guilt trip them, saying her kids were really attached to Sabor and they had a good home, so it was weird for us to not let them take him home that day.

I don't know. I guess I just wanted to write this all down. My coworkers all took my side, and I don't think the family will be returning, but I'm still nervous to go back in case somebody recognizes me as the cat lady who freaked out. I hate making people upset, and I hate people seeing me lose composure. I'm relaxing in my quiet room now, with my own sweet cat beside me, and at least I won't be back there for another week.",1679281551.0

Anyways, over my time here in college, and mainly for the past 10 weeks or so I’ve developed a really bad case of health anxiety; I never thought anxiety could get worse :( Though I’ve been able to manage most of it, I’ve started to trace it back to this instance this past summer where I used Epoxy/Resin for the first time and I didn’t wear a mask to protect myself from whatever chemicals were in it. That night I got lightheaded and thought I was going to die. This was over 6 months ago and I’m just scared that this epoxy is still in my system killing me or I’m going to go blind or something from it. I need support",1679298353.0

I’ve tried therapy, and I’m restarting counselling, but generally people say I’m a nice person, I’ve never been called anything to my face to suggest I’ve acted in anyway towards people that’s pushed them away?
I’m at such a loss. I feel like each year that goes by people make less of an effort with me. Just today alone, I’ve messaged 2 people light-hearted questions and neither have responded after reading it. I get people are busy, but I guarantee I don’t hear from them now.

441,Can permanent tension headaches and muscle tension be anxiety?,3,11w3xz6,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11w3xz6/can_permanent_tension_headaches_and_muscle/,5,"I have been dealing with permanent (24/7) tension headaches and muscle tension, mainly in my neck and shoulders, for the last five months, every single day, nonstop.  In theory, I have been tense for years (that's what physiotherapists told me several times); however, I never felt it until now.   


The tension headaches and muscle tension are so intense that I had to stop my Ph.D. studies and have been on medical leave for the last four months since I can't concentrate or sit at my desk for long times doing any intelligent work.   


I have visited many doctors and two neurologists, and after all the visits and tests, they all agree that my problem is anxiety. However, I somehow do not understand it. And I have two questions:  


* If these problems are anxiety induced, how come I never felt any pain before? I have spent most of my life with anxiety (without really knowing it) and never had any physical problems. Also, how can it be that my tension has not improved after four months of resting from work, eating better, doing more sport, and going to physiotherapy for massages? It makes no logical sense to me. 
* I have been reading posts in this subreddit for several months now, and for most people with anxiety, muscle tension, or tension headaches are not even a problem, or they don't seem to be suffering it 24/7. Somehow, that makes me think my problem is not just anxiety. Otherwise, it would be more common. No?

But it's never been to a point of having a physical impact on my body and therefore I figured I didn't have any anxiety issues/worth seeking help from a professional.

For the past few months I've had a series of things unfold including minor pains in my left arm/leg and left side of Chest. More importantly I've also had a few headaches and eye related issues arise such as floaters, minor blurriness, and particles in my peripheral view of my left eye. Ive seen my PCP, a Rheumatoid doctor, neurologist, and pulmonary doctor who have conducted a range of tests that have all returned normal. My last stop is checking in with a cardiologist that I'm seeing to have an echocardiogram done and Stress test. The only thing that has popped up so far has been a deficient Vitamin D level at 22 and a low B12 level of 350.

I'm seeing a therapist for the first time this upcoming week, but am curious to see if others can share what they experience with anxiety and how it has it has affected them physically? I'd also like like to know if anxiety and Stress is a result, how long does it typically take for you to get over your condition?

Lastly, does anyone have any recommendations or management tools for going through this phase? Im having a hard time not worrying especially with the health conditions at hand. I can't help but to keep worrying if my body is physically bit feeling well.

 A little bit about my anxiety:
I have had anxiety most of my life, but over the past five years my anxiety has been much more severe. In 2019 I smoked weed and had a really bad experience. The night I smoked weed I thought I was dying for eight hours. After that night, I experienced panic attacks throughout every day, multiple times a day for four months. During this time, and after the four month period I started to experience, derealization symptoms and dissociation. I have now been experiencing these symptoms for the past 5 years. I also have panic attacks because of how scary the feelings of derealization are. In the recent six months, I have started to fear my panic attacks, and I’ve started to avoid places in which I may have a panic attack. I am a social person, and I try to exercise often (as it helps my mental health) but lately I am having a very difficult time socializing or exercising because the symptoms of anxiety are pretty severe. I am thinking about starting medication, but I don’t know if it is the right option for me. I don’t want it to make anything worse and I don’t really want to be reliant on a medication. I have talked to doctors about my hesitation but they have suggested a low dose for now. The medication they recommend for me is escitalopram oxalate. Apparently this medication like many can have harsh symptoms. I know everyone’s experiences are different but I want to know if anyone has had experiences like mine and have started medication.

476,How to Deal with Past Trauma and Shame?,8,11vrcc7,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11vrcc7/how_to_deal_with_past_trauma_and_shame/,7,"Hey guys,

On my throwaway for obvious reasons, but I’d like some advice. I’ll try to keep as brief as I can—though I’m notoriously bad at it, so bear with me. TL;DR at bottom.

Ten years ago, I was a teenager who made a big mistake and betrayed someone’s trust. I was immediately ostracized by my then-friend group as a result of the events that took place. Unfortunately, as my dumb teenage ass was a bit of an attention-seeking immature young girl, I had also lied about a different event involving someone else. When confronted with the discovery of my situation, I was so scared to face the repercussions of what I’d done that I isolated myself, and became self-destructive. I moved to a different country, blocked anyone in my life even related to incidents and tried my best to “move on”—I had to do that because I started receiving constant unprovoked harassment even after months of being gone. When I say this is pretty dumb stuff in retrospect, I mean it. No one was in danger, nothing was illegal, all it amounted to was strained relationships, think ‘gossip girl’ drama type crap—I got what I signed up for. 

But for the past ten years, I’ve ran from it, thinking it would go away. Now, as coincidence would have it, I’m moving to a new city and I’ve been made aware that this is the home turf of all these people who grew quite disdainful of me. Or maybe, they don’t even remember me at all. 

Someone in the periphery,who has remained friendly despite it all during the past few years recently invited me to a celebratory event, highlighting the presence of said people as a way to make me feel comfortable because “I know them.”They also other friends, who had nothing to do with the falling out—lovely people who I don’t even remember because all I think about is the bad. This brought back to the surface the shame I still feel regarding this period. It’s like all the positive memories have been erased and I’m left with shame, shame and more shame. 

I’m not trying to victimize myself, since I was in the wrong here, but I do think my paranoia is getting the best of me. I am moving to pursue grad school in my dream field, not for a social life, but I already sense this causing me living in a new country extreme amounts of stress and anxiety to the point I’m even questioning whether I should. Whether I’m invading in their turf. I know, again, this is stupid, but it clearly means I’m not actually over what happened. But I want to be. Desperately. I am a new person now, I’ve had peaceful, happy friendships for the past seven years or so of my life—but this incident brings so much repressed fear it makes impossible to see this move as something positive anymore. All I can think about is how much these people want to see me burn—when in all likelihood, I know they probably don’t even give a crap about it anymore. This is my problem and one I must face.

Except, I don’t know how. How do I go about releasing the shame and guilt over this drama from way back when? I booked a session with my therapist to set me on the right path, but I don’t know what else would be useful. I want to be better and leave this in the past, facing it, if you will, but I struggle to see how. 

I also believe forcing the people directly involved into some kind of sit-down and talk session would be extremely selfish of me since they have brand new lives and I don’t want to intrude upon them with my baggage. This is my problem and my problem alone.

Any tips?

TL;DR: Fucked up 10 years ago with then HS friend group, was blacklisted. Caused long-term trauma. Moving to a city littered with connections to these people—who in all likelihood barely even remember it. Realized I haven’t faced any of this trauma and internalized guilt and shame as a result and want to find out how I can begin healing and face the past. I believe involving them and dragging it out for them is selfish since it looks like they’ve all moved on, but al I can do is run. How can I face my past and accept it, let go of the shame, or at least begin to?",1679246829.0

481,What are ways you deal with anxiety?,3,11vwg7t,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11vwg7t/what_are_ways_you_deal_with_anxiety/,5,"For me 2 things have been very helpful. The first one my dad taught me and the second one I learned in therapy.

1. I get really anxious on flights and ferries, and what helps (sometimes) is to look at flight attendents or just generally people working on the *insert scary public mode of transport*.

Idk if they're trained for this, but scary situations like turbulence are completely normal and nothing to fear, so as long as they look like everything is fine, it usually is. 

This obviously doesn't always work as we all know how anxiety doesn't care about logic but it has definitely helped me. (Just got off a flight where this helped me massively and inspired me to make the post).

2. Lie to yourself. When I was still in therapy, one of my biggest fears would be that people were following me and k*ll/kidnapp/r*pe me and so on. 

So one day my therapist told me to try and make up positive stories about the people I'd think these things off. So for example: A car has been driving behind you for the past 10 minutes. Instead of focusing on the ""oh my god they're going to follow me home and kidnap me at night"", I'd try to think ""okay there is a family of 7, all somehow pushed into this car and they got lost on their way to the beach, there is now chaos and they have no clue what they're doing.""

Now I must say, it took a while for this to work as I always knew I was lying to myself. But one day I realised that these anxious thoughts are lies of the same proportion so it didn't matter what I believed.


Obviously nothing is perfect, and nothing always works 100% of the time for anyone I think but I thought I'd share what's useful for me.",1679257256.0

I also have generalised anxiety disorder so there’s that. 

Also I have no friends in my class, I might have some but they aren’t close as all of them having cliques and friend groups so I’ve essentially become the only loner in my class. 

So todays the first day back to school over spring break and I’ve already missed the first period because of an anxiety attack I had this morning. The thought of having to go into an environment where I have no one to rely on, everyone hating me is so unbearable that I went into panic mode. 

To make things worse, there’s a project that I have to get into groups for by the end of today. I asked my desk mate but she’s a lot closer to her friend group. She hasn’t replied my message since yesterday and Im quite certain she’s online and has seen it. I guess that more or less feeds into the actual rejection and makes me avoid going to school just to not see her. 

Another thing is my English teacher, I haven’t completed the English homework that was due like a week ago and I’m like 90% sure the teacher’s going to call me out. In the past when I have forgotten to bring/ complete my work he has no only called me out in front of the whole class but also blamed my classmates for not reminding, making them hate me further. This teacher knows I have GAD btw but he still does it. This makes me want to pon school even more which isn’t good for me academically.

I'm a 23-year-old male in New Zealand.

Have a long history of Anxiety.

More recently, I have developed these weird sensations.

I've tried to get answers but get mixed results from the Doctors etc. (""Conversion disorder"" ""concussion"", ""stress"", to ""It's all in your head, go away""

1: I can touch myself and I can feel the touch but it's not right. It's almost as if someone is touching me.

2: I get this weird urge to move my arms and legs at random times. Some examples are when I am going away, I get this feeling and it feels like my brain is trying to stop my nose from breathing. As soon as I turn around to go home, it stops! Other times I can be at home, and it just happens.

3: I get a weird feeling all over, not numb but weak, short of breath and almost tingling? Feel like I must lie down. Also feel confused.

4: Had it happen a few times where my whole body locks up and I can't/struggle to move. This was the case when the neighbours were getting burgled in front of me and I was trying to get a photo for the cops.

5: I know where I am, I know and can recognise people but there's a layer I guess, between my memory and me conscience? Like I freak out I don't know where I am, when I do know deep down...

I can understand how some of them (like number 4 and 5) would be the flight, fight/freeze response but the others make no sense.

Anyone else get this? Kinda concerning and annoying that no one can explain what is going on and keep passing the ball to other people.

Although after my last job I did say I needed a bit of a break because I was so anxious), and I’m a bit anxious! Mainly I think I’m anxious for the travel (50 minute drive from my home), rather than the actual work itself. I often think I trigger my own anxiety, as I’m already sat here thinking “I’m going to be SO anxious tomorrow”, which I think is what triggers the anxiety. I’ve worked at this place before and loved it, but obviously there’s no rationalising with anxiety, because I can be there and knowing I’m loving it yet the anxiety still persists. I’d love any advice or words of wisdom to try and feel calmer! 

ALSO I went to the pharmacy yesterday and picked up the sertraline I was prescribed to try and help out with my anxiety, but I’m anxious to start 🤦🏻‍♀️😂",1679233751.0

It just hurts so much as my girlfriend has quickly made friends and I see her every week at church and we’ve started hanging out a couple times a week. I know it’s not good for my healing but I’m so exhausted from not being around anyone I feel comfortable with.

I jumped out of my car and tried to drink water, but I couldn’t open it because my hands were locked, finally someone pulled over and helped me.

Anytime I get stuck in traffic, I feel the tingly sensation start, and now it’s happening anytime I’m trapped anywhere! Like drive throughs that you can’t get out of, or elevators, etc. 

I’m not scared of driving or small spaces, just the possibility of having a panic attack and being stuck or not being able to escape and get somewhere if I need to.

I still laugh, talk to people and go to work fine.

519,Cycling Meds for Depression/Social Anxiety,1,11vyrry,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11vyrry/cycling_meds_for_depressionsocial_anxiety/,0,"I suffer from depression and social anxiety since I was 15 years old (symptoms occured even before but with 15 I started noticing it very clearly, with 17 I first started going to a psychiatrist and therapist). Now I'm 23 and tried 3 different forms of therapies as well as over 14 different types of meds. Nothing helped so far, nothing reduced my symptoms. It's now called treatment resistant depression and even my doc says normal therapy is not effective for my type of depression, it definitely is caused biochemically/neurologically/biologically.

Except for my very last one: Lyrica. Lyrica helps at least a bit and makes my anxiety and depression a bit better. But I know Lyrica can cause dependance and horrible withdrawal as well as tolerance, so best would be to not use it daily but only as rarely as possible. I don't want to use any substance daily at all anyways, cause I've been through many horrible withdrawals. Hence my plan of cycling substances, meds, supplements, whatver to finally have a painless life.

My doc wanted to try every possible med left with me, so she's very open for new meds, which I'm too. She mentioned Tianeptine to try on me soon as - as said - Im trying my 15th med now without success or symptom reduction, for years, 2 depth psychological (analytical) and 1 cognitive behavioral therapy failed to help. I also do sports weekly (tennis and/or gym, skiing sometimes).

I might just take it if needed then, even if she prescribes it for daily. I mean, if it‘s an opioid and one says even harder to get off than oxy… Maybe if needed same as my Lyrica so one can switch them to reduce risk of tolerance/dependance/withdrawal of each. A 3rd med of different class would still be better to have a good cycle and get maybe at least 3, maybe even 5, worthful to live days and free of suffering days a week. 2 days completely off then.

Any idea? Lyrica is gabapentinoid = calcium channels, a teeny bit of GABA receptors itself too. Tianeptine is opioid = opioid receptors. What else could be added but not using the same receptor or system? What about Buspirone, Hydroxyzine, Clonazepam? So far I only have found Lyrica & Kratom to be helpful (even if it's not ""curing"" me, just making my day and symptoms by maybe 20-50% better, but only if not taken daily - hence the need for a cycle and not taking any similar chemical daily)

As I don't want to use any similar chemical daily or many days in a row or a week at all and in the best case only one neurotransmitter/CNS system once a week max, I thought about cycling following, each one only once a week to reduce any risk of possible dependance, withdrawal or tolerance:

**Voltage gated calcium channels (Gabapentionoid):**

* **Lyrica (Pregabalin)** => said to don't have much GABAergic affinity on its own, rather acts indirectly and weakly on GABA, hence hess less risk of cross tolerance with GABAergics (if I should add any GABAergic as a benzo to my cycle, too)

**Opioidergic:**

* **Tianeptine** (opiodergic antidepressant)
* **Kratom** (legal opioidergic plant) => question is, how strong would the cross-tolerance with Tianeptine be if used with a break of many days in between as both are opiodergic afaik?

**GABA:**

* Benzodiazepine => Valium/Diazepam didn't work so I told my doc to quit my script for it as I don't find any use for it => a friend of mine with very similar symptoms had great experience with Clonazepam instead

**Dopamine and/or Norepinephrine:**

* **Ritalin**
* **Adderall**
* **Modafinil**
* or similar AD(H)D stimulant medication
* => big issue: I guess I only have a 10% chance of getting any of these stimulant AD(H)D meds cause even if I strongly suffer from symptoms very similar to ADD (without the H for hyperactivity) no doc ever wanted to test me for ADD as long as my depression and anxiety weren't cured, that's why I never got a diagnosis until now and now docs tell me, you can mainly only get a diagnosis for ADD if it has been diagnosed in the childhood or when one has been very young, also one had to have very bad grades in school for one of the diagnosis checks => so my school grades have only been medium bad, not very bad + I'm now 23 and maybe a bit too late for school medicine to hop on the ADD train even if I always had the thought of suffering from ADD cause of my very bad cognitive symptoms (focus, memory etc.) + ADD goes hand in hand with depression and anxiety and might be a cause of these symptoms afaik (so why the hell no doc ever tested me for it before trying to always continue treating me with typical depression therapy and meds instead of giving the ADD train a go???)

**Other psychiatric medication** (with need of a prescription by my doc) I thought of to add to cycle for the other left days in my week full of suffering that may be helpful for finally making my life painless and livable:

* **Hydroxyzine**
* **Buspirone**
* **Lamictal**
* **Abilify**
* **Amisulpride**
* **Selegiline**
* any other ideas? as said my doc is really open to try new meds with me cause she knows how desperate and treatment-resistant I am and have been for years now

**OTC meds/supplements/herbs** I thought of to add to cycle for the other left days in my week full of suffering that may be helpful for finally making my life painless and livable:

* **Kava:** legal anxiolytic plant, had some good experiences with it reducing my symptoms strenghts, being anxiolytic and antidepressant BUT it's a big hit and miss, causing skin issues for me (when taken some days daily in a row) and very expensive, hence surely also nothing to take daily => ALSO: there's not much science about rather it's **GABAergic** or also rather a **voltage gated calcium channel blocker (VGCC blocker)** as Lyrica, or how it really works, but it's said to not have any physical dependance or withdrawal issues or risk => question again, is there any cross tolerance with Lyrica or Benzodiazepines?
* **DXM (Dextromethorphane): dissociative antitussive** => originally a cough medicine, now officially used for depression and I already read years ago many times about people using it to self medicate their depression and anxiety in non-trip-doses (cause some people abuse it in mega-doses to get a psychedelic trip from it, which I never planned or wanted to)
* **Kanna (Sceletium tortuosum): natural SSRI** => sadly never noticed any effects from it when I tried the plain herb as well as extract orally or sublingually in low to medium dosage (some swear on having to take it intranasally to get antidepressant/anxiolytic effects but I already hate the thought of having to take something through my nose)
* Gotu Kola => seems to help a bit, might be good for my ""off-days"" off ""real stronger medication""
* Lemon Balm => seems to help a bit, might be good for my ""off-days"" off ""real stronger medication""
* Beta Alanine => some studies promise anxiolytic effects because of it's GABAergic properties

Some probably very weak herbs having no sense to try for my severe treatment-resistant depression and social anxiety:

* Tongkat Ali => testosterone increasing, read some reviews about people having success with it for depression and/or (social) anxiety
* SAM-e => read some reviews about people having success with it for depression and/or (social) anxiety
* Bacopa => read some reviews about people having success with it for depression and/or (social) anxiety
* Lions Mane Mushroom => read some reviews about people having success with it for depression and/or (social) anxiety
* KSM-66 (Ashwagandha) => read some reviews about people having success with it for depression and/or (social) anxiety BUT tried one KSM-66 product from Amazon for more than 2 weeks daily and never had success with it or any symptom reduction sadly...
* Taurine => read some reviews about people having success with it for depression and/or (social) anxiety BUT never worked for me, maybe I have to increase dosage to a mega dose?
* L-Theanine => read some reviews about people having success with it for depression and/or (social) anxiety BUT never worked for me, maybe I have to increase dosage to a mega dose?
* Silexan/Lasea (Lavender extract) => read some reviews about people having success with it for depression and/or (social) anxiety BUT never worked for me even after trying it for more than 2 weeks daily
* Rhodiola Rosea extract => read some reviews about people having success with it for depression and/or (social) anxiety BUT never worked for me even after trying it for more than 2 weeks daily as well as only as needed
* Akuamma
* Wild Lettuce
* Skullcap
* Mulungu
* Passion flower
* GABA (plain powder supplement of GABA, infamous for not crossing the BBB so not being able to have any psychoactive effects)

Sure, last resort for me is also still:

* stronger MAOIs as Nardil or Parnate (I already tried the weaker MAOI ""Moclobemide""/""Aurorix"")
* Ketamine therapy
* rTMS
* ECT",1679262254.0

I had a terrifying nightmare where I was tortured and when I woke up I didn’t realize that I did and thought that I was being tricked still, my mom tried to calm me down but when she did it suddenly appeared to me like she’s one of the people that tortured me and I almost ran away from home.

The second time was yesterday, I’m 19. I had an extreme breakdown and when she tried to calm me down she suddenly looked like a monster or a paranormal being but it was easier to snap out of it than the first time. I didn’t recognize her at all during that, even though it lasted for a minute.

Has this ever happened to anyone else? I’m not even sure if it’s anxiety anymore. Any advice is appreciated too.",1679260763.0

Throw in some deaths in the family and young adulthood and I have been in a fog for the last four years, alternating between periods of extreme terror and detached zombie mode plus wild mood swings alternating between anger and sadness and dread. I have seen 4 therapists over the last 5 years, all of whom have recommended antidepressants but I have been running from it and refusing it. I dropped out of school for two years and went into intensive outpatient and intensive treatment for OCD in style of ACT and ERP. It helped some but things got so bad that the therapist said she couldn't treat me anymore unless I went on meds. I can't take it much longer, I'm only sleeping 4-5 hours a night and barely eat much and on top of that I am back in college. I was prescribed Zoloft but I am so terrified to take it. It's been sitting on my bedside table for months and months and I am not even in contact with the psych who prescribed it anymore. I will try to make an appointment in the next few weeks though. Everything has become unbearable and I feel like I am so far away from myself. I really need to try something. But I am so scared!

My worst fear of them all is what if I am Bipolar and I take it and have mania? That is one of my worst fears with my OCD and I am 100% convinced it will happen. My therapist and psychiatrist don't believe I am Bipolar but you never know...I am scared to lose control. I am scared to experience an altered state of mind. On top of that, there are people on here who talk about the ""honeymoon"" phase where they feel intense pleasure and euphoria for a short period of time.

I'm a 18y male who is normally very active and lives quite healthy.

In the beginning of february I had a pretty bad infection without a fever which I personally believe was covid-19. A couple of weeks after this infection I started noticing heart palpitations and a sore throat every morning. And now i'm at the point where I get shortness of breath during rest and extreme shortness of breath after intense exercise coupled with my heart racing. Next to that I have a re-occuring chest pain under my left breast. The moments I get these shortness of breath episodes after exercising it sometimes feel as if your passing out. Anxiety and panick attacks have also started coming out of nowhere since I have been experiencing this. Note that this has been going on for around a month and a half now.

My doctor said everything is fine. And the hospital told me my bloodwork was fine , my lungs aren' t damaged and my heart rhytmm seems to be normal aside from occasional misplaced heartbeats. What bothers me is that I thought this would be anxiety but to me personally the shortness of breath isn't caused by anxiety at all. (It might also be worth noting that I do experience problems with stomach such as random weeks of diarrhea and never feeling fully done after going to the toilet)

Tomorrow i'm getting an Adrenaline provocation test probably to test for certain arryhtmia's and somewhere in the middle of April i'm getting a long EKG monitor test.

My problem is that I don't want to stop exercising for this although it seems wise to not exercise for a while since I have no idea what type of problem I'm facing here.

Is anyone else experiencing these symptoms and does anyone have advice for what not and what to do with this?

I have been dealing with anxiety the last few years. I feel like I have been able to cope with the different symptoms. But recently I’ve had some really strong symptoms of extreme muscle fatigue. I was at football practice a few weeks ago and suddenly felt like my body was quitting on me. Almost every step I take I feel like I’m going to pass out or something horrible is about to happen. My muscles are also super weak and I can get extra sore especially in my legs, much more than before.

I tried to exercise at the gym which I usually do, but my arms and legs would start to shake and couldn’t finish the workout. Im going to the doctor to take some tests because I feel like I’m developing some form of disease (probably just my anxiety). Even on my daily walks I can’t catch a breath and feel like my legs are going to collapse. When going to sleep my body and muscles will often start shaking hard for some reason and I feel like I’m having a stroke or something. Also lifting my arms can be hard, and it feels like they are nonexistent and not a part of my body. I don’t know if it’s me imagining myself having a stroke or heart attack, but it’s a feeling I’ve never had before. 

Im just wondering if anyone have some similar symptoms ? I feel terrified and my anxiety is almost nonstop all day because of this. Have not been able to do anything other than lay in bed the last week:( It ends up being an evil circle where I’m not able to relax at all.

My ex has never been involved. Luckily my parents help out a lot. That being said, I’m trying to work on boundaries. Last week my son was upset because he didn’t get to go out for recess because he didn’t do his homework. I was fine with this, because it’s a natural consequence and a good teaching moment. What does my mom start to do? Blaming me. And right in front of my son. She said I wasn’t doing my job, and it wasn’t fair for Bash, and that I needed to do better. I lost my temper with her. I told her she needed to stop undermining my authority with my child. But later I apologized for giving her attitude (I’ve always been the one to give in).

Yesterday (my day off) she stops up at my house. It wasn’t even a minute and she had already made several negative comments because my house was messy. “Are the dishes in the dishwasher clean?” she asked while opening it. And then she says “nope” in the most disgusted, demeaning way. She then begins to start cleaning. I said “mom please, I just want to relax right now, but I plan on being productive later.” She didn’t listen and kept cleaning. “My anxiety has been really bad,” I told her, “don’t clean, I’ll do it later.” When she proceeded to make another critical comment I lost it and told her to leave. I told her I was tired of her criticizing me all the time. Her reply was that my son didn’t deserve to live like that. I told her that she absolutely could not talk to me like that in front of my child. Things were very heated at this point. She finally left after having to have the last word. 

She never listens if I try to express my feelings. Somehow she always becomes the victim. So I made a post on social media about how I’ll cut off a person’s access to me if they make me feel bad about myself and that boundaries are healthy (no names included). She sent me this private message….

“Are you saying you are cutting me off and I don't air feeling about you online where everyone can see  I am sorry I will leave you both alone”

And she hasn’t talked to me since. This isn’t new. Even as a kid she would give me the silent treatment.

It’s 6 am right now and I feel like I’m full of energy but at the same time moments from passing out. 

I feel like I’m about to start crying and punching shit but at the same time I can’t move. 

Im scared as shit right now and I feel like I’m being watched but I know it’s stupid but I have this feeling like something sinister  is going to happen. 

All week I’ve had this feeling looming over me that something bad will happen, I brush it off as my anxiety but I feel like something is actually going to happen this time. 

I cant even recognize myself anymore, I look in the mirror and I just stare blankly every time I look I look different, my eyes change or my eyebrows of how my face shape is. 

Randomly when I’m having a conversation with someone it’s like my entire body freezes and it’s like when your in a dream and you realize your in a dream and everything feels unreal, and like everyone is trying to kill you . 

I freeze up and it’s like my soul fucking leaves my body and I’m unable to move and it’s like my body shuts down and I can’t talk and my eyes start tearing up and I start freaking the fuck out. 

I keep having images of myself pop into my head , but sometimes when it happens it sends me into a panic because I can’t recognize myself i don’t know how to explain it, it’s like someone took over my body and it’s not me anymore like I’ve been fucking replaced but I’m still In my body. 

I don’t know if it makes sense and I don’t know how to explain it In words it’s just a feeling I get it’s like pure terror when it happens and I sit there and it’s like I can’t breathe for a bit. 

My heart is beating so fast and I feel like I’m about to cry I don’t know what’s happening but I’m fucking scared , I feel like something in the universe shifted and something is wrong. 

It’s been like this for a while it’s like one day somethint changed, I don’t know what it was but the world changed. 

At my old school I would have this same feeling and I would have to speed walk through the hallways so I wouldn’t start crying, it’s like everyone was staring at me. 

It felt like something was trying to get me and if I stopped and looked around I would see it. It stopped for a while and I felt better but it’s started happening again and it scares the shit out of me.",1679228977.0

This is like new to me. My anxiety started to getting worse from 2022 after getting it treated from 2017(my bad i stopped the medicines after year or two).

So right now as of today this very day i had a huge anxiety attack or maybe you can say panic attack too. As full of pounding heart, sensations in the head, being irrated, anxiety numbness and tingling.
(Few hours back had benzo and then i am writting this at ease)

Now the fear of stroke is ruining my life, thinking about it that what i felt few minutes back before having the benzos was a mini stroke.

Even though i have no cholesterol problem except borderline LDL cholesterol 131
My blood pressure last time i checked was 130/90 after evening hours.(during the anxiety attack), before that on morning after waking up half an hour it was 120/85(right arm) 110/75 (left hand).
Its literally like a death( reaper) making my life hell while i am alive.
 

(Be honest)Questions: 


So does anxiety,panic attacks causes stroke immediately and abruptly?
Or its like making you hypertensive patient first then later on it causes stroke?

My bf and mom think I need to rest more but it’s hard, with people looking for me late at night and even on weekends for all sorts of requests.

I have lived my entire life with essentially no anxiety. Looking back I see things in my childhood that were probably related to anxiety but up until about four years ago I lived a normal life. I've dealt with depression since I was about 14 but that was under control and then in 2018 I got hit with a panic disorder that has lasted from then until now. I ended an eight year relationship because I found out in the midst of the panic and the hospital visits and the doctors visits that ""in sickness and in health"" pretty much only meant ""in health"" to my ex. 

I ended up quitting my two jobs which I hated and found a new job which I love and for the last two years I've worked with the most amazing crew I've ever been on. found a really great friend in one of the guys who also has dealt with the same anxiety as me. it's been a great comfort being on a crew with someone who knows what it's like inside of my head. 

It makes the days comfortable knowing that if I am having a bad time I've got somebody I can go to. All of the guys on the crew know what's going on with me and I finally felt comfortable enough to get the ball rolling on getting medicated this coming summer and finding the right balance of medicine etc. I knew they would be able to tell if I was acting weird because of the medicine and they could sort of assist me in finding my way.

and then this week my boss suddenly moved me off of that crew and now I'm gonna be working alone with pretty much no contact with anyone else. And me being alone gives me far too much time to spend inside of my head and I am freaking out right now. 

the last three days has been a doom spiral of depression and panic. because I don't feel like I've just lost my work crew I feel like I've lost friends which I know is stupid… You're not supposed to think of your coworkers as friends but I spend 40 hours a week with these guys and I don't really do anything outside of work but stay at home and watch TV. these guys have been there for me both at work and outside of work when I've needed them

At the moment I'm quite stagnant career wise as I haven't reached my dream goal since graduating University. I know everyone goes at their own pace but with the social media updates, people around me getting great jobs, I get worried. 

I had a hard time in university which already worried me enough for various reasons. College (Sixth Form) was a good two years. Highschool wasn't terrible but I had some toxic teachers and friends. I've noticed that since maybe the end of last year I keep thinking about highschool, I get obsessed about moments I felt wronged or humiliated. I have difficulty in cutting relationships and for some reason I have found myself way too interested with the people I used to know on social media, and I have even contacted one of them. Highschool was 8 years ago, that's almost 10 years. I'm not sure if it's because my life has been so short and I have only recently finished my big education mile stones but the thoughts are destroying my mental health. It's feeding into my current low self esteem, as if it's an attempt to solidify how lowly I think of myself. Even though I really enjoyed myself in college and my confidence was at its peak. Plus all the kids I knew probably drastically changed since. Which is helping me believe that it's probably just anxiety talking and I'm way better than this. 

I'm just wondering if anyone else has struggled with thinking about a bad time in your life because you currently feel bad again too. And how you dealt with it? Did medication help with intrusive thoughts?

This time, I got a Ziploc bag, put ice cubes in it, and put it on the back of my neck.  Also put on some music and started humming.  Took awhile, but I feel better, didn't have to take any Xanax.

Not fearful like a nightmare, just situations that make me feel stressed out to the point where I wake up feeling like i've already gone through a terrible day.

Last night, for example, I dreamt about being arrested and interrogated for a burglary case, despite being innocent. Sometimes I dream that I actually *did* commit some crime, and that I'm fleeing the police, or being prosecuted for it. Sometimes it's social anxiety focused, like I'm talking to some people and stumbling over my words and getting weird looks and being stuck as an outcast (which actually isn't far from real life for me which makes it feel all the more real lol). Sometimes they're verging on full on nightmares, like I'm getting stalked by a serial killer, or stuck underwater in the middle of the ocean.

It really gets grating not being able to escape anxiety even in sleep, and even makes me dread going to sleep sometimes. It's terrible waking up facing the day already having mentally gone through a bunch of shit.

and now i cant stop thinking.

so there is a base anxiety

then it comes overthinking

after that i am having next level anxiety which caused by overthinking.

i cant stop thinking otherwise i will suffer from base anxiety, while i am overthinking i am also suffering from next level anxiety.

it is a loop.

you may say ""well dont overthink then, just stop"" thats my problem. i cant stop that.

my psychiatrist having hard time to understand that how can i provide info for him for better understanding?

i describe him the issue as a methafor ;

imagine a CEO using Volvo XC90. the safest car in the universe. if this guy might have a **traffic anxiety**(probably his common patients). i am a rally driver. i drive hand-made cars with 200km/h in mountain roads (i have a consulting and r&d company) if i make any mistake not even engineering but  in accounting, laws, finance, sales etc i will fall down the cliff and there will be no road service for me. thats my **base anxiety**.

what is overthinking?

in order to go faster i am drilling all the safety equipment in the car but where to drill? i need engineering model. mechanical not enough i need to write a software for best possible holes for that i need to work on math and data science to decide the holes. even if i decide the holes for better manufacturing i need best companies to do it. but they dont do it if i just knock their door. so i have to give them a completely different project which they might like to intruduce me and propose my idea of  making a car. so i am starting that new projects. what to do? get in touch with network find some people find their problems, examine their financials see whats missing is it marketing? stocks? or r&d? get some inside information and prepare a project. set a meeting.......

so this is a **overthinking.** and i am literally doing every step in real life !

that gives me **next level anxiety.** 

so as you can see it is a loop. JUST stop THINKING and RACE !!! but i cant stop thinking.

600,Tips for a flight?,1,11vh5zv,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11vh5zv/tips_for_a_flight/,1,"Hi everyone, 

22F diagnosed with GAD (although my therapist believes I present symptoms of agoraphobia). I had a flight a few days ago that was only little over an *hour*, but I proceeded to panic the entire time. It felt like the longest flight of my entire life. I was having trouble swallowing, my chest was on fire, heart was racing... I felt like I was losing control. 

I wasn't even that anxious about the flight beforehand. I flew last year and although I was severely anxious leading up to it, both flights were amazing and sort of fun! So, I was expecting this one to go the same. I guess NOT.. 

I have been more stressed/anxious than usual for other reasons so maybe that's it. 

I tried everything I could during that hour -- noise cancelling headphones, meditation music, water, breathing exercises, distracting myself with games, etc. Nothing worked, I only felt relief when we were landing. 

What do I do? I have a flight back home on Tuesday and my heart is racing thinking about it. I'm more anxious than I was before so I'm assuming the flight will be even more difficult. I'm terrified. I can't enjoy my time here because I am stressed thinking about the flight. It's way too late to get any medications now from my psychiatrist. 

I'm not scared of flying itself, it's more so the thought of being trapped for an hour, not being able to leave, and losing control.

I've had this issue for a while now. Every time I go to get my blood pressure checked, I get a spike of anxiety. It then results in an incorrect reading, which then makes me anxious because it's high and I'm desperate to know what my normal blood pressure is. Basically when I feel the arm strap inflating, my heart rate rockets up from resting to 110bpm. I've felt my heart rate at rest and it's around 65-70bpm when I'm properly relaxed. My last readings were: 150/79 and then 135/74 on a second run taken immediately after, but my heart rate was around 120bpm due to anxiety. My doctor noticed this and told me not to worry (he knows about my anxiety) but obviously I am worried.

It should be lower, I'm 27 yo and not too unhealthy or unfit, I drink at max once a week and I don't smoke. I'm not expecting perfect but also not that high. I wish you could estimate what your blood pressure is at your normal resting heart rate.

I do have a history of general anxiety disorder, particularly focused on my health. I used to worry a lot about heart issues, I'm better now but this is one of the last things that I can't seem to shake.

Does anyone have any tips to calm me down when I'm getting it checked? I've tried deep breathing, it doesn't work. Closing my eyes works a little bit, but not much. Hoping that someone who has the same issue can impart their wisdom. Thanks!",1679193523.0

Since then I’ve had a 30 day heart monitor, echo, and a stress test. I’m told that all the results read normal and It’s probably anxiety playing a part. 

On Friday I had a weird sensation happen. It’s happened a handful of times and I mainly feel it at nighttime while laying down. It is in the middle of my chest and it’s a cross between a flutter and a spasm. Like it gets tight for a second. It makes me cough and I breathe in to get it to stop. I can also slightly feel them in my lower neck beating. I also woke up this morning a little weak in that area. It freaks me out. 

I have some slight occasional pinching just like I do with the other palpitations (I’m told that can be normal ) but I’m not in pain. I don’t have a headache.  My blood sugar is normal. My bpm is normal. My blood pressure is a little lower than where it usually sits but it’s still in the range.

Luckily I have an amazing, supportive, partner that listened. After our daughter was born my wife often spoke about how she’d love to be pregnant again.

We talked and I have an appointment to talk to my doctor about going back on Paxil.

Today I don't cry as much as I did but if there's one thing that makes me return to a child and cry hard it's the thought of my brother being mean and aggressive when talking.

I had a nightmare last night where he was pressuring me and started to diminish my intellect like he used to. I had a mental breakdown in the nightmare and idk how I managed to forcefully wake myself up and I was out of breathe, sweating a lot and crying.

I know I was safe because he doesn't live with me anymore and he's in another country but sometimes I feel guilty because I don't talk to him anymore but when I think about doing it I just can't.",1679206929.0

I used to do bodybuilding quite religiously, but stopped being so strict and just worked out to maintain and for fun, however the past few years it hasnt been apart of my routine at all and something i would avoid.

With anxiety being high, i decided to expose myself as this has helped immensely before. Even if i feel lousy with my lifts, and the amount of time im working out compared to everyone else there, who cares - at least i went!

I will be fine one moment and the next I just feel so out of place and like I don’t belong. Even at home, im scared.  Living at the moment scares me.

621,Social Anxiety… Maybe?,1,11vcxgm,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11vcxgm/social_anxiety_maybe/,0,"To preface, I’m a 24 year-old white male in a A type personality job field.

TLDR. I cant keep my mouth shut around co workers and I get bullied (or people just don’t like me) because I have diarrhea of the mouth.

It all started when I was a child. I grew up in an impoverished household with both of my parents being toxic to one another. So, naturally I spent a lot of time as a child being a fly on the wall during their arguments. My father would call my mother names and abuse her. My mother would accuse my father of cheating and the cycle continues. 

In elementary school, I was overweight (not extremely but still overweight) and I would be called fat and ugly. I would tell my mother that this was happening and she would reply like any mother would. “Son, you’re not ugly, and you’re not fat.” I see myself as a below average looking person, so her words never really helped. Around 10-years-old, my teeth began to be very crooked. So much so that I had canine teeth that sat on my gums. On top of being fat and relatively unattractive, bullies had more ammunition to use. Eventually, I got tired of the bullying and began to fight everyone who had something negative to say. 


In middle school, I was still overweight and I had “friends” but at a good opportunity, they wouldn’t hesitate to go in with the bully and crack jokes at me. This caused me to develop trust issues with anyone who claimed to be a friend to me. Instead of fighting, i attempted to become funny. I began to talk more and would constantly insult myself to beat the bullies to the punch. I dropped out in 8th grade and I never went back to school (further causing me to isolate.) 

When I turned 18, I joined the military and instead of being sent somewhere new, I was stationed at the military base in the same state and town I lived in. Unable to escape from memories, I felt like I was a child again unable to be an adult. One friend from the military, we’ll call him Marcus only befriended me because he saw me as someone he could borrow money from. He would constantly gas light me when I tried to get my money back and would lie to me. 

Fast forward to my current job and life. All of my anxieties followed me. When not speaking to co workers, I am a professional and I have no social anxiety. However, when I’m back at the office, I turn into a baboon who can’t stop talking. Someone will then take the opportunity to take a jab at me, and I just take it. I feel as if I will never be accepted by my peers and that I will never be a true friend. 


I don’t know what this is, but I feel that it is some form of social anxiety that I need serious help with. I hope some of you can help.",1679205264.0

Like I shake while driving and it only happens when I drive and if it gets bad enough I’ll kinda feel like imma pass out but never have (Thank God)

This is absolutely defeating and horrible for me as I used to drive heavy duty class vehicles w/ big trailers everyday, even heavy equipment.

I use to drive to the ends of the earth and back when I used to work so this is just completely unreal to me how I feel now

Cant even drive my boat with my dad on the lake (although its not as bad as driving on the road)


Now I cant even make it to the store without taking side roads avoiding congested traffic, drive late in the night

Family ask me for favours driving to the store and such and i just get things delivered…. 

Thoughts suggestions?

I always had anxiety, Idk if its just evolving as Im getting older. 

I have bought some aswagandha but haven’t taken it yet as Im trying to push back naturally from using it.

Now, I  just want to say these thoughts or scenarios are not  always negative!  I’ve tried looking up if other folk have thought/felt the same as me and  most are asking for advice for thoughts for negative scenarios!  Mine are both

It’s for anything. For my self, friends family. It’s like I safe guard myself. Positive negative. And I’ll go down that road of, if ‘this’ happens then ‘that could happen. Like it’s a tree and it branches off.   I do every possible tier that convo could reach. And i bear I mind if other people could intervene in that moment and I imagine what they could say. All these branches of possible outcomes. But they are positive as well as negative. It’s like a play a devils advocate as well, sitting on the fence! I don’t like confrontation, arguments but I think what if this back thing happens and I think of how it pan out, what would folk possible sake to anything. ………and this all come to me in just seconds. It’s in my head. I’m already two jumps ahead pre-empting what could be said. 

Now, when I do it when my own anxiety is nuts. I understand. For me as much as it is mentally exhausting even though I do it naturally. I see it as I ‘Super Power’! May sound funny but I do, because I feel I’ve already prepared me self!  (I’m not all negative I’m a hopeful person, ( at times) but I’ve prepared my self. ) I feel I helps me as  my anxiety it’s bad

But I worried because I do it with my friends when they tell me about their issues and I construct every possible scenario for their issue. Like I’m preparing therm. But then scaring them that could possibly happen. When I might not but I can’t help myself, my mind just goes there and I’ve thought all of this in my mind in just seconds!

Has anyone else thought like this because I am getting worried and it’s exhausting. I think too deeply.

It is SO HARD to have small talk with anyone and try to get deeper into conversations. I find myself analyzing everything I say and it makes me feel like I'm almost dissociating while I'm talking and grasping at the words coming out of my mouth and if I notice even the slightest bit of disinterest or what I interpret to be a negative reaction by the person I'm speaking to, I kind of spiral and stumble over my words or get quiet. 

BUT! There are rare instances where the words just flow smoothly and effortlessly...this usually can only happen if I've had a little to drink or am with someone I've known for quite awhile.

Does this sound like anything anyone has experience with? Is it a symptom of anxiety or something else? Not looking for a diagnosis, but would love to find a place to start. I have no idea if this is a social anxiety thing or possibly an autism spectrum thing... or what, but even hearing personal experiences would be so appreciated, if you don't mind sharing - as well as anything you've tried that has helped with this! 

If it's helpful for context or anything extra, I was also homeschooled and VERY under-socialized as a kid (only knew my immediate family from age 7 to 15), so that is probably a huge factor and I was recently told I am codependent (so I wonder if there's something there? IDK!). TIA <3",1679198832.0

Personally despite years of therapy and consciously knowing this is not true I have caught myself multiple times believing subconsciousness old ideas that anxiety = some form of weakness. 

To prove this idea false to myself I made a goal using things I already do: exercise and cold exposure (Wim Hof Method). My goal was to break some fitness world records in sub freezing temperatures wearing only shorts which I know is a little strange. 

Anyways, I was partly successful. Out of the 8 records I tried to break in 31 degree temps I was able to do 3. If for some reason anyone is interested in seeing the proof (a nutty man exercising in his backyard in the winter) it's on my You Tube Channel [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ7b\_dYi3LiPJvsECHRo8HA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ7b_dYi3LiPJvsECHRo8HA).

I'm a little self conscious about posting videos of myself working out but since I have been inspired by others sharing their achievements while being open about having anxiety I figured the risk was worth it. Also, if anyone wants to see someone with anxiety that is a truly elite athlete I would recommend the documentary Eddie- Strongman (2015).

Also hopefully this goes without saying but I am by no means a bad ass. I wish I was but I still struggle with anxiety and when I go to the local gym I see tons of people much stronger than me. 

If anyone else has stories of things they have accomplished (not limited to exercise) despite their anxiety please share them! I'm always looking to be inspired.",1679161616.0

It's funny how anxiety can make the most ridiculous/impossible thing seem so likely and so dangerous in an attempt to protect, when all it really does is make me look like a dickhead for being scared of dish soap.

I “saw” a clear bag of caramel cremes on a table at work, when I was walking up to the table they still were “caramel cremes” (caramel with white centers in clear wrapping with red on the twisted ends.)
When I looked down at the table to grab on, IT WAS RED KETCHUP PACKETS.

- a man walking the side of the road
-caramel cremes
- let the dogs outside (went to call them back in and they were never out there)
- sat my makeup bag on counter from bathroom (physically remember grabbing it and putting it there)
- facetimed accidentally at 4 am one of the people at work that is causing the biggest amount of stress in my life. (Turns out that never happened when looking at my recent logs a few hours later)

I've been suffering with a lot of anxiety but last year I started to suddenly develop chest discomfort and all sorts of weird physical symptoms (sometimes all of them at once)

During day almost no problem, I would feel great, but as soon as night falls, everything gets out of hand almost everytime. I can't sleep, getting awake by what I though was my heart stopping, trembling, feeling weak (but not tired) nausea but I never end up vomiting, head lightness and dizziness, muscle tensing in the jaw neck and back, all that but my heart is not getting past 90.  I've tried everything, relaxation, psychologist, changing sleep schedule and habits, eating lighter (specially the evening) exercising, going out with people to change my mind, now I'm even moving out because the sole fact of being in this apartment scares me. 

I went 2 times to the ER, no problems found, 3 times to different doctors, no problems found. I'm just sitting here every night, feeling what my brain think is my heart failing me while being helpless. 

When everything happens it's always the same cycle, the morning I'm fine, I do have headaches and now constant jaw pain but it doesn't scare me, I don't even understand why I was in such a bad state during the night, but when it's between 9 to 10pm up to 7am I'm convinced I'm gonna die, that that's the end, that my heart beats to fast, to hard,missing a beat, feeling these jolts of adrenaline spreading through my chest by  heat waves, feeling crushed,  jaw, neck, back hurts, getting tension headache, my mind is a mess, I want to cry, to scream to run away from my own body . All of the doctors that I saw suggested that it is anxiety but every time I can't help but think it's something terminal. 

The thing is I had anxiety and panic attack before, but this, it's completely different. Before it was only my mind so I could ground myself back, now I don't know what I'm feeling and it's scares me much much more than anything I had in my life before.

Am I alone in this ? Does anyone else experience this  ?

  For context I went through a very stressful time through 2020-2021. Got sick early in pandemic that wasn't Covid but I didn't know that and obsessed about my symptoms and treatment. Led my mental health spiraling down for a long time. Developed a very spacey feeling like I was out of it or my head was full of a pressure that didn't hurt or feel like a headache. It was like a brain fog. Like my head just felt full. This feeling would happen every other week, to every other day, to everyday 24/7. It took a span of 8 months of constant anxiety and stress before it got to a 24/7 thing. My sleep became unrested no matter how long I slept and I had vivid dreams everyday that were usually bad by end of 2020. Developed sub-clinical hypothyroidism by end of 2021. No family history. 
  
I spent this entire time inside my house trying to figure out what caused the 24/7 head spacey feeling. Got MRI's of brain, other imaging, blood work and they all were normal. I noticed a pressure feeling, again not a headache, would build up if I had to focus on something or use brain energy for a extended amount of time. I did nothing to mitigate stress like running, meditating, going out with friends or just living my old general life. By end of 2022 I noticed my head pressure build up would lead to what felt like a headache which never happened. This went on for 2 weeks in December before one big pressure build up and a headache happened and my head suddenly jerked. I have since been getting these involuntary jerks everyday. I've gotten terrible anxiety over it since then because I hate it so much and scared this is my life now.

I've reflected hard on everything and think this has all been chronic stress and anxiety that's made me feel this way and my brain just finally had enough.

I'm currently 4 days since I started (now I'm on **0,5 mg** and next week I'll be on 10mg). 

Before taking lexapro I was already experiencing so much anxiety in many forms: extreme overthinking about death, **so many heart palpitations**, squeezing heart feeling, (therefore, I couldn't stop associating those symptoms with my arm and jaw pain to heart problems), **very tight throat and constant feeling of choking.**

The thing is, for my **heart concerns**, I did at least more than 6 EKG's, blood tests, X-Ray, and I never got anything weird. Always anxiety. I currently can, in a way, identify it as a muscle cramp in my chest, since I can really tell how tight it is. 

Now about **tight throat**//globus sensation//globus pharyngeus concerns, I did an esophageal transit and even another throat evaluation by putting a camera (?) through my nose and throat. Nothing was there. I've been with this problem on and off for like 10 years. And due to that, I kind of ""forgot"" hoe to eat, since every time I swallow, I swallow gas(?). To be honest, I don't trust those diagnosis. I feel like what I'm feeling it can't be just anxiety. I literally cannot swallow. This has to end.

But I truly feel I'm choking. ***I truly feel*** how the food gets stuck. And since I started taking lexapro, my symptoms **have worsened up**. 

It feels impossible to swallow **even** mashed food. I have so much reflux. I feel so dizzy that it leads me to so much **derealization**. **I can't stop thinking** about death, even though I try to do stuff like drawing or something. When I try to sleep, I suddenly **wake up with so much anxiety**, disoriented, and overthinking about *""how I was very close to dying, maybe I have heart problems or breathing problems etc etc""*... In other words, **I feel paralyzed**. I've been sitting the whole day, I feel so dizzy. If I think about food, I get so scared, and I even feel like throwing up. I don't have energy to move. I just want this to end, I want to live.

Have you ever experienced any of those symptoms? Is any of you on Lexapro aswell? Did all of this stopped for you? How can I make this to stop? How can I be more relaxed? What are your thoughts?

I need some desperate intervention. I have been abusing pregabalin for longer than I can remember. My doses have been all over the place-ranging from 75 mg- 30,000 mg.

I have come out of a severely sexually abusive relationship which was 10 years long. Talking Therapies suggested that I’m suffering from PTSD. They’ve put me on a waiting list. 

I have a great job & a loving family. I love my job & I worked really hard to get to the position I’m in. I have been offered a job to work abroad. 

I need to stop, but I’m incredibly impulsive with taking it. I don’t recognise myself when I look in the mirror, so I know I need to take back control.

I am thinking I should start by taking 300mg*3 this week. 
Then alternate between 300mg*3 & 300mg*2 the following week. 
Then take 300mg*2 the following week.  
Perhaps divide the dose across the week the following week. Eg) 200mg*3

my feelings overall and what i’m experiencing, 
-not in my body 
-high but i didn’t smoke (outside of my body) 
-stress throughout the day and night 
-restless and pressure against my chest 
-no appetite (i’ve been eating a small meal once a day now.. it’s barely anything) 
-insomnia (which 2 weeks ago, everything was normal) 
-paranoia 
-a bunch of thoughts on my mind (usually negative) 
-no meaning in life and sadness. like an empty or sort of numb feeling 
-realization that’s talking or texting feels a lot different, it wasn’t the same normal feeling from before, it felt
like i changed in way that isn’t permanent.. i hope) 
-nightmare (which kind of made me realize that there’s something i’m going through that isn’t normal at all, i’ve been through some shit but i’ve never had an actualt nightmare with a plot and this intense before, it lasted about an hour until i woke up)

Also got an amazing job offer in the same week after being terrified of interviews.,1,11utp9t,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11utp9t/finally_took_the_plunge_and_passed_my_driving/,1,"Just a short story about some recent successes to hopefully motivate other people like me towards their goals. I've experienced very bad anxiety for most of my life (I dry heave a lot of mornings for example, wake up in a cold sweat in the morning, fixate on the worst outcomes, have horrible thoughts come to me at random points in the day, can never relax, etc...) to the point where I put myself into a comfortable box that I know the bounds of to try to avoid it. Part of this box meant staying in a situation that I knew and that included not driving. To the point where I avoided possible opportunities my whole life because of it. I'm 31 for reference.

In the past year, the bounds of that box broke. My partner divorced me, I was guaranteed to lose my job the coming year (visiting faculty). I had to face all of my fears at once. Living completely independent, starting the job search for real with the possibility of rejection and also driving. It's been a long road that has led me to suicidal thoughts I hadn't had for a while, quite literally feeling like I was given six months to live.

 I failed my road test the first time, applying to places was mentally exhausting and made feel like I was dying for weeks due to my perceived lack of self-worth. Lying on my bed as anxiety reeled over my body like a wave. I had already messed up again for the umpteenth time. The beginning of this week felt like the beginning of the end as I had an interview with a really cool place lined up that I didn't feel qualified for, waiting on results from another interview and had my driving test coming up again.

Before my interview I quite literally projectile vomited my egg sandwich back up and felt like I was going to die. Luckily an hour beforehand I was able to pull it together and focus on my message about myself. The interview seemed to go well though and I'm waiting to hear back. They reached out to me, so it's a weird situation but for people job searching, make sure to make connections. Connections matter way more than cold applying to places with decent careers. During that interview, I was sent an email with an offer for another job which was also a really cool place and career goal of mine in higher education. 

This morning I went and took my road test. Guy was cool, we mostly talked the whole time, easily passed. Now I have a driver's license like it was no big deal after losing a lot of my life's possibilities in the past due to avoidance. The anxiety has lifted for now and I feel great. I know that it will come back, but proving to myself my own self worth has been amazing for my mental health.

My suggestion to younger people who are dealing with anxiety on a similar level to mine, please seek help, from friends, family, a therapist, whatever you need to do. Don't limit yourself like I did because of it. Even if it feels like you're dying you have to try. Job interviews aren't that bad. Completely fail? Those people move on with their workday and forget about you by days end. Apply to a place and never hear back? Just keep looking and improving your applications. Started driving late in your life and feeling embarrassed by it? No one cares actually. No one in my life has ever given me crap about it (except my ex). Start small, drive in a parking lot, find an instructor/family member who is understanding of your mental blocks, etc.  Focus on why you are scared and attack those issues first. A lot and I mean a lot of people go through it. I will still suffer from it; I will never be able to drive somewhere without anxiety. But at least I have the option and you deserve too as well. 

Don't let anxiety limit you to the extent that I did. It's incredibly hard not to and its one of the hardest things to do in life, but it is worth it. I will still continue to do it and it is something that I will have to manage my whole life. But it is worth it to try to manage it. No matter how old you are, no matter how much you feel like you have wasted your life, you still have time.

Sound familiar?

Welcome to Imposter Syndrome. You’re in good company. Nigella Lawson, Michelle Obama, Lady GaGa and Lily Allen have all shared their imposter syndrome experiences publicly. But what is this demon?

It’s an umbrella term, under which lives one or more limiting beliefs such as those generalised ones above. They may be accompanied by more specific beliefs. These are typically formed rationally in childhood and, as children, may serve us well. For example;

· I need everyone to approve of me. 

· To be a valued I must succeed in everything I do.

· It is not OK for me to make mistakes. If I do, I am bad.

· I can feel happy in life without contributing back in some way.

· Everyone needs to rely on someone stronger than themselves.

· I shouldn’t have to feel sadness, discomfort and pain.

· Someone, somewhere, should take responsibility for me.

What would your own list look like?

However, time moves on and things change. As we become adults, our childhood beliefs serve us less well – and the resultant behaviours may be incongruent with the situation we are in. This leads to the conclusion that one of the things it means to grow up, is to develop out of our childhood beliefs and adopt a new set of beliefs that will serve us better as adults. This progression follows a broad pattern of developing from dependence as children to independence as young adults to interdependence as mature adults. 

Our overall set of beliefs are developing all the time. However, most of us will carry some of our childhood beliefs with us in to adulthood. Most of these will be innocuous most of the time but some of them will, sometimes, impede our performance as high functioning, inter-dependent, adults. As adults, we benefit from identifying our limiting beliefs, and growing in to more valuable beliefs. 

By way of an example, a common limiting belief sitting under the Imposter Syndrome umbrella is ‘I must compare myself to others’ which can be re-framed to ‘I live my own life on my own terms’ or ‘I have a unique set of character strengths, as do others’. In turn the re-framed beliefs can underpin valuable affirmations such as ‘Because I live my own life, I enjoy the successes of others’ or ‘I choose to celebrate my successes without reference to other’s accomplishments’ or ‘The fact that I choose to live my life authentically means I only compare myself against my own standards’. 

A standard element of working with PERMA hypnotherapy is developing a high degree of self-awareness via exploring your characters strengths, values, beliefs and limiting beliefs which paves the way to defining your identity. In turn, this leaves you ideally placed to choose your own best future. 

Working with a hypnotherapist is particularly well suited to personal development in this area as – by its very nature – it opens up the pathways between the parts we know and recognise as ‘us’ and the deeper levels of our wisdom: ideal for when we need to take those big steps forward.

In the colloquial sense, not the DSM sense. I've had panic attacks before and they were bad. The first time I thought I was having an asthma attack and going to die, and the second time I was hyperventilating to the point my vision was going and my fingers were getting all numb, and they were bad, but still tolerable. But when I was far younger I used to have extreme anxiety around sleeping by myself that persisted for years, despite my family minimizing accommodations and imposing consequences like all the books say to do. That feeling was probably the second-worst or maybe even the worst feeling of my life. I spent years in constant fear because of the struggle that would come at bedtime, to the point that I was willing to do something extreme to avoid it. All the books say that anxiety can't harm you and you must learn to tolerate it. And I do that most of the time. But whenever I do much as think back to those years when I was younger I get overwhelmed and wind up cryin for ages. It's a massive pain. I'm big on accepting and tolerating pain and distress, but as unfounded as my fears were during that time I legitimately wouldn't wish them on the worst person on Earth. So what is it? Was I being an intolerant drama queen who needed firmer limits?",1679123593.0

I've come out of the fog, and though I still cry nearly daily for him, I could get back to life, until recently.

My health anxiety is through the roof. My newest thought today is that I have ovarian cancer because I've been bloated a lot over the last 3 weeks. However, I've also been taking iron pills and just got off antibiotics for a sinus infection.

My brother never had anxiety or worried too much about anything. Watching what happened to him has obviously left me with some serious trauma.

I feel unable to get through life the last 3 weeks, worse than while I was in serious grief. I can barely leave my bedroom because being anywhere else in my house amplifies my anxiety. I can feel every little pain or itch or nerve pinch. Every muscle spasm. My fitbit is both helping and not helping.

The only time I feel a bit better is when I walk a mile or two at a quick speed on my treadmill. But I just feel sooo incapable as a mother, a wife, a student, an auntie, a daughter.

And then when I try to convince myself it's just anxiety, my anxiety goes ""but what if it actually brain cancer(sinus infection), congestive heart failure (weird flu we got last week), breast cancer (pimple on my chest), or now ovarian cancer?""

I've never taken any prescription for mental health. I've coped with depression and anxiety my whole life but I finally feel incredibly overwhelmed and like the quality of my life is absolutely suffering. I cried into my husband's chest tonight and he was wholly supportive of me.

I keep getting told different answers from each and finally paid a $500 retainer to get the ball rolling. The issue is my anxiety is so bad I don’t trust that this is being done the right way and on top of that it has made me have to stop paying the debts I was current on. I feel hopeless, I am barely eating or sleeping. In the midst of this this has caused a lot of tension in my marriage, and that in turn has made my anxiety even worse.

I had to take a leave of absence from my job doing surgery because I had panic attacks in the middle of operating. It was bad. I thought there was no way I would ever NOT be on Xanax. 

At my worst I was taking 3mg of Xanax per day. I was drinking myself to death to self medicate on top of that. My life was falling apart. I was depressed and suicidal. 

Eventually I stopped doing surgery altogether. I stopped drinking. I think so much of my issue was depression and surgery now being a trigger for my anxiety. Luckily I was in a position to take a time-out in life. I started taking an antidepressant. Then another. Then another. I finally found one that worked. I now do real estate. It helps me feel a little more freedom and not as trapped as being in surgery wearing a mask, gown, gloves, and not being able to simply walk away for a few moments. 

2 years later and I still don’t drink. I take my antidepressant each day. And I have gone from 3mg of Xanax a day to .25mg of Clonazepam when I need to. Today I sit here (on the toilet) and I haven’t taken anything for anxiety in 9 days. It has been 12 years since I have gone this long without taking anything. 

My point: I went through a period where I thought there was ZERO chance I’d ever be back to a somewhat normal life. That I wouldn’t be taking a ton of anxiety meds. There was no light at the end of the tunnel. I assumed my life was over. Be patient. It’s hard, but try to take things day by day. It does get better.

They broke up six weeks later, and literally the day they broke up, he started looking at my social media all the time. Like, literally everyday. And on multiple platforms, too. He knew I was looking at his social media too, and we played this weird little cat and mouse game. But for the better part of a year, it was clear he still had residual feelings for his ex. He would do things like trying to follow her on Twitter, but then unfollowing her when she didn't follow him back. Four years later, he's back. He Dmed me on Instagram and apologized for what he did.

We're dating now, and we only just had our third date. The spark we had picked back up immediately. He's definitely a lot more mature and communicative. However, even though he clearly felt bad about the way things went down, I don't feel pretty enough for him. I don't think I ever will. I know I'm a fairly attractive woman, but I don't feel like he finds me attractive. He's a very good looking guy himself, and people say that I'm prettier than him. But I feel like he's always going to find his ex more attractive. He literally threw me away once. I was so thrilled when I found out he was into me all those years ago, but when he cut things off with me, I would spend my time looking in the mirror and thinking, ""if I were prettier, would he have chosen me?"" Not to mention, while he was stalking my social media, he wasn't over his ex. A part of me feels like, if he really did find me so beautiful, why would he try getting back with her? If they did get back together, would he have left me the way he did the first time? Also keep in mind, he didn't reach out for four years. Not four months. Four years. If he really did like me, why didn't he chase me once he was single?",1679127053.0

In the last 6 months, my anxiety became worse and worse and now it's hard to cope with basic everyday things. It can be triggered by anything, I'm afraid to go to the gym, interact with people, look at my bank statement etc. I was prescribed setraline 6 months ago and my parents made me throw it out because of the side effects (one of my meds caused a severe allergic reaction and the other one made me feel weak and nauseous all the time). My GP wouldn't prescribe anything because he's my parents' friend and I'm afraid to go to the doctor anyway - I can't even write a damn email anymore without a breakdown. My parents think psycholody is a scam, they pay for my living (it's less than 300 bucks in a month, they don't die from the financial burden) and I barely scrape by, they refuse to pay for a psychologist or help me to actually get an appointment because I just get so overwhelmed by it. I don't really have anyone else, my only friend lives in a different country. I was in a mental hospital back in october because I attempted suicide due to a massive mental breakdown, but they refused to change my meds even after they saw the side effects. I just don't know what to do anymore, even the school counselor sent me away because I can't visit her more than 3 times a semester.

Most amazingly I hadn't told the administration about this and failed. What do you think it is? Anxiety, I was so depressed that my mind froze and my anxiety just literally stop me from doing anything. Think I would go and get diagnosed. No I don't. I seriously 😒 think that is just me being a dramatic person. I dropped out because my brain is fried. Not completely burned then i changed to major that I didn't like. Thought something will work out, no, I still hate that major but major is not the issue. The problem is my brain fog turned into disaster. There are blankness in my head and all words that come into my ears were just a noise to me. So guess what my brain is burnt entirely. Took me month to pass the problem, of course, my country doesn't consider mental health to be academic excuse so I ended up having to drop out again. 
Now I'm in better condition with medication, but when people asked and reminded me of the time of dropping out. I would had sad and anixous in my heart. So I wonder whether I got truama from all the I experienced. I seriously love my Frist university and major. However my parents rejected of me to go back there as this is the beginning of my problem and studying there is pushing myself too hard and I didn't do well enough for myself now. 
I knew this is all in my head, but I felt like I am no longer capable in believing in myself. I had anxiety in beginning now should I say my sect esteem got even weaker. Listen to motivation speech and self help books just won't do much help for me because all of my friends are high achievers in their subjects.

Like nothing’s right, my life is going nowhere, I have X and Y and Z on my to-do list that have yet to spend any time on, the list just goes on and on and on.

I take zoloft (have taken Celexa too before), they help for a little while until they don’t.


It’s common for people to experience these at night as there’s no distraction and many other reasons like fatigue, etc
But I’ve had it since I can remember. In middle school, nights were dreadful to me. I HATED having school the next day. School was always freakin scary to me. 
I hated it so much.
Don’t know when it started disappearing for a while, but I’d started going out drinking and talking to people every single night for couple years before last year where I had to stay home and save money.
Last year I also had a horrible break up with a bpd girl (im 24m) that likely contributed to the increased anxiety.

I’m not really hopeless about life. I’m actually very optimistic. A day dreamer. Always doing something, learning something (probably part of it is to run away from this mysterious pain).
I also have ADHD and adderall seems to calm me down a lot but stops working at nighttime.
Also Kratom. Huge relief for anxiety. I can’t tell whether it’s just a good medicine or a drug I can’t live without at this point.

A few months ago, my anxiety suddenly worsened, and I developed emetophobia and my health anxiety shot up in severity. I've been on medication for a few months right now and my dose has been raised twice, but I feel like I'm still incredibly anxious.

At night, I'm scared to sleep because I worry I won't wake up. I have to take some fast-acting medication and distract myself until I fall asleep. I hate it. I worry I'll have a heart issue or unknown condition that will kill me suddenly and I'll have no control over it. I have uncontrollable imaginary images of my family finding my dead body and mourning, and it scares me so much. I'll cry for ages at nighttime over the idea of dying in my sleep and not knowing it.

I was previously depressed, but now that it's begun to lift, I have such great fear and anxiety over death. It makes it hard to function throughout the day, as I worry about dying from performing basic activities. I constantly need reassurance that I'm not dying. When I really try to think about it rationally, I'm not scared of death, and I think it may be peaceful. But I can't do anything and I always get heart palpitations and suddenly think, ""This is it."" My health anxiety amplifies it, and any little symptom suddenly becomes a hidden lethal condition.

I'm terrified to have hobbies, enjoy life, or collect things I like because I'm worried that once I really begin to enjoy life again, death might come for me and I won't be able to love anymore. I hate going places and I feel so guilty when I do make a mistake towards someone because I worry that I'll die and I might never be able to make it up to them. I hate thinking that I could die when I'm not ready. I can't enjoy life because I'm so scared of finally living happily and then losing it.

I want to be able to live my life, but I can't get over the fear of my death. Does anyone know of any books, resources, or methods to help me achieve peace? I don't even need it completely gone, I just need to be able to manage it.

TL,DR: I'm a teenager with anxiety that has recently become severe. I have health anxiety which has morphed into death anxiety and I'm constantly worried that I'm dead/dying.

I'm kinda afraid to try another med as I'm afraid of possible side effects. Also my health anxiety is back but I can at least control it better than before lexapro.

At first, I thought it was just simple dehydration, but this was happening even when I drank plenty of water and now it's getting pretty silly. Physical symptoms that I occasionally end up thinking are purely physical just won't stop unless I'm finally going to sleep or when it's daylight.

Nothing has really made much of a different. Lexapro kiiiinda kept my head above water but the name brand stopped being covered.

Now I'm on shitty state insurance because I can't keep a steady full-time job. I also get therapists who can't seem to help and then move to a different office mid-treatment, an office that doesn't take my insurance. Or psychiatrists who do cruddy things like rushing me off meds to try something else and insisting I just ""tough it out"" when things get rough.

I currently have a well-meaning therapist who may or may not know how to help. And a new psychiatrist who suggested adding Buspirone to my Paroxetine (the replacement for Lexapro that I started a number of years ago), instead of trying to change my Paroxetine out for something else.

Adding something *to* my main medication was alluring because if anything goes wrong I'm guessing I can just stop the added medication and balance back out on my main medication.

But yeah.

Just took the first Buspirone. Along with my nightly Paroxetine.

I’ve never posted here but I’m really struggling and I’m not sure what to do. I’ve suffered from anxiety for as long as I can remember, but over the years I’ve become pretty good at managing it. A few years ago there was a mass shooting right down the street from my house. Without going into the details, the incident left me mentally scarred and I struggle trauma issues related to this. Fast forward to this week, we had to fire an employee on Monday because they continuously did drugs at work and they hardly ever showed up, plus he seemed to have gang affiliations. Yesterday he sent some texts to some of us, including me, telling us all to suck a d*** and things like that. But immediately after, he sent a text say “I have murder on my mind” and this completely messed me up. I started freaking out, my heart felt like it was going to beat out of my chest, I felt like my mind was crumbling, I started hyperventilating and crying and I had to leave. The police took a statement from my boss and basically said there was nothing they could do about it. The owner of the company is now saying he’ll hire an armed guard for next week and decided to put me in charge of it even though I told him I’m not mentally in the place to handle this. Still, I pushed through and sent him all of the info and now it is up to him to get the guard. I’m terrified honestly. Even today, the guy who made the threats sent random emoji texts in a group chat and I have no idea why.

From then I had random anxiety attack that increased in frequency into adulthood. It was mostly health anxiety, feeling my heart skip a beat and then having a full on panic attack. I went to multiple cardiologists who insisted I was fine. I went to the ER multiple times only to be discharged and being told I was fine. I began to think it was a healthcare provider conspiracy, maybe there truly was something wrong that they weren’t seeing and I was going to have to die to get my, “I told you so,” moment. 

My anxiety was effecting my job, my (previous) relationship, and worst of all my ability to parent my 1, 2, and then 3 children. One day around 2 years ago, my Uncle, who is a former Army Ranger and Cop sat me down and had an intervention like conversation with me. He told me that he too has anxiety, and that he takes something for it everyday. I never knew this about him. He told me that he could tell my anxiety was having a negative impact on my parenting and that I owed it to myself and my kids to get help. 

I ended up going on a 20MG dose of an anxiety med, daily, which I still take (of course) After a few weeks, the intrusive thoughts just… were no longer there. Also, when I would feel a heart skip, I’d just tell myself ok cool, it’s all good and then… nothing. I couldn’t believe it. I was pretty skeptical of taking a pill and it working but… it did. I also started therapy along with the meds, and just as important, I started Brazilian Jujitsu for exercise and cardio. I also have a non benzo as needed anxiety med if I’m really feeling anxious, and honestly… just having that on me is a big help because I know it’s there. 

I’m a single parent now, and I can and do take my 3 kids places by myself and have a good time. That would’ve been UNTHINKABLE just 2.5 years ago. 

I know there’s no one size fits all for this shit but hopefully this helps someone.

- as needed med in case of panic attack

Basically I️ have had anxiety since my preteens. It was severe social anxiety from 13-17, then became more general. However, at 31 it has become social again along with the general anxiety. 

I️ have been a fashion model for 12 years. It was my safe space, and as crazy as it sounds being in front of the camera did not ever trigger anxiety for me. In fact it did the opposite, and I️ felt free there. However, one day out of nowhere my anxiety seemed to hit this peak. I️ haven’t ever been medicated besides self administering the supplement L-theanine,  and had added Gaba a month earlier. I️ was on set on camera and a song played that I️ recommended that was funny and embarrassing, but we all were sharing those types of songs. Suddenly I️ get a full blown panic attack. Shaking, can’t even smile for the shot, heart RACING, feeling faint; I️ ran out and put my hand on my mouth to make it seem like I️ was sick. 

When I️ returned I️ made it seem like a stomach issue. “Oh, something from lunch just made me get horrible acid reflux I’m sorry.” I️ fought my way through the last hour battling another panic attack. In all honesty I’m suspicious about the Gaba and haven’t taken it since, but they haven’t stopped. 

Since then I️ can’t be on camera without one coming. My current therapist recommended me to consult a psychiatrist who has given me Propanol and Ativan. I just tried the propanol today and I’m hopeful, because she only gives me 7 every 6 weeks of the Ativan, which works perfectly. Unfortunately she will not give me more Ativan because of my families addiction history. 

It has made me feel so desperate and powerless. I️ had a toxic childhood and I️ feel like it’s come back to haunt me. I️ worked so hard to fight my social anxiety for years and thought I’d largely conquered it. I️ hate that it’s come back and it’s worse than ever. I️ love my job, and now I’m having to fall back on other jobs to get by. I️ booked a lot of things this month and don’t have enough Ativan to get through all of my shoots…and yes, I’ve tried meditation, focusing on other objects and battling them.

What do I do?,1,11u65px,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11u65px/health_anxiety_about_rabies_and_hypochondria/,0,"As far as I can remember, health anxiety and extreme hypochondria have always gripped my life. Not a single day goes by where they don't consume my head. Peace is all but a foreign concept

I happen to live in a country that contributes to a third of global rabies cases yearly (India, it's common here. No, I've not received a vaccination for it in the past. People here aren't vaccines against Rabies until they are bitten by an animal), which has not helped matters in the past. This is but one of many diseases that tear their way through my psych. I'm always paranoid about contracting such diseases, since they irreversibly change you


I'd taken a banana from a tray at my college dinner hall. I'll add my constant handwashing, ironically linked to my anxiety and hypochondria leave me with microcuts all over my hands, even after I apply a lot of moisturizer.


I hadn't looked at it directly when I picked it up, but it felt disgusting to the touch. I look down at it, and lo behold, there's a region of concavity, a disgusting brownish pit that looks as if though a small animal took a bite out of it. My mind went to that of a rabid bat biting down on it (I've no idea how large bat bite marks are, though I did hear someone might've contracted Nipah virus this way) 

I dropped it immediatey and washed down my hands with the diluted soap at the dinner hall bathroom TWICE, though I felt a droplet of water hit my face in the process (to make matters worse)


I'd already read through in the last online and went through it again an hour after this incident, which only affirmed my fears and made matters worse


Rabies on saliva when exposed to dryness and sunlight dies out within an hour. At room temperature in the absence of sunlight.... It can live for 120+ hours according to a pubmed (I believe that's what the site was called?) paper and various posts online on other surfaces


The bananas would be stored away in a shed from what I assume. They wouldn't be exposed to sunlight right? And the insides of a banana are obviously not dry. If a rabid bat were to bite down on it, the rabies in its saliva would NEVER have died out by then


I'd taken another look at the banana after dinner. I didn't touch it so I couldn't see the other side. The concavity did look like a bite.


I've no idea, as stated before as to how big bat bite marks are. The Internet states they consist on puncture wounds on human skin, but what if the bat chowed down on the banana for a good while? I've seen other pics where they chew through fruits like guava really well so such a pit isn't something I'd put past a bat


I don't even know why this happens to me. I was already on an edge since the last 2 years I'd been at this college owing to the bats that fly around at night and the stray dogs in and around the college. I constantly assess their behavior to see if they're off, a tell tale sign of them being rabid


Much of it is due to my family preventing me from accessing evidence based medical care (as opposed to naturopathy or homeopathy) well up until an year ago. As such, my health anxiety is deeply ingrained into my psych. I've royally screwed up my last few doctor visits, the few that I had

Please, is there any way out of this mess? Am I getting something about this wrong? I'd take any relief, any evidence that contradicts what I've said, that convinces me this wasn't the result of a bat bite, to keep my mind at peace. I haven't had an episode this bad in a good while


Edit : Made before I sent the post. I'd also realized at the time that I'd picked out a spoon from the spoon tray (immersed in lukewarm-warm water usually). People would've picked them with the same hand they used to pick the banana. If the saliva transferred over to the spoon tray and then over to the spoon, I'm fucked. I have cuts all over my mouth due to braces that I'd started wearing 3 months back. 

Saliva could easily enter through my blood via those gaps considering rabies can transmit through saliva coming into contact with gashes and scratches on skin, let alone the musocsal membranes + cuts in my mouth. Yet another reason for my anxiety to ramp up




I'd resorted to asking chatgpt out of desperation. It opts for circular reasoning (given it's an LLM, I don't expect anything better). I'd assumed it being a trove of knowledge from around the Web would know SOMETHING that could contradict what I said. It doesn't address my points,  shoots out responses that are easily countered and which are not addressive of points I've made

I have heard a lot say they weren’t able to pass gas or use the bathroom despite feeling the need to with appendicitis and (tmi?)

I (25f) find it really hard to be myself due to my social anxiety. My anxiety is rooted in the fear of embarrassing myself in front of people by actually being myself, which I believe may also be an issue for most of you. I’m scared of being myself because of these “quirks” that I have. I’ll try to explain it as best as I can.

So, my brother describes me as an “overly expressive” person, which I believe was supposed to sound like a good thing. What he means by this is that I make very accentuated facial expressions when reacting to certain things, some of which I’m not even aware of until he reenacts them to me. And he bursts out laughing whenever he does it. He does this with expressions I make when I’m mad, scared, or surprised. I know that he might just find this funny and amusing and mean no harm, but I do get offended sometimes.

He’s not the first person to point these things out. People constantly mention how fast I blink and how much my hands shake (due to my generalized anxiety disorder, yes I have been diagnosed) and it hurts me. As you can probably tell, I’m a very sensitive person. What bothers me most is that these are constant reminders of how “weird” I can be in social situations. Two events I remember clearly are:

– I was at a movie with a couple of friends. I got really “into” the movie, to the point I had my mouth agape. I didn’t realize I was doing it, until my friends started commenting on it and laughing and mimicking what I was doing.

– During a social gathering, I was part of a conversation which I was super absorbed in. While I listened to the other people talk, I started being “expressive” again while in my element, until I looked at my Instagram stories and realized a group of friends (the same I was at the movies with) had recorded me and posted me on their stories. They probably found it funny or something. I asked them to delete it, and they did.

I try to brush this off and justify it with the fact that I may be overly sensitive after all. But this worsens my social anxiety to the point where I’m hypervigilant about myself in public. And, as you know, this just makes me more anxious and self-conscious. I’m scared to meet new people. But what hurts me the most is the fact that, if I do let go of the self-consciousness and “accept” myself, I’ll be 10x weirder. I don’t want to be known or remembered as a weird person.

Yes, there’s a disconnect between who I am and who I wish I were. Yes, I know I should be unapologetically myself and authentic and all that, but I’m scared. I don’t feel like a normal person. It’s hard to feel like a normal person when people laugh at you when you’re being yourself.

As I write this, one of my friends just texted me asking if we can go out for my birthday tonight. I don’t know her in person and I’ve been putting off irl meetings because of this very issue. I’m scared that she’ll just be another person who finds me weird or points out another quirk I didn’t know I had.

I wish I was confident and sure of myself. I wish I could talk to people normally and not be afraid of being who I am. And yes, there are worse things to worry about, like my dad says, but this is honestly breaking me and ruining my social life. I’d appreciate it if any of you could give me any advice. Any words. Anything. Should I just say fuck it? And if yes, how?",1679063733.0

It seems to me to be fast acting: I'll start to feel tense and worried and then I'll remember to take my pill and next thing I know I'm feeling better.

However, the literature for Buspirone suggests that it is a slow acting drug that you need to build up in your body over 2-4 weeks, similar to an SSRI. If that's the case, why do you need to take it 3x a day? My psychiatrist seems to disagree with this fact: when I asked him the same question, he said you take it 3x a day because it only lasts a few hours.

I’ve been dealing with a breakup recently and it’s been the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I F18 currently in my last year of college in the same classes as said ex M18. Things were bad at first after the initial breakup. He is very manipulative, and nasty in his ways and the whole time we have been broken up he has proven that time and time again. I was insanely stressed throughout, I had to take time off college because I was physically ill with stress, vomiting, diarrhoea, heart palpitations. It was like a constant panic attack for weeks. Things started to settle, things became civil and he started being nice and speaking to me again. Throughout this whole breakup I was adamant I didn’t want drama, I was happy to be civil/friends. All I ever asked of him was to refrain from talking about his new relations with other girls- I assumed he would have the respect to do that just like I did for him. Needless to say that didn’t last long and he began making comments insinuating things. It obviously bothered me but there was nothing I could really say. I have had my best friend of years with me throughout this, weve known eachother since we were in year 7. I couldn’t be more grateful, she’s had my back through everything. We started getting close with another girl in our class, she’s a bit older than us and we never really spoke before this. I had always been quite wary of him being around her when we were together, I always assumed it was my insecurities. She’s blonde, slim, pretty, drives. And I never trusted it. But anyway, we started getting close, she invited me and my best friend to her house we stayed the night, got some food and then went shopping the next day. This was about 3 weeks ago?? Then on Tuesday, I was stood at the bus stop with my best friend talking about how I feel like something was going on with her and him. I’d had a feeling since the breakup tbh. I had told people this and EVERYONE told me I was just being paranoid and she wouldn’t do that to me. And some other girl in the class chimes in and says he has been telling the whole class but me and my bsf that he has been involved with her and they’d slept together. My heart SANK. Stood at the bus stop having a full on mental breakdown. I knew, I knew I wasn’t crazy. Even thought it hasn’t come from the horses mouth I believed her. I was ready to go in guns blazing on the pair of them, especially her. She sat there and watched me cry over him. She sat there and told me need to leave him and that I deserved better. She BAREFACED lied to me for weeks. And so did he. Literally days before this he has spoke to me and said he still cared about me, he doesn’t have it in him to be a cunt to me, I’m not an easy person to get over, he messed with my head for what? My bsf took my phone and told me she’d see what was going on first. She rang her and put it on speaker, and as soon as she opened her mouth I knew she was lying. Now me personally, if someone rang me saying that I’m being accused of sleeping with my friends ex and the whole class knows, I’d be livid. She was calm as a cucumber, like she knew it was coming. My bsf asked her outright and she said “whatttt… nooo…I wouldn’t do that…I’ll ring him”. She denied it to my face. I’ve been nothing but respectful to him. I don’t know what I did to deserve this. A few weeks after we broke up I ended up sleeping with one of my old friends with benefits, more convenience than anything and tbh I didn’t even want to I just felt like this was what I needed. I was wrong I felt 10x worse than I did originally, I told this girl and she cheered me on anyway. She has now told him and he’s saying stuff about my body count and telling everyone. Why is that anything to do with him? And you were the cunt and now you want to air my business to everyone just because I don’t wanna speak to you? The stress is something I’ve never felt. I don’t know why, everything he’s done everything she’s done. I just don’t understand why. I want someone to tell me what to do, what is wrong with me. Why can’t I just move on like he has? Why am I sat here killing myself with stress while he acts like I never even happened? I feel like there’s something wrong with me. It’s not normal to feel like this for so long and nothing to work. I know everything people are saying is true, my head knows that. My body just won’t let it go, I’m worried about my weight. I’m at a good place with it now, i just genuinely can’t eat. My stomach is too tight, I’m too anxious. I’ve only got a few months left I’m just not sure if I can do it. I’m sick of being treated like this, I haven’t said a single word to him, even when he’s been saying stuff to me. I don’t wanna lower myself to that. I don’t even care about them sleeping together anymore I just want to be left alone, I don’t bother you so why do you go out of your way to be nasty to me. I just need someone to tell me what to do. How do I stop this feeling. It’s consuming, it’s affecting my health now and that’s what’s worrying me. I could probably deal with the  anxiety but not this intense, not the no eating or sleeping, and not the feeling like my heart is going to give in.",1679082355.0
875,Went to the ER last night and the ER doctor suggested anxiety is the cause of my symptoms. I have some questions to see how people have dealt with symptoms,2,11tv36d,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11tv36d/went_to_the_er_last_night_and_the_er_doctor/,5,"Hello all,

So, I have been experiencing these symptoms for a few weeks now and the ER doctor ran metabolic panels and what not and said there is no medical reason for these symptoms and that I'm probably experiencing some anxiety:

* Eyes feel strained/twitching for weeks. 
* Muscle spasms in my legs and triceps kind of like tremors but not like cramps. 
* I can feel my pulse through my body, but my blood pressure is unaffected, but my heart rate may go up.
* I'm constantly hungry, not like a craving hungry but like my body has been physically busy and needs fuel.
* My body feels like it is in a very low level of fight or flight with shakiness but I'm still in control and I haven't lost strength as I lift weights daily and there has been no impact there. 

I kind of realized a couple months ago that I was experiencing a lot of stress and wasn't sleeping a lot due to a lot of things at once, medical concern that resolved itself, everyone getting laid off, taking pay cuts, general mid-life crisis things I suppose. I felt like I was mentally over it but then talking to the ER doctor a bit I may not be. For instance, I didn't realize it but I couldn't tell you any details about any shows I've watched or video games I've played because my mind is always thinking about our bills in the house and getting out of debt. 

My biggest thing was telling the doctor if I'm distracted, I don't feel the twitches or eye strain, only when I'm sitting back down and being still, un-distracted. 

Are the symptoms I'm feeling typical of those who have felt anxiety? How did you work your way around it? I think it is difficult for me right now because I'm not fully realizing what's going on or addressing it properly, but I'd like for it to physically stop.",1679068604.0

They told me their email right away in session but then I forgot, so I asked them to send me the email since they got my number. (I was late for appointment that day and they sent me a text to my number so I assumed they clearly know my number). They said surely will do that later. The next day, in the afternoon I got a reminder text about the payment from the receptionist (same number my therapist texted me), so I texted the receptionist to sent me my therapist’s email and the receptionist did. However this is my therapist’s personal email, not the work email they gave me.

But then in 2nd appointment, they didn’t ask how am I doing with my college or do I still need the letter.

She is having me do all kinds of exercises at home that fall under the umbrella of IE. I‘ve been doing the exercises now for a little over two weeks, and I find I am getting more and more annoyed at them. They are supposed to mimic the feelings I have right before a panic attack and since I‘m doing them at home, in a safe environment and only for a short time, they are supposed to help me get used to the feeling and teach my brain that the sensation will stop at some point. For those of you who have tried this technique, did it work for you? How long were you busy using this technique? Would you recommend it? Did it have any negative effects on you? After your treatment, were you „cured“ of having panic attacks?

I get incredibly anxious, and shaky, and I don’t feel safe or confident being a driver or a passenger. Advice? 


I’ve been a passenger in multiple car accidents through out my life. It took me a long time to even get my permit (age 18) and even longer to pass my license test after 3 tries (age  22). I failed my license test multiple times due to panic attacks mid test. Well, I had gotten my license in April 2021. Everything was great, I didn’t need help with transportation anymore! I no longer felt like a burden. Then in October of 2022 I got in my first accident where I was the driver, and my car was totaled. Unfortunately I was at fault. I was at a stop sign and I guess the driver behind me thought I sat for too long and blared their horn at me nonstop until I panicked and hit the gas (loud sounds are a bit triggering and bad sensory for me). I suffered a lot of emotional trauma. Since then I’ve nearly been run off the road 2 times and I’ve had a front row seat to witnessing 3 other car accidents directly in front of me. The most recent being yesterday March 16th around 5pm, 2 cars collided in front of me and came about a foot away from slamming into my car as well. I’m struggling horribly to feel safe and confident when driving, or even just as a passenger. Due to this anxiety I’m the most annoying “back seat driver” and it irritates my husband but he understands. I constantly point out that the light is red, I tell him “you should be in that lane instead”, I get super upset and scared when someone tailgates, honks, recklessly speeds, weaves in/out of traffic, or flashes their headlights at me, I gasp/jump/cringe if I don’t think he’s slowing the car down fast enough when approaching a stop, I get really anxious in heavy traffic, around road work, and unfamiliar areas. It’s often bad enough that I will use google street view to map out exactly what my route looks like, and what the parking situation looks like so I can try to avoid a panic attack (I usually have a panic attack anyways). Also, ever since totaling my car, whenever I hear a car horn or loud sounds while in a car I get vivid flashbacks and an instant headache. I am afraid I will ruin or lose all the progress I’ve made with driving.

I'm   a 19 year old male from Serbia and I've been experiencing panic  attacks  or anxiety attacks when trying to sleep in bed for the past few  days.  I've been awake for three days now and I'm really struggling to  sleep.

Every  time I try to lie  down in bed, my whole body starts feeling weird,  my  heart races, and  the left side of my body feels numb. It's like I'm   experiencing  pressure or cramps, and it's hard to move my left arm and  leg. I also   feel tingling in my left side of the body. It gets very  hard to breathe  while  falling asleep; I feel like the bed is moving or  that I'm  falling down  in some rare cases, but I quickly panic and wake  up by  the influx of  energy every time. I start shivering, but it feels  very  hot in the bed  all of a sudden. The usual way for me to stop  this  is  to play video games with my boyfriend and talk to him or to  listen  to  music, but it's hard to get rid of the symptoms after trying  to lie   down and sleep in my bed, as they persist even after I leave my bed, but   they usually start to slowly fade away.

I've   tried meditation and relaxation techniques, but they don't seem to be   working. I feel like I'm half awake and half asleep, and it's really   affecting my mental and physical health.

I  have also been monitoring my blood pressure, The last time I checked  after a panic/anxiety attack, it was 168/85, which is concerning for  someone my age. I have been feeling a tingling sensation in my heart and  chest, and I am worried that these symptoms are related to my high  blood pressure. I am not sure if my panic attacks and anxiety are  causing my blood pressure to rise, or if there is an underlying medical  condition that I am not aware of. I would appreciate any advice or  insight on how to manage my symptoms and potentially lower my blood  pressure.

I've already been to the  hospital and had several tests done, including an EKG, a blood test,  and an ultrasound of my heart and abdomen. However, all the tests came  back normal, and the doctors couldn't find any underlying medical  conditions that could explain my symptoms. They suggested that it could  be related to anxiety or panic attacks, but I'm still not sure. I just  want to find a solution and be able to sleep peacefully without  experiencing these scary sensations.

In  addition to my panic attacks and anxiety, I also experience symptoms  that suggest I may have ADHD or OCD or something else. I have most of  the symptoms of those. I have never been tested for ADHD, but I believe I  might have it. It's also worth noting that I have anxiety almost always  or very often but it's usually mild. I feel like I'm trapped in my own  head and can't get rid of the racing thoughts. I'm starting to wonder if  I have an anxiety disorder that needs to be addressed.

I'm   reaching out to this community because I'm hoping someone can provide   some advice or support. I don't know what to do, and I'm really scared.   I've never experienced anything like this before.

I graduated from   UNI in january of 2022. I still seem to struggle to find a permanent job. I have been working some months, but not the whole time. 
I know I sound like a nagging manchild, 
I feel like I am to damaged of materials, loser and a dissapointment to my family and friend. 
I cannot live life like this (what life is this?) but I also do not know how to break this bad cicle. I just put blame everywhere else and I don't seem to do better, I just fall in the same loophole again. 

I got a new job three weeks ago, but I don't seem to feel comtable with that particular working place, its customers, managment and coworkers. Maybe I just do not like my profession, or maybe I do. I feel kind of split right now, and I really am thinking about thoughts like if life is really worth it all. I called out sick the past two days and I just cannot stop thinking about this. 

I still live at home and struggle with loneliness. If I can not hold a job and later buy an own home what worth do I have? Will I find a loved one, travel and live a happy life? I can not see my self happy living life solo, I did that and hated it. 

I still live at home and I can see that my family is starting to give up on me and I do not know why I panic, this is my own wrongdoing and I am a loser. 
I lose time and youth and I am a burden on my closest family and one friend I have sticking around since high school. Please don't see this as me feeling sorry for myself. I just have to vent and I cannot even be in my own skin right now. I feel alienated from society like I don't have loved one to talk about my deepest fears right now. I want to experience lifes both good and bad.

I probably should sort out that I got a mild aspergers diagnosis in my early 20s. I went my whole life with this being unnoticed. I did struggle with social interactions and cues but they are not as a big of a problem now. I can speak to people (both new and old) without problem. But I see that my anxiety about other stuff in life makes me look reserved uinterested and confused when I interact with people, such as now. 
I think what is a typical behaviour in me is that I HATE new routines and sudden changes. I do not deal with stress well, which I should work with now as I did with my social issues before.",1679052044.0

[TW meds, hospital]",1,11ttq6h,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11ttq6h/advice_on_anxiety_medication_tw_meds_hospital/,1,"I \[19M\] have had issues with anxiety for as long as I can remember, was casually ""diagnosed"" with GAD when I was in high school, but it wasn't mentioned anytime after that. I have a few other issues, mainly Autism + ADHD, but also CPTSD, which makes life extremely difficult.

4 years ago, I was hospitalized on and off for about two years, and the therapists there would prescribe me medication that my body didn't react well to at all. Unfortunately, they kept me on the same meds until I forced myself out of the system by moving a few hours away.

I've managed to stay very roughly afloat for a little amount of time, but in the recent month, things have gotten significantly worse - in the past two weeks, my insomnia has gotten so bad that I slept probably 8 hours in the past 4 days. The problem is, I'm starting a new job this Monday, and I need to be fit enough to get there and not have panic attacks on site. I'm obviously terrified, since I've never been able to hold down a job, and I had been looking for a few months, so I really need to do it right this time.

I'm thinking of seeing a psychiatrist again after two years, but I don't exactly trust them with their understanding of doses and meds, mainly because my organism being hypersensitive to side effects is something they never take into account. Which is why I'm taking to Reddit here. In my country, oftentimes you can go to a psychiatrist and tell them point blank which medication you need and they'll prescribe it to you, and I believe this to be the better option than going in blind and risking a lot in terms of physical health.

My ideal (and I mean ideal) anxiety medication would be :

\- something that I could take during the day to calm anxiety attacks when I feel them rising, but that wouldn't make me drop dead and lose the little energy I have (and yes I had tried tiny doses of previous medications, I fall asleep extremely easily on these meds)

AND/OR

\- something that I could take in the evening, which would help me fall asleep TO A REASONABLE EXTENT, because last time I was on meds to sleep they would make me sleep 12 hours a night which is wildly incompatible with a 9 to 5.

Are there any names you can think of ? Ideally with the least side effects, especially since I am very much devoid of energy a lot of the time and I can't afford to lose what little I have.

TL;DR : Going to go to a psychiatrist to get anxiety medications prescribed, I don't trust them to believe my body is hypersensitive to side effects, looking for a name of the tamest thing out there to go into the appointment asking for that.",1679065583.0

I’m a 26M and about 2.5 ago I was sitting at work after working 23 days in a row of night shift (not my normal schedule) and my heart was beating very fast and I felt like I was going to die. Confused, face went white just didn’t know what was happening. They called the fire department and I had a very high blood pressure but was released and went home. That seems to be my kicking off point. 

Ever since that night I have had this intense fear that I’m going to die. I began having headaches every day that I can only get brief relief from, random aches and pains in my arms and legs. Waves of adrenaline paired with that flushing feeling over your body regularly through the day. When I get a weird symptom I start to worry that this is very serious and start looking into what it could be. I know this is a bad move and have been trying to avoid it. 

I went to my doctor and they ran some blood tests. I have pretty bad cholesterol that I need to work on and a slightly elevated liver enzyme but nothing else was abnormal. 

My blood pressure fluctuates from a normal range 120/80’s to as high as 167/103 I measured tonight. 

Fast forward to todays ago and I was at home, felt my heart pounding and had some pain in my chest and arm that was coming and going. I was convinced I was having a heart attack. I went to the ER and no heart attack. Blood pressure was super high when I got there and was totally fine when I left. Good news. 

Yesterday we found out that that our baby stopped growing at 8 weeks and there was no heart beat so we have to plan to get it removed. My wife has been a mess for obvious reasons so I have been trying to be as supportive as I can be through this process and also try and deal with all of this which I’m not handling well and need to deal with so I can be there for her. 

Tonight I began another headache at the base of my skull on the left side that was intense. Waves of pain shooting through my head and neck. Worked myself up into thinking it was a stroke thanks to ole google. Heart rate and blood pressure were very high but haven’t had a full panic attack. 

Currently laying in bed scared to go to sleep and have been hoping it gets better so I don’t convince myself to go to the ER again. I have a follow up with my primary next week and haven’t officially been diagnosed with anxiety or anything. I don’t really want to be on medication if it can be avoided I just want these pains and constant panic/stress to go away so I can work and go back to normal.

So I’ve been out of full time work for coming up on 5 years now. In these 5 years I’ve attempted 4 different times to hold down full time jobs that I applied for and was hired for and failed at all of them. I believe 3 weeks was the longest I made it at any of the 4 before I had to quit or was fired for missing days due to panic attacks and all the rest exc.

I had my monthly facetime checkup with my psych aprn who scripts my meds the other day and told him how horrible I’m doing (I’m currently in therapy again as well have been for 4 months trying IFS therapy) and he said he thinks I should def apply that the attempts at working look good in my favor exc. 

It’s just based on everything I’ve researched and heard even ppl with great documentation and severe illnesses exc get denied and somes appeals even eventually get denied as well. I also worry that since I’ve gone though so many therapists I only have one long term mental health professional I’ve been with and that’s him…this aprn I see who does my meds and I’ve been seeing for 8-9 years now. 

I mean maybe that’s good enuff since he can provide all the diagnoses and records of the million meds I’ve tried exc. I guess I can list out all the shrinks I’ve seen including my current one altho as far as them being able to actually talk to them if that’s even needed idk I mean some of them are from way back. 

I’ve been diagnosed with Gad, SAD, cptsd, panic disorder, non specific depressive disorder and ocd so uhh ywah  I’m pretty Fkn bat shit lol and I’m def disabled I mean I’ve tried to work I want to work I don’t want a hand out but I’m desperate now. Savings are dwindling and while my older sister helps me out here and there knowing my situation with 100 bucks here 100 there which I feel so pathetic about but am grateful for but it’s just not enuff.

I don’t wanna be on disability forever but idk at the age of 33 after everything I’ve tried for so many goddamn years now I think I may be fooling myself holding on to any illusion of hope for a future for myself, and that includes ever being able to work a job again of any kind. I couldn’t even Fkn do a work from home job I was having panic attacks from being so overwhelmed logging on to my laptop in my own fucking living room for Christ sake.

Anyway I guess you didn’t need the whole life story sorry so basically just wondering if anybody here who is familar w the system or who has applied and been accepted or denied or whatever knows if it’s worth a shot. 

I know I said I’m a desperate so it would seem like duhhh of course irs worth it but at the same time I am so fucking exhausted mentally n physically 24/7 and have such little to nonexistent will and energy to do anything that I would feel like such a Fkn jerkoff if went through with all the paperwork and the gettint a lawyer possibly and the auto denial they basically do to everyone and then the hearing before a judge and just the massive headaches I know would lie ahead 

Tl;dr: familar with applying for mental health disability? With the system in general or you personally applied and we’re accepted or denied know if irs worth it or it’s rly just really low chance of approval even w a lawyer and good paperwork and diagnoses and doctors backing me up exc…

My mum suggested I start eating very small amounts of fat to see what happens. Everyday I went home from college she made me home made oven chips. For weeks. And I was fine. Then she admitted to me that she had been putting more and more oil in my chips everyday. I was gobsmacked! I’m so grateful she did this because I finally realised I was tricked by my brain.

I need you advise really... i am 35 year old male, I always think that I have a health problem, it started like 13 years ago, when I was diagnosed with migraine, I thought I had a tumor in my brain, the dr. Assured me it's a migraine, but I went into a state of anxiety for months, starting to have the same symptoms as the brain tumor, went to the same Dr. Many times, until the point that he told me, you have a mental illness, I am going to order an MRI for you, just to assure you, and to stop seeing you again, so I did it, it was normal as expected, and so everything was fine again, even my migraine had gone. 

I married a wonderful woman who is a GP, and had a beautiful  baby boy, everything  was fine for me, until almost a year ago, I had a sever case of covid, so my wife told me let's run a full blood test on you, so I did, everything was fine except my liver function tests, they came up Slightly elevated, went to a GI dr, and he told me that it was because of Covid, but nonetheless, I am going to run some scans and extra blood tests, it came back fine, but here is the click, I didn't go back to normal since that incident, maybe my body did, but my mind didn't, I was in constant fear that my liver is having some kind of problem, and i actually started having pain  in that area... against my wife advise I went to another GI after several months, who ran, many lab test on me including scans. all came back normal, and he told me it's an IBS pain, didn't believe him, went to another GI the most expensive one in town, who ran more tests (blood, stool, scans), and came back to the same conclusion its an IBS, so since my liver is ok, i moved to another thought, i might have colon cancer, so that other day i told my wife who i might remind you is a Dr. Herself  that according to the internet,  i might have a colon cancer, she is not even speaking to me anymore, and told me that i am not the same man she used to know... I am spending so much money, time, thought and quality of life on this, I am not the man I used to be, I am measuring my weight every day for God sake, looking at my stool like a wierd fuck to see if anything abnormal is happening..

Just back to back to back horrible news and I'm holding on for dear life for no reason other than I don't want to hurt people and I've never really struggled with those dark thoughts before, not really. It's been a really really rough handful of years, I have 2 chronic conditions that give me constant headaches one of them being constant migraine. I can't find any relief whatsoever. I've been moved from neurologist to neurologist and no one could help me and they all gave up on me, that of course was over months and months and for a few of the neurologists it was years of coming to appointments just to be sent away again in the end and referred elsewhere. I can't work or anything so I'm just trying to cope and survive. Right now actually I'm doing ""homework"" type stuff for my new neurologist. I learned last month that my illness and pain is passed the point of medication right now and the plan right now is for me to study and read and have my neurologist be my cohort and try to figure it out together. I was actually trying to do my homework and take charge even though that news was really painful to learn and the last chapter I listened to before I broke down it said ""one patient took 12 years to feel better and to get relief"" and that made me feel so beyond hopeless and like what was even the point in trying anymore? I also suffer from anxiety issues. They've been slowly getting worse when I've been under more and more pressure and it's been hard to feel okay. I have a psychiatrist that took months for me to get into but she only deals with medicine and hasn't been helpful to me with my anxiety unfortunately. I didn't know that she was a psychiatrist until I actually met her of course but I've been doing all that I can with the medicine given and it's not helping very much I don't think. I'm terrified of getting addicted to xanax so even though atm I'm in a constant feeling of intense and overwhelming anxiety I'm too scared to take it because I don't want to abuse what I've been given. I've been having nightmares and intense dreams every single night for 6 months now. I dread going to sleep every night and I'm already dreading it tonight. I have a permanent ball of anxiety and hurt in my chest and stomach lately. This is embarrassing to mention and seemingly random but important and I hate that this happened to me but my house ended up getting  bed bugs. My boyfriend was grossed out and refused to see me and we had an extremely strained relationship for the last month and a half of our relationship. He wouldn't compromise at all and he wouldn't even try to talk to me on the phone. It was excuses after excuses. He broke up with me this Saturday. At first he said he needed to work on himself and needed to grow and needed to do it alone and his mental health wasn't good at all. I begged and begged and embarrassed myself trying to fix it and make everything okay. It didn't work. I was devastated and sick and have been since then. I made a horrible awful mistake and messaged him Tuesday night because I had an intense vivid dream mixed in the middle of the nightmares where we were able to fix our relationship and when I woke up that day it really messed with my head. I messaged him and what he said broke me in half and threw me on the floor. He told me he might actually be gay. The whole time we were dating I knew he was bisexual and I'm not straight either so it never ever bothered me and I tried to be supportive. Him saying that really has made me feel sick. I have issues and trauma around things not being real with people and not being able to trust that people tell me the truth and being lied to and me loving someone while they felt like I was just there and he knew that. I feel way pushed past my limit. My brain has been repeating that phrase from his text over and over and over again, I'm so exhausted from crying and trying to not think of it. Every thought is about that and it makes it hard to breathe every single time. I have extreme trust issues and I try really hard but things like this keep happening over and over again and I sometimes think my brain is broken or wired stupid because these things are so traumatic and life altering to me ig because I'm so sensitive. After days of questioning my reality and handling yet another instance of me loving someone who didn't love me or care about me I'm at least comforted by the knowledge that I don't think he wasn't physically attracted to me during our relationship. He was very sexually forward and liked my feminine features and when I wore skirts and when I wore lipstick and eyeliner and he'd get really turned on when we were just cuddling on the couch together very innocently or when I would run my nails across him anywhere. I'm not sure why that part mattered to me as much as it does but he was a big deal in helping me be able to be intimate with someone so the knowledge that it was all fake almost legitamately killed me. I think he is confused and tired of dealing with people who have a lot of feelings and he himself struggles with apathy and numbness so he thinks dating strictly boys will be the answer. He never dated any guys, only girls and I have a feeling he panicked at the thought of never getting that experience and bailed on me. I'm not at all okay right now and I cannot see the light. I don't really actually want to die, I just want things to be okay and maybe even great one day and right now I cannot imagine one scenario where that's ever ever going to happen for me. I have so many things going on that are out of my control and I'm struggling to breathe. I'm sorry if this is messy and all over the place hehehe that is my state right now. I moved back in with my parents for the time being and I emailed a therapist and I'm trying to set therapy up but I physically feel like I'm dying inside I'm in such emotional and mental pain. I'm hurting more than I thought was ever possible. Please if anyone has anything nice or uplifting to say or any advice I'd gladly appreciate it.

&#x200B;

Alright this is gonna sound very weird, but for the past 2 or 3 weeks I have started experiencing what \*sounds\* like a voice or whisper, but very quiet and \*\*very\*\* short-lasting. It's not at all throughout the day - again it's very, very short instances - and I don't even think its been happening daily, it happens at random times. At first it was just a little weird but I figured it was probably just in my head and ignored it, however it recently has started to scare me when it happens, hence the reason for this post lol.

&#x200B;

I think the first time it actually scared me was when I went grocery shopping last week. I thought I heard it very quietly, but then, unlike the other times, it was like I \*kept\* hearing it for like, 3-5 seconds. Yeah, I know that's not a lot of time, but its creepy as hell and like I said, prior to this it would be super quick moments that I was able to convince myself I didn't hear, mostly because they were so fast. This instance actually scared me, like gave me chills and made me get very anxious in the store until it stopped.

&#x200B;

And like, recently its almost like I can sort of hear the whispering morph into my name being whispered. The problem is, its usually very quick and quiet so its super difficult to tell. That being said, rn its very late so no one's up besides me and it happened again, but this time it really sounded more like my name than any other time I've heard it. It was like a voice whispered my name.... Again it really scared me, however at the moment of writing this I'm pretty much chill now, so I'm not like terrified by it.

&#x200B;

Now here's the thing, I can't tell if I'm really hearing stuff or if it could just be my body misinterpreting noises from the environment, you know? It's usually very quiet and quick, so it is hard to tell. I still think it could / probably is just in my head, but because of how it's been happening out of no where for the past 2-3 weeks and seems to be getting somewhat more distinct, I am a bit anxious about it.

&#x200B;

Oh and there's something else but I doubt its relevant. For the past year or year and a half, I've been getting instances where it feels like bugs are crawling on some part of my body, usually at night. I actually feel it on my legs now, on my upper right thigh. When this happens I try to convince myself it's just my body playing tricks on me, or that it's simply my hairs rubbing against something, but it \*\*genuinly\*\* feels like small bugs crawling on me, so I do sometimes have to check bc it just feels too real and I need to be sure.

&#x200B;

If it matters, I am 21 years old and a guy. I do have anxiety issues/ some other struggles with my mental health, and about 2 weeks ago I started my switch from Zoloft onto Viibryd. Not only that, but because I've known for a long time that my dad sees things that aren't really there (shadows, angels, ghosts, etc.),  I have already had some anxiety for a while about \*seeing\* stuff like he does when I get older, because \*that\* sounds terrifying; a year ago he was telling me how he had a hard time sleeping one night bc shadows were walking around his bed. Aside from this info he shared, I've only heard him tell me about him seeing stuff during the day so it's not like he just dreams this stuff.

&#x200B;

I \*\*seriously\*\* think it might just be my body playing tricks on me. Like, idk maybe I'm hearing quiet noises and for some reason my brain has started to interpret them as a voice? If this \*is\* the case, I imagine that being anxious about it will just make my brain \*more\* likely to interpret these noises incorrectly.

&#x200B;

The workload is not too bad; I mostly just have 3-4 classes a day, some days even lesser, and I have no classes on Fridays which gives me time to do planning. My colleagues are great, super helpful and super welcoming. 

The only issue is the students. They're super rowdy, often very rude to me and other teachers, and they don't listen to instructions like when I ask them to complete tasks etc. The worst is that they're super noisy and disruptive in clsss, and almost never sit still, even when asked multiple times. Now they're around 11-14, and of course I understand kids that age just aren't fully matured yet and will act out. But it's been really taking a toll on my health in the past 3 weeks; their sudden outbursts give me panic attacks cause I can never anticipate them, and the noise and movement in class gets me so overwhelmed and overstimulated I just blank out. 

I've tried asking my colleagues how they handle the issue, but it hasn't been much of a help. From what I found out, most of the other teachers just ignore them or have an unimaginable amount of patience with them. I've tried warning the students with consequences, detention, exclusion from certain class activities etc, promise of rewards if they behave, but the thing is I feel like the kids just do not care. They don't care if I send them to the reflection room, or threaten them with telling their parents, or try to talk it out with them. 

Over the past 3 weeks I've had a panic attack/nervous breakdown nearly everyday, and it's been exhausting. I'm worried if I keep this up, my health will get worse, and speaking from experience, it could land me in the hospital, which is not what I want. I've brought this issue over to admin, but they say they can't do much for now either. I love teaching, I love education, but I'm so afraid and sad to face the reality that maybe it's not for me. 

What's the best thing I could do for now? A shout out to fellow teachers who maybe facing the same, I cannot tell you the insurmountable amount of respect I have for you to still be in this job.",1679025410.0

Earlier today I got a scope down my nose and into my throat for some things. I had to take 4 puffs of afrin in each nostril. Then my nose was numbed by Lidocaine spray. 3 puffs in each nostril. This was about literally 8 hours ago now. My throat was burning from it and hurts when I swallow still. 


However the main issue is, I started to get a random tingling in my head that isn’t going away. When I touch my head, it intensifies. It feels like goosebumps/tingles are in my head. Idk what’s going on. I’m pretty sure lidocaine cannot cause this especially since it was in my nose, but I am hoping someone can give me advice. I’m freaking out. I’m so scared.

Despite this, I was able to graduate college in August of 2022 and secure a job in October of 2022. Due to my anxiety, I opted for a remote job. 

Despite being a remote job, I even get intense anxiety before and during virtual meetings. My job is now transitioning to a hybrid schedule, meaning I would have to go to the office often. This is extremely overwhelming to me. I still have a hard time just managing to go to the grocery store so I can’t imagine going to an office work environment. 

I just feel like I need time for self care and that I shouldn’t be working at all until I get my anxiety to a manageable level as it does impair my abilities at times (my brain fog and tension headaches are terrible, aside from the constant panicked feeling and nausea). 

My biggest concern and why I rushed into getting a job so quickly is feeling like a failure or that I am letting my family down. I also worry about finding another job in the future, my coworkers hating me, not having a good reference, or just never getting better mentally.

Ever since I started going to college I’ve been feeling massive anxiety at one point or another. At first it was just minor thoughts about homework or classes that sort of just went away, but ever since I had a major panic attack at my old job in front of many others, I’ve been fearing for myself and my health for a while. 

Anxiety attacks have been hitting me hard this school semester especially. I’m an art major and I think I picked the worst selection of classes to get through this semester, in just the first few weeks I was tasked with drawing insane amounts of thumbnails for assignments as well as a 20 page essay before midterms. The grind hasn’t really stopped.

I’m on spring break currently and visiting my parents and it’s given me a bit of solace and comfort seeing them again (as well as my cat, haha.) but even then, it’s been hard to destress even when I’m in a space I find the most safe from life outside my hometown. I almost had a panic attack just from simply sitting down and eating with my family.

I used to be such a fearless person… I used to be in plays, I did one-act, I’ve spoken in front of large audiences at certain events, all without thinking of the worst possible outcome. I don’t know when I started to over-catastrophize every little thing I do now, but dang man, it’s taken a bit of a toll on me. My heart area kinda hurts a little bit now. The only times I don’t feel anxiety or feel panic attacks about to occur is when I’m hanging with friends at college, putting myself out there when I can because I think it helps. But even then, I sort of forget the people who have my back and end up singling myself out and catastrophizing when I have panic attacks in class or when I’m alone.

I’ve tried a lot of things. I’ve taken meds before, but none seemed to really do the trick. Hydroxyzine made me sleepy, fluoxetine made me want to do absolutely nothing, and Zoloft kept me up all freaking night with zero sleep (I started taking it around midterms, probably the worst time) so I called my doctor and quit it after just 4 days. I’ve tried the breathing exercises and rationalizing, they work at the moment of the attack but it sucks having to do them repeatedly whenever something comes on. I’ve tried journaling my thoughts, but it’s just not working all that well. I wish I could just go back to being the person I used to be, free of intrusive thoughts and the burden of panic disorder.",1679022885.0

&#x200B;

first of all let me start out by saying I have pretty severe dysgraphia so my grammar and especially my punctuation aren’t going to be the greatest. Some background information on me I am 26 years old (m)  I have been diagnosed with high functioning autism ADHD,ODD,OCD,depression,severe anxiety,dysgraphia and I have never been form diagnosed with either one but I’m pretty sure I have Dyscalculia and body dysmorphia, needless to say living with all of this has made my life quite tough. The first five years after high school were horrible and the worst years of my life I came very close to committing suicide.

I had to deal with three close deaths, I had to deal with the fact I couldn’t drive because of poor hand-eye coordination, a failed job,COVID, family problems, and my best friend since the third grade decided out of nowhere he wanted nothing to do with me anymore and then I had a family friend who is 63 years old calling me in the middle of the night drunk and laying all his problems on me, and plus I was being put on all kinds of new medication and I got put on some antidepressant that caused me to go from 172 pounds all the way up to 250! I had never been fat in my life, and I was pretty ripped in high school and being at that weight made me disgusted with my self I can’t stand to look at pictures of myself when I was at that weight it makes me sick. Last year comes and things had really settled down in my life I started working for my Dad which has been great because it allows me to work from home and at my own hours, plus this year I have gotten back into working out and have gone from 250 all the way down to 205! I’m nowhere near my peak I was in high school. But I’m a lot better than what I had been, but out of nowhere last Thursday I just started to feel down and very anxious, and feeling like a failure at life I always feel this way but usually it’s manageable but it’s just been so extreme lately. I just keep thinking about how I’m a 26 year old man still living with his parents I can’t drive and I am just physically repulsed by my appearance I always have been and getting fat sure has shit didn’t help me with that. My parents like having me live with them and I love my parents to death, but it makes me feel bad because of how society views a man my age still living at home  and not being able to drive, your seen has not a real man and basically scum of the earth. And I really try not to think about this but it depresses me that I have never had a girlfriend and most likely never will and that my only sexual experience I most likely will ever have was some creepy gay guy at school sexually harassing me and that I will most likely die alone. I mean come on what woman is going to want to be with a loser like me, I’m a pathetic excuse for a man and emotionally weak and in my opinion I look like something out of a horror movie like Wrong Turn or The Hills Have Eyes or something. The thought of my Mom,Dad,Aunt,Uncle dying terrifies me being alone in this cruel hard world makes me sick. And one thing I keep thinking about is I remember back in middle school learning about Chris Chan (if you don’t know who that is trust me you don’t want to) on the internet and vowing to myself to never end up like this guy and in some ways I feel like I did end up like him just not as bad. I probably could go on but I think I’m just going to stop here if you read all of this thank you, I mean my life’s not all doom and gloom I’m going out of town next weekend and I am looking forward to that. I just needed to anonymously vent I guess because it has been rough these past couple of days. And yes I know there are people out there who have it way worse than me, also I’m sorry about any poor punctuation or grammar.

He's on medication, but it seems the meds have actually made it worse. He had to spend one night in the hospital because he had a hugely severe crisis last week. He has a very supportive brother who's paying for his treatment, but his mother is the devil on earth, she thinks this whole situation is because he's lacking god in his life (she herself barely attend churches or seek good whatsoever) and she actually beats him up when he has crisis. 

They are very poor and only his older brother pays for everything in their house. His mother doesn't work and neither his wife, they both abuse the kids (17, 19 and 23 years old) often. The older brother stands against her and won't let her harm anyone when he's home, but he works all day to provide for the family. 

I told them to leave the house and go live by themselves but the older brother (who's also a good friend) told me that if they left her mom, she would probably live on the street, and she's also a suicidal so he doesn't feel like abandoning her is the right thing.

The poor older brother is going through hell right now. We work in the same place and he's unfocused to work and to study, but he can't afford to lose his job, otherwise everybody would be on the street.

985,Constant work panic attacks,1,11ti00s,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11ti00s/constant_work_panic_attacks/,1,"I’m having yet another panic attack over something I said at work today. In my head I find a way where what I said leads to me being fired, which can’t happen because I’m the bread winner for my family. It’s to the point where this has become so frequent I want to lay as low as possible at work. I don’t want to take promotions or be a leader or do anything meaningful because I’m so scared of saying the wrong thing. My job isn’t particularly stressful and is considered pretty secure, which is the entire reason why I took it because the same thing was happening at my last job. Every panic attack feels like it’s taking years off of my life. And now I see how it’s holding me back from professional growth as well. I’ve tried so many meds. Xanax is the only one that works but I can’t get a prescription to take it everyday. So I know I’ll wake up tomorrow and be right back where I am now. How can I stop this madness? What has worked for others who have been in similar situations?",1679030496.0
986,"i want to play video games with my bf bc he loves them, but they make me anxious and i dont enjoy it. how do i get around this?",1,11thwc1,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11thwc1/i_want_to_play_video_games_with_my_bf_bc_he_loves/,4,"First poster here, please excuse any mistakes

i get a lot of anxiety from (the thought of) playing video games. it's down to the point where i only enjoy ones where im playing solo and its a low stress environment. i find it fun, but i also find gaming exhausting because of this. my boyfriend enjoys video games, and i can tell it means a lot to him when we get to play together. however very rarely because i dont find it very fun. we kind of have opposite view points with gaming and he understands how it's not really my thing and doesnt really push it, but occasionally he will suggest we play something together light-heartedly (i know he is serious). he's very understanding how i don't like playing them, but i want to meet him in the middle and play with him for once because i know he would enjoy it alot. how do i get over myself? 

we've played a couple of games that work for me together, but i want to be able to play something he likes to play (more action based) 

tldr: bf who loves video games wants to play with me, i dont enjoy them but i want to play for the sake of him. how do i get over the anxiety?",1679030151.0
987,Alcohol & Anxiety,2,11td7qi,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11td7qi/alcohol_anxiety/,1,"For most of my life I was a HIGHLY anxious person. Then in 2020, I fell while riding my bike and hit my head pretty bad on the left-front side (prefrontal cortex) and was concussed. This resulted in my ADHD to have a HUGE flare up. Doctors basically explained that I probably lost a lot of my coping strategies and that I would have to rebuild them. BUT there was a silver lining, my anxiety got SIGNIFICANTLY better. Like almost gone. And with it my depression episodes stopped. 

It's now been almost 3 years since my concussion, and while my ADHD hasn't significantly improved, my anxiety seems mostly at bay. The only times I get anxiety and fall into circular negative thinking is when I have consumed alcohol for a few days in a row.

Anyway I spent most of the past 2 days  sick to my stomach because I botched trying to ask a girl to prom. I never even asked her.

Why am I like this.

989,self mutilation,4,11t74a6,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11t74a6/self_mutilation/,0,"I'm in my 40s, happily single parent, and struggling with intense anxiety despite meds (ssri) and weekly counseling.  I've tried emdr and really didn't like it though I am going to give it another go.  

Biggest sources of anxiety are my job (teacher and it is not a good fit for me) and family stress caused by my older brother bullying me since childhood.   The bullying has continued although he is nearing 50.  He joined several foster parent groups (he is not a foster parent, I am both a foster and adoptive parent) and bashed my parenting ability and status as a single parent.  The bashing was pretty bad--he created aliases to do this and he vehemently denies it.  I can stay away from him because he lives out of town but my parents seem to be pushing us to be closer together.  

I have been a self mutilator since age 7.  Specifically, I punch my legs, bite my hands when in the ""red zone"" of frustration or anger.  Nothing seems to help.  I've tried all the ideas and suggestions out there on the internet.  I'm afraid to admit the self mutilation to my counselor as I worry that it would affect my status as a foster and adoptive parent.  

Any suggestions?  I am working on finding a more suitable job, but the family situation really sucks.  Parents are old school and just want us to get along.  The only thing I can think of is severely limiting the time with them.  I wish I didn't take the anger out on myself.  Even if my brother or parent are being obvious a-holes, I blame myself.  

Any advice would be appreciated.  I'm struggling tonight.",1679002729.0
