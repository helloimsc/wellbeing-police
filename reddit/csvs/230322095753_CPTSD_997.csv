**BIPOC**

We recognize that healing communities such as [r/CPTSD](https://old.reddit.com/r/CPTSD) are not exempt from the insidious impacts of racism, whether overt or covert (for example, invalidating, minimizing, or microaggressive comments made by those with good intentions). In these cases, we encourage users to report the comments as Rule #3 violations. Because of the subreddit's high profile and open nature, this problem will continue to be with us, and we therefore can only promise a ""safe-ish"" environment for BIPOC.

i have to start treating myself as well as i treat my bun. i neglect my needs way too much and my relationship with my pet has actually shown me how much i put others before myself. and that i am way more capable and giving than i thought. i would never do what i’ve done to myself to anyone else. 

when i’m crying my bunny will come up to me and nudge me. i always try not to cry because i’m scared i’m freaking him out as rabbits are naturally skiddish. but his little nudge is so comforting.

2,My high school bully gave birth recently,158,11xqj0i,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11xqj0i/my_high_school_bully_gave_birth_recently/,31,"It baffles me that how can someone who ruined the life of a child delude herself into thinking that she can raise a child without any issues at all? Poor kid will be cursed with an delusional, evil bitch for a mother. 

Knowing her, she will also probably do that to her child too, except that the child does not have a high school bully, but he will be stuck with a ""mother"" who will probably use him as a punching bag from ages 0 to 18.

She was mean, yelled at me often, hit me on the head multiple times, threatened to kill me, made everyone in the class call me names, and threatened me into not reporting about the violence she did to me. Due to this, she was seen as your stereotypical ""popular girl"" who likes to pick on weaker people since they don't fight back and don't report. Nobody remembers it so well but me. She seemed to enjoy picking on me and me only since she did not pick on anyone else. I was in my pre-teens at the time and this shit still hurts. 

Yes, she may ""grow up"" and ""mature"", but a teenager that violent won't probably grow up to be a functional mother. It will only take some time and the stress of parenthood for her demons to haunt her again, and her poor kid will be forced to deal with it. She may be ""kinder"", but she will always be scum to me. 

It just sucks that these types of people get to experience ""normal"" lives while I want to rip my ovaries out and cut my fallopian tubes by my own because I am not capable to raise a child due to my own trauma, as much as I want to.",1679425009.0

5,"""Emotional Maturity"" - a checklist",34,11xt633,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11xt633/emotional_maturity_a_checklist/,20,"Hi y'all - i'm feeling mad anxiety about posting this, I'm worried the word 'maturity' is gonna make people feel some type of way, so please just know I'm a messenger, I found this useful. It's from the book ""Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents"" by Lindsay Gibson, and while I can't say I agree with everything she wrote in that book, I found this specific information to be helpful. 

So helpful, I typed it up as a bulleted list to put in my bathroom or someshit, so I never forget what I'm both seeking in others and aspiring to be. Tbh it'd be better represented as a list of spectrums from immaturity to maturity - qualities on the bottom list being on one end of the spectrum, qualities on the top list on the other (e.g. ""inconsistent and contradictory"" ------------> ""consistent and reliable""). But that's a project for another day. 

**Maturity awareness checklist:**

Qualities common to 'emotionally mature' people:

* Works with reality, rather than fighting it
* Can feel and think at the same time
* Is consistent, and thus reliable
* Doesn’t take everything personally
* Shows respect for your boundaries
* Has reasonable boundaries of their own 
* Gives back
* Flexible, compromises well
* Even-tempered
* Willing to be influenced by others
* Truthful
* Apologizes and makes amends
* Their empathy makes you feel safe
* Makes you feel seen and understood
* Sees you positively and remembers the good you
* Is playful and fun to be around
* Can use humor to strengthen bonds, not put others down
* Likes to comfort and be comforted
* Reflects on their actions and tries to change



Qualities common to 'emotionally immature' people:

* Rigid and single-minded
* Low stress tolerance
* Does what feels best in the moment
* Tends to be subjective, not objective
* Little respect for differences
* Egocentric, self-involved, self-preoccupied
* Self-referential, not self-reflective
* Needs to be center of attention
* Promotes role reversals, esp. in power dynamics
* Low empathy, emotionally insensitive
* Inconsistent and contradictory
* Strong defenses in place of self
* Fears feelings, avoids emotional work
* Focuses on the physical, not emotional
* Can be killjoys, hard to share positivity with
* Intense but shallow emotions
* Doesn’t experience mixed emotions
* Difficulties with conceptual thinking, esp. if feeling threatened
* Proneness to literal thinking
* Intellectualizing obsessively
* Hard to give to, literally and figuratively
* Resists repairing relationships
* Communicates by emotional contagion rather than directness
* Provokes anger
* Demands mirroring from others
* Sees roles as sacred
* Self-esteem rides on the compliance of others
* Seeks enmeshment, not emotional intimacy
* Plays favorites, treats others as replaceable
* Inconsistent sense of time and memory, esp. when feeling threatened
* Hard to hold accountable for past actions


IDK about you all but I'm a work in progress, lol. I am aspiring to be all of the things in that top list but I have learned from the best of the bottom, eyyyy. Anyway I found it hella interesting and helpful. Hope you do too. Have a nice day <3

she'd walk around and talk to me when she was completely nude sometimes especially when i was younger so i guess its not as bad??

8,"Police force that traumatised me found to be institutionally racist, misogynistic and homophobic.",143,11xdchq,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11xdchq/police_force_that_traumatised_me_found_to_be/,16,"TW: Mention of SA (no specific details given). 

I was the victim of SA and the police force that handled my case, the London Met, was absolutely abhorrant. I had CPTSD before the assault (from my childhood), then PTSD from the assault, plus new layers of trauma on top of all that from the way the police treated me during the investigation and trial. When I subsequently experienced SA again in the same city, I decided not to report it because of how traumatising it was to deal with the police the first time. 

Today, the results of massive inquiry were published that found the very same force to be institutionally racist, misogynistic and homophobic. The Mayor of London has accepted these findings. In a country that has increasingly become scary the past few years in regards to the erosion of human rights, I feel this report in my bones as a validation of my own and many other people’s trauma at the hands of the police. It feels like a massive layer of gaslighting has been removed from that terrible experience. 

Full details here for those who are interested, noting the article makes specific mentions of traumatic incidents & therefore should be opened with care:

9,Should we do a positive stories thread to give some hope for younger survivors?,38,11xn9ju,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11xn9ju/should_we_do_a_positive_stories_thread_to_give/,5,"It makes sense that we often talk about our difficult experiences here, and things we find troubling or that bring us down. And it's good we have a space to do that, I believe.

But something I've experienced and I've saw others have experienced too with cptsd is a lack of examples of older people with the condition thriving and living life's worth living.

Most of us here are probably in the thick of it, as well. It makes sense that those who seek community around cptsd do so because they are struggling or newly diagnosed or similar.

It's a complicated one for me to contribute to, as well. But I feel strongly that I could have a great life now. Personally, I find it difficult to share happiness as I feel it might insult or upset others or something. Can guess where that comes from... but at the same time I am worried of upsetting people if it leads to comparison if someone is feeling down, and that sort of thing.

But I'll share some of my story to start. I'm 26, and I became aware of having cptsd around maybe 18 / 19 years old. I won't lie that it has been a journey, but I feel I can have a great life now - if I want it, if I choose it. I feel like happiness is a choice for me now, I just have to take it. And I'm learning to take it.

My ""origin story"", lol, had plenty of shittiness in it. Let's just say abuse of all kinds, in the home, and what felt like others in society re-inforcing the abuse and gaslighting when I was desperately crying out to be helped. Went through some pretty awful things. SA, homelessness (although weirdly enjoyed that to an extent ngl, basically just went camping lmao idk), verbal, financial, physical, emotional, sexual abuse.

But there's been joy in life, too. And I'm out the tail end of healing. Even when I was in the thick of it at times, I had genuine happy moments when I had a group of friends I'd see every day, and got outside a lot, and had structure. Idk. It was one summer when I was younger, but it existed and it happened. There were moments of joy even when going through hell.

I was selectively mute. That's been a journey. At work recently I talk in meetings and I can actually enjoy it. I've been fighting and clawing for my life back and I'm fucking getting there. We can do that. It's possible for us to do that.

I no longer feel guilt over leaving my family. The guilt consumed me before, and was properly obsessive. I've processed it and it's not my fault. I know that now.

I have a good job in a really cool field working for a pretty decent company. I have my own flat and over the past few years have developed enough self love to make it more into a home. I'm living alone in the city too, which feels kind of cool I guess.

I've stopped the cycle of repeating abusive relationships and my attachment style (which is a core part of cptsd from my understanding) is going more towards secure.

I went a walk today and the sun started shining, and I felt simply happy in the moment.

Idk how helpful this is and I am rambling, ADHD is out of control today lol. Just... we can have good lives, it's possible.

I'm not saying it's all sunshine and roses, I've got shit to work through still. But that doesn't take away from the good stuff, now.

I'm not perfectly healed, far from it. But I feel now that I'm on the precipice of my life in a lot of ways. I'm forging my own life now. Idk. Hope this helps someone. Would love to hear any other positive stories of yourself or others overcoming terrible circumstances, etc. Idk, or moments that bring you joy.",1679418512.0
10,When people ask you/imply that you did something to deserve some kind of treatment they're self reporting,19,11xtovk,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11xtovk/when_people_ask_youimply_that_you_did_something/,7,"Normal people know that treating other people poorly is wrong and the perpetrator is a ""bad guy"".

But abuser's psyche is built in a different way. They need to find a scapegoat and are intently looking for a candidate. They won't show their colors to everyone but they do to someone who doesn't have a support system, isn't able to stand up for themselves or etc Only people who are abusive themselves or know them very well know that this is how their mind works.


Also,
I always thought that it was silly to judge people for liking some fictional characters until I found out that my co-worker/new friend liked Miranda Presley (from devil wears Prada). I also love that movie and find both main characters compelling/theyre well written but turns out  she had different reasons. It was because she thought she was entitled to treat other people like that and secretly wanted to behave like her. When I became closer to her I found out that she kinda treated her close friends like a demanding boss and I proudly couldn't fit her friendgroup. So now I'm cognizant of this when I meet new people",1679431141.0
11,Sick of feeling guilty about screen time,15,11xvfic,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11xvfic/sick_of_feeling_guilty_about_screen_time/,7,"I realize I have an internet addiction due to my CPTSD/potential ADHD, I spend a lot of time on screens. Last year I started trying to detox from screens but I was still dissociating 24/7, I was just stuck in my head instead of stuck inside a digital world. This advice telling me to get rid of my addictions did not help and just made me more stressed, perfectionistic, and dissociated. I’m sick of feeling guilty about my body’s chosen way to soothe its nervous system. I do yoga, I try to eat healthy, do grounding exercises. They only help marginally, I still get stuck in my head a lot especially when cooking food or in the shower or right after waking up. 

I don’t want to quit my addiction, people say “you have to face your feelings” but I’VE TRIED ALL THIS SHIT! I’ve tried recovering repressed emotions through freedom tapping and other stuff but all my feelings are buried and I have trouble accessing them a lot. I’m sick of listening to gurus online telling me how I should live my life. I can’t go back to therapy for a few months because of money and I don’t want to quit my addictions because they are my body’s way of keeping me safe. I often feel depressed when not on screens but quitting is too painful, I want to distract myself and work on healing myself slowly in the meantime, but I keep beating myself up for wasting my life behind a screen even though I’ve been using screens since I was 6 years old and quitting makes me feel worse. 

Anyone else feel this way? As long as I continue healing, is keeping my screen addiction really that big of a problem?",1679434437.0

13,I'm tired of pretending that my grandpa was a saint. He was actually a horrible person.,38,11xixwq,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11xixwq/im_tired_of_pretending_that_my_grandpa_was_a/,6,"
I (26, NB) have taken quite a long time to get over my grandpa's passing away back in 2015. And as of last year, I have come to terms with it. As of this year, I have also come to terms that he was an abusive, controlling, narcissistic, manipulative piece of shit. 

My grandpa used to spank me for every little thing that made him mad, even if I didn't know that what I was doing was wrong. The only reason he stopped spanking me was because I eventually grew stronger with time, and his strength faded with age. 

My grandpa was severely homophobic. He would go into these fits of rage every time he saw any LGBTQIA+ person on TV, and rant about how they were ruining America. He even made fun of my grandma for watching ""Ellen"", because Ellen was a lesbian, which prompted my grandma to not watch the show anymore. It was also said that the last time he saw his youngest brother, my grandpa got into a big fight with his youngest brother, because he had come out as gay shortly after their father died. He also threatened to shoot me if I ever came out as LGBTQIA+ when I was 11. Because of this (and my grandma's being a bible thumper, since my grandpa was an atheist), I don't plan on coming out as bisexual until after my grandma dies. 

My grandpa was also VERY racist. When I was 6, I had picked up some Spanish from watching ""Dora the Explorer"", and from playing with other kids my age, who grew up in Spanish-speaking households. When we went to this Mexican buffet, I told the waitress ""Thank you"" in Spanish, and she actually had a big smile on her face when I thanked her in Spanish. My grandpa was really red in the face. He bent down to my level and whispered aggressively, ""Young lady, we do NOT speak Spanish here. This is America. And here in America, we speak ENGLISH. I don't want to hear another word of Spanish come out of your stupid little mouth again."" Suffice to say, I've had a tougher time learning Spanish than I did with Japanese. 

My grandpa used to look at pretty girls on TV like a lecher. And then every time a gorilla walked on TV on the science channel, he'd point at it and be like, ""Hey, look. It's your grandma.""

When I was 6, I got into big trouble for bringing an imaginary friend to school. He ended up spanking me for it, and throwing away my favorite VCR tape as a punishment. And then when I was 8, I got spanked for singing ""Pancakes, pancakes, eat 'em with a fork"" on the school bus.

When I was 6, he yelled at me for telling a boy at Vacation Bible School that I had a big crush on that I wanted to marry him, and embarrassing the boy in the process. He told me off for being ""stupid"", and that if I did that again, I would be severely punished. This is why I only had 2 crushes during my teen years, and I can't bring up the courage to confess any feelings as an adult. 

My grandpa wouldn't let me eat anything with a cartoon mascot when I was growing up, because ""only spoiled brats eat those"". (He was also diabetic due to the Agent Orange killing his pancreas, so I wasn't allowed to eat anything sugary or anything that appeared in a commercial during a Saturday morning cartoon.) Hence why I have wasted every dollar on any food with a cartoon mascot as an adult, and on Chuck E. Cheese's. 

My grandpa often scolded me for getting any B's on my report card, claiming, ""You could have gotten all A-pluses. You just don't try hard enough."" And when I struggled with math, he'd get mad at me and be all, ""This is what happens when you don't pay attention in school, and play stupid games on your stupid Game Boy all day."" (I had a PS2 when I was a kid.)

At one point, when I was adamant about not helping him mix the concrete or starting a brush fire, proclaiming, ""I'M NOT YOUR SLAVE!"" He actually got super pissed, and yelled ""GO GET FAT!"" while kicking my butt to where I got knocked on the ground. That was the last time he laid his hands on me. 

&#x200B;

When my grandpa died, I was already living with my dad, who had taken full custody of me the year before. And living with my dad was just as hellish as living with my grandparents. 

At first, I'd go into big bouts of depression, because I missed him greatly, and because my grandma was super miserable without him. But over time, and especially this year, I eventually came to my senses, and realized that my grandpa was an abusive prick, and that my grandma was just as bad for allowing him to abuse me like he did, just because it was ""how he was raised"". 

Coming to those terms has brought me a lot of peace of mind, and has strengthened my resolve to move out as soon as possible. 

As soon as I move out of my uncle and aunt's place, and get my cat from my grandma, I'm going limited contact with her, keeping in contact only through Facebook messenger, and only visiting twice a year, such as for Christmas and the Family Reunion held every second Sunday of July.",1679409880.0
14,Told my dad I know everything,16,11xrey4,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11xrey4/told_my_dad_i_know_everything/,5,"TW: csa, incest, murder 

My dad doesn’t know that I know what he did to my sisters. A lot of my trauma was being a witness to my dad molesting my sisters. My parents split up. One sister moved with my mom, an emotionally neglectful and abusive person as well. She became a heroin addict at 13. She let grown men use her body. She is so mentally far gone. We thought she has schizophrenia, but I’ve been reading Surviving to Thriving and I read a part that some dissociate so hard that they don’t come back and that perhaps some pschizo people are actually just people with severe Cptsd. I do not know, but I am angered even more. 

My other sister and I stayed with my dad. We chose my dad which should say something about my mom. We got fed, had electricity, and didn’t live in filth. 

My dad never did anything to me, but he continued to rape my sister. She got pregnant and had his child at 15. She got into a relationship with a 21 year old dead beat and eventually he ended up killing my nephew when he was 10 months old. Then, my dad fled the country to Mexico. We’re Mexican and he was born there, so he stayed with family. 
Him leaving causes so much instability for us. We couch surfed and struggled. We got into toxic and abusive relationships with men and continued to be victims. 
I went no contact with my dad 3 years ago, but I never said anything to him. I have been ignoring his calls and texts. He still calls every week. 
Today I left him a voice message on messenger. 12 minutes of telling him what I know and how he ruined our lives.

It bothers me sm, because it makes me doubt my trauma and symptoms. I have re-experiencing symptoms, but I never remember the original traumatic situations.

On top of this I dealt with a lot of bullying and trauma through school. I was alone for many years. When I was about 10 years old, my mother told us that she had always wanted girls and that we were not which she had expected. She now has a new partner and two girls. We are both in our adult hood now but I’m only just dealing with the  mourning process. A lot of people say that I never got to experience my child hood. Sometimes it gets more difficult every day. Other days I’m ok. I just don’t know how a kid could go through all of that. I became suicidal at nine years old and the feeling never really went away. I don’t think it ever will.

17,"I decided to finally save up for cosmetic surgery. Can't tell anyone, because they'd think I'm vain, when in reality...the truth is so much worse.",5,11xyyhn,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11xyyhn/i_decided_to_finally_save_up_for_cosmetic_surgery/,5,"Since I was a kid, I had issues with sugar. I have memories of pimples since I was a Kindergartenkid. The shit got worse as a teen. But in comparision to other teen-girls, I never learned hygiene. My abusive mother would throw expensive creams at me, and all in all made it seem like I was attacking HER for how I looked, so in my depression & learned helplessness, I started to care even less about it.

Now my entire face is filled with acne scars. Though they are not as horrible like other scars, they fuck up my life consistently. Be it makeup, or otherwise. However, the biggest reason I am saving up is...because of homicidal/suicidal thoughts they're giving me.

I sound nuts. I know. But these little scars created a personal ""Buffalo Bill"" complex in me. Like...you have no idea how this shit wore me down over the years. It was not just these comments of ""Hey Kolben, you like warts?"", or ""Jesus, lay off the cookies"". No matter where I went, people would remind me of my uneven skin. My mother would point out girls with smooth faces (""Her mother must be proud"") and after a while, I started staring at them automatically on my own. I started getting intrusive thoughts when I saw my face in the mirror. It's weird to explain how I feel. There is just this...desire, of wanting to cut my face off.  Like, I'd be having dreams about me just pulling my face off like a facial mask and putting someone else's face on. I think I even tried ""shaving"" my skin with a knife, or razor, but it ended up hurting too much.

I always thought makeup would do the trick. I've seen burn victims getting expert makeup and look decently normal -so why can't I? But in the end, all in all I ended up was finding tutorials in which the girls would always need to use products just to prep the skin. Like...8 different highly specific creams JUST to reduce redness. Little bottles each $45. I lauged when I saw the first vid, but after 4 I was crying.

Surgery has been on my mind for years. However, I scoffed it off for the same reasons anyone looks down at plastic surgery. I didn't want to look ""vain"". I saw all those easy cases of botching and women who were praised as ""cool"" for owning up to their imperfections.

But...I'm done.

This shit is nothing a ""Aw, you look perfect just as you are <3"" could fix. It's not that I just want to feel attractive for guys, or society or...whatever. I also know that I will never be able to have baby-smooth skin. I will continue to have breakouts. But again: That's not the point.

I need to *feel* like I have a start-over. I *want* the feeling of my skin burning away. Like my skin is somewhat ""reborn"". I can't get myself to even care for any skin-care (not even washing my face regularly), because I just feel everything is already destroyed.

So yeah. Sorry. Had to get this off my heart in a trusted space.",1679441474.0

Even then, I like to think of it of had having no effect on my life, but recently the memory has been surfacing more. Ive never looked back on this memory and thought of it as trauma, I have no feelings for the memory at all.

But I’ve developed many defence mechanisms from trauma / emotional abuse and neglect. Like the following examples,

- Easily losing my sense of self when someone likes me, feeling like I owe them something, instead of it being a 50/50 balanced relationship.

- At the same time I easily feel disgust/push people away when they get too close emotionally/express interest. It’s way easier for me to navigate relationships with people who are a bit emotionally distant or who set firm boundaries. When (I feel like) they’re “clingy” and want my attention, I feel suffocated by it. 

- Feeling very little attraction to people in the first place. I’m pretty much aroace/hyposexual, but I was capable of feeling attraction to others when I was a teenager, so I’m still exploring if something’s mentally blocking me.

- Have mostly avoided dating in general. Have felt too “alien” and just not ready for it. I tried a dating app once but it felt pretty useless since I didn’t find anyone attractive. At least to me I don’t see the point of dating if I’m not drawn towards the other (and as said, I know what the feeling of attraction feels like, but I haven’t felt that in years). 

As the years pass by without much progress in therapy I feel more frustrated and hopeless. When you search online for what to do in order to improve/heal in terms of relationships, they always point you to therapy and basically call you broken. It’s so discouraging.

(I have been confirmed as not having bpd by three separate mental health professionals- two therapists and one psychiatrist who all said I have cptsd).

I am feeling really scared and activated over this appointment tomorrow with this psychiatrist who without discussing this at all with me randomly added a bpd diagnosis to our last encounter. I asked him via MyChart to remove it and he did but he said “we would discuss it further at my next appointment” which is tomorrow.

I slapped him thinking it was going to help me get over my feelings of being hurt, instead it comes back as a flashback and there's no way to take it back. I thought it'd make me hate him and I'd forget him and forget our relationship and move on. 

Every single time I think I'm okay, I am actually not. I even purposefully talked to my abusive mother and people who'd reaffirm my suspicions then I'd fight with him because I'd be even more worried and paranoid of his intentions. 

He has picked me up drunk and high a million times. He has came to me any time I was going through something bad and never hesitated once to help. He calmed me down during all of my breakdowns.

Context;

I was NC with her from about 18yrs old to 20yrs old. At 18 I moved out in the middle of the night after she verbally abused me and threatened physical abuse.

I reached out to attempt to have a relationship that I had always wanted around 20yrs old. This was very surface level and quite painful for myself to uphold for the last 6 years.

She was a verbally abusive drunk and my childhood was full of chaos. From her driving my siblings and I to school drunk, to allowing the men she was dating to be incredibly inappropriate with my sister and I, CPS visits and the neighbours calling the police multiple times. I am beginning to recall memories I have clearly repressed and am saddened to realize how little she protected us and in turn how little I protect myself as a result.

Today, I stepped in front of my partner to not only defend him and explain it was my choice to not communicate with her, but also to tell her that she did not deserve an answer. I shut the door forcing her to step back. I could hear her scoff about how I don't want a family then. About 1 minute later she texted me stating how dare I do this to her again and that she is cutting me out for good.

I don't really have much to say.  My whole life I have felt like the dynamic between me and my dad has been off.  Things like always feeling like I had to ""tuck"" my body when we hugged to shelter my intimate parts or feeling like my dad sometimes treated me like his wife more so than my mom.  My darkest fear growing up was that if I were to ever have kids or get married that ""I would love them too much to prevent them from raping me.""  I grew up thinking rape was inevitable and that it came from those you love.  Similarly, I grew up with a deep resentment towards my mother for always teaching me to be wary of strangers rather than family members.  I don't honestly have memories of anything, just thoughts.  Things like my dad telling an innocent story and telling my mother ""there are stories that even you haven't heard"" and my mind immediately thinking he was referring to rape and my body just starting to boil with anger and resentment.   

Two years ago I finally started considering the fact something may have happened.  Once I started to accept that, everything was terrible for a few months.  I spent hours laying in bed dissociating, shaking and sweating and basically getting high off of how stressed I was.  There were so many nights I could not sleep due to feeling like something was forcefully penetrating me.  It was like hell.   Nights were full of nightmares, and waking life was full of sensations that made me feel like I was reliving something that I honestly don't know if ever happened.   I felt so sure it did until I found out months ago that my grandma was raped by her father.  My grandma (probably due to this trauma) accused my father of sexually abusing me (this accusation was just between my grandma and my dad, it did not leave the house if that makes sense).   I was probably 10 when this happened.  I didn't know what she accused him of, all I knew was that my grandma was no longer allowed to visit us.  Now that I know her story and do know what she accused him of, I wonder if maybe my dad just internalized what she said, and maybe I did know what she accused him of and internalized it as well.  One of the reasons I thought maybe he did hurt me was because he was always so defensive of sexual abuse.  When my father caught me cutting myself as a kid I remember his first response was to scold me for making him look like a rapist and that ""only girls whose fathers rape them do that.""  I was extremely depressed at the time and I honestly thought he wanted me to kill myself because after he discovered I was self-harming, the following months consisted of yelling at me for hours about how much of a burden and embarrassment I was to him.  I also think he tried convincing my mom I was schizophrenic and convinced her I needed a therapist.  I believed this was his way of discrediting me if I ever did come out saying he abused me.  But maybe he truly was just defensive because of the accusal. I also wonder with epigenetics being a thing, if it's possible some of my grandma's trauma was passed down to me and that that's why I have always had this fear of my father and that my fear of him and his internalization of what she said just made our behaviors feed into this sexual dynamic if that makes sense.  Or maybe me considering all of this is just my form of denial.  I'm not sure.  I feel lost.   Despite all the mess I've shared about him yelling at me and everything else, our relationship feels pleasant now.  Awkward, since I still am weary of being sexualized, but pleasant nonetheless.  I enjoy playing family games with him and spending time with my parents now.  It's not my favorite thing to be alone with him, but I don't dread it, and I'm able to act like a normal daughter and hang out and laugh with him. I feel like I live in a normal home with a normal family.  I still have present triggers tho.  Things like breaking out in screams during sex or needing to sit down while in the shower because some days I get overwhelmed with sexual dread.   it possible to make up triggers?  I just need to share this.  I would feel so guilty for thinking he may have hurt me if he never did, but I guess I might not ever know.  If anyone has any insight or similar experiences they would like to share I would appreciate it.  Also for the record, since i mentioned depression, I just wanted to say that I am happy now and fortunately do not deal with depression too often.",1679436310.0
41,My dad laughed at me when I told him I was abused,2,11y02yq,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11y02yq/my_dad_laughed_at_me_when_i_told_him_i_was_abused/,2,"tw// physical and sexual abuse

I’m so disgusted with myself right now, I feel like I’m rotting.

My dad made me sit down and talk to him today about how my mom found my journal yesterday and read that I wrote she was abusing me. My mom has been crying nonstop and I’ve been feeling really shitty about it. 

I’ve made another post on this sub if you want the full details.

My dad gave me this speech. Don’t ever call CPS, my parents love me unconditionally, don’t be an idiot, etc. I was feeling like he didn’t really grasp how serious this all is and how much it’s hurting me. I asked if he knew about the time my mom threw a metal water bottle at my face and bruised my nose (a really horrible memory), and he said yes.

“…and?” I asked.

He shrugged. I asked if he believed me and he started laughing, saying “alright, for arguments sake let’s say this did happen.”

“So you don’t believe me.” I said. He said I might’ve perceived things one way or interpreted them, but I need to get over it. And he was laughing while he said this, like it was a joke.

I was stunned. I told him, it really hurts that you’re laughing when I’m talking about a legitimately traumatic event. He still wouldn’t take me seriously.

I sat in silence for a bit, in shock, while he talked. Then I summoned up the courage to ask, “would you have the same attitude, would you still be laughing, if I said I had been molested in preschool?”

I don’t remember much of it, but it’s something I have been speculating for a while. I remember exhibiting a lot of the signs of sexual abuse as a child and being told to stop, and I have a really specific memory of just feeling awful around this one specific teacher, just feeling violated. It all makes sense, and I had never told anyone before.

He looked at me for a second, then said “I don’t even know what to say to that.” Then he turned away, changing the subject. “Anyways…”

My heart shattered. I can’t even look at him now, or at myself. I feel so damaged, and gross. I want to scream. I hate myself, and how people have ruined me.",1679443819.0

Sometimes I forget about those things when I’m looking back on my childhood because they don’t stand out any less than multiple other horrifying and life changing things that happened. 
It’s extremely exhausting going through life having nightmares on a regular basis. But then also having to spend time thinking about whether the nightmare brought up some lost memory or if it’s just something your brain put together based on the other things happening around those times. 
Did I have a dick being shoved in my face as a very young child or did I not? Literally having smell associations and never fucking realizing it until I was huffing whipped cream? Honestly doesn’t make much of a difference. It would just be one more thing to hyper-fixate and ruminate on until I lie awake til 9am.

Honestly they’re just a bunch of bitches and I’ve had it with them but I can’t quit because I need money and can’t look for a new job right now because I’m dealing with a physical illness.

I guess if I had to think about why I’m having these thoughts it’s because these people are hell bent on making my life miserable and I can’t get away from them. This situation is triggering a very powerful and overwhelming memory/feeling of wanting to lash out and hurt my abusers but at the same time not having any power to stop them from continuing to abuse me. 

I feel powerless in my situation and my physical illness is keeping me stuck in a pace where I literally don’t feel well enough to get on the job search. Like I said OBVIOUSLY I’m not going to act on it, I was just wondering if anyone has ever had these thoughts and what helped.

I’m not embarrassed of it in my personal life and I do share about it with close friends but it’s obviously pretty heavy stuff so I don’t advertise and especially so to strangers. 
I feel like it’s also worth mentioning that it wasn’t just secretly traumatic- it was outwardly traumatic as well so it’s not like I could show a photo of my family and just leave out bits that I want to, it would be like a bit like a kid in foster care, I moved around and changed caretakers and I’m scared shitless that if I put a photo in this presentation, someone will ask about who X is or where Y lives or why Z happened.

So with that as background- I joined a new job and they tap an employee every fortnight to give a informal presentation on their life up until that point. I saw one yesterday and saw another employees in our file storage system and they are VERY personal- childhood photos, siblings, parents, locations, etc. and I’m absolutely panicked on what to do. My knee jerk reaction is to “make it my own” by diving into a hobby or something but after seeing theirs, I’m scared that it’ll just be painfully obvious that I’m super off topic. I could definitely try to curate some photos that don’t reveal anything I don’t want to talk about to a crowd of strangers but that feels horrible because its going to feel like lying as I’m essentially crafting a false narrative about who I am and where I came from- I also am scared that if I keep it vague, people will ask prying questions as that’s what happened in the last presentation.

The panic is making me feel like I’m doomed to either 1) awkwardly deflect personal questions or 2) give answers that people are going to regret asking the questions for (e.g. where do your parents live now, why did you move to that place). How do I handle this?!",1679431911.0

Trigger warning for DV, child abuse, trafficking, SA

Sometimes I wonder if it's hard for some to understand just how much trauma I've been through, based on the way I am now. I've been thinking about making this post for awhile, and now I feel ready to share my story. 

I was raised in a house with two absentee parents. My father is an angry narcissistic pothead, and my mother was an alcoholic during my childhood. We were abused and neglected, and two of us children were molested by a neighborhood older child. My sister wet the bed until she was 14 and my parents did nothing.  I was the scapegoat though. 

My dad pounded into my head growing up that I'd never amount to anything. He told me once (at 11) that I belonged out on the street, barefoot and pregnant. That statement ran through my head on repeat for over 2 decades.

As a teenager, I ran away from home, and ended up living in a crack house, where they trafficked me to ""earn my keep."" I did it enthusiastically, because by then I'd realized I could get affection through sex, so I felt like if it could bring me money too, well great 😬

I became pregnant at 16, with twins, and I thought it was the best thing that could ever happen. I felt like I could finally get the love I so desperately craved through my babies. But, I ended up hospitalized on bed rest for the last 3 months of my pregnancy, and because I couldn't look for a place to live, they were taken into foster care and eventually adopted. This sent me down an extremely dark path emotionally. I was completely unprepared for them taking my children, although I realize now it was for the best. 

My dad threw me out three days before I turned 18, while I was still reeling from the effects of having and then losing my children. I was desperate for love while at the same time feeling undeserving of it, and I got pregnant again a few months later, to my oldest daughter. Her name is Hope, and she's my light. But, I betrayed my obligation to her when I met my ex husband, something for which I'll never forgive myself. 

He was perfect. The most caring and wonderful man I'd ever met, right up until I was 4 months pregnant with his child. That's when he showed me his true colors. I remember getting married at the justice of the peace, make up covering bruises on my face, 9 months pregnant, and wishing I had someone I could call to save me from this mess. 

I don't remember much past that, but I do have journal entries from right after we split, 3 years later, detailing what he did to me. I'm still grateful that they're just words on a page to me. He, well, tortured me, physically, sexually, emotionally. I would wake up at night with all 360 pounds of him on top of me, because consent didn't matter to him. I was his wife, HIS, I no longer had ownership over my own body. And the worst part was, he convinced me this was true. He also convinced me that if I could just be a good enough wife, pray hard enough, I'd be able to ""rid him of his demons"" and restore our marriage. Yes, I really did believe that his abuse was a sign I wasn't godly enough 🙄 sigh

He actually ended up leaving me. I used to hate this fact, it felt like proof of how weak I was. DV survivors tell stories of how they had to escape, but in my case, I was discarded, left for trash, and when it happened I was terrified that I couldn't survive without him. After he left he told me god ""saved"" him from me, and that I'd never be able to make a man happy. 

I wish this was the end of the abuse I went through, but no. I went from being in an abusive marriage, to being in an abusive friendship, a different and more bizarre kind of horror that I still have trouble wrapping my mind around. She isolated me, turned professional relationships against me, and told my friends I was hiv positive and out on the streets selling myself.

I think by the time I met her, I was so deeply programmed into compliance and pretending everything was okay, that I just couldn't see it. By then I thought all of humanity was evil, like, people couldn't help themselves but be abusive. I wasn't even mad about it.

 I was friends with her for six years. She would hold me hostage inside my own bedroom, physically restraining me at times. I can't count the number of times I had to flee from my own home just to get away from her, and she'd follow me down the street screaming that I was suicidal. There were times when I even got so desperate to get her away from me that I'd threaten her with knives. I just didn't know what else to do.  

She'd steal my phone and message friends I'd meet inappropriate and sexual things, sometimes pretending to be me, and other times telling them she ""just wanted to warn them"" about what they were getting themselves into by being friends with me. She ruined every Birthday of mine, having meltdowns and telling me they were all my fault. I still can't comprehend why I didn't get away from her sooner. Looking back through my healed lens I see so clearly exactly what she was, and what she was trying to do, but while I was in it, I couldn't see it at all. 

At this point, I believed I was the problem. I thought I must be a narcissist, I'm the common denominator. I was worthless garbage, I belonged out on the streets barefoot And pregnant, and now I had a new statement running through my head on repeat: I could never make a man happy. I started doing hard drugs, and I went into sex work - consensually this time - because I felt like that was the only way I'd ever have ownership over my own body. 

And then came my boyfriend. I'd actually met him almost 18 years earlier, when I was a patient in the ER where he worked as a nurse. Funny, I still remember that, and he said he wanted to ask for my number but he was afraid I'd report him. But this time we met outside of work. He asked me out on a date, and I ended up staying with him for a whole week.

When I met him, I told him I'd never date again. I also said ""I sleep around, if you don't like it don't talk to me. I'd been saying that to men for six years at that point, and I fully expected him to leave me alone after that. But he didn't. He stuck around, kind of waiting on the sidelines of my life, being dependable and consistent, slowly but surely earning my trust. For a YEAR.

During that first year I was volatile and combative any time the idea that he cared about me ran through my mind. I put him through hell, because I believed, absolutely, that if I let him in, he'd change and become like my ex husband. And even after that first year, I still had my moments where I became so afraid he would change that I convinced myself it was happening.

At some point during this time, I got caught with drugs. When I got arrested, he borrowed money from his boss to bail me out. I remember this being the first time when I actually allowed myself to believe that he might actually care about me, and it was shocking. After court, they put me on probation, and I needed an address, so I moved in with him. It was that or my parents, and, well, fuck no. 

The first day I moved in with him, I had my first full fledged panic attack. I was on my way to do a urine at the probation office, and I found myself on the street, unable to even walk. He had to carry me to the bus stop. I ended up going inpatient, and they put me on meds to help my anxiety. Part of my problem was I didn't feel safe sleeping next to him, that took another year to finally go away. 

This was where I finally began to really comprehend just how fucked up I was, just how traumatized I was. I had this wonderful, safe person who loved me immensely, and I couldn't even enjoy it because of how afraid I was of just about everything. I had started therapy, and I set about trying to at least learn how to hide this from him. Heh, I don't know that I ever learned that, but I did manage to heal, which was so surprising, I can't even verbalize how shocked I was. 

Two years later, my oldest daughter made allegations about my ex husband that really set me back healing wise. I hated myself for the way this impacted me, I felt like I should be strong for her, but I just couldn't. I relapsed for a few months, but then I went inpatient again to try and get clean, but this time i got so much more. 

The doctor offered me Lithium, and somehow, someway, it took away my fear. I woke up the next day and it was gone, poof! It was amazing. It was at this point where I made some of my biggest breakthroughs. I discovered some toxic behavior patterns that had been placing a strain on my relationship, and I managed to work through some of the worst of my trauma. And most importantly, I learned how to forgive myself for all the bad choices I made because I wasn't taught how to make good ones. 

I'm so happy now. If you take nothing else away from this story, I want you to know that happiness is possible to achieve after trauma. You can find your place in the world, I promise you can.",1679425425.0

I thought this stemmed from a religious upbringing and a couple of incidents in college, but recently I recalled a “dream” I had as a kid: an adult man was instructing me to perform oral sex on him. I woke up feeling terrified and disgusted and the taste in my mouth- I remember that taste wouldn’t go away for the whole day. I had no idea what oral sex was and had never seen an adult penis as far as I know, but as far as I remember looking back I was able to accurately imagine it.

I realized that this is the sensation I get when trying to do oral with my husband, the taste and fear and everything rush back as soon as I start. I can still remember the dream as if I just had it, but it must have been around 25 years ago.

58,Considering reconnecting with people from my traumatic past. Good or bad idea? Experiences? [TW: mentioning CPS],1,11y2oc5,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11y2oc5/considering_reconnecting_with_people_from_my/,1,"Hi friends! I (28F) am considering reconnecting with my old CPS caseworker. Although I feel it could help me heal and move on, I'm slightly scared of 'awakening' or worsening my CPTSD. What is your view on this? Have you done something similar?  


A little background: mom and dad divorced when I was 9. Mom had some generational trauma on board and it was worsened by the abusive relationship with my dad. I lived with mom and she could get quite abusive. After stuffing things inside for years I've started working on my CPTSD and healed for a big part. It's not easy but I feel like I've come really close to living a 'normal' life and achieved things I couldn't dream of back then :)  


My country's version of CPS was involved at one time when I was about 14 and one of my caseworkers / investigators was this lovely man. I'd only seen him a handful of times but the talks we had stuck with me. After being hurt so many times by these cold power-hungry adults he was such a kind, respectful gentle breeze. There were a lot of things I really wished I could tell him but didn't because I was protecting my mother back then and didn't want to be taken away.  
   
I remembered his name and traced him on the internet. He works as a childhood therapist now. I'd love to visit him for some closure but I'm quite insecure about it. Aside from being good / bad for my CPTSD, would it be a weird move towards the caseworker?",1679449491.0

I've been able to hold a job (or 2, or 3) since the age of 10. I got good grade in highschool and college. I had my own apartment for 2 years and was decently independent despite my underlying co-depencey issues. 

Basically I was pretty ""successful"" in regular society until I moved in with my bf that I was long distance with for 5 years last year. I was even slightly excited for my future and confident in my skills at that point in my life. 

Once I moved in with my bf last year, he became really mentally abusive. And looking back on it, he's always been this way and I excused his bad behavior for years. It was also easier to ignore because we were long distance for the majority of our relationship. 

Ever since my old therapist pointed out that my life was surrounded by people with narcissistic tendencies last year, I kind of freaked out and fell into a deep depression where I started ignoring all of my friends and family. 

I felt like my entire life was a lie, and the people I loved dearly were all just putting up a facade. I started questioning what that must make me if all of the people around me had these bad behaviors. I started hating myself even more than usual and fell into a catatonic state where I barely left the bed for weeks on end. I didn't have a job and my bf financially supported me for the past year. 

Now I'm absolutely losing it on my boyfriend, I've turned into a monster when we argue. I feel so stuck and anytime I bring up my concerns in a nice constructive way, I get put down and he even uses the concerns against me to continue doing them. My old therapist thinks he has covert Narcissistic tendencies. I can definitely see them now.

 I feel like a rat stuck in a cage that he keeps poking until I lash out and he can blame me for being ""crazy"". It doesn't excuse my behavior at all though. I don't recognize myself anymore, I have never been full of rage and my body is telling me I need to run far away. I pushed all of my friends away because they have strong narcissistic tendencies, and I don't know if my family would be better to go to or not. They would probably make my mental state even worse than it is right now.

I don't have the mental strength to find a job, I feel like a ball of anxiety. I also have a warrant out for my arrest because I forgot about a court date on a ""fix it ticket"" ( I got pulled over for a broken taillight that I fixed that night). I feel really stuck and hopeless and I don't know how or where to start on this journey.

I left a severely abusive relationship over 12 years ago, I didn’t start processing the trauma of said abuse until probably 4ish years ago.

However one thing I never really brought up and haven’t gotten advice or counseling on is the physical bodily reactions I can have due to my PTSD.

I don’t know if these are considered flashbacks or not. For instance though, my husband tonight yelled at our dogs very loudly to stop fighting( they were fighting so loudly he wasn’t going to be able to just tell them to stop like he usually would ) and he didn’t warn me he would be screaming and did it right in my ear. Mind you my husband is extremely mindful of my triggers and has been a huge part of my healing. If he knows he has to yell for whatever reason he always warns me and has me cover my ears but this time he didn’t. My body immediately went into a physical reaction. I couldn’t hold back my tears and I started violently shaking and went into a panic attack, but I didn’t feel scared, threatened, or upset in any way. It was just my body feeling that way if that makes any sense. I have had physical reactions before but almost always I feel scared, threatened etc before/during but not this time. 

My husband profusely apologized and helped me do a grounding exercise to ease me out of my panic attack but I still feel extremely shook up physically. I haven’t even had a physical PTSD like reaction in a very long time so this caught me pretty off guard.

After feeling like something was wrong all of my life, I’m starting to get some footing on what it actually is. 

It’s looked like Pure-OCD for years. I’m starting to think that intrusive thoughts/rumination about current issues or magical thinking, are really just emotional flashbacks. Or fear of not having control like I felt my whole life until 20. I was emotionally abused by family. The second I left home, I just felt like there was a hole in me. Couldn’t enjoy things. Could never be myself. Could never trust myself. Risky behavior, typical CPTSD stuff. 

I’ve finally found a great therapist. She’s helped me connect dots. I got a CPTSD diagnosis last year but I couldn’t make the connection myself. 

We will be doing EMDR once we find the right starting point. 

My question is—has EMDR helped you? Has anyone had co-morbid OCD about things not related to trauma? Could these be emotional flashbacks? Anything even *really* small that could be an issue gets blown up, feels huge and very real. Even if it isn’t happening. 

Edit: it just feels like something is wrong 24/7. Been this way as long as I can remember. My brain picks something—whether it’s where I am in life, my friendships, my identity, something is always a target. I just want peace and to enjoy my life as is.

Funny how people don't seem to be able to transfer that understanding to society. What if mental illness is a symptom of a sick society? 

I once argued that human rights don't exist. Essentially, the powerful create struggle. ""Human rights"" are the result of, and reaction to, the bourgeoisie losing control of society. We wouldn't need to discuss it if the struggles that led to the charters were non-existent.

Most of us should have read Van Der Kolk, any trauma informed therapist will encourage it. Interesting how learning about trauma, and learning protective skills, reconditioning ourselves to the world that repeatedly puts us back into survival mode... do you get where I'm going with this? The world is sick, not us!

Every good day is a blessing, we know this. Every week with more good than bad is a good week. So if the planet is full of people trying to do better then the world is a better place. 

We're fed so much crap, I can't handle tiktok after finding out the Chinese version is educational... my FYP encouraged mental illness! How am I meant to have a healthy mind when I live in ""haha I'm sad too"" land? Information is Beautiful had an infographic at the start of Covid... it was posted two years ago. At that point, Covid already had more media mentions than anything in history. Regardless of your opinion, there was fear mongering.

So now we're facing housing, food, power, water, money, everything struggles. None of these are new, and the fact there's potato crisis but KFC still has chips tells me everything I need to know. Watch Tomorrowland. We're being fed our doomsday. Elevate your mental!

The population hit 8 billion people in December... and no one fucking cares!!! To put it into perspective, there are at least four times as many living humans now than there was 100 years ago. The world is brutal and we're too slow catching up to it.

More people stuggle with poor mental heath than don't, and those who don't are either fiercely ignorant or blissfully unaware. Over thinking is only bad in a world that discourages individual thought.

The statistics are clear, I'm not repeating them to back up my claims because I encourage research... trauma is the leading cause of every issue within society. Not treating society will lead to the death of it. 

So those removed from society, the society we're forced to uphold, are left floating and lost. Some find meaning in artistry or work, but most spend every waking moment cursing life. Life is terrible, death should not be the absolute solution. What happens in a moment of suicidality? The mistakes build up, everything you are is staring you in the face and comparing that to who you want to be hurts. I'm sure there are plenty of other reasons, but it feels like the only way out.

I'd rather call Ghostbusters if I'm suicidal than an ambulance. I'm more trauma informed than most of society so why is it that society keeps trying to tame me? Why is itbtrying to tame our glorious minds?

Our struggles create domething beautiful and most of the traumatised lean into artistry. Philosophers and artists were once regarded as some of the most influential and important people within society. The free thinkers.

Work starts at 9am, you can't afford to fix your car. Food is more expensive and there's always the looming threat of eviction. There are wars, famine, plagues; you've had people coming at your soul too. If you're mentally stable then tell me how? What do you do to treat the symptoms of a sick society?

I fell for a straight partnered monogamous dude due to the mindbaffling circumstance that he kept being genuinely nice to me. As my body and mind revolt in response to any positive notion that others express about me, I become dependent on their opinion, attention, and closeness to them. 
And as I've noticed, I intervened. I told him I wanted to be friends with him in a decade, and for that I might need some distance. This hadn't worked before, but it helped before. I was left lonely, but reasonably stable.
Couldn't have guessed the emotional privilege and.. love this dude has for me. 'Let's do the opposite and get as close as we can. I'll give you everything you'd need in a relationship from hugs to a shoulder to cry on, emotional connection and attention. All except for romance and sex.'
Psychotraumatology proposes interpersonal cPTSD symptoms are both characterized and maintained by the inability to establish distinct borders. So in this situation, I should've known better than to euphorically accept the offer of an idealistic person who doesn't know what they're getting into. And now after weeks of flashbacks and instability, it will hurt thrice as much to explain to him that this won't work out, and probably won't either for our future friendship in a decade. But it's fine; he wouldn't have saved me, and that's exactly what the hopeful traumatized part in me needs to understand for good. Whatever you keep hoping for, hopeful hurt child, no one is guaranteed to save you, commit for you, or be able to give you what you're missing. Conversely, we will still regain all that, with some more work and by meeting the right people in the right circumstance. This was a fun intermezzo, but it seems we need to take a traditional way, together.

I (24M) have an elder sister (30F), who abused me since I was \~6 until she moved to a different country  when I was approximately 17.  The abuse started when I was a little kid and she would slap me here and there when I refused to listen to her or when I refused to do things the way she wanted them done.  I don't remember when it escalated from a single slap to multiple slaps to senseless beatings. I distinctly remember multiple instances when I was thrashed on the smallest things like not doing my homework on time. I was hit when my parents weren't home so they wouldn't know. I never hit her back because I was too afraid of what she would do to me if I did.I couldn't cry because she would hit me more.

Apart from physically being abusive, My sister also berated me from time to time about the way I do things, the way I live my life, about my appearance. The one-way constant berating and condescending comments are still a pretty much active part of our interactions. I was scared to talk to my parents about all of this because I was told by my sister to stay quiet about these things (OR ELSE!!).  I never talked about this to any of my friends because I wasn't sure if I was overreacting or if it was just normal in a sibling relationship. 

I spent my teenage years, being depressed because I thought it was my fault and that I deserved to be treated that way. I started having suicidal thoughts which took a lot of courage and help to get out of, until I moved to the same country as my sister last year when the berating started again. She doesn't hit me anymore probably because I'm older now, but I'm still scared she someday will. She leaves no chance to put me down or make me feel inadequate. All my friends seem to think the reason that I become closed and timid around my sibling is because I respect her, when I am just terrified of her in general. I have anxiety attacks when she calls me up. If I'm in her presence my response is to start walking on eggshells to make sure she has nothing to berate me over. 

I still have a very low self-esteem and fear of abandonment. I fear people don't like me and I fear everyone just keeps me around for convenience. I don't know if this is a direct effect of this or a separate issue altogether. But I still am afraid of talking about this to my parents or my friends because I'm afraid that they won't understand or that they'd think that I'm overreacting.

So I recently “came out” as having CPTSD. I am taking time off work due to burnout (this is how I figured out I have been masking). Anyways, a few friends know what I’m going through (I don’t have a ton of friends to begin with which is common for us folks) but one friend sent me a tik tok video about dealing with your life difficulties on your own and not looking for friends for support because it’s your own battle to fight (to which I mostly agree but this seemed passive aggressive?) And others know my situation and pretend like everything is fine as usual or just send texts like “hope you’re doing well” without actually asking how I’m doing. I appreciate the sentiment but it feel like no one wants to “deal” with me and are doing what makes them feel like they are doing the right thing while keeping it light. I get that trauma is uncomfortable and mental illness can be too. I wish they knew I’m not going to inform them of everything that’s happened to me or vent for hours on end. I want to be treated like a normal person and not feel alone or like a pariah. The same friend told me she doesn’t know how I could function without her support. I know Im probably part of the problem because CPTSD behaviors can be friend killers, but at the same time it has only been the last few months where I haven’t been able to mask.

Or I make one mistake when they've made that same one thousands of times, and I'm suddenly the worst person in the world? It's not fucking fair.

I'm sorry if this sounds like angsty whining, I'm just fucking angry at the universe. Every single aspect of my life has been terrible, and it only continues to get worse. I feel like I'm cursed or something. I don't feel like I'm allowed to feel emotions because when I do, someone gets angry. Either real people or the universe itself.

A few months ago I was having a bit of a breakdown, which turned into one of those fake happy moods where your brain tries to ignore everything that's wrong with your life, and as soon as that happened, the power went out. The next day, I ended up writing about what was making me upset and actually acknowledging my feelings, and as soon as I finished doing that, the power turned back on. This isn't the only time something like that has happened. I get upset, something bad or weird that's out of my control happens and doesn't stop until I figure out what the hell I'm feeling. I know this sounds completely insane, and I really don't understand it, but it's part of the reason I feel like my entire existence in this universe is wrong. *It's not fair.*

If the shit I've been through wasn't already bad enough, to make it even worse, absolutely nothing helps. I don't know what's wrong with me. Everything about me is broken. My brain, my body, the way I affect everything around me. The weird, unexplainable things. Things acting the exact opposite of how they should, to the point not a single person understands. Things that work for most people making me significantly worse (and not in a ""just find the thing that works for you"" way). I feel like the universe wants me to suffer and I don't know why. What did I do to deserve this? All the trauma, mental and physical issues, literally everything? I can't find anyone to help me because no one understands. I think that's part of this imaginary curse. It wants me to be alone.

I know this doesn't make a whole lot of sense. It's not really meant to. I just needed to talk about it because I can't take this anymore. It's all so confusing and messy and I have no one to talk to because no one even remotely understands. Again, I know I sound completely insane. Maybe I am, who knows.

My father sexually abused me both overtly and covertly my entire life. My mother was verbally and sometimes physically abused by him, and from what I can remember would leave us alone and give him opportunities and couldn’t have possibly not known what was happening. I had every sign under the Sun, but it was always written off as me being a “sensitive kid”. Anyway. The two of them were extremely controlling of me my entire life. Most likely because they were scared their secret would get out. 

I recently remembered my older brother (10 years older, my dad’s kid but not my mom’s) would sexually abuse me as well. And my father would sometimes coach him to do things he couldn’t (I don’t wanna go into detail) and record it. I was about 2-4 when that part would happen, my brother would’ve been 12-14. My brother and father never really stopped, it just became more and more covert over the years.

My brother told my parents I remembered about a year ago now. I hadn’t even scratched the surface of what he’d done, or that my father had even done anything yet. He tried to drug me and take me home three hours away when we went out drinking together to celebrate my 21st birthday a few months before. It made me remember a few things, and I called him out on them. He in turn told my parents, and I got in trouble for it. 

Now I remember so so SO much more, especially about my father. My partner and therapist both say that there is no way they don’t know I have remembered. I have since become extremely distant (haven’t seen them since Christmas when usually it’d be like one or two times a month) and reluctant to have any sort of physical contact with either of my parents. My brother is completely out of the picture now too, he left after telling them I remembered. 

I’m tempted to tell them I remember. I want to do it the way they treated me all of those years. I want it to be casually dropped, no anger or emotion from me (I’ve always been “so emotional” to them). I want them to squirm, and I want them to feel the shame of knowing I remember. 

My father has been exceptionally kind and nice to me since I told them about my brother. Though neither of them believed me (it was so long ago, let it go you were a little kid, why do you want to ruin our family, we don’t NOT want to believe you we just want to believe you BOTH, you were always watched that never could’ve happened, if it did it wasn’t a big deal you should get over it).

Anonymous account for obvious reasons. 
So I have been working on myself in therapy since 2015. I started having flashbacks in 2016 of being sexually abused by my mother and I’ve been working on healing this. My dad knew about it and he just watched. Sometimes my mom would force my dad to do stuff to me too. It happened to my sister as well but she has become pretty verbally abusive so I don’t speak to her. It’s been extremely painful and I’ve made attempts to end my life in the past. 

I work in a very fast paced work environment because it’s all I can find for full time work, and literally all my energy is going in to just getting up and going to work. I’ve never stayed at a job this long, so it’s an accomplishment for me to have been at a job for over a year. But every time I’ve left a job it’s because I cannot handle it mentally, and I am horrible at socializing and I find it exhausting. I still wear a face mask at work because some days I just do not want to even try to look happy. A lot of my colleagues keep saying “your mom” to me and it makes me want to scream and tell them they have no idea what I’ve been through, but I have to stay silent because it’s not professional. I understand it’s a playful joke but I hate them for continuing to say it. 


I recently broke up with my boyfriend cause his anger and lack of emotional intelligence was making me have a lot of emotional flashbacks, and he would get angry at me for having flashbacks and crying because I “should have tried harder to prevent them” and he wouldn’t even hold my hand or comfort me when I asked him to. Instead he got angry and said I don’t care about him at all, even though he never shared his problems with me when I ask him if he needs emotional support. I told my therapist this and she said I should try to find a new roommate because his behaviour was unacceptable. I was afraid to leave him because I can’t afford to live on my own and I haven’t been approved for financial assistance from the government. I couldn’t even tell my boyfriend how much he genuinely hurt me because I know he would actually try to ruin my life because that’s the kind of person he is, I had to play it off like I wanted him to be happy without me and that I was still in love with him. One thing he said to me that I can’t forget: “if you’re unhappy with what I give you in this relationship then fuck you”

103,My friend feels uncaring when I'm triggered by her,1,11xtmuw,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11xtmuw/my_friend_feels_uncaring_when_im_triggered_by_her/,1," 

My good friend has helped me a lot in my life to get me where I am now, and knows everything about me and my past traumas.

But I often feel like she is uncaring when something she said triggered me, even to the point of having an episode of shutting down, crying and shaking.

One incident like this happened today so I'll use it as an example.  
I immediately told her if she could unsend a message she sent to me that was triggering for me, I can't tell the details but it's because the message contained highly sensitive information I didn't want even her to have about me. I asked her if she could please delete it and told her my heart goes fast and I'm shaking. She saw my message right away, but asked only few minutes later 'Why should it be deleted? :)' I asked her to delete it again, it's the most sensitive thing for me, I don't want her to have that information, told her again my heart's going fast and I'm shaking. She saw my msg again and I panicked cause she didn't reply again. Then turns out she was writing a longer messages but I just didn't see she was typing. I asked her if she deleted the message, but she wrote a longer message again, not replying to what I asked, not reacting to my hurt.  
Then after half an hour after she was done typing, I asked will she delete it, then she told me ""You could have deleted it yourself if it bothers you"" I told her does she really not understand, it didn't matter if I had the message, but because SHE has it, with my sensitive information, that's why I ASKED her to delete it.  
She told me she doesn't understand at all. At this point I said, can you really not delete it when I'm here to the point of shaking and crying? To which she said ""I don't like it to be told to do that, it's really impolite. Especially when one has gone out of their way to try to help"" Even though I didn't even command her to delete it, I politely asked, many times because she didn't reply and delete it yet. So of course I was feeling even worse.  
Then she finally said she deleted it and asked me what was the problem. I asked her to take a sceenshot of the deleted message so I could finally calm down, but even that took her 12 minutes to do until I said, hey I really don't want to be here frozen unable to do anything crying. Then 3 mins later she showed the screenshot of the deletion, asking me why did it have to be deleted. I thanked her for deleting and said I don't really feel comfortable telling her why.  
I also told her, that it's already been an hour since I asked her to delete it, and it took her almost an hour to delete it. And because of it, I had been in a horrible state of shaking and nearly crying for an hour. And my heart hurt.  
I told her, it feels like she's being uncaring to me, when I'm in distress to the point of shaking, and why couldn't she delete the message already AT THAT POINT right away, not an hour later? Even though she was writing a longer message, but it didn't help. I feel bad because she didn't really even acknowledge my feelings there in any way, only asked why. She could've wrote the longer part AFTER acknowledging my feelings. So I ended up being in a horrible, triggered state for an hour.  
She hasn't replied to that at all for hours now.

Even before, when I was triggered by her and told her I'm crying horribly to the point of having a dissociative episode. She doesn't really say anything to it right away, but continues what else she's saying, which makes me feel even even more bad. It makes me question, does she really care how bad I feel right now by her...? Not even a 'Oh sorry, are you okay? What was it that I said that made you feel like that?"" no. If she said something, it was that ""I understand you feel bad, but I'm not responsible for your feelings, you're just triggered."" I feel so confused if it's true...? And in the end she leaves me without a proper reply to how I felt hurt, not just once, it's almost always. Not even apologizing.

Also her saying to me that ""I don't like it to be told to do that, it's really impolite"" reminded me of how while she was helping me with something, she actually told me in a commanding way to do something, like 'do it NOW, RIGHT AWAY'. Which feels a bit scary...

Am I really wrong about feeling like this? She always makes me feel like she's right...  
I'm sorry it's long, I'd really appreciate any insight and advice...",1679431032.0
104,What is this called?,2,11xmoix,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11xmoix/what_is_this_called/,4,"A couple years ago I started therapy again. This time my therapist was/is very experienced with PTSD treatment. She explained EMDR to me and wanted me to think about it before we did it. I did and honestly I couldn’t see how anything could be worse than what I was experiencing. I was in constant fight or flight. I have terrible PMDD which can be caused/exacerbated by trauma. 

EMDR was good. Beneficial. Also very rough. I feel like I have had to relearn how to function or have a personality because unfortunately as I’m sure we all know, trauma is the personality. Abuse for me began very young. 

It also brought up dark memories I didn’t know I had. At first it felt like a lie. I didn’t really believe it, why would it suddenly surface after so long?! I understand why now. 

But now, I’m different. Nothing brings me joy. Alternatively, almost nothing makes me angry or gets a rise out of me. It’s like I am numb. I used to get super amped to go on a bike ride, or a run, or hiking. I’m supposed to go start another tattoo in a few weeks. I feel nothing about it. I am going to a hockey game with some friends this weekend… meh. The following weekend I’m seeing an awesome punk band… again, not really enthusiastic. Going on vacation in July… no excitement there. I’m trying to plan a vegas trip with some girlfriends for my birthday… eh. I could come home and sit down and see no one the rest of my life and not care. I have zero libido. Like I’ll see an attractive guy or gal and think daaaamn! But that’s it. I’m disgusted by the thought of sex now. I wish I wasn’t. I used to be probably hyper sexual. 

I work a lot. I go to school two nights a week. I have two great teens and a sweet husband. We moved out of his parents house just over a year ago because his mom was terribly toxic and abusive. I wonder if that is part of it.

This is my first time posting here. I have emotional flashbacks and I've read about it a little. I know that, just like any trauma, it can go away. Maybe I'm being pessimistic, but I feel like it's going to follow me my whole life.

I get emotional flashbacks mostly when i'm having a good time. It happens a lot at family events. I get that sudden rush of disgust about myself and others, shame, dread, etc. and the only thing it makes me feel of, is sexual assault. Like how you would feel after getting assaulted. Now here's the thing; I have no recollection of anything like that happening to me as a kid. But those feeling still feel very sexual for some reason.

I acknowledge the fact that those emotions have nothing to do with the present, but since it's just feelings and emotions and not memories, it's like it doesn't change anything to tell myself that I am safe in the present moment.

I also have to be quite careful because I can attach those feelings to other things. For exemple, out of nowhere one day, my brain decided that my place of work was a trigger. I'm still working on that. This could also be due to OCD, still not sure...?

Am I wrong for thinking it's never going to go away (with or without work)?",1679429124.0

""They can smell your touch on them, and they will either be isolated or pecked to death."" she explained while crushing their heads in a paper towel.

Maybe I WAS touched by something ""outside the nest"" and that's why I was being neglected and pecked to death all my life?

I'd never thought of it that way, like literally ever. He's right though, and it's kind of shaken me?

The only way I know how to express love is caretaking. I was moulded to be a protector/caretaker, I even chose it (at least partially) as a very young child. I love seeing and helping my loved ones achieve their goals. There is nothing that makes me happier. But I don't do the things I do for them for myself. I know they do not use me, would not want to take advantage of my inclinations. I'm still terrified of them realizing I'm not good enough, that I'm a bad person though. It's still part of what motivates me to do good for them and by them.

I live my life so obsessed with doing the right thing and the worry of causing others harm. The harm I do myself in the process is something I was shaped to expect and feel I deserve. I don't though, and no one who's worth my time would want me to feel that way. 

Every major change I've been too afraid to make comes from the same premise of, ""what if I'm too awful to deserve to exist/haven't made up for the fact that I exist."" Fawning is a pillar of how I see myself and my place in the world. I really can't believe I couldn't see it until now.

My heart is shattered & I feel so abandoned. My partner of 1.5 years traumatically dumped me the other day via text. A day after it ended, I took a test. My period was late, and I realised that my last ""period"" was actually just implantation bleeding. I’m absolutely getting an abortion. Literally a week before, my partner was saying things like “We’re forever,” “I want to grow old with you,” “I want a life with you,” “I want to move in with you,” “I don’t want anyone else.” A week later, BAM, discarded. I know 100% for sure that if I found out I was pregnant a few days earlier, he’d be there for me, he'd probably be lying next to me right now. Literally just a day before, there's no way he would've left me - I know him. We would've worked through it and our other issues would be so minor. Even if people would say he'd leave me in the future anyway, at least he'd be there for me now as a partner, not a guy who's going to go ""no-contact"" with me when it's over. This is one of the scariest , traumatising moments of my life & he’s just up and left. From professing his love to me and asking to move in with me to now sending robotic auto-generated texts like “I’m sorry you’re feeling this way.” I know we aren’t together but what on earth is this? How can you go from extreme love to absolutely nothing in a week, especially considering I’m pregnant with HIS child. He’s been so hot and cold. So black and white. Yet, he calls me these things all the time. I can assure you, nothing horrible happened between us. The dumping was triggered because he liked a revealing photo of his friend who he had let sleep in his bed prior and I expressed my anxiety about this, calmly.

We've gone through an abortion before - also during the midst of a breakup (OFC this happens to me!!) and he was immensely supportive, loving, kind, was calling me, messaging me, booked a hotel room for it, held me, kissed me and decided to give it another shot - I literally didn't expect this. This time round he is a different person.

I feel petrified, empty, scared, just a million things. I wish, I wish I knew before - a week before, a day before. This past month was CHAOTIC as hell - my moods were all over the place and I felt like absolute shit which significantly strained the relationship. NOW I know why. I was so confused why I was acting so much more reactive & emotionally. If I had taken a test earlier, we'd both realise this and work through it all. Now it's over, he's just going to leave after the abortion and it's going to feel even worse. Instead, I am alone, and he gets to live life scot-free whilst I suffer. It's shit, it's so shit. WHY did this happen? Why now! He’s off to the gym everyday, can work, hangs out with friends, can eat. I’m lying in bed, haven’t eaten a meal in a week, taking time off work, isolated and devastated.

Everyone is supporting me and would do anything, but him. I know we’re not “together”, but considering he plays a role and said he wants to be with me forever to a sudden “no-contact” hurts me more than anyone has. Having C-PTSD and BPD, this makes it all the more worse as the abandonment is HELL as my primary relationship is over full stop. Just like that.

I think I’m moving on from making it my main thing, after having discussed this with my partner, I think it’s healthier as just a hobby.

However, even as a hobby I have trouble getting myself to make anything. I have so many observations about the world, tidbits I know about anatomy and random animals and history and styles- I have ideas of how to fit these together and compose them, but I rarely enjoy the process of making them anymore due to how my trauma has impacted that process, learning skills, etc. And then there are times I really want to make something, but I try and the results are so bad or disappointing despite genuine work and study I put into it. I don’t expect to make a perfect painting from the get-go, but my perspective and simple ability to focus are shamefully bad and honestly- with art part of the appeal used to be a competitive aspect, to actually grind on and master something people usually assume comes from pure “talent” and to grind on and learn something I was truly interested in and back then, enjoyed.

After all this I usually find myself more interested in stepping back and just watching other analyses, or watching a movie or something, or looking at others’ art. Unfortunately, then my self-trained observational skills come in at random points and I want to create something, and I usually find myself forcing myself to ignore it, otherwise I get frustrated trying to do the creative process and actually trying to make something. I’m very confident in my ideas, but when it comes to making them visually or writing something that actually ties together that’s when I really get the feeling that it’s work and it becomes unfun and I don’t really feel a reward from finishing ideas rather than just jotting them down. It sucks though, because I do actually want to see them finished and do more. I don’t even have art friends to share some of those ideas (let alone the art I have made) with, it’s basically between me and my partner.

Anyone else have this sort of struggle wanting to create and trying but not actually enjoying it? What really sucks is it feels so engrained in me and that feels like it hurts me more in a way, I actually still enjoy philosophy and writing (despite deteriorating skills, between more run-on sentences and grammatical slip-ups) and I wish I could make more from them. Even just for me. But trying to do that truly hurts and retriggers trauma.

Addendum: I have been taking minor art lessons for a while now but honestly they haven’t been much of a social experience and the lessons themselves aren’t great or talking about mindset much at all, it’s not what I want which is even more discouraging. I could be a little more social, but I have pushed myself socially with speaking up more there already (and even by being there), plus doing that in an environment/situation that is already triggering since it’s about art is not very good. I need more to do besides that, tbh my area is just very boring and barren but I sure don’t have the resources to move away rn.

122,I'm so hurt. A letter,1,11xpk4t,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11xpk4t/im_so_hurt_a_letter/,1,"To the only girl I chose to trust completely after healing. You compared me to your brother. Shamed my body after you told me you cared about me. I feel like cutting myself every night even though I've never done it. I feel like jumping off my roof after I thought I'd finally gotten my inner child back. You betrayed my trust and destroyed my faith in people after I found out you had been fucking and giving blowjobs to your brother for most of your life. 

To the girl who called me her bestfriend. Her only friend. You used me for my body and when I tried to touch you. You were repulsed. Something only allowed when you were hungry. I feel so hurt and disgusted when I look myself in the mirror. and compulsively watch porn even when I don't feel like it because I'm bracing for when I'll be used again. 

To the brother of the girl and my childhood best friend. You kept making subtle jokes about me having a small dick because I guess you have a big one and you base your identity off of it. I feel so hurt and my self perception is so messed up because of it. Despite having had a dick I was more than happy with before. You and your sister made me feel like the body is all that matters, That my physical height is all that matters. I feel so hurt when I see someone much taller than me. 

To the girls I avoid and can't talk to after all this, even though you are more than interested. I feel so pathetic and hurt. I feel so sad about all the friendships I've taken myself out of because I'm so scared and feel a disgust towards myself. Even though some cuddles and gentle kisses is all I want from you. To stare at you in the sun and under moon lit skies. I feel so pathetic. I feel like a shell of the person I once was. 

To the past version of myself. One that stood tall with his head in the clouds. Then bringing it back down to see your feet. The person who built up his confidence back to a hundred percent and was living his dream life. To the one who could talk to anyone and charm anyone by being genuine and in the moment. To the person who felt like he was worth it. To the person who spoke to his inner child with compassion and kindness. I'm sorry. I have to say goodbye. 

and lastly to my inner child. I'm sorry you went through so much after I promised to protect you. I'm sorry that you need to learn to become a new version of yourself. More compassionate and less hurt to get out of this. I'm sorry I'm asking the world of you to get through this mountain of pain. I'm sorry we live in a world where there is only so much sympathy that goes around.. and the quota is taken up by the suffering women. It's not okay to take it away from them. But it's another opportunity for you to learn how to be stronger through this. I'm sorry that you need to do this alone and cry in quite secluded places. I'm sorry I can't do more than listen to you. I'm sorry that this is happening to you. 

The world might not show you compassion or kindness but I promise to show it to you. I promise to hold your hand when you cry. I promise to never leave your side when you feel alone and disgusting. I see the pain you are going through. I'll let you cry. I'll let you laugh. I'll make you feel heard and understood. It might not make the pain go away immediately. But maybe you will learn to accept my love. and we can go back to a time when we didn't need anyone else's love. and then you can love right. From a place where you don't need it. Which will only add positivity and happiness to someone's life. and they can do the same to you. We will have better boundaries and love someone who loves themselves and has kindness this time. 

I can't promise you that you won't get hurt again. But I promise you that I'll be there through it all. I'll never leave. Never. And like Lia, promises are not meant to be broken. Promises are what shows another person that you hold their feelings and trust with the utmost care. It shows that you are gentle with the sentiments and feelings of another person. and I will never let you down.",1679423030.0

He lives near the coast, so I got to have a peaceful walk along the beach (the sea is my favourite interaction with nature, I was raised in a beach town), we watched Everything Everywhere All At Once (I loved it), we had a nice takeaway, and I got to play with the two gorgeous dogs and cats who he's currently living with. It was just so lovely and wholesome and one of the best weekends I've had in a really long time. It's made me realise that I want to have a dog of my own when I'm ready and in a better position to take care of one. I came home feeling refreshed and at peace in a way I haven't felt in a really long time.

Since I got back home, my energy has just plummeted. I'm spending a lot of time in bed, not really doing anything, and my motivation to look after myself has dropped massively. I really need to go food shopping, I don't have anything in the house I can really make a proper meal out of. But I cannot summon the energy to shower, get dressed, go down to the supermarket, and make decisions on food items. I don't even want to get takeout, as I'd still have to get dressed and go all the way down to collect it, and it still requires the decision of what to get. 

It's weird. Like, I don't feel depressed, I don't feel like I've ""lost"" anything or that I'm ""grieving"" for times that haven't been like this, which would be the explanations I assume that would make sense in this situation. I just feel wiped out. Is it an emotional hangover, maybe? Surges of positive emotion causing the same burnout as negative ones? If you have experienced this, any strategies that have helped? I hate to think I'd have to moderate good times to avoid this happening.

EDIT: Actually I should probably add for context that this weekend was at the start of a 2 week vacation from work, and my work environment has been extremely stressful because I'm on probation and due to excessive sick leave I'm currently having HR reviews that could lead to my contract being ended. So on reflection, maybe the good weekend just delayed the emotional hangover from the work stress?",1679400060.0

130,Was this sexual abuse ?,3,11xd68z,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11xd68z/was_this_sexual_abuse/,25,"I’m (F25) not sure how to write this. I’ve never put down my memories to paper let alone tell anyone. A family member would do certain things between (from what little I can remember) the ages of 7-15. These things made me feel uncomfortable and I asked multiple times for it to stop to no avail. I want to protect their identity so calling them X. 

1. X never let me lock the bathroom door when I shower X walks right in and has conversations with me even though the shower doors are see-through. This still happens now at 25yo. I used to lock the door when I was younger but X would use a coin to open the door and would leave it wide open so I just stoped locking the door and forget to every time now. 

2. X have always sneaked up the stairs and burst into my room on purpose. Dispute multiple times asking X to knock. If I’m just out a shower and wearing a towel I’ll always ask X to leave but X scoffs as if I should be less embarrassed and I’m weak for being embarrassed about being naked. 

3. When I was younger if I would touch myself X would take enjoyment from bursting into my room and surprising me and made me feel dirty and mentally fucked up for doing so. X would also watch through a crack in the door (caught them sometimes) before bursting in. 

4. X would ask to see my breasts and say it was to compare mine to theirs and any time I said I didn’t want to I was made to feel silly for being embarrassed like it was no big deal. 

5. X used to ask me to shower with them. Well over the age I needed anyone to wash my hair. Still asking me at 15. X would again scoff if I said no and plead for me to join them as if I was not wanting quality time with them. 

6. X flashes me (still does) and leaves the door to the bathroom wide open when they shower and sometimes calls me over to chat with them on purpose as if they want to see my reaction to seeing them naked. 

7. X would insist on checking me ‘down there’ when I was younger and would put cream on me saying there was a rash but I never saw one. I remember getting older and being adamant that I could do it myself but X got furious with me. 

8. X gets into my bed without asking when I’m in bed or when I’m not and asks me to cuddle them in their bed and gets angry when I say no. 


The next two are hard for me to type…I don’t feel ready but this platform has been really supportive so far so here goes. For content X definitely physically abused me and still emotionally abuses me and I think they are narcissistic.  


9. Growing up and even sometimes now I go into a childlike mind and put on a higher pitched child like voice (this cringes me so much so please don’t say anything nasty about this). Once when I was around 16 I was hugging X in their bed and was in this childlike state. They played into it and said ‘aww my baby, do you want to suck milk’ and I for some disgusting reason that bothers me to this day I nodded and X got their breasts out and I ….I can’t type the rest but I don’t think I need to.

10. Again difficult to put down to writing. This one I don’t know if it’s in my head. When I was younger X would ask me to sit on their lap. I would feel (or think I did) them pushing up their private part on my body. I would feel uncomfortable and would sit in a different position but it would keep happening and I learnt to ignore it. 

Sorry for the left hoy post but because this is not obvious or classic case of sexual abuse (I think) I’m just unsure if it was. I know this person would take it very badly if they knew I was thinking this and I feel like I’m betraying that persons honour or something. 

(Context : been depressed since 11/12  and after experiencing panic attacks for the first time at 25 I finally told a doctor and I’m on a waiting list to get help for pdsd (unsure if that’s what I have) and I don’t know if it’s worth mentioning this if it’s stupid or a lie or if I am even able to).

132,Struggling with constant anxiety and lost feelings for partner?,2,11xf8tc,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11xf8tc/struggling_with_constant_anxiety_and_lost/,2,"Okay so there's a lot for me to go through here, and I have to apologise as it is hard for me to explain things as it's hard for me to even understand what's going on in my brain!

I've been with my partner now coming up to 2 years in May, wonderful healthy relationship where there are no issues whatsoever, I'll preface this by saying I have struggled with mental health on and off throughout my life, mainly being anxiety so I have been on Fluoxetine (anti depressants) for the last 2 years, this has been great for me and has helped me to regulate my emotions and feelings quite well and to what I believe has helped my relationship with my partner to flourish and I have felt genuinely happy.

Anyway, cutting to now... Since the very (very) start of the year, just after new years... (obviously) I noticed a lot of anxiety... although it may of been creeping in a few weeks before, It was as though now I felt it full blast, and my inner voice kept telling me that my boyfriend was interested in someone else, and I was then getting strong feelings of them cheating although there was no indication of this, I think on new years eve I had noticed my boyfriend getting on well with his mates and watching one of his friends who is a girl sing (he's a musician and i know the following sounds daft, believe me) so the next day I kept getting intrusive thoughts of that moment and feeling very sensitive around it, as I'm quite insecure and never sing and I know my boyfriend would love it if I came out my shell more in that way (although he's always telling me how perfect I am) It kept going through my mind that he should be with someone like that...

fast forward a few days, I'm still feeling VERY on edge and feel incredibly anxious when my boyfriend isn't really showing me that much affection, or is in his room for long periods of time... I get very panicky and can't seem to calm myself until I go upstairs to see what he's up to, if he's just sat there on his phone with his door shut I assume that he's not wanting to be with me (even though I think having our own space is healthy and have never had an issue with it before) after seeing him just sat there I'll get incredibly upset and more anxious and feel very emotional, may even start crying and it's difficult to stop, I suddenly view my boyfriend very differently?

I'll also mention now that I was never like this at any other point of our relationship, I just started feeling this intense anxiety since new years, also I'll mention that I'm a very sensitive person and feel as though I pick up on other peoples emotions very easily and that I do that a lot with my boyfriend if he is feeling down about himself etc, I also feel these emotions.

As the days went on I stopped getting these anxious feelings when he wasn't always around, but still felt bad anxiety and feeling depression creeping in, as the days progressed I noticed myself becoming more sensitive to things and even hyperaware? (think that's the word) which would cause more anxiety for me, my boyfriend may say something and I would take it in a negative way and feel offended by it and it would cause a lot of hurt and then anxiety is even worse... I would have a lot of moments of just emotional outbursts of crying and finding it difficult to stop just feeling very overwhelmed and so uncomfortable in how i'm feeling, even gagging from what felt like stress and not being able to eat (I'm feeling this pretty much everyday)

the past month and a bit I've been having internal thoughts such as ""I don't love you"" and other horrible things directed at my boyfriend which cause me so much anxiety and even more stress as I try to convince myself they are just thoughts and not real, having suddenly no feelings towards him? getting irritated at little things but still feeling intensely sad over the thought of him with someone else, this person is perfect in my eyes and I love all the things about them that are considered imperfections, where have my feelings gone? It's been over a month and I'm scared they won't return because I know this relationship when I'm not feeling this way, is so good for me and has been the best thing for my life.

I'll quickly mention that I'm 23 now and had a relationship when I was 14 that brought a lot of the very same feelings up but this happened very early on in the relationship (a month or so) with much breaking up and getting back together due to my anxiety and depression.

I'm sorry for the essay but it's really hard to fit everything in, but this is just the summary of it...

Please can I get real responses with this, I really want to make this relationship work and stop this anxiety and emotional stress and be able to feel these feelings again for my partner... I'd hate to think that it's over now.",1679401360.0

I don’t know what to do anymore, i am so totally alone. 
Around 5pm tonight I was finishing an online class when my mom knocked on my door demanding to talk. My therapist had texted me earlier today and said my mom wanted to talk to her, so I was nervous. Mom knocked on my door upon getting back from the meeting.
She was crying, and claimed my therapist told her I said she was abusive and couldn’t believe i had said that. Later however she admitted that during the day she had found my diaries, “skimmed” them, and saw the word “abuse” and immediately called my therapist to ask who was abusing me. A very likely and believable story.

She forced me to recount for her one of these “abusive” events, and after sitting in silence for a while I finally admitted (like I had done something wrong) that when I was 4 she was angry at me and threw a metal water bottle at my face and my nose bruised. 

She said she didn’t remember this happening and she’s sorry i believed that.

She also claimed my she had to stop my dad from hurting me several times when he got angry, so I should be blaming him too. I don’t remember this but it’s possible this is true. I only remember one incident with my dad, but many with my mom.

My therapist is not being helpful here when I am actively in a crisis. Before my mom blew up at me, I had texted her “how’d it go”, and she responded “Your mom’s in bad shape. Try to talk to her.” 

I replied that we talked, and she said “Ok good. You are both very compassionate and caring underneath your “tough” exteriors”.

I had no idea what to even say to this so I asked if she knew about her reading my journals. She said: “I was in a tough spot. A crisis is an opportunity”. 

I am so angry and hurt and hopeless right now. I don’t know what I even do next. I can’t keep living like this, I feel so small.

Update: Next morning. My dad cornered me and told me my mom had been crying all night, and it was all my fault. I insisted that I didn’t do anything wrong, and he sarcastically said, “no I know you didn’t, because you’re so smart and mature at 17”, just mocking me. I tried to avoid him, and he followed me, saying he knew I was avoiding him because I had done all this on purpose. “Are you happy now? You’ve broken your mom’s heart. Is this what you wanted?”

I hid in the bathroom and locked the door and cried. I’m at school now, and everyone hates me. My parents are done with me, and it’s all my fault. My mom asked me before I left if I had left my journals hidden under my clothes in my dresser on purpose for her to find them. I insisted no, of course I didn’t. Now she thinks I purposefully left them there so she would know all the “horrible things” I think about her. Everything is my fault, and everything is broken now.

Tonight we have to have a “discussion” to sort everything out. I’m so done, I don’t want to sit there and listen to how I’m imagining everything and I’m mentally unstable and manipulative. I just want someone to protect me, I feel so alone.",1679359835.0

Has anyone managed to?
I've been depressed and in distress since the end of 2022. It just doesn't feel worth it

I have asked for help from everywhere that I can go to,  and at present my own strength and a small amount of support is only keeping me existing. I spend my day too exhausted to do anything. A very physical exhaustion. I've forced myself to do things, as I know you're supposed to, but my soul feels broken. By other peoples standards, I haven't managed that much. 

My hair is so knotted in places and i tried to brush them out but a lot of it stuck there,  and have been for months. I think i might have to cut my hair off. 
 All my housework has been neglected,  its piled up. I've been doing tiny bits at a time, but I quickly get exhausted and upset. Work and study is impossible. I've just hide at home, see my family occasionally (not my 'biological' family).
 I  use meds to sleep as long as possible, in order to stay out if the emergency room. Before doing this, i couldnt sleep and would become very distressed at night, resulting in a lot of crisis at the hospital. Forcing myself into long sleep means more nightmares,  but its better than the hell of getting through hours upon hours of mental pain and exhaustion in my bed.

Im constantly on the edge of doing something to myself, and using various coping skills to not do that.  When im not asleep, i . play low intensity video games,   or I just watch the same series on Netflix repeatedly, waiting for medication time and sleep to come.

I cant describe how unwell i feel, but different professionals have differing opinions about clincal depression vs cptsd.  I just cant deal with it. 

It feels impossible to get myself out of this. I really have tried.  Life feels too terrifying, too much anxiety, too much darkness.  I am very  lucky and fortunate,  despite going through 20yrs of trauma, I have lots of good things. However I am also in enormous pain and my normal tactics of gratitude and 'choosing"" a better future, just aren't working.  I can't choose my way out if this it seems. I feel unwell, even my whole body feels unwell. 

I am phobic of psych wards,  the crisis team here in the UK refuses my referral. I am in therapy but it's been hard lately.  My meds won't be looked at.   I feel like I've been falling down a hole. 

From the outside there's nothing anyone can do.    It is so lonely. 

From the inside I just cant find any light, any sense of safety,  any warmth, any hope,  playfulness,  relaxation.   Just fear and terror and depression 

I am about to sit in the bath for a bit.. put on some clean clothes.. this kind of stuff I am supposed to do.  But I still feel so sad, tired, despairing at the end of the day.

Specifically, there are two groups that are for neurodivergent people that need some kind of advice or venting, where I sometimes see posts about relationships. some of them are horribly reminiscent of what I've been through.
Every time I read another fucked up story where there's abuse, gaslighting, manipulation and sexual abuse, it just sends me into a very unpleasant state where it's stuck in my head and keeps bringing up my past.

My parents were and are abusive. They gave me a lot of issues. I still suffer from the aftermath of what they put me through. It made me anxious to pick up calls because my dad would scream at me and call me names if I had scored bad in an exam, it gave me an eating disorder, anxiety, body image issues. I hit my own father because he was hitting my mom, he grabbed my hair and I had a headache for the rest of the day. I am a shell of a person I used to be. My earliest memory is my mom and my dad screaming at me as I cowered in the corner, my mom spitting at me because I dared to talk back to my dad and telling me how I ruined their lives and I begged them to leave me alone and banging my head on the wall.

But somehow I like my last name, I have my dad's first name as my last name because it's the norm. My friend told me that I should change my last name immediately after moving out but I don't feel the inclination to. Yes my dad was horrible, but even amidst the horribleness he taught me things that made my life better, he even let me take a gap year so I can prepare for medicine and will be paying for my education if I get into a good school. I hate him for everything he's done but because of these things, but there very few things he's done right and  because of which I am the person I am today. A part of me feels bad because he had a shitty childhood, I don't excuse him abusing me but weirdly I respect his hard work into succeeding career wise, when he had nothing.

I was telling my friend that I might give my child my last name and my husband's last name as sort of a double surname and she told me that I had to change my last name else I would be a hypocrite complaining about my parents because I still want to be associated with them and use their money.

This is a throwaway account due to disclosing this level of location information - I’m not a weird random troll or anything and I’m active in this community on my main. I really care about this community so much and it has helped massively. Might delete this but feeling compelled to share right now. With that in mind:

Please, please, if you reside or are visiting the California central coast and you’re having a mental health crisis where you need to go to a hospital to get help and be safe, DO NOT GO to Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula (CHOMP). I can best describe what happened here by sharing the feedback I sent to the hospital in response to their “how was your stay?” follow-up email:

“I’m not attempting to be dramatic when I say that this was one of the worst experiences of my life. I’m writing this in efforts to be completely honest in hopes to advocate for anyone else who comes here in a similar state that I was in. I came here experiencing a non-violent mental health crisis needing help and, ideally, a little kindness. I spent two and a half days alone on a gurney in an empty room, mostly ignored and barely checked in with, not provided with anything to wash myself with, only given one small Dixie cup of water only when I asked for it, and given a portable toilet without providing toilet paper. The staff were either rude when explaining information or seemingly completely oblivious. Every time I asked for clarification I was told they would “check on it” and then 2-3 hours would pass without an answer. I understand that an ER is a very busy and often chaotic place by its nature, given the volume and spectrum of people who require urgent care. I am not delusional enough to expect a ritzy, cushioned time in an ER, but one would hope to expect the bare minimum. I would only consider providing feedback on my experience in a situation like this if it reached a level of extremes, which I believe is relevant here. In full disclosure, at the peak of my emotional distress I did shout at a staff member, which I immediately apologized for and deeply regret - but aside from a moment of verbally expressing despair over my treatment, I was not an aggressive patient. While my situation was due to a mental health crisis, I was 100% coherent enough to recognize the complete lack of warmth and competence. I have seen animals treated better than the way I was treated here.”

I read this to my therapist because I was feeling insecure about seeming spoiled or some shit because my self-worth is low enough to truly wonder. My therapist was deeply disturbed and said that knowing this, she will never ever suggest to any of her patients to go there. Idk, I know this sub has people from all over the place but on the off chance it applies to you, or if you’re insecure about the treatment and respect you rightfully deserve in a hospital setting, I wanted to share my experience. Literally go anywhere but this place. I would have been better off sitting in a gutter hyperventilating for two days rather than the experience I had here.

You deserve kindness and respect, always, no matter what. You matter. If you receive treatment like this, please know you deserve better. Sending love💚",1679344955.0

* Another friend, trying to hide his young fat picture from us, and we being jovially curious to see it. 
* A police officer telling me I ought to run in a designated place - it's compulsory and me finding a logical reason to not (all these feel so real). 

My mind wants to know what to do - first it keeps trying to recollect the dream, to look for details that I'm missing. Then I keep asking myself, should I do something about these dreams, to ""solve"" them, so I don't experience this another morning. 

Then another thought is whether I have to wake up and get to reality, 

but 1) I feel I need to sleep as it's incomplete (though I can't go to sleep coz of this state) 

2) it almost feels like those dreams are my realities. Like it's so convincingly vivid and real that I need to know what just happened (and can't seem to see that those were just futile dreams). 

Regardless, I wake up, groggy, sleepy, trying to think of what to do next - yoga? Loving kindness meditation?, go for a walk (but in all of these states, I'm caught up in thoughts).

It certainly makes a lot of sense but I just, don't care very much. All these labels, what help have they brought me? What peace? What safety?

I'm struggling so hard. I haven't had a job since 2018. Between my existing trauma, COVID, not having a car, and being a highschool dropout, I just... I don't know how to even get a job. My mom wants me to get on disability, but that could take years. And I can't work while trying to get it. 5 more years of this life? I can hardly take another minute, and you want me to live like this for 5 more fucking years? She owes me 5 grand for the college funds she stole from me, yet when I bring up that I need a car, it's just ""oh well, you fucking figure that shit out. I don't give a shit about you."" 

I'm needing to take deep breaths right now. I just. I'm so mad. I'm so scared. I'm so disgusted. All I want is to feel safe but it is entirely impossible in this society. How am I supposed to trust that I can create my own safety? When a landlord can just raise my rent, for any reason, at any time. When a job can just fire me, for any reason, at any time. When all of my medical expenses are simply too expensive, and I have to survive without the necessary treatment for my ADHD, and Depression. When any car I could get myself, could just spontaneously fall apart, leaving me with nothing once again.

Realistically speaking... What the fuck am I supposed to do other than die? I don't have any options. I'm tired of pushing and pushing and pushing and getting more and more taken from me in return. Like really. What the fuck am I supposed to do? In my 22 years on this Earth, NOTHING has helped. I simply cannot make myself ""do."" I can feel the nerves sending impulses, I can FEEL my intention. But do I get up? Does my body listen, or does it resist? Does it lie and yell and scream about how if I got a job, I'd just be shot or hung or assaulted or in some way, physically and mentally torn apart? I KNOW that they're lies, but they're all I've known and seen. 

I don't know why I'm even writing this post. I've made so many exactly like it on this site. For years, since middle school. And I have found no solace. No help. No peace. I'm so tired. I just want to be able to feel safety. Why is it such an absurd luxury? I can't go on much longer. I NEED a miracle, extremely quickly.

There are thoughts in my head that I don't want to share here. Things that I try to fight off, that lately, have grown so much louder than I can handle. My darkness is replacing me, and I fear that it'll succeed. I have nothing to lose, and nothing to give anyone. No one loses if I die. But I lose if I live. Again and again and again. Until I have nothing and no one left. I don't have the strength needed to get better, nor do I have the support needed. Without those two things, it is simply hopeless. I can't go on.

I know intellectually that neither of those responses are appropriate, given that he has expressed that he knows it was unintentional and he accepted my apology (thanked me for understanding).

The way they treat us as babies will inform us about who we are. When a child is mistreated by a primary caregiver, their mind interprets this as a sign that they aren't good enough, that there is something wrong with the child. Maybe the parent knows how to fix it, and this ill treatment is the way? Well, no. 

As adults who have survived child abuse and neglect, we must unpack these feelings. If we can understand where they came from, we can start to challenge them and rediscover our identity. For some, this may mean reparenting ourselves. For others, this may mean challenging these negative belief systems. 

This may be why so many of us look for validation through other people. This may make sense on the surface, but this validation will always be both temporary and inextricably linked to the person we've sought or found validation from - and our relationship with that person. To be clear, I'm not saying we shouldn't seek healthy and loving relationships, only that to make these relationships into healthy ones, we must learn to validate ourselves, or avoid falling into codependency. 

I hope, for all of you, that you may find ways to see yourselves as worthy, deserving of good treatment. Because you already are, even if you don't know it just yet. You are ENOUGH. Anyone who tells you that you need to change in order for them to be okay with who you are is wrong. They might not be abusive, but they're certainly not compatible with you, if who you are right now is not enough for them.",1679323711.0

* I live with my boyfriend, and his parents.
* My sister moved here from across the country, then moved back across the country 6 months later. During this process, she did some sorta bad things that really hurt our relationship. Not to mention, she has the emotional availability of some sort of a rock. 
* My therapist and psychiatric ""fired"" me (for lack of a better term) at the beginning of the month, the day before I was supposed to see them; because I changed my insurance plan and they cut their contract with my insurance plan on March 1st. I can't start getting on wait lists for mental heałrh care until April 1st, when I get *new* new insurance.
* I have difficulty with making new friends, because I am not super functional. I was doing a lot better until I lost my mental health care; I have a fun history with medical neglect. 

I sleep in another man's bedroom. Every single person I see in real life shows up to see someone else (him, or his parents). The one person who showed up to see me just moved back across the country. The people that were supposed to help me deal with this kind of thing don't take my health insurance.

I feel so pathetic, and forgettable. I need to be able to make friends, but I don't have the mental health support that I need right now to even go buy blue jeans (all I have are exercise shorts and sweat pants). Meeting new people and maintaining relationships takes energy that I don't have.

It just feels like everything in the world is confirming my ""core beliefs"" -- that people won't care about me unless I am so impressive that they have no choice (I am not impressive at all), and that I am going to be denied medical care and left in some dark place where there's nobody to help.

What do people do in situations like this? How do they get out of them? I was doing so well until March started, and now I'm just treading water and trying to stop my craziness from leaking into my relationships.

i always thought i had some sort of form of ptsd but never wanted to be that person to self diagnose. i also never wanted to be that person to think my life is so bad because it could always be much worse, but honestly i’ve had a pretty shitty life. i’ve had many traumatizing things happen to me, from s/a multiple times to my shitty childhood. i had my first panic attack when i was 10 but they were pretty rare up until lately. now, every time i try to talk about my past i end up having a panic attack. even if i think i’m over something n that it doesn’t affect me, once it hits the tip of my tounge i suddenly can’t breathe n start crying uncontrollably. the feelings i felt in that moment all come rushing back. i started to remember every little detail that i thought i forgot about. the first time i got s/a, the memories used to be  so vivid n i could remember everything, but it eventually became all blurry. i started questioning if it even really happened even tho i know for a 100% fact that it did. the only way i could get over it was if i tried to forget about it n pretend like it never happened. i’d think about it from time to time but it didn’t hurt me as bad as it used to. it ended up happening to me again around a year later. what “got me over that” was knowing it happened before n i wasn’t awake or conscious to remember it like i was the first time, so it could’ve been worse. 3 years later, i tried talking about my first assault n what had happened n immediately started having a flashback. suddenly i could remember every single word that was said even tho i couldn’t before. i started having more n more panic attacks after i was trying to tell a story about my dad. i immediately realized how shitty he really was n that none of it was normal. i felt too many emotions at once. from constantly questioning your sanity to realizing my feelings are completely valid is a lot to take in. it’s comforting in a way but it’s still upsetting to realize that the things that happened were really that fucked up. lately when i get a flashback it just sends me into a spiral n i can’t stop crying for at least 5 hours. i start thinking about everything that’s happened in my life. i’ve started to realize i wasn’t over exaggerating or trying to make myself a victim, those things really happened and i really was abused. i also started having weird nightmares every night but at first i wasn’t sure why. none of them were directly related to my trauma but they are always about me in danger. whether it’s a zombie apocalypse, school shooting, somebody trying to kidnap, kill or rob me, it’s always something out to get me. i never considered it to be ptsd related, but i realized it kind of connects to my life. i always feel like i’m in danger, i’m always waiting for the next bad thing to happen. i wasn’t sure why it was all affecting me so much lately but it’s starting to make more sense. the only way for me to get over something is to forget about it n pretend like it never happened or to think about how it couldn’t have been that bad because it could always be worse. my problems started so young i started becoming numb to everything around me. once i finally started opening up about it, i realized it really is that bad. i shouldn’t feel like my problems don’t mean anything because it could always be worse. i always tried to justify it in some way in my head, but hearing it out loud made me realize those weren’t normal things for a child to have to experience n i’m allowed to have feelings about it. i’m allowed to say my life sucked n i’m allowed to say i’ve been through horrible situations. i have so much unhealed trauma that i tried to block out, but that only works for so long. eventually it all comes creeping up on you n it just becomes so overwhelming.",1679386969.0

Well, hear me out...

Feeling unworthy, unlovable, incapable, these all come from somewhere. But, just like the characters of those movies, we're so close to the action that it can be hard to spot the faulty logic our abusers used, or even that we've used in an attempt to make sense of the chaotic and nonsensical ways our abusers treated us. 

Take a minute to ask yourself why. ""Why do I feel so worthless?"" Then, ask yourself if that reason really stands up to scrutiny. As an example, I felt worthless because my parents never showed me any kind of love, care and attention, except for when my father was angry enough to punish me in various horrific ways. I didn't want to accept that my father was a bad person. 

I'll say that again: I didn't want to accept that my father was a bad person. 

So, if I was the bad person, the problem child, the black sheep, then it must have been his duty to correct me and attempt to turn me into a good person. In my faulty logic, I absorbed full responsibility for my father's actions - and my mother's inaction - and I stayed stuck in that loop for ages and ages. 

Look at the scenarios that made you feel unworthy, and think about whether it was actually your unworthiness - or the other person's moral failing, character flaws, or simple lack of self control - that made that situation turn out the way it did. 

And, lastly, remember that absolutes are harmful. Maybe you might find in some of these scenarios that you were at fault. Maybe it was your lack of self control, or your mistake, that turned that situation or relationship sour. But that mistake doesn't define you wholely. I've done plenty of stupid things, especially during my traumatized state. But I was and am far from a stupid person, and you are too ❤️❤️❤️",1679317602.0

The abuse is still very much real.

I used to be very volatile myself and cause fights (or at least made them worse). This was, ofc, because as a child I realised the abuse was unfair and stuck up for myself.

As an adult, being re-abused, I can see now my parents’ behaviour is irrational. I respond calmly and maturely and am berated for it as if I am doing it to patronise them.

I still can’t shake the thought that well, given how volatile I used to be, their abuse is because they are anticipating my reactions to also be hostile.

All my energy goes into surviving-trying not to give up, trying not to act on intrusive thoughts, trying to put off intrusive thoughts, trying to minimize the need for distraction from these thoughts. For context, I have always struggled with persistent isolation, identity issues, and debilitating anxiety that would lead to shutdowns or meltdowns that often prolonged my work or would lead to utter avoidance from work and people. These issues in conjunction with PTSD, depression, anxiety, trichillotomania, and ADHD have made the simplest tasks overwhelming and draining. 

These weaknesses are incompatible with the requirements of modern life. I mean I avoid even small things like texts, emails but to an extreme extent etc. I don’t know if much of my problems are connected to spending many days disassociated drowning in internet, etc because I grew up in chaotic household marked by infidelity, divorce, neglect, family contention, denial and more(story for another day). I also had parents with permissive tendencies who didn’t implement structure, discipline, accountability or responsibilities for various reasons. It’s hard to engage in human activity- hobbies, friendships, relationships, goals. I’m tired of being on the brink of survival and can’t say I haven’t made an effort but persistent mental health challenges are hard. 


Even in my adolescence, my high school witnessed my anxiety crying spells when I encountered perceived failure. I would even avoid extracurricular activities due to anxieties. Oh not to mention I also would call in sick once in a while to avoid or study extra for tests and quizzes.  I would often cry myself to sleep every night during this period. I was a hard worker in high school I skipped my cousin’s quinceanera to study and spent numerous nights studying. I feel like my efforts are made void by my anxiety and issues. I had high hopes to attend medical school during that time, but the mental displeasure of existing //living/studying made me re-consider this goal. 


College was a bit better in terms of masking emotional issues but I still faced moments a different type of depression. Nebertneless, I persisted the best I could and strategized for postgrad. However, core issues around executive function, mental health, and motivation persisted regardless of my goals. I  feel crushed by the weight that my potential might be hampered by trauma and instability, emotional neglect, potential generational curses. I’ve had great opportunities with top Fortune 500 companies and even a top tech company but my dysfunction followed. I often found myself shutting down on the job, overwhelmed and underwhelmed and trapped. I would do anything to get rid of the mental baggage and low self esteem that seems to follow me everywhere. 
I feel trapped in these very real cycles. I suppose I’ve gotten to the “what’s the point phase” in my journey? I think subconsciously my mind reminds me of the efforts in which I failed.  The same efforts that have led to me being fired, at home, struggling- with no idea what lies ahead. I also feel broken because some people are resilient regardless and then there’s me struggling with the bare minimum, passive, and feeling weighed down thinking about the future. I used to feel a semblance of there’s still life, but how can I get excited knowing that most experiences at this moment are accompanied with overwhelm(it’s like I panic knowing all the steps and the multiple points of failure) and persistent mental health problems? I would do anything to not have these mental health issues. I also feel guilt and shame because ngl my parents have sacrificed and invested, and tbh I’ve had dope opportunities but here I am battling avoidance, dissociation, and executive dysfunction, random hyperfixation (down to the words I send in my email.) 

I don’t know what to do with this, I can’t imagine a life in which all my energy goes to survival and little invested into my potential. Not to mention the disappointment, the stagnation, the weight and loneliness of living with mental health problems. I feel more dead than alive. It’s been a long road and I’ve always wished and worked different but I’m at the end of road. Things seems bleak…

181,I have a lot to unpack and I feel this is the best place for me to share,1,11x8w86,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11x8w86/i_have_a_lot_to_unpack_and_i_feel_this_is_the/,2,"Throwaway account because I'm not comfortable with the risk of someone I know in real life catching wind of this.

I know for a fact I have C-PTSD. 

It started out when I was as old as four years old as my mother would physically and emotionally abuse me just for acting like a kid and getting on her nerves. She herself most likely has undiagnosed mental issues as my mother's ill-temper was hereditary amongst her siblings. And I suspect, genetically passed on because her dad has had some wartime PTSD from serving in World War 2. I digress.

But ever since I was four to the age of twelve, my mother would physically and emotionally abuse me for not being able to do my math homework correctly. Because I struggled with math back in elementary school. And I should let the audience know that my parents had the bright intentions of starting my education career a year earlier than expected, against the advice of their friends and co-workers. Again, I digress. 

So I would remember many nights where she would slam my head against the kitchen table, pull my hair strands really tight, threaten to knife me, cook me in an oven, call me demeaning names and humiliate my intelligence sarcastically, (One memorable quote, probably: Bravo you stupid kid, you finally figured it out after 300 tries and now dinner is burnt because of you. If you get it wrong again, I will stuff you in the oven and we will eat you for dinner). She would also pinch me across my body, and would hang me upside down at home or in public places if I upset her. 

So the formative years that we call Elementary School/Primary School were a mess because of the way my mother treated me. I knew it was wrong, but I didn't want to say anything to any of my teachers because I just thought this was a normal thing that most kids went through.  

I was able to survive elementary school though because I had a group of friends who were there for me. They didn't know what was going on but they treated me like a regular kid. And that helped.

But then when it came time to enter middle school, things were rough because all my elementary school friends were going to different schools and I was going to a new middle school. And in all honesty, I probably would have coped if it wasn't for the second big bombshell in my life. And that bombshell being my dad having an affair with another woman for what I can imagine to be during the time that I was being physically abused.

I should now mention that I am the oldest child in my family for greater contextualization. So when I found out that my dad was having an affair, I assumed it was because of me. That I was a disappointment to him. That he didn't like the fact that I wasn't smart enough for him. That he couldn't tolerate to be at home while I was being beaten.

So ther I was in middle school, just trying to live my life. But the drama at home was too much to handle sometimes, so I had to retreat into my own world at school whenever I could. As a result, I closed myself off from making new friends for I was afraid of making new friends who would leave my life all over again. 

My parents argued for about two-three years. But to me, it still felt like an eternity. Throughout high school, I was always plagued with self-doubts about who I was and what I wanted to do with my life. I took a lot of high honors, AP courses, community college courses on the behalf of my parents: for I would have done anything to make them happy and stop them from fighting each other. 

But I got stressed out so much in high school with all the different classes and curriculum to keep up with. And it really messed me up because I couldn't allow myself to get anything less than an A grade. But juggling too many classes at once and I couldn't perform as much as I wanted to. So every year, my parents would rant at my academic performance. They always told me I could do better. But I struggled because I was still processing the events of my life from the ages of four to like fourteen? (I don't even remember how old I was exactly when they stopped hating each other and started ranting about my academic performance).

As for my high school social life, I was more social than I was in middle school. I made an effort to reach out to others. But I didn't have any genuine friendships with anybody in high school for I was afraid of developing any genuine relationships that turned out to be more duplictous. (most likely in a reaction to how my parents deviated from the standard norm of how parents should behave). 

Anyways, I got into college. And I thought that the nightmares would be over. I thought I could get a fresh start. I was studying a degree that my parents wanted me to study, for the degree I received was and still is economically viable. But I thought, being in college, I could put the past behind me.

I could not.

Not because of anything my parents did. But because of what other people did. 

While in college, I befriended lots of different people. Many of whom end up being domestic abuse victims or sexual abuse victims or individuals with economic disadavantages.

Hearing the stories of what other people went through actually made me angry. It made me want to take actiion, both means legal and illegal to ensure exact and just punishment. Of course, you can't just commit a crime and get away with it. But I've slowly started to learn in college, and still even now, that I hated to hear other people talk about their life issues with me not being able to do anything about it.

For, I've accepted that it's okay for me to endure whatever. I've rationalized I was just one person compared to the many out there who are in need of help or are currently suffering. And with the many people I befriended, I did my best to be there for my friends in time of need inspite of hardship. 

But now, this is where my problem lies. 

Do I like to help people because I genuinely find a joy and satisfaction in helping others? Or because I've been hurt before and I don't want others to be hurt again?

Also, I want to add this last bit in. 

I don't know how to prioritize myself. I've prioritized serving others first before myself. For again, I am just one man and there are millions more who could need me.

Yet as I grow older, I realize serving others constantly isn't helping. And it can be damaging without personal regulation. 

So where do I start telling myself, everything's okay exactly?",1679380241.0

There were times in my childhood where I was absolutely molested by my step brother that I knew was wrong and I knew how to communicate that to my parents. 

After moving away from home and having time to myself, I started piecing some things together about my dad. When we would visit my dad and get dinner, if I sat next to him in the booth in a restaurant, he would grab my thigh and squeeze (above my knee, but mostly my thigh). I would jerk and push him away and say stop, but he would do it again. I just kind of came to accept this from him. When walking into a restaurant, standing behind me, he would pinch my butt cheek. I never liked any of these touches. I always said stop. I don’t think my dad was being sexual with me or ever wanted anything like that, but it always made me uncomfortable and it continued through high school. 

I guess I’m looking for advice/information - I think this has def made me messed up in one way or another. There are other traumas involving my family that are more serious, but it’s like layers on a cake. I look back at these memories and feel so disrespected and damaged. I want to look more into stories like mine and how other people would feel about this scenario. Where would I start to search? It’s not molestation, is it? If you need more detail or want more info on my relationship with my dad I can share more.

How do you stop being a child if you literally feel like a child all the time... 

Each my reaction, thought and behavior is that of a 12-year old and I physically cannot change the way I percieve the world

I can pretend that I'm an adult for some time, I can do what adults do, but inside it never feels like I'm being my authentic self... Which is a 12 year old, like I said, so the only way of living that feels ""natural"" to me (in a good meaning of that word) is being childish, demanding people's attention, feeling entitled to love and affection, not doing ""adult"" stuff like phone calls/trying to find a job, etc. 

[Basically what promted this question was a conversation with my therapist when he said that if I want to meet my father I haven't seen in 10 years I have to do something MYSELF, because I can't expect him to contact me. So he said it's natural for a *child* to expect actions from others, especially from adults/parents, but since I'm not a child it's MY responsibility to contact my father if I want some closure. And like, yeah, that's 100% true, I have no problem with that on a logical level. But at the same time I know I just... won't do any of that. I'm not an adult. I'm a child. It's my father's responsibility to contact me and try to repair relationship. I feel an enormous amount of guilt and shame for perceiving the world that way, but I cannot change it.

i made the decision not to go, although i still need to cancel my flight. my boyfriend is really sad about this decision and i feel really bad. i want more than anything to be with him on our anniversary, but this anxiety became so bad. i was scared of something i couldnt explain, so much so that its more relieving to be without my boyfriend for nine days and miss our anniversary than it is to even think about going back home. i got so scared these nights that i needed magnesium, marijuana, and 2 benadryl to fall asleep. i had stress dreams that woke me up in the middle of the night breahtless when i already always wake up with tight shoulders and a tight jaw. ill be back for summer, but right now i am just very fragile and recovering from an eating disorder that i desperately want to relapse back into. the sick part of my brain is telling me i need to be alone forever and starve. i just need a little more time, i feel. my family makes my ED urges much worse.

i feel like im disappointing everyone. my family, my bfs family (who are the loveliest people i have ever had the pleasure of meeting) and my bf all want me to go home, and i want to acknowledge that kindness, but the thought is so terrifying and i feel so relieved that ive decided not to go. 

am i a bad person for this? my boyfriend was really sad and im really sad to miss our anniversary. i love him so much, and he conpletely understands why i dont want to go and he supports me unconditionally, but i hate seeing his sadness and disappointment. i really really do want to see him on our 1 year, but this fear of home that i cant even explain well is overriding that desire. do i need to overcome this fear? how bad is it to miss our one year all over some baseless anxiety? should i just suck it up and go? i feel so guilty.

188,Advice about ghosting abusers,10,11wpm7x,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11wpm7x/advice_about_ghosting_abusers/,8,"Hi all. I have never posted on Reddit before, but I am in need of advice currently. I wanted to ask my therapist about this topic before I did anything, but our next appointment is not for another 3 weeks and this situation has been causing me a lot of distress.

My CPTSD mainly stems from two different friendships I had during high school, which I feel like is already kind of uncommon for this specific disorder. The abuse I experienced happened 4+ years ago, and only recently have I processed through therapy and my CPTSD diagnosis that these two people were actually emotionally abusing me. We all went our separate ways for college, but we still keep in touch, sometimes texting in a group chat and occasionally meeting up in the summer time. 

Looking back, I should’ve ended these up friendships years ago. They are so emotionally draining, and both of these friendships made me think so little of myself for a majority of high school. It was only when I went to college that I was able to build confidence within myself. 

That being said, I’ve withheld a majority of feelings towards these two friends for our entire relationship. They have no idea how much I despise them because I was scared of how they would retaliate if I spoke up or rocked the boat at all. Now that I know that their behavior towards me was wrong, and that their behavior resulted in me developing CPTSD, I no longer want to be friends with them. 

Quite honestly, I just want to block them on everything and never speak to them again, but I don’t feel justified because everything happened so long ago. They haven’t done anything negative towards me in so long since we’ve drifted apart, but they still make comments about how we’re friends forever and we’re all going to be in each other’s weddings one day. I don’t even want them AT my wedding. 

I just need advice. Am I justified for wanting to ghost them, or do I owe them some sort of explanation? I feel like ghosting may seem mean and cowardly, but I’m just scared of their reaction to me essentially breaking up with them. One of the friends has also hurt me significantly more than the other, but they both played a part in abusing me, and I suspect they are both narcissists. I just feel so unjustified in ghosting both of them, even if I know all the terrible things they did to me.

Any help is appreciated. Thanks",1679334188.0

When I was 9 I discovered Roblox. And through Roblox I discovered a danger I could have never fathomed. At age 9 my childhood ended. At age 9 my fate changed so drastically. At age 9 I was taken advantage of and groomed by many older men. 

They told me to cut myself. They made me talk dirty. They made me send pictures. And I obeyed every order. They made rely on them to feel good. It’s weird to say out loud, but I think I had a sex addiction at 9. Although everything was virtual, I’d sext these men constantly. Every chance I’d get. I couldn’t lead a normal life with friends because my priorities were always to please and get praise from these men. 

They ranged in age. 12-60 I’d say. They didn’t care what age I was. And I didn’t care about theirs either. All I knew is that the attention and praise felt good and this was the only way I knew to get it. I was addicted to the attention. I was a whore. A child whore. It’s crazy to think there are still photos out there of me as a child. I did any sort of weird request they asked. The shame I feel now is immeasurable. 

My parents would always catch me, but I’d always find a way back online and new men to make me feel better about myself. This continued until I was 14. It only stopped because I had gotten a boyfriend. (Who then gave me ptsd anyways.) 

But for 5 years I couldn’t stop. Despite my whole family knowing. My dad even told my aunt and grandparents. I didn’t even realize until my aunt brought it up. I’ve never felt more guilt and shame. My own dad called me a whore. Asked me why I couldn’t just keep it in my pants. I didn’t know. I still don’t. I wish that instead of yelling at me they gave me the attention and praise I longed for. The love I could only find in those disgusting men. 

It feels like I lost my whole life. My trauma made me forget ages 9-14. And then right afterwards the boyfriend who made me forget gave me ptsd. Now I have horrible memory loss. I don’t remember my life. I don’t know who I am anymore. All I know is I’ve been a whore since a child. 

But the most horrible thing to come from this? Kinks. I had a rape kink because in our role plays I’d always be forced. I had an age play kink because I was always much younger than the guys. I say had. Because it’s not a kink anymore. I don’t find pleasure in it like I used to. I fantasize about being raped but I don’t enjoy it. I just want to be abused. I want to abuse myself. To make myself suffer. To have other people make me suffer no matter how bad the emotional and physical pain is. But why? I just want to be normal and I know this is far from it. 

I feel like a freak. I hate pain but at the same time I deserve it. I hate myself so much. My identity is my past because I have no future. The past is all I know about myself. Those men made me who I am. A mindless slave who obeys. I do whatever people expect of me because I don’t have a choice. How do I escape myself?",1679362743.0

I even unconsciously don't want to. Maybe my thoughts are suppressed. I hide it even from myself. I hide the pain I felt as a child. I disguise it like nothing happened. I'm maybe not ready to open up about it. It's really hard for me to open about my childhood but the pain caught me.

My childhood was lonely and without love. I always tried to make it the family I wanted. But I always miserably failed. I always pretend that everything is fine because I wanted it to be that way. But parents never were there for me and to this day they don't see what they failed to provide to me. I mean love and compassion. I was always left out. I always felt like life was happening to me and I couldn't do anything about it. I Couldn't change it I couldn't say a word. I was helpless. For fuck sake that's where my learned helplessness comes from. 
I never felt loved. I never even felt worthy to feel loved. I from the start always wanted to be better than I am so I deserve to be loved. I never get to accept myself for who I am. I always known I'm not enough. 
My mum is cold my dad is numbed by pills. My mum never received love and she never find a way to give it to me. I suspect that she always felt the same as me... As a burden. My mother feels like a burden in my life so she never spend much time with me. And my dad?  To make him to spend time with me??? Good god that was just a brutal secession of rejection and ignorance. He just destroyed me. Like what I have to go through to even get attention was brutal. Completely brutal and it always backfired on me. Hay dad let's go play football... Maybe tomorrow... Next week.... Next month.... Yeah uncle will come visit so we will wait for him. Do you see that the only way to preserve myself from all the pain was give up????  And I hate I always was the happy one so I get at least one look one smile but never more. I pushed my happiness to the limits and then I become annoying. I was unwanted and too much for them. I just give up on everything really early in life. 

There are things I want to say but I will continue later. I want to talk about my ways around bullies and how conforming and could loose myself almost sell so I don't get bullied. I always find ways to limit the way how people hurt me but not to never get hurt. 

Let's go in to more details. What I did all day was playing computer games, school was too overwhelming and nobody ever had patience to help me. I have dyslexia and everyone give up on me. I never ever was seen as some one clever or intelligent. I was the dumb useless and failure. My family talked to me with this in mind. I felt every single bit of this contempt. Whole family just scolded me again and again for how much I spent on computer. But they never did anything about it. Never helped me to do anything else. 

My problem with too much of responsibility. I always felt huge responsibility for my self. That's also why I covered my family and also was trying to make our family work. It was lost cause. But I felt so responsible for my school, mood, presentation of my self. I had to much responsibility and non ability to change it and make decisions. This is the reason why most middle managers burn out.... 🤣 I was experiencing it as a child.

I have failed myself in many ways. I've been breathing and surviving on movies and music.

She was paid to come and clean for me. So after a lot of encouragement (thank you again!) I complained to the boss and got another one. The second carer came once, cleaned with a wet tissue, left HER USED tissues on my table and also she was an anti vaxxer (ofc she was). So I waited til Friday two weeks ago and finally they send me a new carer. She seemed nice enough, drove me to get my brace for my broken leg and tidied up a bit (driving took a long time). She was supposed to come last Monday and then just ghosted me, didn’t answer, didn’t pick up the phone and I stood here with wet laundry. Had to leave it in the machine and wash again two days later bc I had no strenght anymore. She apologized and said she was in hospital to see her grandma. That’s no excuse though bc she could’ve just texted me and all good but she didn’t AND she ignored me for 3 hours before she told me she wouldn’t come. Then last Friday she was supposed to come. She didn’t but at least she texted bc she apparently spilled hot water on her hand (she send me pictures of her red hand and later of the bandage. So today she was supposed to get important prescriptions from two doctors, one of which closes at 4:30pm so we agreed she’d start at 4. At 5 I asked her if she got it all. No reply. At 5:30 I asked where she is. No reply. I called her 5 times. Two of those with my number hidden. No reply. It is currently 6:30pm. I left a voicemail for the boss and asked they call me back. I also told them on the voicemail what happened, that this was the third time in a row and that I’m furious. Last time I asked for a call back only and no one ever called back. I’ll call them tomorrow until they answer me but I feel sick to my stomach. Before you say I should get a new carer company, this can take many months since they’re all full.

I guess the idea was that once I have that settled, all problems are solved.

Despite restricting my energy in this way, I always felt overwhelmed and never really succeeded in the traditional sense. I just found workarounds.

Recently my work has caused my anxiety/depression/burnout to flare up, which forced me to think about what I'd do if I lost this job. I started thinking about therapy and disability insurance again.

What I seem to be noticing now is that I'm getting worse. Suddenly I doubt I can do this job at all anymore, I feel like I'm spiraling into complete helplessness and confusion. My executive functioning seems to be evaporating into thin air, I struggle to understand or communicate anything.

This is terrifying because I don't have good alternatives to this job. In all likelihood I will never have this kind of opportunity again. I need to keep this at least a few months longer. I would like to keep it even longer if part time were an option, although I'm no longer sure if part time would actually make a difference.

So now I'm wondering if I should just shut the door again. Stop thinking about mental health problems, stop thinking about disability. Stop thinking about not having hobbies and friends. Ignore the frustration and dissatisfaction for a little while longer.

Go back to just pushing through with will power.
It won't be nice, but I think I could do my job if I really try. I have done this for the last 1 years, ultimately even longer. Then in a few months, evaluate again. This will give me a lot of financial buffer due to the unique situation I'm in.

197,I hate it when people make excuses for religion/culture and say it's not the religion/culture's fault. Even though religions/cultures can and do encourage abuse,90,11w7osa,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11w7osa/i_hate_it_when_people_make_excuses_for/,25,"For example, I'm Chinese, and unfortunately my culture tolerates abuse a lot. No thanks to the whole filial piety shtick from that ancient Chinese con man named Confucius from 500 BC. Filial piety is just ""honor thy father and moyher"" on steroids. Filial piety teaches that if your parents are cruel and abusive to you, they have the right to be. Even though they technicaly shouldn't.  And you must still obey your parents no matter what. To tell the truth, this is why I don't feel proud to be Chinese. I'm not going to celebrate a culture that promotes child abuse.

Sadly, it seems Asians and non-Asians don't really understand. On one hand, you have Asians making ""jokes"" about it too much. You have Asians worshipping their parents and saying how ""grateful they are for the sacrificies their parents made."" (Ugh i winced saying that.) As if that excuses abusive toxic behaviors. You also have Asians defending the shitty parts of our culture, saying Asian culture is the best. Or if you're criticizing Asian culture, that automatically makes you ""racist"" and ""Oh its not all Asian culture's fault."" Um, except I never said its all my culture's fault? Just that it's my culture's fault for encouraging abuse? Asian culture does not deserve all of the blame, but neither does it deserve none of the blame.

On the other hand, you have non-Asians who make excuses for this. Non-asians who say things like ""Oh that's just part of Asian culture,"" as if that makes abuse okay or tolerable. And non-asians who think you're being ""racist"" when you're making valid criticisms of Asian culture. You just can't win.

But I disgress. Now for the religion part. It really pisses me off when I hear people say things such as ""That's not what the religion teaches!"" or ""The Bible/Quran/Book or Mormon teaches us to love others!"" As an Asian myself, I've heard people (including Asians) defend Confucius. For example, I've heard people say ""Confucius never taught blind obedience! He taught children should criticize their parents! And parents should be kind to their children!"" (Technically Confucianism is a philosophy, but it's also kind of a religion too because it teaches people to worship ancestral spirits and Heaven/Tian/天.)

As if that magically undoes the abuse we've suffered from religion? And that's not what religious abuse survivors were taught? Stop making excuses for the religion. Abuse survivors need your sympathy, not the religion. Religions can defend themselves. And I'm not saying all religious people are the problem. There's a difference between the believers and religion. Criticizing the religion doesn't mean you're criticizing all religious believers. Also, you can't just give religions all the credit but none of the blame. If a religion is responsible for good stuff, it is also responsible for the bad stuff. Let's not kid ourselves.

I knew her not very well but we were aware of each other. this person also has a history of abuse and i feel that i should do what I can for there safety. bit of backstory is I left my partner a few months ago because they were getting more controlling and I did not want to repeat apart of my abusive past when i left them they threatened suicide and engaged in stalking behavior and i ultimately had to flee. while we were together he was communicating with someone the person i had mentioned before they seemed to have a really good friendship just before i fled he metioned that she was fleeing abuse and he knew her location because he was someone that felt safe to her. Now having relocated I feel I should message them to let them know about this person as i think think from alot of what he has said is he has manipulated, abused, and done this to alot of people just to inform her and potentially make things safer or create more of an awarness . what has been holding me back is not knowing what they impact will be and knowing that lots of people who have been abused have an awareness and can start seeing warning signs about people and when something is about to go wrong. I am reminding myself that If I could see it she may be able to see it too and act accordingly. they have as far as i know never met in person but have a relationship online. asking for advice and more things for me to consider before I act.

he at first seemed like one of the kindest people i had ever met.

I also don't want to trigger her or unsettle her to a reality that someone she thought was safe isn't

Anything along the lines of self-compassion just doesn't reach me, but it's weird because I'm also desperate for it and even seek it out (I wanted to try compassion focused therapy, IFS, etc.) and more traditional approaches like CBT and DBT have often felt very invalidating and left me spinning and self-loathing. So it's not like I actually prefer a ""tough love"" approach, but every time anyone says anything comforting, or empathizes, or sympathizes or tries to help me be kinder to myself I feel like I cannot hear it and I just shut it out, laugh, and kind of want them to stop. Anyone know what this means or have the same issue? It's honestly difficult in therapy because any attempt at self-acceptance or self-compassion (or god forbid sympathizing or taking care of my inner child) is met by me with skepticism and resistance and literal eye rolling (I'm not rolling my eyes at my therapist consciously to be rude it's more like an involuntary reflex to discomfort).

This was a challenge for both of us, I am a control freak and he is scared of anyone behind a desk. The counselor advised him to stop all payments, so she could renegotiate the conditions for future payments, and that we could call or email her anytime we get new mail from the creditors. He even called her back last week to reaffirm this strategy, and she repeated ""Don't worry, you can always contact me if something happens.""

We got mail today, one of them says we have to react until Wednesday, in two days. I took pictures of the letters, put them in a PDF, and wrote an email to the counselor. I even wrote ""Good to know we have your support in this scenario.""

Ha fucking ha.

I get an automated one liner back ""I am on vacation, thanks for your understanding.""

No previous mention of her being away. No date until when she will be gone.

So naturally we both got highly triggered, my boyfriend shut down completely, couldn't communicate with me how to react now, which triggered me and got me into fight mode.

Hi guys, I hope you're doing okay. I just really needed to rant because this has been annoying me for weeks now. I've talked about  it to a friend and family member and while they do support me they just don't totally get it and seem confused so I wanted to vent where people would understand.

So, originally when I escaped my abusive house I had horrible memory loss. Basically nearly 15 years of random flashes. At that time as well, I didn't even remember at all that I had been SAed; nowadays I remember quite a lot more, still pretty bad, but I do remember the SA.

I'm just shaken up recently because I thought I remembered all of the SA events, but turns out I was wrong. My mother was mainly verbally/mentally abusive throughout the years, but for a few years as a toddler she was an alcoholic and had SAed and beaten me consistently. Turns out though she had done things when I was much older and also when she stopped drinking. But I only have flashes. It's enough to get an idea but it's practically haunting me because I can't remember exactly what.

I've had three flashbacks in the shower recently (related to the memory), to the point that I now have to hype myself up to go into the shower because everytime I go, I start to feel nauseous and those flashes come into my head. I just want to remember it so I can get the processing over with and start working on it, if that makes sense? Past times for SA memories, I've had flashes like this, and then at some point it just clicks and I remember. So I'm sick of this, whatever this is. I don't want to know really because it's just another reminder of how she's a monster and that I suffered but at the same time, I will probably remember just like the times before, so I just want to get it over with already. It's dragging out so much longer than before. From the flashes, it's more horrible than the other memories so, maybe that's why it's taking so long. But I hate hate hate this process. It's so tiring. This week has been exhuasting. I've had to cancel so many plans because my body is just tense and I keep dissociating and just lying down doing nothing. I'm not mad at myself for that or anything, I'm just tired. I want to remember already just so that at least this cycle of symptoms can stop.

***Are you going to shoot up a school? Are you an incel? We're going to see you in 10 years in a bombing, right? You know you give off all the traits of a serial killer, right? Wait, you own guns? Oh no...***

I've heard these and more over the past year or so. I'm 24, and my CPTSD comes from being homeschooled/completely isolated in a collapsing trash heap of a house belonging to hoarder parents for 20 years, with no escape and no way to leave the property. Emotional abuse and other stuff too. Needless to say, I couldn't work on my game out there.

People say ""no one cares about your virginity"", but clearly those people are wrong. Once people can tell you've never been in a relationship they label you with weirdo and judge you according to that, which is what really hurts.  Don't get me wrong, I want to have sex like most people, but I'm not in a place to go out hitting on women -- it's simply just not that high on my priority list of things I need to do/fix about my life. Yet others seem to view that as bizarre. Am I supposed to be insecure and feel some sort of pressure to have sex? Isn't that what turns incels into incels?

And the comfort people give to virgins is just as insulting and hurtful. *It just takes time. Get a hobby! Women are normal people too! Getting a relationship is easy. Groom yourself more. Work out. Go to therapy. Meditate.* I meditate. I have many hobbies. I groom myself better than most. I work out. I go to therapy. I know women are people.  It's as if the people saying this stuff are implying that if you're a virgin, you have to be a stinky, muck-covered rage-filled fool who goes around slapping women on the ass.

And then incels will say being hot is all that matters. Well, news flash, it isn't. I'm attractive, tall, etc -- I've had women compare me to Michelangelo's works of art and frequently receive random compliments from people I'm helping at my job. But being attractive makes the shame worse, as that means 100% without a doubt the issue is with my personality.

I didn't care about any of this because I knew it wasn't my fault, but now that people are poking at it more and more often it's starting to wear me down.",1679250850.0

About two weeks ago I ended up in a situation that led to spending a night at the acute psychiatric ward. Nothing too special. I was not doing ok. But at least I was able to tell staff to please stop doing something that I *know* (and they should know, from previous hospitalisations) is a guaranteed way of getting flashbacks. They didn't stop. No, they even went out of their way to do more of it. And tell me to ""stop acting"". And that's among the nicer things that were said. I don't know for how long I dissociated. Long enough for the next shift to come on. They were trying to be helpful, but the damage was done -and worsened by an extremly condescending psychiatrist.

Luckily I was allowed to go home that morning, but since then flashbacks to and feelings from a decade ago have intensified, in addition to having this recent event on repeat in my mind. I've been breaking down trembling and crying almost every day since, and don't know how to deal with this at all. Being too afraid to be able to get more than 1-3h of sleep pr. 24h doesn't exactly help, either. Asking healthcare for help is not really an option, as I'm far too scared of ""them"" after the recent incident to be able to do so.

It feels like I'm breaking down. Disintegrating. Disappearing into a fog of hyper-fear. Wasn't doing well before, but now I usually don't even know what the next hour will bring.

20 yrs ago they decided to take a massive risk moving to a new country just cuz their peers were doing that, and on the surface it was about giving me a better life, it was all a lie, a facade to conceal the truth, they just wanted to keep up with joneses, turn me into a success so they can feel better about themselves thru comparing me with other kids. 

It was a massive risk for me, losing all my friends and family, not speaking the language or fitting in at school, living in devastating poverty for many years, suffering abuse at home and bullying at school, lacking basic resources to live a healthy life, they robbed me of my time and money, spent child care benefits on themselves for school/living expenses. 

If I had agency, the capacity to make my own financial & life decisions, and saw the risks of what they were about to put me thru by moving to a new country, I would’ve never allowed it to happen, since it was taking a massive risk with my future, and if things didn’t work out, they have much less to lose than me.

I feel like my efforts to do it are all for naught.  I feel pressured because of all the abuse I've received in the past from my father, who has often accused me of not liking my own African-American heritage, but would turn right around and tell me that I shouldn't straighten or add hair for braids. That, along with pressure from peers and family members of my own race have made feel like I'm unkempt, especially since I'm not good at upkeep on my hair. 

I've been natural for over 10 years. I've tried to do my hair regularly, but haven't been able to do it properly.  I've often felt like certain natural hairstyles don't look nice on me because of my face and have defaulted to doing updos for years, which I've gotten tired of. Due to my father's influence, I often felt like I had to brute-force hairstyles without tutorials and would notice that my hair would still have bushy ends, strands sticking out, etc. This has left me discouraged many times. I've also let other people dictate how my hair should be done. For example, comments from an aunt and cousin (I live with relatives) about my hair have made me angry or depressed.  It doesn't matter to them the efforts I make to do my own hair, because if it looks imperfect or wonky in some way, I haven't done it right or I didn't do what I said I did. So I'd either take their 'advice' and go back to square one or might give up on my current efforts. (Another aunt lovingly reminded me that my hair is mine and if something works for me, I should do it.)  

I've had the most positive results with my hair in the last three years, though. I've learned that I have all three subtypes of Type 4 hair.  I'm starting to embrace looking up tutorials for the simplest of hairstyles and seeing the results is uplifting. I'm experimenting with different hair products to see what works FOR ME (Sauve Naturals on wash day. THE SLIPPAGE YALL. THE INSTANT DETANGLE) And I've been getting help by getting my hair professionally done (mainly braided) around once every month to month and a half. And that's great. It's just that whenever I have to do my own, due to the pressure I feel, how long my hair takes to get done and how many times my hair has looked 'imperfect' (not to mention my weakened strength from a surgery I had), I've started to spiral. So the day ends and my hair is still unwashed or unfinished. I hate the fact that I'm nearly 30 and still don't want to do my hair on a regular basis and feel like I'm constantly getting judged, especially by those who refuse to acknowledge that my mental health is strongly impacting my feelings.",1679344069.0

227,Am I having flashbacks?,2,11wu7k3,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11wu7k3/am_i_having_flashbacks/,4,"After 14 years I’m (F 25) finally asking for help with my mental health after experiencing what I think were some panic attacks. I’m only now able to accept what I went through was ‘trauma’ and ‘childhood abuse’.

When I told my GP (General Practitioner) he asked me if I get flashbacks, I instinctively said no. He’s referred me onto an organisation that help people with ptsd trauma. This was a surprise to me but I guess I never thought about what my diagnosis is. I’m new to getting help and have never tried to diagnose myself. 

When I think back to saying no to getting flashbacks I am second guessing myself. When I think of flashbacks I think of something very strong coming over you and thinking and feeling like you are there again and not being aware of your surroundings and maybe smelling or hearing things but I don’t get that. 

There are times however, where I will just be reflecting on life when I’m at home, especially now i’m worried about what sort of questions I’ll be asked by a therapist where and I remember an awful memory. I kind of go through the scene in my head like I’m processing it again (an example is when a family member grabbed a knife and pointed it at themselves screaming at me to stab them if I hated them so much). I don’t necessarily feel emotional I feel kind of numb like I can’t believe I’ve been through experiences like that then I kind of get in my head that I must be broken or faulty. When I remember memories I can hear the voice clear as day of the person who abused me but I can’t smell something or see a vision. What’s the difference between just remembering something and a flashback? 

(What is very strange is when I had my first panic attack about 1 month ago that was triggered by an item that reminded me of a memory that I feel extremely ashamed about and just remembering it made me so embarrassed and shameful that my heart started racing as if i just raced someone. Not sure if that one was a flashback?) 

Sorry if my questions sound ignorant I just haven’t been diagnosed and haven’t talked to anyone yet and I’m just confused.",1679342997.0

229,I have been an ANP pretty much all my life!,2,11wt7t1,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11wt7t1/i_have_been_an_anp_pretty_much_all_my_life/,3,"Wow, what a day!

I've met my ANP... I think.

Well, actually, I've been an ANP all my life, at least most of the times when I'm with people. Doesn't matter with who. Anyone, basically. 

I noticed that when I meet people I put up a front. I'm fine, all's good. Smile. Even with therapists. Yet, with therapists the wounded part comes out sometimes, but not as it is but indirectly through the ANP, who more or less describes the woundedness of the wounded part, the wounded inner child, the exile, or whatever names there are.

I can even be in the middle of an emotional flashback in the woods - when I meet ppl I can stop crying almost immediately, dry my tears, blow my nose and smile when I pass them, then I start again. The ""front"" works well. 

Two weeks ago my T wanted me to ""tell my story"", make a narrative from one of my traumatic experiences and then have me process it. That was when my front came out, told the story, or part of the story, like a machine, the facts, but not the emotions. And I was thinking about this earlier today and thought, yeah, this is when my ANP wants to keep me safe, when I am like this I cannot bring in the emotions bc ANP doesn't feel them bc they are not part of ANP. ANP is me without the trauma parts. That's why. ANP cannot notice them. That's the function of ANP - to get me through life without noticing and feeling my little and bigger trauma parts.

ANP comes out when I need to function in public. ANP is highly functional; ANP can even be very good with ppl, fun, outgoing, social, curious. ANP becomes dysfunctional when situations remind ANP of trauma stuff - that's when ANP begins to flounder, the front crumbles, ANP notices that something isn't quite right. That's when the defense mechanisms jump in: either acting in as the critic, the toxic introject, beating down everything that's acting up, sometimes even with brute force, i.e. self-harm. Or acting out, becoming aggressive, moody, then retreating or fawning. Or the perfectionist enters the picture, trying to control ambiguity with planning, perfecting; trying to keep me busy, trying to keep trauma parts from awareness. I need to be good, I need to be perfect, I must not act up, must not annoy anyone, lest I get hurt, laughed about, ridiculed, shamed.

Ooh, emotions not allowed, no, no. Too dangerous!

I've been thinking when I've ""felt my feelings"" that something has been missing. When ppl say, ""the only way out is through"", how do I know when I'm through? I've felt my feelings to much in my emotional flashbacks, wanting my little one to fully come out, tell their story, get heard, yet I always thought there was something missing. I've always felt, ""there's no one there"". I want someone to be there with me when I feel my feelings. Yet it always feels like there's no one there! 

And just now I've been thinking, yes, of course! It's true. I am missing. I am not there for myself. The ""someone"" that I've been missing is my whole self. ANP is not enough. ANP is not whole, ANP cannot provide what I need, what my little one needs. It needs someone to be there with them when it gets tough, yet ANP cannot be there. Only the whole, adult me can be there, but that is never the case bc that adult is hardly ever present. My wish for someone to be there with me is my unconscious wish to be whole; I felt that something was missing, that parts of me are missing, that I am not whole, that parts of me are dissociated, or have been dissociated. Little me woke up, and now I am desperately trying to become whole, but I don't know how. 

My mom wasn't there for me when I was little, so I never really fully introjected this ""being there for me"". I've been waiting for myself to be with me, but I cannot. Little me needs someone there but senses it's not me, cannot be me bc I'm not there. Little me can feel I am not there and feels as abandoned as before.  So feeling my feelings means abandonment over and over again with every emotional flashback. 

I've been wondering today what it means to feel my feeling, how do I know that I'm doing it ""correctly""; when the only way out is through, how will I know that or once I'm through? I don't. To me it seems it doesn't work. I mean I feel like I never get to the other side. My feelings are never worked through, felt enough, validated enough, seen enough, heard enough. I am never enough, never whole. Forever front. Forever ANP.  Only part of what can be. Part of whole.

Well, now, ""poetry"" aside, what now? How to become whole?

Partly IFS, partly ego state therapy, partly schema therapy, CBT - oh, fun, when done by an ANP that cannot and doesn't want to see little me, its pain. It's like appointing a wolf to herd sheep. At least, there is some part of me that sees this. That's probably adult me. That needs to become more present in therapy when little me starts screaming and the front appears (not DID tho), trying to protect all of me from shame, humiliation, ridicule, and abandonment.

Oh wow, something to talk about with my T tomorrow...",1679340958.0

Not to mention while I’m working, my depression begins to worsen quickly to the point of me genuinely considering suicide every waking moment (this is around when I quit, take a 3-8 month break doing odd jobs here and there, and back to working until I’m at suicidal state again). And from the beginning, I can’t seem to keep up with any housework or selfcare like eating, bathing, brushing my teeth, and doing hobbies.

There's an overwhelming abundance of issues in me that I'm struggling to sort out in my egg baked brain. I just want to get my life going and to finally be ""grown up"" and get what needs to be done, done. However I'm finding I'm absolutely useless to the point it's humiliatingly pitiful. With all these mental blocks I could build myself my own personal home, retire early and get into stocks and bonds or whatever responsible adults do these days.

I'm on my own out here for the most part, reaching out to the people immediately available around me feels impossible, I do not feel safe nor trust them. As much as Id like to, let me stress how much I wish I could trust them, I just can't. Even though things seem different now(arguably better now Im an adult and semi independant w/ minimal paying job), they happen to have a heavy hand in the reason to this distressing mental paralysis of sorts, and thats something I realize with grief rather than resentment.

I want to be able to just rip out and detangle the root cause as to why I'm not actually doing what I feel I need to do in order to be the better more functional adult I know I need to be. And that usually involves digging into the ""whys"", where did these behaviors come from? And what does healing look like for me? Feels like I've always been rushing to fix this shit on my own like this as a kid. And if it were so straight forward as to reflecting my own past, I wouldnt be here typing and going back to my usual of just barely making it.

It's difficult to really lay out my own story on paper, and even in my own head. It feels like I have several perspectives in my brain on what happened to me and how my childhood went(and this is with so little memory that reliably escapes me). And when I write it out one way there's always other parts of me that range from wanting to nitpick or straight up delete and restart. It's just never ""right"", for a multitude of reasons that stem from shame, anxieties about potentially lying, exaggerating, or worse lying to myself to make myself out to be some victim. For attention maybe(I call these paranoias). But to be blunt, I never enjoy the reactions I get when I open up about what I can remember, I usually end up shutting down the moment I see someone upset. I feel endless guilt for some of the reactions I brought out, even if I can no longer clearly remember their faces or what was said, I still hold onto that shame I was the cause and that interaction couldve gone better if I had just shut up or lied.

Itd just be nice to just have another reliable account to my past or to speak for me sometimes. Someone who has no reason to lie to me or themselves to feel better. It's not like I feel I can rely on my own memories at all. I still have that need to talk about what I think I can remember, very desperately I wish to be understood preferably by someone safe(Ive tried therapy, but I could never get across what my needs were, im looking into a new one as of late, we have yet to start but hoping it works out better and they can help sort out my brain). But for what I think I can remember, to put it plainly, is very damning on those close in my life. I feel guilty about these experiences even though I virtually have no control over it, and more so that I can't speak of them with confidence as I can barely remember until recently. I just always knew something awful happened, and my body remembers more than I do. It reacts before me sometimes, I say things I don't understand, and it's like my body isnt my own when I'm too anxious. 

I find myself struggling to explain my actions, I may not even have clear memory of these actions at times. These actions arent always harmful, just straight up weird, ""out of character"", childish, and maybe sometimes it got me into situations Im not comfortable with. I dont date anymore due to the sole reason I find myself ""snapping back"" into place, as if suddenly realizing myself in the middle of getting intimate and the vibe for me is ""killed"" for a reason I cant comprehend. And for whatever reason, even though Im no longer comfortable with the situation, I feel the urge to ""keep up the act"", like everythings fine and normal. Ive gone and retraumatized myself because of this. Its just not ideal.

I find myself always struggling to put up an act, like I'm picking up after someone left the stage with little to no script, but the show must go on. As if it'd literally kill me if I didn't. There's nothing more terrifying than having someone suddenly realize just how stupidly vulnerable and fragile I truly am. Or that confusion I'm met with and I have no way to explain what just happened away. I cant say I necessarily completely forget what was just said or done, but when these things happen I cant reliably look back the few seconds before after these ""snaps"" because its like looking through a fog. The memory is already fading into murky waters and who knows if itll resurface, certainly not in that moment most vital.

It's just a lot of issues. So many it's hard to deal with. I find myself wishing for a little guidance in these moments of confusion or depression. Something to set my head back on straight because I got places to be, things to do, I'm running behind in the big rat race and I do have an idea of what I want for my future. I want to be datable, and I want to be a good partner and hopefully one day a good parent after experiencing more life and resolving my own issues so I dont pass it on. I'm getting older, my twenties are escaping me and I'm not happy how Im not financially stable yet or how little these ""self-help"" tutorials are actually doing anything for me. Im a college drop out because I couldnt handle it. Am I just lazy? Am I too comfortable where I am now? I somehow doubt that because even if I lost what blessings I have now that keep me from homelessness, I'll still struggle to thrive or to find it in me to function any better.

What in the world can I even do for myself here? Am I just destined to succumb to my suicidal ideation? Im not trying to alarm anyone by saying this because, please just dont, but some days suicide does make sense. I dont want to die. Preferably I get my shit together and I find myself in my own little home of my own making, and I can spend my days playing games, writing, and chatting with friends. It just feels like an impossible dream right now when Im exhausted all the time and tackling with this bullshit inside my own head. I dont even want much from life, just some sense of stability, safety, and good people to be around when Im lonely. I dont want to be anything bigger than I am, to be known, or to be the stereotypical successful adult climbing the coorperate ladder. It sounds so draining and bleak, this life I feel like Im supposed to be striving for, its something my parents will be proud of i think(or maybe not, I dont think theyll ever be proud of me actually, Ill always be that useless leech Ive always been since birth). I dont actually want to be all that grand even if it leaves few things to be said at my funeral. Id be happy with the lowly job i have now if only it provided a life of independance. It just doesnt, and i need to reach out for more, to be better than I feel I am truly able.

Im just not able. And as embarrassing as it is, thats just the reality. And im stuck with what Im supposed to do about it on my own. And I really wish I didnt feel like I actually NEEDED to be coddled sometimes.

So he confronted my parents, and me too though of course I'm on his side.

They...didn't have much of a reaction. They didn't really care. And my brother pointed that out, that they didn't care. Which made my stepmom mad. 

She then went on to tell us about how when my brother and I were little she would be the only one who cleaned the house, and all the other adults in the house didn't clean. 

I believe her. But at the same time I know there's always more to the story.

She was mad at the suggestions that we now clean, saying she didn't have time, or energy, etc. 

I even told them that I need it. I'm a hoarder, it won't get better if I don't have someone helping me now otherwise it's going to get to absurd levels. 

I told her Blair was in the same situation she was in all those years ago, and wouldn't she want to prevent that from happening?

Of course my stepmom kept taking everything I said and either being dismissive or taking it personal. And of course she had to come in with the ""I clean up after all your messes"" 

I...just want them to be supportive. But it feels like it's just easier for them to turn the other cheek with their own justifications.

Father - Sexually abused as child. Ended up becoming a legalistic self righteous alcholic Christian who hit their children if they didn't immediately do what he asked. For example, he once randomly demanded that I immediately sweep a large driveway just when he saw me when I was 11. When I mentioned I was hungry he hit me. This was his typical behavior. Including hitting me for accidently dropping a plate. Never telling us why we are being hit. Never talking to us children just talking at us. Never any help with schoolwork. He abandoned the family several times, screaming matches with wife everyday. Daily beatings for the children.

I developed CPTSD. He has expressed regret with what he did but also throws in comments blaming demons for my mental issues. Such as developing asthma at Age 3 which is a stress response. I was sent to leg with a broken leg age 3 after I was hit by a vehicle one time and the household was far from safe and peaceful for me so come the fuck on. 

I am torn between cutting him off for continued gaslighting and accepting his remorse and that he is my father. 

Brother - Abusive juvenile bully behavior for years. When I tried to sort out with him he gaslighted me, telling me I am making things up. Then just said sorry you were hurt by these jokes. Continues to gaslight and behave self righteous. 

Brother was abused as all children were in this family. Has shown some remorse. Has chronic fatigue and major memory issues. So very likely lacks the capacity to remember things like a normal person which I believe is a large reason for the gaslighting. 

Torn between cutting off for gaslighting and being a self rightous arrogant douche bag and having some mercy on him due to his illness and history of abuse. 



As I have CPTSD. I do find I get flashbacks seeing them especially when they invalidate and gaslight me as this is connected to the abuse I suffered as a child.

239,My story,1,11wxzm0,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11wxzm0/my_story/,1,"(I'm reposting from David Goggins subreddit)

&#x200B;

 

Hi everyone,

I am a 44-year-old father of two amazing kids and husband to an amazing wife. I want to share my story with you, hoping that it can inspire guys like me.

My story began during my mother's pregnancy when my father hit her a couple of times, causing me to shiver inside her womb. My first childhood memories were of the hits I received from my cruel and brutal father. He worked in moving and weighed 240 pounds, making it even harder to endure. My mother was also subjected to his abuse, and one of the most traumatic events was when I saw him choke her when I was 10 years old, she almost died.

I suffered from this abuse throughout my childhood until I was 17 years old, including emotional abuse and neglect. After I joined the army, I almost shot him when he was very close to hitting me again. Only today do I understand how much stress and anxiety I experienced and still do.

Shortly after my army service, I developed an autoimmune disease called Myelitis , which caused me to use a wheelchair for a few weeks. After recovering, I started training again, doing gym workouts and running.

From 2001 to 2006, I worked in the center of Jerusalem, where terrorist attacks were frequent. I was close to most of them and to this day, I am hypervigilant from every loud noise. But I didn't let any of this stop me from becoming a better person. I started working in the high tech industry and became an expert and manager in my field. I also ran in 10km competitions, and in my late twenties, I met my wife. My traumatic childhood caused me a lot of problems in my relationships, but I am still married, and my wife still loves me, and I love her. I am lucky.

When I was 39 years old, another autoimmune attack came, and I was diagnosed with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). It was even harder than the previous one, and I got a drop foot (100%). My hands also became very weak, and my whole body was affected. I was hospitalized for two months, and during this time, I got meningitis, causing me to lose 24 pounds.

During my hospitalization, I was diagnosed with two other autoimmune diseases - Hashimoto's (hypothyroidism) and Behçet's (the incomplete version). I was under high prednisone dosage (corticosteroid) - about 60 mg per day for more than a year, and I tapered down for three more years. For the first two years, I also did several cycles of Mabthera.

One week after my release from the hospital, I went back to work, managing my team and completing the internal data platform of my organization. At the same time, I got back to training, but it was awful. I couldn't even hold the pull-up bar, and my biceps were so weak that I couldn't do biceps curls of 8 pounds. I couldn't walk without a brace for my drop foot for almost four months. But I didn't give up. I started meditating, doing guided imagery, and using cannabis, which really helped me, especially with my mood and neuropathy. However, I stopped using cannabis last month as it stopped working and caused a lot of loops and paranoia.

About a year later my leg became better, as well as most of my body parts. It was very hard to train, but still, I kept grinding.

Throughout all this time, there has been one movie playing in my head - running the Jerusalem Marathon (10km). I ran it a few years back, and I can still remember every single meter of the course. Ever since that day, I have been imagining running it again someday.

During this time, I came across David Goggins and his first book, along with his Joe Rogan interview. I was incredibly inspired by his story, particularly given that he had suffered from domestic violence. I could relate to his struggles and hardships, and his success story motivated me to train harder. I have seen a great deal of progress since then, with improvements in my pull-ups (I am now able to do 16 reps), bicep curls (up to 36 pounds in each hand), and kettlebell exercises (using 16kg kettlebells for almost all exercises).

However, over the past year, I have been experiencing some sort of mental regression. Memories from my childhood and my insecurities have resurfaced, and I found myself in a deep depression. I was unable to think clearly and felt hopeless, my sleep was very poor (2-3 hours). Despite this, I continued to train. Eventually, I began psychotherapy and was diagnosed with CPTSD (complex post-traumatic stress disorder). Medications and therapy have helped me immensely, and although I still have my ups and downs, I am in a much better place mentally these days.

One month ago, I went to the park and started running while listening to one of Goggins' motivational videos. After running for about a mile, I began to consider quitting, but Goggins' voice continued to push me forward. As I passed the 5km mark, I heard him say: *“Life ain’t about medals, ain’t about fucking certificates.It ain’t about houses, money, cars,fame, all that bullshit. It’s about scars. So when you get judged, you won’t get judged on your medals, you get judged on your scars. Those scars show your willingness to get to the side, They show your failures, they show your willingness to start from scratch. They show what you’re wanting to do, to go the distance, to see what you’re capable of. So make sure in life don’t be afraid to get scars.”*

It touched my inner self and almost made me cry. I continued to run and eventually completed 10km, which was the first time in 7 years since I had last done it. It was then that I realized how much power was inside me.

After this experience, I decided to register for the Jerusalem Marathon. On the day of the race, I drove there with my wife. A few minutes before the race, she wished me well and “have fun” and I replied, ""Honey, I'm not going to have fun here. I'm going into battle, and even if the sky falls, I won't stop running."" As soon as the race began, I encountered many tough slopes on the course, as Jerusalem is built on mountains that are approximately 800 meters high. Despite the challenging track, I didn't give up, recalling every step from my imagination. I knew exactly how difficult it would be, but I never stopped running, not even for a second. Eventually, I completed the 10km race.

It was one of the most significant moments of my life, and I hugged my wife and thanked her for all her support. A few hours later, I emailed my neurologist and thanked him for his amazing treatment during the years. Many of my friends also sent their love. I had finally achieved my dream, and now I am going to create new ones.

This is my story, and I hope it will inspire and bring hope to others.

My parents are always worried and fearful. They just dont really let me take any risks. I usually had to sneak around, but it made it hard to succeed in certain things because I know I have no support. I just never take any risks because I feel like they will react with so much fear. Its really hard to succeed when you are always trying to mitigate risk . Lately I am always nervous about having a good career because I am afraid to break my comfortable routine.",1679254519.0

A memory came back because my therapist said 'it feels unsafe to feel safe'.

That's exactly it.

When I feel safe, I'm worried about it being taken away in a way I can't predict. It's why I struggle to sleep so much. Being asleep is when I'm most vulnerable.

My dad used to wait till I was asleep. Then he'd rip the covers away and dump a pot of freezing water on me. He'd be screaming at me, and I'd be terrified and confused and cold and couldn't work out what he was saying. 
I could barely catch my breath for fear and shock. 

He'd yell at me to sort the bed out, and he'd leave me to it. I'd strip the bed and have to put towels down before the sheets because the mattress would be wet. Then, id changed my clothes and did whatever it was he said I'd not done.

Usually, it was missing a dish or something when I was washing up. Often, it was nothing at all. I'd ask him what I did, what did I do and he'd say 'you know what you did'....

I'd never usually know",1679335912.0
242,Another post inspired me to make a list of media that I enjoyed/helped depression and is mostly wholesome or not too gritty! If you add to the list please use explanations (don't just name dump!),8,11wf6yj,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11wf6yj/another_post_inspired_me_to_make_a_list_of_media/,2,"* **Groundhog Day** \- very uplifting romantic comedy with Bill Murray. Does have dark humour scenes about suicide, but I feel it's done in a non triggering way and the film is overall very good feeling. One of the few movies they repeat on Australian TV but I don't get sick of it (haven't watched tv for about a decade, but I remember them playing it a lot)  

* **Enola Holmes** 1 & 2 great action adventure. Has fight scenes, and is a murder mystery - but mostly done in uplifting, spirited manner that I really enjoyed, kept me entertained entire movie. I loved Henry Cavil as Sherlock Holmes too. Imagine a sort of Sherlock Holmes mystery but done with a Disney tone to it. Makes some of the darker themes palatable and it's a good romp.  

* **Amelie** Really fun French film that was popular in the 2000s, watched it again this year and it is still as charming as I remember. **Big INFP vibes!** The only thing is there are a few nude/sex scenes/flashes of nudity that don't last very long at all, but might upset some people. It's a strange but uplifting movie. Great piano music, feels a bit like a Tim Burton movie even though it was not created by him. Great for the art student/creative type! Millennials would most likely know it well, but older/younger generation may not have seen it - so recommended.  

* **Yes Man** This is a great movie for anyone stuck in a rut, as it is all about breaking out of stagnation and trying new things. I would say there is a stupid scene near the start that implies Jim Carey gets a sexual act done on him by an old lady (but they both enjoy it if that helps?), but that is all I remember, and it wasn't triggering to me just a bit low brow comedy. The only warning is this movie is for people who have put boundaries up so high they are more like walls and fortresses. The ""say yes to life"" message could be great for people like that, but it may be very unhelpful for someone who has trouble saying no! Quite zany and awesome. I need to watch this again as I could do with getting the message into my brain as I'm prone to being the folded arms ""no"" guy he was at the start. Very funny imo.  

* **Moana** One of the few Disney Pixar movies that was more about the music, adventure, uplifting story than trying to be as sentimental and emotionally heart wrenching as possible. Don't get me wrong, I love Pixar, but lately it's like they want everything to be a tearjerker festival ever since ""Wreck it Ralph 2 "" (had me in uncontrollable sobs IN PUBLIC, that movie destroyed me) and the awesome but gut-punch ""Inside Out"" it seems they are unsafe for my depression.  
But Moana is safe, fun and toe-tapping. I don't feel emotional wrecked afterwards, I feel soaring and upliftment!  

* **Whisper of the Heart** This is a feel good Studio Ghibli. I love Studio Ghibli but like Pixar - some of these seemingly innocent films can really hit the depression strings too hard!   
It's why I love this one so much as it made me feel inspired, and want to do some creative writing! It's an awesome book and vaguely linked to ""The cat returns""  
That's it for now. Please don't add things that have happy parts or endings but the rest is sad/a struggle. So no ""oh but it gets better in the end""  We want a list of really high energy, mostly constantly uplifting movies that will leave people feeling inspired, warm, happy! Things with minimal triggers or none.  

* Please let me know more media that is consistently a feel good time! :0) Tell me if you watched and enjoyed any of these!",1679308730.0

I never felt any comfort, emotionally, from her. After so many years trying to reach her, I just do not give a f*ck. I understand why she was the way she was, and why she was not able to be there for me in a meaningful way, but at this point I have enough meaningful relationships that I spend time and energy caring about. 

Why try out of a sense of obligation? Can anyone relate? She still makes really passive efforts, like texts asking yes or no questions.

Two days ago i asked them when do i see them again and they could come over after they go to two events but they dont know when they will come and that they are happy to see me then. When i said yes come no matter at which time i want to see you and miss you he started to say they are insecure because they will drink and they dont know how long they will stay at the party. I told them to come whenever it doesnt matter.
They seemed to be concerned about the fact they they would smell of alcohol maybe and that it would be weird and that they think its weird etc. 
in the end they came and all the time they said they think its so weird to come at me like this etc etc.
At some point i felt so bad telling them they should come and i felt so bad for waiting for them that i apologized. 
They said that it was nice(they slept the whole time and when awake they stayed only 10 min and had to go again) but rationally it would have been better to go home.
Then afterwards they told me they need to talk to me because they like me and they want to tall to me about it in person.
I felt really weird and confused by their behavior and when they asked me what im doing this evening i responded to them that im overthinking and if they want they can come over.
I lied awake for a response but nothing and they were online. They just decided to ignore my message and to me also my feelings of missing them. 
The next day i got a message with sorry i needed sleep. 
To which i replied you could have written me back that you dont want to come over and not let me think that maybe you will come again to which they replied that im stressing them because i said that and that they needed sleep because they got 1/2 hours less sleep because of me when they came to my home the night prior.
I feel really bad and guilty. 
I just feel like they dont really want to see me and that they put the blame on me.

I do look much younger than I am. From the start it was clear this was not going anywhere.  But it was the first time in a long time I really clicked with someone and he felt the same.  So after calling, gaming and texting for about two months we met and it was really,  really good.  Since then we've seen each other 5 weekends and even spent almost a week together.  But while it was great in many ways it also started to hurt.  He lives in a small town and when we went out he was always cautious no one he knew saw us holding hands (it would be told to his parents). Also he made it clear on various occasions,  that there would never be more for him than that.  And while my head understands that,  my heart felt heavier with each visit.  So today I told him that this is not working for me. What I did not say is I need someone who is proud of having me by his side - who wants me as a partner.  I deserve that. 

He was very understanding and asked if we could keep texting and talking.  Also we have tickets booked to see each other in April - once I'll go there and once he'll visit here.  They are non- refundable and I do want to see him again.  Maybe we can make that friends without benefits work,  I don't know.  I just know that right now I am hurting bad.  But we do care for each other and he has become a really good friend.  I don't want to lose that.  This is really hard and I hate myself for getting into this situation when I KNEW (deep down)  it would end up hurting me.

It burns, it’s painful and hurts and then my entire world gets disoriented and I get stuck in a terrifying thought loop. The problem is, it's gets stuck like this for months and years. I always felt like my brain is broken or amydlaga is damaged beyond repair. Sometimes I just feel like a floating head riddled with torment and head pain of racing thoughts.

I remember having my first emotional break when I was a teen and was given medication that drove me in to the worst panic attack : death feeling, existence anxiety. It was a one time occurrence that broke mentally and emotionally for the last 15 years. This caused my first ever head pain and forehead distress mixed with panic , worry ocd. 

I have finally been exhibiting child hood trauma excerizes and just today noticed my head clearing a tad bit and old joyous memories resurfacing. This came with a lot of crying out and revisiting childhood pains, I feel as if for years I have held emotional pain in my forehead region. I hope to progress and get in to more advanced therapy.

I’ve gone through childhood physical and emotional abuse and traumatic events in adult hood (family member has tired to take their life a few times) but I have resisted the idea of getting professional help for myself since I was 11/12 and have only opened up about 90% with my long term boyfriend.

In 2017 I was at an all time low and was feeling like life wasn’t worth it and felt numb to the world. One night after going for dinner with work friends I was walking home and collapsed on the ground. I was conscious but felt so numb my body and mind just gave up there and then. Some people came to help me and called an ambulance for me. When the paramedics arrived the shook me and got me on a bed I didn’t talk but could hear them. I suddenly snapped out of it when they rolled me into the ambulance and started crying. The paramedic pricked me with a needle on my finger to test me for something. It hurt and was unexpected. They said they had to take me to the hospital to check me out but I was sure in my head that nothing was physically wrong with me. I got to the hospital and was so embarrassed and ashamed that I told staff I should leave and I went home. I was so incredibly embarrassed and ashamed and still am. How dare I just let all that happen when I wasn’t an emergency and what if someone somewhere needed help and was dying. I just don’t understand why didn’t snap out of it. 

Fast forward to a month ago. I was at first aid training (ironically) and that machine that pricks your finger was brought out to show us. The instructor used it on his own hand. I remembered immediately what I had done in 2017 and all the feelings of shame, guilt, embarrassment came rushing back. I didn’t think much of it and we moved onto what the readings of the blood would tell you. I suddenly started feeling my hands sweat and a hotness covered my hands and seemed to radiate throughout my whole body and face. I was taking notes and my hand became so weak I couldn’t keep writing. Then I realised my hands were shaking uncontrollably. At this point I was thinking it was in my head but then my heart started racing sooo incredibly fast. I was still sure it was in my head as all I could think about was that I’m not someone who faints at the sight of blood. Then I started feeling like I was going to faint and to my embarrassment I had to stick my hand up and say in-front of the class I was not feeling well. I got up and staggered outside the room and sat on a chair. The instructor followed me , clearly concerned. I then started thinking I was having a heart attack and was about to die. I genuinely started thinking what is everyone going to think if I die right here, my boyfriend, my family. I was telling the instructor that I don’t normally faint and that I felt weird and that my pulse was fast. The instructor took my pulse and told me to slow my breathing (hadn’t even noticed how fast and heavy I was breathing). Soon as he told me that I started calming down and thought if he’s not worried about me dying then maybe I’m not. I started feeling much better after that. At the end of the class he said he reckons it was ‘a little bit of anxiety’. 

Was that a panic attack? Whatever it was it scared me. Since then I’ve had 6 more with carousing degrees but the first was the worst. This has pushed me to tell my doctor I need to speak to someone as I’m scared it’s going to happen in public and now I’m being referred to therapy so I’m not diagnosed with anything yet so am clueless.

I wish I knew about DARVO sooner.,3,11wiow7,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11wiow7/dae_feel_sad_that_even_after_all_they_have_been/,3,"I did not know about DARVO and only learned about it this year. I was in  this relationship for years and reached out multiple times in various forums (in past) saying how my boyfriend used to twist my words and always turned  the tables on me.   
I had many people jump to the abuser label (without properly explaining) but at the time that didn't help me as it wasn't nuanced, didn't listen to my fears, doubts etc and the jump to just ""throw him out"" ""run"" and ""get  away"" when it was more complicated than that actually kept me stuck.   
I stopped telling people because they'd pile on him and say how bad he was. Instead of validating me (that helps me now) all it did was scare  me away as I was beset with doubts and kind of didn't explain to me why.  Just made me feel guilty and like an idiot for staying with him. Made  me hide things he did as people would panic and over react. 

Now  it's great to hear. I'm ready and need that validation. But sometimes  my heart hurts. DARVO is so obvious. People in the comments of a  different woman's posts calling out toxic stuff mine also did and said. I was reading that and having so many lightbulbs. The comments and help here and in XX have been amazing!  
I'm  an intellectual and pretty resilient, strong person. Yet the word salad  and DARVO really messed me up and left me in a sea of doubt. they were  masterful at turning me into the perpetrator and he was also very  articulate, persuasive and just amazing at deflecting things back my  way. DARVO slid past me, made me doubt. Covert abuse is really difficult.

As we are separating (thanks  to the people in XX suggesting lawyers, mediation, counselors, witnesses) he  likes to bellow at the top of his lungs ""you're not bringing me down""  ""you sure love to tear me down"" ""you're so miserable and saw me  happy/productive so you decided to tear me down"" it makes me feel  trapped, helpless, wanting to cry. To be bullied and accused loudly and  publicly of being the bully. i even walked away and he was still  screaming ""you nasty bully"" and I worry people hear him and think ""wow  that guy must be with some spiteful woman who whispers or says mean  things softly and he's freaking out"" as that's what I might think as my  mother used to say mean things quietly and then get me to blow up. The  thing is I'm not saying the things he is claiming. Sometimes I'm just  walking past or asking him not to do something I don't like. He doesn't  respect or listen to me. When I call him out he says loudly ""bringing me  down again huh you're sick little game!"" and things like that.  
It's sad he needed to go so nuclear on me before I could stop doubting. Things like laughing at me when I cry and cruel things. I needed it to be really overt before it sunk in.

I  don't know how to stop him and he is making me look like the abuser. He  also spent years twisting my words and doing DARVO. I feel crazy, sad, I  want to throw up. How come I can't see or accept it unless it's comically obvious?

P.S.  
I thought I knew all about abuse dynamics after going ""no contact"" with my family of origin, left an overt man who was officially diagnosed with ASPD and BPD. I am now very, very sad I ended up with this covert guy (hey at least I leveled up right? No longer accept obvious disrespect) and still got lost in his DARVO madness. He was very, very covert and helped me a while with my health, so it was easy to think he suffered from cabin fever or compassion fatigue....easy to excuse...but no crystal clear he's abusive. Very, very sad about that still happening to me.",1679318387.0

As awful as last year was it taught me SO much. Probably more than I would have ever learned through my programs and therapy. I was doing ACA before I bottomed in love addiction last year and my therapist at the time who was trained by pia mellody told me I wouldn't fully heal my love addiction without dating. I didn't agree but I dated someone (unplanned lol we did not seek out dating to heal my LA) and holy shit was she right. I worked so hard on my program but dating someone dug everything up more than I could on my own without that experience. I'm back at work now and making major break throughs with inner child work but having a horrible flashback rn and not sure why. I'm hoping I'm posting in the right place because I don't see a bunch of pia mellody, inner child work, or ACA mentions here but thought I'd try. 

Yesterday and today I've been in a horrible flashback. It feels like despair. And rather than feeling angry at something or projecting onto someone or something, I just feel lost in it. Normally I hate projecting and putting my pain and anger onto people who my pain has nothing to do with. I believe it is a defensive mechanism that takes me away from my real pain as my real childhood pain is way worse despite my desperation to connect to it so I can heal. Yet now, I feel my abandonment depression so strongly it hurts so much. I feel small and like the world is too big ( a sign of a flashback). My inner child is in excruciating pain and I do not know why. I feel like there is no point to anything and life is meaningless. I'm not suicidal as I know I'm in a flashback but I'm not sure why I'm having one. I played a hero role, lost child role, and scapegoat role as child. I feel almost wantless and needless right now so maybe I'm flashing back to feeling like a lost child. I'm in scapegoat a lot so lost child I don't fall into as deeply.

Interestingly enough, I feel my flashback is triggered because I'm finally starting to do better. Because when I tell myself I'm doing better, I feel pain and loss. It's like this sense of abandonment. it's so painful it's like I'm losing something huge. I think my inner child is extremely loyal to her parents and does not ever want to give up the fantasy that her parents or someone will come and save her and make up for her awful childhood.  I think giving up dysfunctional thought patterns and behaviors and learning life can be normal without extreme highs and lows and crippling dependency issues feels like losing my family and despite hating my family and having very little to do with them now, my inner child is so loyal to them and does not know anything else. It's probably trauma bonding. 

I'm finally learning to see people as people equal to me and not bigger than me who can control me, I had a great weekend with no acting out, I'm doing better at my job and feel that last year which was awful was meant to be. I'm having break throughs I've never had and it's amazing and yet, I feel heart broken. It's like my inner child can't let go of her parents. She wants to act like them and think like them so feeling better and different is terrifying and feels like a loss. I don't know if this makes sense but this is an extremely hard flashback to work through and can't afford my therapist right now.",1679336464.0
271,Why should getting a relationship be the only way of getting out of your parent's house?,11,11wamgt,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11wamgt/why_should_getting_a_relationship_be_the_only_way/,6,"(25M) Hello there, first post. I have CPTSD, resulting from repeated narcissistic abuse from controlling parents who have parentified me and put a lot of unreasonable pressure on me or else they threaten I become homeless, which has happened multiple times in the past. I have always had to crawl back to my abusers, because I have also experienced abusive relationships with my employers, where my work is never reflected in my paycheck. 

I recently got a much better job in a much less toxic environment which I believe is a step towards progress and I am getting a second job to cement my path towards success. I asked a question from another sub on how they were able to move out of their parents' home despite the ongoing financial struggles of millenials in this generation. 

Many said that they needed to get a roommate, sometimes multiple. Many others also said because they got a boyfriend or girlfriend and that they rely on each other to survive. I know that's not the only option, but hearing that just sort of triggers me. In addition to abusive parents, abusive employers, I also once had an abusive intimate partner. 

This ex of mine lied to me about their age, lied to me multiple times, and cheated on me multiple times all why portraying themselves as a victim while I was labelled as the selfish, uncaring and controlling boyfriend. I hate the idea that you need a partner or a roommate in order to become a fully grown, independent adult now these days. 

My dad immigrated from the Philippines to America, while I was born, and my mom did absolutely nothing to contribute to the house because she never made it past 6th grade. They had it so much easier in 1998 vs 2023. 

I want to leave my family's house, because as they always say, you cannot heal in the same place where you were harmed. But it's really financially impossible. I have tried looking for rooms for rent. All pretty expensive, even with my paycheck it's unsustainable. I have spoken to a couple of friends and they say they're either living with their parents house or are with a partner, sharing rent. 

I just do not make enough money to survive in this economy.",1679293065.0

I'm either playing videogames for hours on end, endlessly scrolling apps, listening to music and daydreaming, or staring at the wall (I'm not exaggerating either,  I will stare at walls for well over an hour) 

Facing the mundane reality feels extremely unbearable. Especially when it reminds me of just how lonely and alone I am. Ive started isolating myself from others even though I don't want to. I can't connect with anyone properly. 

Most days I feel completely disconnected from my body, I have look at my hands and feet to remind myself that I'm a real person. I neglect my physical needs most of the time, starving myself and staying dehydrated until I feel utterly horrible. Only then I do go make food but it's never anything healthy. Just highly processed garbage lying around that's easy to make 

I'm pretty sure this all stems from childhood. I had most of my physical needs neglected (caused by poverty and one parent was plain neglectful) and I was rejected by nearly everyone at home and at school. I was treated like a nuisance and a burden, even when I was nice. So I spent most of my time alone in a room (or basement) in a completely dissociated state. Daydreaming was the only thing that got me through it all

I'm out of the funk now, those days are over. But  now im finding that I can't snap out of it. Even while people are talking directly at me, I sometimes physically feel my vision becoming hazy as I stop feeling real. People's voices become muffled background noise until something snaps me out of it. I still have trouble implementing a basic self care routine because I'm so used to being in my head.

Does anyone else struggle with losing attachments because the few times in history that we've had someone there for us mean that processing the necessary grief is difficult because we don't have anyone there anymore for it?

I've had to lose my community support worker because of a restructuring of funding and it's devastating. It's hard to find other blokes in this field who have been through enough of their shit to be able to relate to you and have come out the other side gentle and supportive and I guess the loss is devastating me.

I guess in an ideal world I'd have a family that could be there for me to help me grieve and cushion this blow and without that it feels so much more deblitating. We had a good relationship; he got it and he knew I got it and he really helped soften me.

I'm finding it hard to cry even though I know inside how sad I am.

It fucking sucks that these attachments are so precious to some of us and so rare that when we lose them the grief we need to feel is swallowed up by the emptiness.

I guess I'm whinging how unfair it is.",1679303092.0

But my mum wasnt that stable although she never hurt me or was mean she just wasn't emotionally available a lot of the time. In my early childhood she wasn't around physically much at all. My dad as much as he tried to hide the problems like money or loneliness I became very aware of them even at the age of 5. It made me feel like a burden. I don't remember if I was shouted at for wasting things but I know I just can't. I would of rather never of asked for anything than them think I was a burden. My mum left (divorced) and maybe as a child I might of thought subconsciously that it was my fault for being a bad child. 

But then my dad met someone else and in my opinion she was manipulative. She changed him. And I'll never know if that was the true him (pretending while with my mum) or the fake one. He moulded perfectly to her never saying he disagreed and went along with everything. For example playing older rated games she said no but when we were alone I could. He wouldn't stand up for it. This is when I was 9. She then moved in with her kid. 

Because I never wanted to be a burden I would do anything to make sure my dad was happy. And the kid really liked me... And the kid pressured certain activties designed as games. I felt like I couldn't stop anything because what if my dad hated me for it? What if he said it was my fault he was going to be alone? I ranted to my mum how I hated the girlfriend and the kid how I wanted to live with her and then the girlfriend thought it was a good idea to go through my phone (11 or 12 now only had a phone so I could talk to my mum) and found all the messages. Then forced my dad to say that my mum was being toxic and just hated that my dad had found someone and that she was being mean and was a bad person and that I shouldn't be a bad person too.

Then once my mental health declined I told people about the kid. And you know what happened? My dad believed his now step-child and wife not the perfect child that did everything he wanted and got the best grades and tried hard at everything just to feel wanted. He said ""it was wrong it happend, but it's ok that It did...you're not in trouble"" basically saying he didn't believe that I didn't want it. I couldn't say anything because again didn't want to be a burden or for him to hate me. Didn't matter though I got admitted shortly after and now live in care so probably see him once every 3 months. 

So in lack of a better phrase was it my fear of abandonment that ment I'm so broken because I put myself in vulnerable suituations, or was I emotionally manipulated to believe I am worthless? I need to accept it either way. Do I have a right to hate my parents or am I looking for someone to shift responsibility? Yea it ain't my fault I had a fear of abandonment so early but I don't want to blame my parents if they weren't actually bad parents. For the record I need to blame someone so I can accept it and heal even if it is myself. I don't have a therapist right now because of waiting times.",1679312264.0

He enables his mother (my bio) when tells blatant lies, and runs with it (example: his mom told me that he was afraid I was taking advantage of her, he didn't but I reacted by blocking him and trying to stay out of stuff and his reaction was to sick his wife on me, I at the time was a very vulnerable kid who was struggling with depression and she did some stuff that I won't mention on here) , spends the entire time dead naming and misgendering me and just being crappy.

This happened last week.

It did not go well at all. I thought my newly placed IUD was being rejected by my body. Long story short I was in excruciating pain and that's why I needed to see him.

7 months ago a male doctor was checking my heart and lungs and he had his hands on my breasts instead of my back or shoulder. He also started touching my thighs. I haven't seen a male doctor since.

I had to make a urgent appointment because of the pain and was able to get squeezed in Wednesday. I knew it was a male doctor but I thought I could handle it. You never know how bad it is until you're faced with the possibility again.

I want to say that the doctor did nothing wrong and was just doing his job. He was sorta holding the side of my stomach/hips to check for pain. He was pressing down on my stomach/ top of my vagina to check for pain. That's when I started to cry.

There was a nurse in the room btw. I had to hold her hand. Then he was about to do the exam and I completely lost it. I started sobbing very loudly and said I couldn't do it and he said that's completely ok. 

I had the biggest panic attack I've ever had. I was able to reschedule the next day with my regular OBGYN who is female but I haven't been the same since. I can't sleep because I don't want to deal with the nightmares. I've been grumpy/ irritable. I don't know what wrong with me. Why has my behavior changed?

Whereas most people, it seems to me, never have the guts to step beyond: 'I like what I like because God made me that way,' and assume that being a follower of initial instinct and never challenging our motivations is brave.

All helpful and insightful advice/support is appreciated. TW: the story involves racial bias and street harassment. 

I (F 20’s) was walking by myself in the Summer time in the downtown area of the city I live in a couple years back. Ironically, I was on my way to a therapist appointment of all things. At this point I was receiving therapy/treatment for CPTSD, Agoraphobia, ADHD, and Autism.

I was about two blocks away from the therapist’s office, when I noticed the sidewalk was being blocked by a group of people, eight to be exact. 

There was no way of getting around them without stepping into street traffic, so I politely said “Pardon me, I just need to squeeze through.”

I waited a few seconds for them to move off to the side since I didn’t want to accidentally/rudely walk through the middle of the group, even though there was enough room to do so.

Not only did they not move, but as I proceeded to walk past them without shoving through, they were already collectively leering at me when I was about a block away from them. 

I could tell they didn’t want me to walk near them from a block away, but perception isn’t always reality, well, except in this case.

Out of the group, 5 of the people berated me. One lady proceeded to get angry and yelled without hesitation “Uhh huh, yeah, all you wh*te folks be acting the same.” I was shocked but ignored it and kept waking.

While lady 1 is yelling, lady 2 is saying almost at the same time “all you ugly wh*te b*tches are the same, so f*cking entitled.” Man 1 shouted “Dumb cr*cker!” At me, while lady 3 echoed the “cr*cker” remark. Lady 4 said “Don’t be walking up in here unless you want your a** beat.” 

All of this hostility because someone they perceived as different, or perhaps maybe a threat for existing in the same space as them even just for a second while walking on a public sidewalk is something I can’t comprehend, especially as someone who is notably multi-ethnic/multi-racial but is otherwise wh*te presenting.

I understand and empathize when it comes to history and epigenetics, and the realities that a majority of BIPOC folks endure in their daily lives. There’s a lot of internalized oppression and hurt. I completely get it.

However, now my mind and body are perpetually disoriented. I don’t know how to proceed if I were to ever end up in this type of scenario again. 

I didn’t do anything that commanded the amount of hate and wrath I received. I kept it pushin’ and minded my own business.

To this day I can’t get myself to walk in that part of town again. I already struggled with mild (now severe) agoraphobia at the time and was working towards getting through it, but this scenario (and other scenarios) put me right back in my shell. 

I’ve survived so much violence and bullying throughout my life. My body is physically sick from years of abuse, neglect, and displacement.

All I can think is “How can anyone be so vile and harmful towards someone who simply and politely said pardon me while trying to get somewhere?” 

I’m not a reactive person, and as someone who’s been through violence and abuse on all fronts I knew to just walk away and to create distance.

I guess what I’m asking is, how can I best handle/process racial bias/hate/street harassment if it were to happen again?

If anyone has had a similar experience, or solid advice please share.

P.S., this is **not** your place to be racist or hateful towards me, or anyone in the BIPOC community. I also hope the mods are ok with me asking for support/clarity on this as long as the comments are dignified.",1679307135.0

My abuser, aka my ""father"" is so fucking awful. He's a misogynistic, narcissistic piece of shit man child. Don't want to do something for him? Fuck you, you're now the worst person on earth. ""I'm going to beat the shit out of you"" ""I'm going to hit you like a grown man in the streets"" ""Keep talking and I'll break your mouth"". How the FUCK do you say that to your child?

And then the fucking audacity for you to get high and try to flip the situation on to ME??? Tries to manipulate my mother into thinking I'M the problem????? Ah yes, the underweight kid who can't even stand straight half the time is clearly at fault.

Clearly, anything that he doesn't like is a fucking attitude with him. I can't do this anymore, I'm done. This is almost every fucking day whenever he isn't high off his ass, and when he is he tries to lovebomb me. Fuck off with that. He ruined my entire childhood, he ruined whatever potential I had, he ruined everything so far. The best I can do right now is just continue to dissociate and pray that I don't fuck myself up beyond repair, or to just keep taking the hits for another year. I don't have much choice, it's either those two or I end up killing myself. But I can't do that, that wouldn't be fair to my friends, or to my cat, or to my mom and uncle. I have these people who care and yet I feel so alone and even then they probably don't even truly care, they just feel like they have to.

All of them are hardcore Christians, what the hell am I going to do. I'm sick. I want to blame everything at my disabilities, my mental illness, my abuser, my home life, everything.

 I would let my mom do those things so I could get what I wanted. I still do to this day, although I dont let her get physical like when I wad a kid, but ik shes desperate to touch me again so I play nice for a while and let her sat disgusting things to me and stare at my body, undressing me with her eyes. I do the same with my aunt too who also participated in the abuse. 

Then theres my dad. He didn't sexually assault me as a child as far as I remember, but he was really violent and overall horrible.  He came over to visit a few months ago and he had his hand on my ass for a while before taking it away. I didn't say anything or complain, I just moved away after a few seconds and went to serve him some tea. He gave me money later and gave me a sloppy kiss on my cheek. I tell them what they want and smile at their foggy faces while I slowly die on the inside.

I went to my room and cried and self harmed. A part of me is proud im doing what I can to survive till I can get hired for a job, but another part of me feels like a cheap whore. Someone who would let their abusers do those things just for some money. Im not happy with my life.

Recently there has been conflict because my remaining family (specifically my aunt) has been getting pushier with her attempts at religious conversion. I have no interest in religion and never will. Her last attempt was worse then usual and it triggered my religious trauma and I sort of went off on Christians in general and she took it super personally. She sent me a wall of text that basically amounts to guilt tripping me, invalidating my beliefs, and subtly implying I'm not good enough as I am. The real kicker was her saying ""not all Christians are judgemental"" while in the act of judging me. I haven't responded to the text and I have to say I'm tempted to just cut my losses because I already know there's no response I can give that will satisfy her short of ""ok I'll abandon all my tenets and beliefs and let you choose them for me"". Kind of at a loss with this one...


UPDATE: Happy ending thankfully she reached out after a couple of days with no response and we had a good talk. She actually wasn't aware of my religious trauma, and she apologized.

whenever someone who has really caught my heart shows some sort of mutual interest, they end up frightened away by how much it means to me

it seems like the moment it becomes evident that I need them, that they mean a lot to me, that it begins to spiral

then it becomes like bargaining with my killer (to reduce an incredibly complex thing to a simple metaphor)

I'll try to put things into words, which entails a lot of furnishing, contextualising, whatever you would call it, but this just hastens the spiral

it's not as if the need would ever manifest in e.g. a draining way. I am able to exist in my own time, I am not simply some void

although I'm struggling at this point, I'm an articulate person, and a very compassionate and close listener. I don't get angry. I'm as grounded as a person could be. I communicate 'non-violently' as a force of habit + consequence of the CPTSD (among other things)

none of this matters, though. the need breaks the spell, the spiral begins, and it comes to the same end, more traumatic every time

I was supposed to rebuild my life according to the expectations of others. I unfortunately was willing to let her get away with it. I saw her as a victim and too codependent to function. She claimed to be a codependency ""expert"".

I said I was bullied at work. My workplace was like day care for sociopaths. She wanted to help me get from feeling abused at work to feeling valued at work. She wanted to build my confidence around the fact that I the company was a big name and having been let in spoke well of me. What if we reframed my sense that I was being hit by my husband to reminding myself that an uglier woman wouldn't have even gotten married to him?

I told her that I suspected I had autism and grew up in an environment that was both abusive and neglecting around issues like this. She then demanded empathy towards the people I claimed were bullying me at work. She even made my codependent boss the example to follow. I thought he had no integrity and was using his friendship with a narcissistic higher up to get ahead. The therapist got on his side and I fell into the bad habit of trying to spell out all the red flags to have that met with passive aggression, covert bullying and stone walling.

The more I tried to explain, the more adamant she was that she was reasonable, and I was exaggerating about everything. So the ""therapeutic"" denial of small issues turned into disbelieving child sexual abuse. On top, she was verbally abusive in regard to my reaction to the abuse. I think the message was, ""this is how we treat people like you"", since I was being branded crazy or a  liar.

It was getting so bad that I was experiencing more difficulties. She was pushing more meds on me. I went to see a psychiatrist in response to her insistence. I thought I would jump ship. Instead, the guy turned out to be a bigger asshole. I took the meds he suggested because I couldn't deal with my life in general, although the ""help"" I was getting was in itself re-traumatizing.

I’ll be talking about sensitive subjects such as >!religious trauma, emotional/physiological abuse, and of course, suicidal ideation!< if to any of these subjects trigger you, proceed with caution, and please stay safe!


My earliest memory of fighting with suicidal ideation was at around 7-ish y/o. I’m autistic, and since around 1st-2nd grade that’s when teachers began emotionally/physiologically abusing me. I vaguely remember in kindergarten, the *very* moment I entered school, they told us special ed kids that “we couldn’t possibly just leave you *behind*” I was considered a failure before I even had the chance. They did *everything* in their power to avoid accommodating for my disabilities despite having an IEP and a 504. During IEP meetings, they would do anything and everything to remove my accommodations, pointing to a certain need on the paper and saying “she doesn’t *really* need that, now does she?” My mom has fought *repeatedly* to keep those accommodations and have told them on numerous occasions that I *do* need them and will *continue* to need them…. The teachers of course later went against my accommodations on my IEP and continued to emotionally abuse me

Here are the many ways they would abuse me, and these are just what I could think of on the top of my head: 

* Used sarcasm, ridicule or denigrating statements,
* Verbally abused me regardless if it was in front of my peers. 
* Name-called and insulted me
* Mocked me for my autism, such as my stims, meltdowns, etc. basically my entire disability
* Neglected me by ignoring me when I was obviously struggling
* Every time I would ask for help, they would either scoff, roll her eyes, laugh at me or make some rude remark, making the rest of the class laugh. (I remember this one teacher in the 6th grade who hated me specifically because I struggled and favored the “smart” kids. She made a rude remark saying “if you start moving that cotton-pickin’ pencil, I’ll throw a party” the whole class laughed along with her) 
* Used punishment on me for either not responding correctly to either an exercise/question, forgetting my pencil or paper, being unable to finish an assignment during class, etc. (*very* minor mistakes, I’ve *always* tried my best to be a good kid and to follow the rules) 

Types of punishments they used on me, such as: 
* humiliation in front of peers 
* getting lunch detention
* loss of privileges such as: 
* recess
  * being forced to stay in during recess and do a packet as the teachers purposefully opened the windows so we could hear *all* our peers playing outside
  * being forced to sit outside and do a packet for *all* our peers to see
* field trips - being made to be left out of a field trip while also being forced to go outside to see the rest of your peers on the bus drive away (and by the end of the dreaded day, you see kids coming into the school with souvenirs, leftover lunch bags, etc. and getting to hear everyone talk about how the field trip went while you were forced to do packets the whole day)
* Other school events such as seeing the school’s sports team performing, etc. (even though I was never particularly interested in sports or any of that, I was still punished for my autism despite having an IEP and a 504, punishments included being left out of those events and being forced to do packets all day) 

I also remember my special ed teacher in the 3rd grade who used to verbally abuse me for *everything* I did, such as stimming, meltdowns, when I went nonverbal, etc. (I remember having to pronounce certain words and I went nonverbal for a moment, she screamed at me *really loud* “you HAVE to say these things!!!!” I also remember me struggling with a question in my math book, and she screamed at me “PAY ATTENTION!!!!!” while slamming her pointer finger on the book page. And she didn’t abuse me not just for my disability no. For legitimately *everything* even for my bodily functions, such as yawning, swallowing, etc. She would scold me and yell at me saying “how DARE you do that!” “What do you think you’re doing???!!” (I kept yawning because the night before I had to witness my parents arguing about our financial issues, I *genuinely* couldn’t help it) I also remember an instance where I went to the restroom, and when I left, I started wandering around the school (a common symptom in autistic people) She found me wandering, scolded me, took me into the restroom and screamed at me “you have ONE minute!!!” I don’t remember what happened next, I probably got verbally berated even more. My memory is extremely foggy since my brain hardcore trauma-blocked a *lot* of the things that happened

My god, these are just simply on the top of my head, if I wrote *everything* that ALL my teachers did to me that I can remember, this whole post would be as long as an encyclopedia

Now, back to my child self fighting with suicidal ideation, I remember being 9 years old in the 4th grade (while not only being mercilessly bullied by my peers in almost every way possible except physically, on top of it all, being emotionally abused by my teachers. Oh! And financial problems and having to stay in a trailer park inhabited by meth-heads with shitty landlords) I remember crying to my parents one day after school, saying “I can’t take it anymore!! I want to kill myself!!” (this was back when my parents were also brainwashed by *that* kind of Christianity, they aren’t anymore) I remember my parents saying to me “Life is a gift from God. If you kill yourself, then you’ll be throwing away his gift, >!and then you’ll suffer in hell for a thousand years where you’ll be scorched alive and get raped by the devil’s demons!!!< (Not something you’d want to tell to anyone, especially to an 8-9 year old…) and that shit *shook* me to my core, and that’s what kept me from killing my self as a kid. Because I was feared into it

I really wish the adults around me would’ve took action sooner and actually took me seriously as a child when I was showing obvious signs. But y’know, a lot people tend to think that “oh well a child that young couldn’t *possibly* be able to have feelings like that” so as a result I was never taken seriously. I can’t stress you enough how important it is to take action ASAP when you see *anyone* talk about or exhibiting signs of suicidal ideation, *especially* in children",1679257620.0

At some point in my childhood, maybe when I was 12 or 13 I sort of realized I have to start avoiding my dad for my own good. At that point he wasn’t sexually abusive anymore. guess i was too old. but he was still physically abusive and manipulative. so i’d be outside of the house for majority of the time. i started hanging out with the wrong kind of people. I started using. mostly crack. i’d do some weird and dodgy shit. and then i met a girl who had a brilliant way of doing money.

she’d go to her favourite corner and pick up older and desperate guy. and they’d usually go to a motel. or a car. and i figured that i wanted to do it too. i was 15. i just wanted the money for weed and crack. but i’d use it to buy things for my siblings too. like food and sometimes toys. 

and thinking about it now, it’s a miracle that i’m still alive and never contracted hiv or anything serious. and that i wasn’t trafficked or killed. i’d only get taken advantage of sometimes and not get paid. or they’d push my limits and be violent but could be worse i guess.

332,Need to vent!! Talked to a family friend last night who was often over at my house growing up (TW),10,11vs0kx,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11vs0kx/need_to_vent_talked_to_a_family_friend_last_night/,6,"(Cross posted from another sub, forgot this one exists and thought it might be better.) edit: TW eating disorder!!

We began to talk about my mother. 

I learned a few new things I need to process. I’m constantly impaired from CPTSD, like brain damage levels, and this has pissed me off beyond belief. 

Apparently, my mother would force me to go to pre-school in ridiculous, frilly dresses. I’d come home bawling because I’d be teased, and my mother would be pissed at me for being upset. The family friend once tried to comfort me, and my mom started fuming saying how I don’t deserve to be comforted over a dress. 

I know from experience that my mother would make fun of me and shame me for not being able to socialize, acting like there was something innately wrong with me. She’d never let it go either. Now I see it was directly HER FAULT. And also, I hate dresses. NOW I KNOW WHY. 

I developed a *severe* eating disorder at fourteen. Like at death’s door bad. This family friend told me how my mother would tell her how I’m disgusting for it, how all I do is puke everywhere, and how SHE DOESN’T CARE IF I DIE because it would be my own fault.  Family friend said how she thinks she wanted me to die to collect life insurance and for the victim status, which 100% confirmed my own fears. Like ya’ll I spent all of my teen years alone in my room waiting to die, unable to have friends really because I was so bulimic. And all my mom would do is scream bloody murder at me until I would black out. 

AND the family friend told me how she was over once and my mother PUT WINE IN MY WATER and told my family friend it was because I needed to calm down!

And my mother wouldn’t let me clean! Family friend was saying how she’d lose her shit at me if I tried, but then go off about how lazy I am. This 10000% confirms vague, dissociated memories I have. 

She also wouldn’t let others see me as a baby. Like I’d always be in my room/crib with the door closed. There was one time I fell off of the kitchen counter onto granite floor and fractured my skull as an infant. She insisted it was an accident. KINDA QUESTIONING that now. 

And sometimes my family friend would come over (to clean) and my little brother would be hiding because “mom’s mad,” and my mother would insist he’s just doing that because he’s shy. He’d also ask for me and say how he wants me to come to him. But I was so bulimic at that point, I literally wasn’t functional. Guys I left my little brother to be abused and couldn’t even be there for him. I was the only one who could have been there for him, and before I got really sick I tried! I could have made a difference for him if I hadn’t gotten my ED. Instead we’re estranged now and I have like 100 different mental illnesses - so I’m just like a failed deformity of a person let alone a sibling. Omfg. My mother would also do her screaming at me until I blackout right in front of him, and he’d start crying too, and then she’d tell me that it was my fault he was crying and that everything was my fault. I seriously just want to die omfg. 


IT MEANS IM NOT CRAZY!!! I was right!! I am FUMING. Seriously want to go to her house and ask what the hell is wrong with her. Been NC for almost two years now. Just WOW. What a psycho. Of course there’s way more shit she did, but to hear things I totally forgot about or didn’t even know about from that family friend is just… UGH. Validating and HORRIBLE.",1679248277.0

It’s like here’s your gift that’s my part done, kind of like ticking a box and gets annoyed at me and says I don’t appreciate it when I’m upset. 

I think I don’t care as much about gifts as I do the caring side of it. The side which shows you you mean something to someone and for that day you are the center of their world. Just taking the time to make you breakfast or cuddle with you or take the kids so you can sleep in. Or just to take you on a picnic or a day trip to take a walk or have lunch. Just some effort or kind personal thoughts.

Special days just make me feel rejected because I see others being made to feel special and it’s triggering as I realize I care more for others than they do about me. I end up depressed or kind of angry the entire day and I don’t look forward to them.

On my last birthday I went to a supermarket by myself. This Mother’s Day (the first without my mum) I spent the day doing washings, bathing the dog and doing things for other people. Is it selfish to want someone to look after you just for one day?

Because it happens every time I’m thinking of canceling my 40th because big birthdays are even worse.",1679262162.0

Like it's *not* stupid because it does affect me and it's gross behavior on my mother's part but it's also so fucking stupid because I could just be okay with my boundary and not worry about it. 


My mother sent out an invite to everyone to have Easter at her house. It should just be an easy family ""thing"".


Instead I'm mad and shaking and nauseous and stressed to the max trying to figure out how I'm going to handle this. My mother and I are not speaking. Her boyfriend is disgusting, mentally and verbally abusive and manipulative, and my mother is caught up right in his trap. I *REFUSE* to bring my children around him and her behavior has made it necessary that we don't see her or have very limited contact with her. They communicate with my ex who we have a permanent RO on and is the reason for the majority of my CPTSD and my teen's PTSD.  She even sent the email to a family member to invite them who have also refused to speak with them bc of the boyfriend being so awful and this family member has/had a restraining order placed on mom's boyfriend for their daughter who was colleg-aged at the time. Smh. 


I'm just SICK. I hate PTSD. I HATE IT. I hate being this triggered by things. I hate people behaving in such disgusting ways that it causes all this trauma in us and I HAAAATTTEE that it's the people close to us who have done it.

338,I reacted to a trigger and I think I fucked up my entire life,192,11v6ytl,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11v6ytl/i_reacted_to_a_trigger_and_i_think_i_fucked_up_my/,128,"I woke up fine, stressed from moving. Had friends show up to help, we all decided to get lunch before we started working. In the car ride I apparently was complaining to the point where a friend stared said ""pull over I don't want to be in the car with this @#$% I can't listen to her talk anymore etc"".. this really triggered me for some reason I flipped out tried to get out of the moving vehicle and I spit on the car and walked away. I cannot believe I behaved this way. I didn't think at all. I just wanted to punch him and I hated everyone. By the time I got home I was told this was the straw that broke the camels back and my partner of 5yrs now wants to me move out. I'm horrified. I hate myself. This triggered his C-PTSD. I am not allowed to talk about how my C-PTSD was triggered. My partner told me he has no love for me anymore. I'm crushed. My whole life is ruined.i don't know what to do.

Edit: I'm providing more context, there was some questions on context and background. Also IMO some victim talk and shaming. 

I was complaining about how I am not included in any plans, just along for the ride. I don't know what the agenda is for the move out plan until I'm told ""you should have don't this/that instead"". I would make suggestions to my partner as, ""I'll pack up the x room this week and sort the pantry is that OK with you?"" This is my game plan to talk about logistics then work room to room. When we have moving help on the weekends everyone else has an opinion on how I should have cleaned the fridge instead or ""hey can I have this"" & my things are given away. It's been 5 weeks of this when we had planned for 10 weeks.

It's been stressful. I have been interviewing for jobs during this time. I have been draining my savings account paying utility and everyday needs. It's a very competitive job market here where I live. Pretty much everyone has a masters degree and I don't know how they afford to get paid the wages ordered. I don't have a formal edu but my job experience is equivalent to bachelor's. My partner and everyone he knows is in the construction industry, and job since out of high school. I've lived in 7 states was a military spouse for years and put his career first. Mine was nonexistent. This friend who is really upset with me hasn't worked in over 2yrs and has borrowed 2g from my partner. I don't see how my paying my own way for my life while I'm trying to work through the diagnosis is seen as 'I can't hold my shit together'. That's all I've ever done is do for others. So now my getting 'bitchy' about my personal things being given away is outrageous and I am not allowed to express myself. I didn't know they were going to just show up at the house that morning, it was my idea to invite them along to breakfast/lunch. I just been holding so much in for so long - it just burst when I was told along the lines of 'shut your bitch mouth' I just flipped out and tried to get out of the car. I couldn't handle anymore. I felt trapped.

It's the friend who said I was complaining who has PTSD. He had a reaction to my complaining and wanted to get out the car, that threw me into a panic. I let him sit in the front cuz he's a big guy for comfort. 

I am always putting others first. I have copping mechanism of shutting down. I'm not allowed to say anything other than positive things. My prev counselor said it's important for me to start to feel feelings. That's where i can't so crying now that I'm letting myself access feelings. 

I have a appt with new counselor Tuesday, I haven't had therapy in 5 months, due to my insurance changing and I've been on a wait list. I've been calling crisis lines during this time.
I was in counseling until my insurance changed from losing my job while I was on medical leave, I worked for the fire department in very male dominated environment. There was toxic workplace going on, I was in complete denial, then everyone left for work elsewhere and HR came in to help which they've tried before (had no idea how bad it was going around me, staff had heart attacks, 2 ppl had strokes. I was getting support from my new boss, he said I needed to learn how to crack these guys skulls to get respect. I am not a skull cracker. It took almost a year of me navigating the system with HR & my union trying to get me transferred. My Dr and boss both said the workplace is causing triggers and not conducive to my health. 

My partner has no idea how to be around someone with mental health stuff. Since being diagnosed i lost my support when my insurance changed. It took me 3yrs to feel like i could trust my counselor to talk about my life. I talk with my partner about my needing emotional support and how I am trying to just sleep through the night without nightmares. He doesn't understand. I know it's not OK to last out and call names, what set me off is how it was all my doing, ""all of this wouldn't have happened if you weren't complaining"". 

I apologized to my partner (can't stop crying) and he told me i needed to apologize to the friend. I left a voice mail, I wrote a letter and went to put on his car. They were all outside having a BBQ. My partner saw me, I was told I shouldn't have come. I just wanted to apologize i feel horrible, i hate myself. I don't even know what happened. I feel worthless I'm trying and it doesn't matter what i do. I fucked up unlike anything ever and i don't know what happened, i wasn't in control. I'm always in control. I was told I put him in a very awkward place because his friends hate me now and that I needed to find my own place to live. I have a counseling appt for EMDR Tuesday that I've been on a waiting list for months. I'm trying.

This ""friend"" has said horrible things to me and it was OK for him to talk like that. I know it's not OK but others make it seem like it's justified. I made a rule for our home 'speak with loving kindness'. I broke my own rule.

I am trying so hard. I understand the self sabotage thing and I don't think that's what I'm doing, I think I'm just realllly stressed out lacking support. I'm hoping I can get some quality therapy and work on myself to learn how to stand up for myself properly. 

A friend thinks I was never shown how to do things properly, pick friends, set boundaries. That's resonated with me. I moved out at 16 and been on my own. I'm turning 37 this year. Life just keeps getting harder. I don't understand.",1679188351.0
339,Working with children is both triggering and healing in ways I didn’t expect.,6,11vvxmp,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11vvxmp/working_with_children_is_both_triggering_and/,1,"For some background, I haven’t been officially diagnosed with CPTSD but I relate to every single aspect of it. I was raised in a toxic family, my dad emotionally and financially abused my mom, my mom emotionally and sometimes physically abused me, my dad would emotionally and physically abuse me and my siblings and he also emotionally neglected us and introduced/exposed my older sibling and I to drugs at a young age. The abuse/toxic environment lasted my entire life, I am now in my early 20s. My mom is a lot better now and I have forgiven her for a lot (it’s complicated). We have cut off my dad entirely. I have been in therapy on and off as well as seeing a psychiatrist but seeing as my therapists didn’t address my childhood trauma in full (I opened up about a lot but not all of it). I am currently looking for a therapist who specializes in childhood trauma. Anyway on to the point of my post. I am in my early 20s.

I have recently begun working in childcare for an after school program. I love children and am good with them. I want some of my own one day. Because of my past I have always been interested in psychology especially childhood/developmental psychology and parenting techniques. 

There are two aspects of my work that trigger me. One is more obvious. I don’t want to get into specifics due to the privacy (not that anyone will see this but still) but we have had issues with two kids in the program who are brothers. They have a lot of behavioral issues and both brothers have been temporarily banned/on probation from the program at various points for bad/dangerous behavior. Both brothers are little, below 4th grade. Their dad was (is?) abusive and the program is aware of this. I had an issue with one where he became triggered and had a meltdown while I was walking him from his school to our after school location. He had a huge meltdown and would not move. This resulted in him screaming at me and eventually bolting and running away. I was scared shitless for a minute because he ran out of my sight and I had other kids with me! Thank God we found him and his mom came to get him. During this time he told me he was afraid because he didn’t want me to tell his dad because his dad hurts him. I had to file a CPS report because of this (mandatory reporter). It was so heartbreaking. I was totally calm and reassuring with the child but nothing I said could comfort him. I wasn’t angry or pressuring him. It was so heartbreaking to see him deal with something I dealt with a child as well. I even felt a little guilty filing the CPS report because as a kid I was conditioned to never tell anyone about what was happening to protect my dad. Thankfully he does not live with the dad and the mom is aware of the abuse. This child has been banned from the program. We are very sympathetic about their home life (this is not the first time an incident like this happened but the most extreme as he bolted out of my sight in a major city, extremely dangerous). Unfortunately we had to ban him out of safety concerns, not because we want to punish him. This is heartbreaking as well but there isn’t anything we can do. I spoke recently with his younger brother and it just breaks my heart. They love each other so much. I’m not going to lie both of these brothers can be very difficult to deal with. All of the people in our program have had to deal with their behavioral issues at one point at another. Even I am wary of them since the incident. But I made an effort to be there for the younger brother and he warmed up to me quickly and began tailing me. I think he just neered someone who could speak to him openly but reassuringly, who tells him nicely (but firmly) not to do something and why (so it’s not just a command with no reason). More importantly someone to listen. We just talked about silly things, he’s very little so a lot of his stories don’t make sense in that little kid way lol. But I see in them the same bond that I and my brothers had, the way our home life caused us to cling to each other and be fiercely protective of each other since no one else did. Seeing this play out is both triggering but also helps put things into perspective. No child should be so afraid of their parent. It helps me empathize with little me in a way while also breaks my heart all over again knowing that these tiny children have to deal with this too. I can only pray their mother is dealing with this better than my mom did.

The other part that is triggering somehow triggers me even more. And it kind of makes me feel ashamed. The other part that triggers me is seeing the kids be happy… I know I don’t know all their details of their lives or what they deal with so I don’t mean to assume. But when I see them be happy, have friends (I never had friends growing up until middle school, I was bullied until high school and also moved around a lot which meant I fell through the cracks even more). Seeing them have friends, have supportive parents, seeing them express themselves in ways that I was not allowed to, see them gain confidence and be joyful when I was always sullen and sad and awkward and shy… It just reminds me even more what I was deprived of as a child. Sometimes I have to excuse myself and go to the bathroom and cry a little. To be clear I am not jealous or resentful of the kids at all!! I am happy that they are happy. And I am proud of the kids in my program and in this generation in general— it seems that we have instilled values in them like kindness and empathy and conflict resolution skills that we didn’t have in place when I was a kid. And again you never know everything going on at home so I don’t mean to assume their lives are perfect. But it just makes me hurt for that little girl that I was who felt completely unloved— by my parents, classmates, teachers, etc. I think of these moments as a kind of regression. That the sad little girl inside me is crying bitterly seeing the other kids play without her. I know reparenting the inner child is a huge step for healing but it’s so hard when I can’t actually go back in time to protect myself or my siblings or even my mom.

I also feel so bitter and powerless when I see the timeline of my life. I am in my early 20s so it’s normal to not have everything together yet but I get so bitter when I think of all the time and potential wasted because I was in survival mode from birth to 18. I especially tend to freak out when I think about neurobiology and the developing brain. It’s sad that being in states of high stress makes you produce a ton of adrenaline and other hormones that accompany the adrenaline. But adrenaline and these other hormones overwhelm the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. It also causes the nervous system to shut down “non-necessary” systems like digestion and such. (I’m not an expert by any means so forgive me if I’m butchering it). Now imagine (I guess you all don’t have to imagine) all of that but for a sustained period of time while your brain is developing! When I think about that and all the chronic illnesses that can accompany it (I believe I have a thyroid problem, I am getting it checked out soon) it makes me so bitter. And I didn’t even have it as bad as other people (I guess that’s a common sentiment here).

I'm sure you all aware how bad things have to be for that to actually happen so I think that's telling enough in itself.

I live with my dad now and only speak to his parents. Mum is not in the picture neither is her family. I moved back in with my dad 16 but have lived between him and his parents since I was 14.

The issue with this is none of them understand that I was neglected. They are all convinced that social services (CPS) had a vendetta against my dad and took me off them for no reason. This is not true, I was literally going to school with my clothes covered in my own pee, had lice 24/7, had severe behavioral problems etc.

Whenever I try to point out that something he did was neglectful or abusive (I don't use that language), he blames my mum or says he was working a lot. He was working a regular 9-5 job.

My mum was the person who did most of the abuse and yes, she did neglect me more severely when I was alone with her. But that isn't an excuse to refuse to take accountability. It makes me so angry and I can't tell anybody because my dad does work a lot and take care of me now.

342,Can you help me find hope for my future?,8,11vt96j,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11vt96j/can_you_help_me_find_hope_for_my_future/,4,"Hi. I'm a 25yoM. As the title suggests, I'm at a point in my life where my situation and past dictate - though I think I'm in a flashback right now - that my future is bleak and that I'm killing myself for nothing.  

tldr; I'm having a flashback. I've failed a lot in my life and made numerous bad decisions.  can you help me reframe my situation and find hope in my future.  

I have been diagnosed with adhd+ocd and since I can remember I've had trouble focusing, learning, studying, planning, procrastination, etc. I ""studied"" CS at uni, though it wasn't really studying. I just passed exams and got out, and for those I studied overnight and learned the bare minimum. Graduated at 23, and was also working on the last year. I was fired from my job at the same time as my graduation because I was at a bad place emotionally and were severely unproductive. Now these past two years in terms of skills/experience I've got nothing. The only good thing that I've done was notice that my problems are actually caused by CPTSD.  

Now I used to work as a backend engineer which I figured is too boring (not engaging) and not so adhd-symptom-friendly. So I've started moving to another area of expertise which is devops. I'm sure these details do not matter.  
As for my situation, well, I have had the misfortune to be born in a ""developing"" (I think it's regressing more than it is developing) totalitarian middle-eastern country which is at the brink of economic/political collapse. To make the situation worse - for me obviously - 99% of my friends along with A LOT of my friends have immigrated. They did study and gain skills though. But on the other hand I believe the quality of their immigration is not good enough, as they're struggling. Immigration is always hard, but still it can vary a lot. Another aspect of my situation is that I'm addicted to cigarettes, daydreaming and porn; which is awesome because I also used to be addicted to weed, movies and music, but I quit those successfully.  

As for my future. Honestly the reason that I'm currently not killing myself is because there is a dream that I have that I want to live in, and that's basically the only thing keeping me alive. The vague faith of achieving that. To achieve that, I'd have to be able to do a couple of things, presuming the state of my country will not reach a point that makes it impossible, or the state of the world does so, and also presuming the things that I think I need to do to achieve that dream (though I've thought about them deeply) are **not** the wrong things.  
- I need to get some skills within 3 to 5 months and get an internship/job.  
- work for 3 to 5 years and gain job experience. this obviously includes changing positions and learning things on the job. which is obviously hard.  
- somehow manage to ""re""-study CS classic books that I should know. It is not necessary for a person to have a job in this area, but it is necessary if a person wants to *drip* as much skills out of those 3-5 years as possible, to possibly increase the quality of the immigration.  
- use the momey from the job and invest in personal growth through services. because the value of money here is so low it's stupid to think about financial investment when you want to immigrate.  
- one of the above said investments must be finding a therapist which is something of a luxury here nowadays. working on my cptsd (which is presuming I can find oen that is ok with it or I can encourage them to learn it) and fixing my deeply rooted problems, which eventually addresses my social anxiety, adhd and ocd symptoms.  

These are all perfectionistic and I recognize that, but anything beneath that is unacceptable. e.g. two of my friends immigrated these past 6 months with 2.5 years of experience. oh what a bad immigration. they can't afford to live in the capital, they live outside of the city center and in very very small and old apartments. they have to wake very early just to be able to get to work on time and get back in a reasonable time. therefore they also don't have enough time/energy on their hands to gain much skill outside of work so they obviously can't increase their salary as much as possible. let alone going to therapy and focusing on personal problems which manifest themselves in different areas.  
I'm trying to say that, yes it is perfectionistic, but beneath it is stupid. It's not worth it.  

Now with all that said, I fail to see myself, being able to get that done given my past. Even worse, I wish I was a robot, because man, comparisons suck. I cannot stop comparing myself to others. It's stupid and pointless, I know. But I just don't know how to shut it the f up. Even when I'm studying the thoughts creep in. It's frustrating. Things like this make me get stuck in suicidal ideation. I wish I got cancer right now as my aunt did, I'd be done with worrying about my future. But that's the point, in university I didn't think about the future until the future came and I was like I wish I had thought about it. I wish I had cared about it. To some f'ing degree. I spent it either in crippling anxiety of loneliness and not being enough, or in dopamine inducing mind numbing activities which mostly included my addictions.

I cannot find any positives in my situation, therefore any hope. As I said the only thing I have is this vague hope inducing faith of ""maybe it just might happen"".

I end up so in my head, I can’t trust whether the connection (in particular romantic) I’m having with someone is actually there or I’m just willing it into existence. 

I’ve been getting to know somebody recently and feeling happy about it, while trying to keep myself grounded. But the past couple times we’ve been meant to hang out, he just doesn’t say anything or messages a vague excuse hours later. Typing it out it seems so silly - if someone wanted to spend time with me, it wouldn’t be difficult to make it happen. And yet, here I am feeling sad and full of shame that I even got my hopes up. This cycle is so damn repetitive, and every time I tell myself I’ve learned my lesson and won’t settle for less than reciprocation, reliability and someone I don’t at all have to second guess myself about. Every time I end up at this hollow disappointment. 

I’m just really, really tired of it, I feel helpless against my emotions, my apparently unreliable perspective, and my somehow endlessly renewing hope that drives my actions time and time again and makes me think “Maybe this time it’s the real thing.”

I feel so broken sometimes. 

I don’t have a particular question or anything, just wanted to put my thoughts and sadness somewhere they might be understood. Thanks for reading friend",1679237231.0

[This](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LBPP7u12VfE) video I just saw of someone telling off their cat and making them sleep and close their eyes, and all of the comments are praising them. I guarantee you that cat doesn't  even know what she's mad about. Someone even said that's exactly how they've treated their child, and all the replies are calling her a good, compassionate (????) parent.

These people jump to punishment and try to find any little thing they can find to exert their authority, completely ignoring their pets feelings in place for their own. The real dilemma for me isn't that this happens, but that it's so common. It's difficult to live in a world where you know for a fact that so many people around you do this to their pets and kids (kids for whom it is an equally big issue, I'm talking about pets because of the video).

For those unaware, purely 'positive reinforcement' training with dogs is scientifically supported and will work with every dog. In fact it's very very important when rehabilitating a dog who's been abused. My point is that it is a fact you do not need to punish over and over.

I feel crazy for believing it when the vast majority of people would say I'm too sensitive and that it's not a problem. I hope as more and more scientific publishing's come out about the importance of positive reinforcement (an increasing trend over the last few decades) that it will slowly seep into the public consciousness, and that the future generations will be baffled at how we ever treated our own kids and pets with such contempt.",1679189904.0

I removed all people from this group/community from my socials because they would be easily manipulated by the abusers to spy on me and my location.

I’m also working a few other part-time jobs at the moment.

I have been so drained by this job, but at the same time the money has of course been helpful. But I pay for doing this job in overtaxing my nervous system, and in the recovery time I need after work. It feels like this job may be taking more than it gives, you know?

And I was reminded of my own despair why the hell I just wouldn't let go of my fierce inner critic even though I realize and feel how negative, devastating, merciless, and rude it is.

And I was thinking, well, apart from the fact that it has been engrained in me for decades, which is like a super-habit and extremely hard to change, I also realized that I don't really have an alternative in place that's working and that I believe in.

And if that belief came to you in the shape of a trauma or as a result of a trauma, then it's even harder to change.

I also have a very similar belief as the one mentioned in the post. My inner child has been abandoned, little me has been left to deal with stuff on her own, well, that made me a very independent, self-sufficient, DIY kind of woman who knows how to do stuff, get stuff done and doesn’t need others to take her by the hand, plus a fierce inner critic that pushes her on regardless of pain and exhaustion, but she has always found a way to find some calm and relaxation in the end [notice the distancing of the third person?]. So far, so good. But a recent trauma has pushed that dissociated little one out of her prison, and now little me is screaming for the support, help, nurturing, understanding , validation, love, ... that has not happened in childhood, at least not to the extent of being sufficient. And of course it's crying for mommy. And mommy cannot come. For once, real mommy is dead, but of course little me is not crying for the real mommy, it's crying for what ""mommy"" stands for. And here I am, adult me with this screaming inner child that wants to be hugged all the time and I don't know how to do that. What's on offer inside of me is the inner critic, the perfectionist, or shut-down. I know how to beat myself up, verbally but also physically, I know how to numb my emotions, how to bury myself in work or occupy myself with watching TV, but this mommy that little me is crying for isn't coming. 

And of course, that's the time to go out and look for help. Well, and my shame will not allow me to open up to friends, so my best bet is a T. Who is supposed to rescue me. Or at least, for the time being, that T is going to be my ersatz mom until I know how to be self-compassionate, able to allow self-care and not see it as selfish overindulgence, how to be kind and graceful with myself, and then be that loving, kind, compassionate mom to my wounded inner child whenever it needs me to. 

No, I cannot yet let go of my old beliefs, just simply because there are no alternatives in place yet, at least not ones that I can view as resources. They need to become stronger. And I need to address the source that feeds the critic, the dysfunctional beliefs, my defense mechanisms.

Well, yeah, we might appear stubborn to let go, we might appear resistant. There's a reason for it. And this reason might have once saved our lives.",1679246600.0

Someone can be loyal to you on the surface, but still have no desire to understand why it's hard for you to trust people, or to overcome that with you. This I think is part of why it can be so hard to eject toxic and abusive people from our lives. 

""But they care about me!""

Well, let me ask you, do you consider a person's willingness to earn your trust a part of caring for you? If not, why not? Think about some of the things you might imagine a person doing - or not doing - in an effort to earn your trust. What would it cost them? That trigger word that ignites your trauma - what does it cost them to remember and avoid using it? That ex you caught them texting with - what does it cost them to delete and block that person? 

Back to the title, this is what I mean. Toxic people weaponize loyalty in an effort to keep people close to them. They use the words ""I care about you"" and ""I love you"" as a way to excuse their behavior, and to keep you from really processing that they're only words. 

""I care about you"" is a set of words that means nothing, if not backed up by action. If they don't care about earning your trust, then think about what that means, and whether they can really be loyal to you, if they're not willing to adjust their behavior to make you feel safe.

Nothing is real, I remember almost NOTHING of my life, my life has happened yes but I don’t remember being there during it because I was dissociated. I get to the end of each day and don’t remember it. I feel nothing but extreme frustration as I wish I could experience life through my senses. It’s torture. 

My therapist hasn’t been able to help, I don’t know where else to turn. Is there anything that can lessen dissociation? It’s unbearable and I can’t live like this.",1679256250.0
370,"my abuser is on heroin, yay?",2,11vvrrn,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11vvrrn/my_abuser_is_on_heroin_yay/,1,"I feel bad for him because I know he had a rough childhood, and since he wasn't an adult when he abused me, I was more than willing to forget and forgive. But when he explicitly sexually harrassed me while we were both adults and brought up the past and tormented me, I knew he was truly bad.

I cut him off completely, and notified my entire family why I would never be in his presence ever again, so they'd have to choose. 

I heard from the grapevine that he's on heroin now, and his mother is trying to get him into rehab. And it makes me feel better in a way because surely he must know what he did was wrong. Or maybe its just hopefully thinking to think he did drugs out of regret. Maybe he's still as shitty as ever. 

I don't plan on ever having contact with him again. So I guess it shouldn't matter.",1679255807.0
371,Am I traumatised? I would like to tell my story and get some outside perspectives.,5,11vp1tx,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11vp1tx/am_i_traumatised_i_would_like_to_tell_my_story/,4,"Trigger warnings: homophobia, religious trauma, generational trauma, relational trauma (that's all I can think of atm. Please tell me if I need to add more or format differently).

Hi! I have been following and reading this subreddit for a few months now. This is my first time ever posting on reddit, and I'm on mobile(apparently I'm supposed to tell you that), so I apologise for any formatting errors.

Some facts and disclaimers about me:
-27yo cis woman
-queer (bi, and qestioning demisexual)
-I do not have a cptsd diagnosis, and I am unsure if I even qualify.
-I do have an AD/HD diagnosis. Diagnosed as a child and been medicated since.
-I do currently speak to a psychologist. It is through my university, and due to organisational circumstances I am on my third psychologist since November last year. I have had one conversation with the new one, and she seems alright.

I think I'll start with how I ended up here specifically. A morning this past october I woke up to a text message from my youngest sister (23, lives at home) that read: ""does Rita(fake name) know you are not straight"". I told her no, not to my knowledge, and asked why she asked and what had happened. So she called me.

For reference Rita(40s I believe) is my aunt, and my mom's younger sister. I have always admired her and looked up to her, but have had basically no contact with her since she expressed homophobic views in my presence(while I was newly self discovered and closeted) about my very much out and gay older brother Ole(fake name, early thirties) a few years ago. I still love her, but I feel wounded and unsafe after that. I knew she most likely held those views as she is involved in the same christian organisation as my parents and much of my family(I also grew up in this environment), but it stings in a much more real way to hear it spoken directly.

I have told both my parents when I stumbled unsafely out of the closet later that same year to never tell anyone without my permission, especially family such as Rita. Both my parents as per their belifs are not supporting of my queer identity. I am allowed home and have a relationship with them, but I would never be able to bring home a partner of the same sex, or include them in any family function where they had any control over that. My potential partner wouldn't be allowed into the family on their accords. I do not need that same grief, disgust and guilt being felt, thought or said about me or to me from other close family members outside of my control.

So, back to my little sister. She called me and told me about a phone call she overheard between my mom and my aunt Rita. Rita was on my mom's back about why she had more frequent contact with my oldest brother Ole than with my third oldest sibling Fredrick(fake name, early thirties). Her reasoning for this was that Ole was gay and very much publically outspoken against their church, while Fredrick was not(is straight, he used to be more involved in the church and is not anymore). My mom explained that Ole simply kept more in touch on his own(which is true as far as I know). 

BUT then my mom said, and here's the kicker - Not to worry. To be perfectly clear both Ole and OP(she used my name) would not be allowed to bring a same sex partner home, and they do not support that.

Why would she use the name of the only other publically out sibling and mine? And so casually, as if Rita already knew. As you probably have gathered by now I have many siblings (more than 8, less than 12 to be non-spesific but descriptive). The only reason would be that my mom at some point have outed me to my aunt. And honestly to who tf else at this point.

This might sould like an overreaction, but I was sort of stunned. Angry even. After all the painful conversations I have had with my mother since I came out. All the heartbreak and tears. This was the least I could ask of her. To not share it without my consent. I think I was in some sort of shock. Like I knew this was bad, but I could barely react. I kind of froze.

I texted my friend and classmate Oliver(fake name, 25) that I might be out of sorts today and perhaps steer clear if he was having a bad day(he has his own trauma history). But he instead offered to take me for a car ride at the end of the day, so that I could talk. I barely spoke throughout the school day and afternoon, and then ranted on the car ride. But I could barely feel. I could feel some betrayal, some anger, a little sadness but all seemed far away tucked away under a thick heavy blanket. I managed a few small tears as we parked outside my apartment, but they dried quick like water sprayed on a frying pan.

A few days later I spoke to my mother on the phone. I had ignored her calls for a few days(which probably were about my birthday in a few days tbh). I didn't want to do it on my birthday, so Oliver once again offered up his help - he would be there after the call was over and we would go for another ride(I don't know if it needs to be said, but I am extremely grateful for his help). This made me feel a little safer and braver, so I did it. 

I was angry, as angry as I am capable of being without being outright nasty and immature. I told her how horrible it was, how disrespectful and hurtful. How she betrayed my trust. She claimed to not remember me telling her to not tell(which is kinda suspicious as Kris my younger sister told me that she specifically remember me telling my mom that on several occasions). She apologised, but it felt hollow as she claimed to not remember, thus not knowing she was doing something wrong. She said that she of course would never talk nasty about queers. So I asked her to at the very least protect my mental health by not allowing homophobic language about her children from other people in the family either. I used my other aunt on my father's side, Vera(fake name, 60s) as an example. Vera was also a close and beloved aunt that expressed very similar beliefs in front of me the same summer as Rita did. My mom said she couldn't do that because Vera has a tendency to gossip, so that would not be safe for me apparently. 
I asked her what she and dad would do if I ever had a child with a same sex partner. She said she would like to be their grandmother and be involved. But she couldn't properly answer about how she would handle my partner, and the disrespect of only wanting to interact with the child and not the partner. And what if we wouldn't allow it? She couldn't answer that. She also once again stood her ground in her beliefs about my queerness. She could not change her stance, and basically spewed the same religious bullshit again. She said we obviously never would agree on this, so we should probably stop discussing it. I don't remember much else from the convo, but this is the most relevant parts I think.

I have been that way ever since. The lacking access to negative emotions. I am not depressed as far as I can tell, I do have emotions. Positive or neutral emotions don't seem to be interfered with. But most negative emotions that have to do with what happened that week and throughout my life before that lay under that blanket. I need to feel to understand it, I need to cry to release the tension. But as soon as I start crying, it's like my body says NOPE and shuts down the process.

I think one of the few negative emotions that I still have mostly unhindered access to is shame. Shame for thinking I might be even a bit traumatised, shame for taking up space in my friends life, shame for needing comfort, shame about who I am, shame about my body and sexual nature(yayy, purity culture), shame for thinking badly of my parents and upbringing, shame for not being a well functioning adult(my living space is a mess, and I cannot hold a proper sleeping schedule). Even as I write this I feel like I should be crying, but there is just a constipated feeling in my chest. And an aloof numbness in my head.

Another negative emotion I still have(which is closely tied to shame) is rejection. I have feared rejection as long as I can awarely remember. Until now I have tied it to my adhd and rsd(rejection sensitivity dysphoria) which is common to experience with adhd. And it might still be that, though it might go deeper than I thought. 

I shame myself in my close relationships(friends etc), and lately a lot with Oliver. He is a newer friend, so the connection feels more intense, and also more fragile. So I shame myself and reduce myself, so that my friends won't hate me. So that they won't leave. So that they won't think I am simply too much to deal with, and a baby. So that they won't think I'm a terrible selfish person and hate me. I am aware that most of these thoughts are utter bullshit, and they are mostly buried under a layer of logic. But the feelings they induce are harder to shake. And they still keep me from not censoring myself.

So yes, two things brought me here:
1. The betrayal of my mom. I believe it was some sort of tipping point for me.
2. Meeting my friend Oliver and hearing about his history. He actually has a cptsd diagnosis from childhood neglect and abuse. And as we got to know each other and opened up to each other, I realised I related to him on way too many things. In a spookily too many things way. Like... haha, (morbidly) funny. And he observed and pointed out things with an accuracy that actually scared me a couple of times. He believes I have signs of relational trauma. And he often reminds me of the fact that I constantly invalidate myself.
(We are both aware of the similarities of symptoms between adhd and cptsd, and are mostly confident in our ability to tell them apart. We are both pretty certain he has undiagnosed adhd as well. It's sort of a mental health cultural exchange haha. I help him reflect about his neurodivergence, and he helps me reflect on my trauma.)

Basically I flip flop between actually believing I have trauma and reason to be upset, and being very much dismissive about it all. I have been told my whole life that I'm emotional and dramatic, sooo.. is it really strange that I feel that way? Maybe not.

These two things made me start to dig in my life and memories with a more critical eye than ever. It's been disturbing and it challenges my whole view of my life, who I am, and who my parents and family are. It sucks, but I don't know what's scarier: not digging into it and letting it fester, and carrying on generational trauma, or digging into it and facing some scary realities.

I started following and reading this sub to understand my friend better, to learn about trauma from first hand survivors, and see if I perhaps would relate.

Do I relate? Maybe a little? But I am very unsure. I do not think I would get a diagnosis if I tried, but I think that's okay. What I need to figure out first is if I even *have* trauma at all, not if I measure up to a serious diagnosis. Though.. the level I relate might also change. My perception might be influenced by the self-invalidating that I do pretty much automatically.

Sorry this was so long. It is obviously not my entire history, but I think it's enough for now.

Thank you for reading if you got this far! I would love to hear your thoughts and/or opinions if you have the bandwidth, and I won't judge you if you do not. You also do not need to adress everything if you do want to comment. It is perfectly fine to just comment on a specific thing that stuck out to you.

I haven’t been diagnosed with cptsd officially, but my counselor thinks that I may have it and I need to check with my psychiatrist. As I’m trying to get a different psychiatrist, I am worried that I’ll have to explain myself over again (which is the norm with all intake), although I reached out to my past psychiatrist who I was with from 15/17 years old. I’m currently 21, but my therapist believes I may have cptsd and Bpd (my Bpd has been diagnosed) and I’ve gone through countless other diagnoses. I’m really trying to figure out if what I have is considered trauma, but I feel like psychiatrists will view those things differently (especially the one that I reached back out to who diagnosed me with depression and anxiety). Anyways, I’m just worried and don’t know where to start writing and talking about my potential trauma because it feels like it has been prevalent in my life since about ten years old. I was wondering if anyone has resources noting different types of trauma (I have searched up some by myself, but I want specific examples). Thank you all!",1679268817.0

I feel so much shame for everything I do at the moment and I feel hopeless about overcoming rejection sensitivity because it feels like my brain is just formed to be that way from all the abuse. There's also very little helpful information I can find for actually recovering from it. I keep seeing the faces of judgmental people looking at me in disgust in my head. I try to challenge those thoughts but the thoughts keep recurring and the shame intensifies. I feel numb but am acting anxiously. I try to feel my sadness and try to cry but not much comes out and then I feel intense shame. I try to feel and vent my anger but then I feel intense shame. I try self compassion exercises but then just feel intense shame. This shame makes me feel like a prisoner in my own body. I've tried so long to get better but the idea that I can't make progress in the things that are really hurting me makes life feel like its not worth living. The idea that the people in my life would be hurt if I killed myself has never been the thing that has kept me here. Only the hope that I could one day overcome this but right now I feel hopeless. Reading CPTSD from surviving to thriving gave me hope at first but being near the end of it and finding that a lot of the suggestions aren't helping me is making me feel incredibly hopeless. I feel so empty and am not enjoying anything right now. I keep having thoughts about killing myself to stop all of this and to punish my family for being so abusive and neglectful and for not taking any of this seriously. But then the idea about them all acting like victims to their friends about it makes me feel sick. I stayed at a friends house last night which helped a bit. But I still feel hopeless about actually fixing my rejection sensitivity. I'd talk to my other friends but there all just getting high all the time right now.

I used to be optimistic though when I was 18, if I met someone I crushed on I'd be really overly cutesy and compliment quite a lot, cus I guess I only knew how to date from TV shows (which I now look back on and see they were quite unrealistic representations of dating). This always made me come across as intense and I ended up just having my anxieties strengthened by the end of every dating experience, since they would always end up bad. I didn't know I had cptsd at the time, I didn't realise my background was unusual (growing up a lot of the kids around me were in awful situations, but I moved away from that area) . Eventually, when I was 19 I had sex for the first time with a girl I met online, I didn't really want to have sex with her though and kept hinting at her to go home and that I didn't want her to stay over, but she persisted. A few days later while I was peaking on acid (terrible idea, but my friends wanted to do acid with me and I was embarrassed to open up about me not enioying having sex) she started messaging me saying I kiss cold and that I'm weird as fuck (I also later found out I got an STI from her too). I didn't think this was rape for years, I just thought it was bad sex but the effect it had on my mental health was enormous. Every time I tried to date after, I'd get so much anxiety, it would affect my appetite and my overall happiness massively. I had all these anxieties about romance people had been telling me for ages weren't justified, but then I got raped, and they got so much worse, and I tried to date later but it would always just strengthen my anxieties. I've had some time off dating, and about a year ago I hooked up with a friend a few times - which was actually nice, and helped me out loads (until she turned mean on me, and fucked my anxiety levels to the max for a few months).

I just don't know how to date. I don't get it, it stresses me out. And I have soooo many other things in my life that make me happy, but everytime someone comes along I crush on that all goes out the window and I just fixate on that crush going wrong. Lately I have been chatting to someone I have a small crush on, and it's been going nice we have a lot in common, but after every message I send I'm just full of anxiety until I get a reply back. I don't want to feel this way - if things don't go anywhere, I'll be fine, I think the worst of my trauma is behind me and I've got a lot of friends and hobbies to fall back on to support me. I'm just so tired of it. Why is it so difficult for me? I don't see anyone else around me finding it to be this tough. I wish I could just turn off the anxiety, and talk to someone I have a crush on like they're just another regular person I am making friends with, instead of fixating on the inevitability of them hurting me.",1679222468.0

379,Bullies know or don't know,19,11vd1o4,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11vd1o4/bullies_know_or_dont_know/,3,"Imagine you are a kid and your family keeps bullying you, mocking you, nit picking things, ridicule you. There are adults who are so insecure that they compete with children, they want to feel superior but most importantly [want you to remain inferior to them](https://media.tenor.com/jDVC2cDGNGcAAAAC/powers-up-punch.gif).

It goes both ways

(1) They must feel superior in terms of status, money, accomplishment, intelligence, luck, fortune. AND

(2) You must remain inferior in terms of status, money, accomplishments, intelligence, luck, fortune.

By chance if you are able to attain any measure of wealth, status, money, accomplishment, intelligence, luck, fortune in life

(1) They will ridicule, make fun of it, envy you, nit pick you, how you are still inferior to them and

(2) Yet pretend to be lovey dovey because they know that you will not deny their advances, you cannot.

Life is so complicated. Earlier I used to think ""why don't people just go no contact and stop talking with toxic and bad people?"" Later I realized that social personality is inevitable, you need a certain level of connectivity, networking, interconnectedness, you help them and they help you. Life may change any time and you will need them to do things for you and vice versa. In this way, it is inevitable to have a social personality just like you cannot go on without an outer layer of skin over your muscles. If somebody has been mocking you since you were a toddler, the anger will build up inside you even though you have grown up now. Anger, resentment, bitterness, frustration, helplessness. And by the chance of fate, if they are still in your life and still being the superior bullies they were, you will want to avoid them at all costs otherwise you just cannot heal in the same surroundings.

I understand this much, I don't know if bullies know they are malicious or they think they are angels inside. I think they think they are angels inside. The one who bullies does not realize he or she is a bully. They act like it was nothing, as if it did not even matter what they did and said. People are so hollow, so hollow inside. So hollow that they fill it with emotions, validation, ego boost but yet remain hollow. So much hollow inside.

Same goes for internet virtual world. People post memes, comments, say things they know will get them likes and upvotes. They will do anything to make others feel inferior. Atheist v/s religious. Vegan v/s non vegans. Spiritual v/s science. I cannot believe I was so caught up in these things for so long. It was a kind of default mechanism for me to fulfill my emotional needs in virtual world which remained unfulfilled in real world. I went from being bullied in real life to unconsciously bullying in virtual life. When I could not take the negative soul eating emotions anymore, I realized that life is a compensating scale from one sphere to the other. ",1679205650.0

Where I lived, almost everyone downtown knew me and talked to me. I had people who stop me to talk with me about how they admired my dressing and my confidence to do so. They would tell me they loved that I dressed for myself and it showed. I made friends all the time everywhere and had became super outgoing while still maintaining my introvertedness. 

I was happy. I started to find myself and be myself. 

Now, ... I've been thrown back into the meat grinder again and came out the other side. I feel like I had to deal with so many of the same traumas all over again. My heart is shattered still even though the situation has been rectified. I've always been able to pick myself up and grab the ""duct tape"" so to speak and put myself back together again. But now, I'm holding an empty roll and the pieces of me are finally too small to fit back together. I feel like my light is gone. There's nothing left inside me.

Everything inside me hurts so much or it's just empty. Even though I lived through some really bad people in my life, I always had trust for everything else and everyone else. I've finally been pushed to the point where my trust is gone. It's gone for everything and everyone. I don't know how to get it back.

I've always lived live with hope but I'm 40 and I still learned nothing apparently. Even the nicest the person is just a viper waiting to strike from what I've learned. I've no hope anymore. I barely keep it together for those around me. No one knows how bad it really is because if they did everything would fall apart again. 

I can't dress the way I used to, in the clothes I like. I feel stupid now. I feel judged poorly. All around, lost.

I can't act the way I used to. It's like someone tired me up and I can't move anymore. I tried to have a talk with someone, the biggest culprit of the problem, but they're weren't very much helpful.

Someone hurt me so deeply that i dont even know how to take care of myself or have a big enough desire to. taking care of myself just feels like work it feels like a chore and for the most part i feel tired and miserable while doing it. On top of that i have no idea how to reparent my inner child because i simply have no energy i just wanna be done with the whole thing. It rubs me the wrong way when i see things about how as an adult you have to take charge and responsibility for your life and your trauma is your responsibility and your job, it just feels like too much to do alone.  You have to do it alone and thats making me panic because im just tired of being alone and dealing with my feelings alone but your trauma is so unique and not enough people even understand the concept of healing so i have no one. 

Im looking for a new therapist and psychiatrist but it just feels like a lost cause i have to start all over with them. They often tell me im very self aware and that im doing everything i can to sustain myself under this amount of stress which leaves me feeling helpless like they dont know how to help me. I don’t think i can do this and ive been heavily contemplating suicide cause the pain and frustration of just remembering and analyzing and suffering and fighting against my own thoughts is just too much for me. Its all so exhausting it just makes me sink deeper into my depression and bad habits i just want to give up and destroy myself completely because its more familiar to me than getting better.",1679226014.0

Dad was verbally abusive, mom had low self esteem and they fought in front of us constantly. I’m gay and had to hide it from my dad until I was 21, that constant fear, worry and shame just compounded. 

My mom passed away 5 years ago, and she was my best friend, even with all her flaws. I moved out of my parents and my life got infinitely better. I made good friends, found a wonderful career I love, created a safe space for myself and broke free of the past. I continued to struggle with depression and anxiety but it was manageable.

This summer I started suffering severe panic attacks out of nowhere where I thought I was dying and my only option was to move in with my dad, who is much older now but still that same person. This house is where my mom passed and there’s so much unpacked trauma I can’t even begin.

For 6 months I’ve become terrified of panic attacks, depressed, feeling like I’m in nightmare, suffering DPDR and out of body experiences. I’m taking medication which has helped somewhat but I’m still really struggling. I want to move out because the daily reminder of the trauma is eating at me, I hope this will help me feel more myself because I feel like I don’t even know the old me anymore. I was social, funny and motivated - loving life that I created for myself, those panic attacks altered my very path. I’ve been having thoughts of being trapped, stuck, in a nightmare etc. my therapist says this is all anxiety and depression but it feels so much complex and deep rooted. I didn’t suffer just one trauma in life, there have been many. And all the sudden it feels like I’m living them again. My brain is trying to protect itself from the past and making me miserable in the process.

Besides medication, therapy, lifestyle changes- what else can I do? It feels like living in the hell i grew up in all over again",1679260044.0

I don't want to be insensitive because I know this is a support sub, but I think it would be a shame if I created this character who has CPTSD incorrectly as it would give those on this sub and those who struggle with CPTSD the wrong kind of representation. I'm going to talk about certain things that happen to this character that may be triggering for my friends on this sub, but I don't know how to add multiple trigger warnings (I'm only a little dumb) so I'll list them here. If any of the topics listed are triggering for you, please make the choice that is best for you. 

* CSA (Child Sexual Assault) 
* Emotional Abuse
* Physical Abuse 

&#x200B;

So, those are the big ones and I'll explain them now. My character's name is Dean Henry, age seventeen, and at his core, he is a problem solver. If he is faced with a puzzle or a problem he will negate his own physical and mental wellbeing to find the answer. This has worked well for him as an intern at the FBI, working on cold cases. But, it does not work well for him in his personal life. He *used* to be able to ignore his own wellbeing, but he can't now because he has a sister who depends on him and the Virginia DPS office watching his every move. But, these cold cases are his escape from his own head and now that he can't revert back to that coping mechanism, things are being resurfaced that he has tried his very best to bury as far down as he can. 

He is sarcastic, funny, loving, empathetic, intelligent. He's an expert liar, can make people believe he's a terrible one when the time comes. He's also a teenager who was never given the tools to sort out his past traumas and emotions and so he's made them up and they are terrible ones. He's resistant to therapy, even though he very much needs it. 

Dean's parents were teenagers themselves. Drugs, addiction, those are the things that surrounded Dean as a child. His parents wouldn't go out of their way to hit him, but when it was convenient, they took full advantage of it. What they did go out of their way to do was verbally and emotionally berate him. At five, he didn't have an outlet so, it just all piled up inside. School helped, he had teachers that showed him kindness and understanding, but it was still there and he didn't know what to do with it. On his fifth birthday, a man who had came to their trailer to buy drugs set his sights on Dean and assaults him in Dean's bedroom. This has shattered him and all the things that have kept stacking over one another have spilled out of the crevices. And then he meets Dave, a last ditch attempt his brain has created to protect him. A boy a little older than himself who can be his outlet. He can tell Dave anything and he won't leave him and he won't look at him weird like some of his teachers. He can be his brother, with him through everything. 

The rest of his childhood isn't a cakewalk, but it's better. He has Dave now. All of the things that have happened to him have made him vigilant, have made him understand some humans on a fundamental level. He cues in on body language, clothes, how people present themselves, how they speak and act in different settings. What their car says about them or their shoe color. These skills become of some use to him when a serial murder occurs at his high school and the FBI shows up. This case has become personal, he *has* to solve it, even if he gets in trouble for it later. 

The reason for this unreasonably long post is how to incorporate panic attacks that stem from certain triggers. I don't want to write something that is surface level or inaccurate. I also want to write panic attacks and anxiety attacks correctly in the context which I know is a lot. I know everyone is different and reactions to triggers can vary a lot which is why I'm kind of struggling to articulate a question. I guess any pointers you have of certain behaviors or anything I should stay away from. I will say this story is not centered on Dean's trauma, but those traumas are an integral part of his psychology and his character. 

anyway, any ideas would be super helpful and I'm sorry I've written this ridiculously long post. It's the author in me. Have a lovely day!",1679257923.0

The last time I was on ssris (for around two months again)  i also made impulsive/ self destructive decisions which would be typically associated with cptsd (and was after a lot of fresh trauma), but I wonder if my behavior was due to a side effect of ssri's. I wonder if maybe ssris are not so great for cptsd, but there are no studies on a disorder that isn't even an ""official"" disorder yet (eye role).

He calls me on the phone and we talk on FaceTime. But I’ve noticed that he purposely will switch the camera to my dad and sometimes even gives him the phone to say hi. I usually will say hello to be polite in front of the munchkin, but then I’ll tell him that I want to finish talking to my brother and to pass him the phone back. I’ve tried to explain to my brother that when we talk on the phone, I just want to talk and spend time with him. But I don’t think he really understands. 

I’m worried that my dad is saying things to my brother to make him feel like it’s his job to make my dad happy by making us talk. I’m making this assumption because my dad did similar things with me when I was a child. He would cry or vent to me about things beyond my scope of emotional understanding and always made me feel that I had to go out of my way to fix them and get involved in adult problems. The way my brother is trying to act slick about it only makes me more suspicious. 

I was NC before for reasons I (very briefly) listed in a previous post, but turned LC recently because my brother has been reaching out himself to talk with me. The reason why I made my previous post was because I’ve had enough and wanted to state my boundaries and make a stance/stand up for myself. Especially if I’m going to continue talking with my brother. I love him so much but I don’t want a relationship with my dad. Especially right now. He has this mentality that just because time has passed that he can try to make his way back in, but I’ve made up my mind in wanting peace for myself. The only reason I’ve put up with him for so long is because I love my brother and I want him to know I’ll always be there for him. But I also want to protect myself and my sanity. 

So I guess my question is, what would be an age appropriate way to talk with a child about this boundary I have? And how can I explain that I understand if it makes him feel conflicted, but it isn’t his job to mediate? I just want him to be his happy, go-lucky self without putting these adult sized emotional burdens on him. If it continues anyway, how should I go about handling things then?",1679252589.0

I didn't have a great childhood, but overall its been hard for me to pinpoint events that I could use in EMDR, my trauma just seems like one long droning memory, in my opinion not as extreme - just very prolonged stress.

I mean there were definitely some events that pop into my head more often than others but they logically don't seem any worse than any of my other memories.

Other days just leaving the apartment for a five minute walk totally stresses me out. In other words, I am not like a normal patient who is afraid of spiders and then you gradually expose them and they recover. For me it can be everything and anything that disgusts me, terrifies me, reminds me of past trauma, whatever. Worse yet, I'm not always afraid of those things, as I mentioned.

I feel so frustrated. And I'm sure it's frustrating for my therapist too, which may be why she never acknowledges the complexity of the problem. I am not seeing her now, it's been a couple of months that I'm on my own again. Anyhow, wondered if others can identify.",1679175320.0
407,Does anyone experience flashbacks of good memories?,1,11vrqyu,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11vrqyu/does_anyone_experience_flashbacks_of_good_memories/,1,"I know a part of ptsd is the unwanted flashbacks of the painful trauma and the triggers that set it off. However, something I have noticed every now and then that I can’t figure out, is good memories that flood my conscious mind.

These memories are of times when I was really happy and content or of when trauma hadn’t really took place in my life or impacted me just yet. Some of them are really simple, but pure memories like shopping with my mum whilst I watch it rain outside. 

I’m trying to figure out what this means for me, I know not everything always has a meaning, but they’re so vivid just like a flashback and they’re triggered by a smell, the way the sun reflects on something, a sound or even the taste of food etc. I feel like it means something, that my mind is trying to tell me or show me something…. 

Does this mean I’m healing? Or maybe my mind is reminding me of simpler, happier times to comfort me. Although, I don’t feel I need to be comforted right now… Does it maybe mean I’m lacking connection or does it mean my mind is trying to protect me from the bad memories by showing me the good? Or maybe they are just core memories I had forgotten and because I am working through my trauma the bad ones aren’t consuming me as much anymore… 

I had this happen in my abusive relationship and it was a gentle reminder of a time when I felt loved and that people cared about me because I was feeling so lost and isolated at that time. At the same time it brought me great feelings of despair because things were no longer that simple and I was being abused. 

Now I am doing so much better in life. I am healing. Yet when I get these good memories flood my mind, they still also bring feelings of sadness even though they are good memories. 

Can anyone make light of what is going on here? Is this something you have experienced too? 

Thank you.",1679247700.0

I had spent nearly the entire time from middle school to mid-college in a state of virtually complete emotional suppression. I had decided that feeling no emotions ever again was the right course of action because feeling emotions simply hurt, so pushing them all down was the quick and easy solution. It made me incredibly numb and I simply made my way through life with a mask up which prevented most people I talked to getting anywhere close to me in an emotional context.

Fast forward to about October of last year and I caught incredibly intense feelings for a girl, combined with being thousands of miles from home and my then-friends basically dismissing my declining mental health made the floodgates burst open with regards to all of the emotions I was keeping down. It basically peaked in a mental breakdown where I cried uncontrollably for a couple of hours and I was somewhat dissociated and most definitely triggered for at least a couple of months.

I've been slowly rediscovering emotions as time has gone on, the first being sadness and grief, followed by anger and rage (finally making boundaries and validating myself against how I was treated), and some short sustained periods of love and compassion which have been more frequent as time has gone on. I've been trying my very hardest to peer deep into myself and face the pain in my psyche, and I'm very proud of how far I've come so far.

Most recently, I'm rediscovering jealousy and envy, combined with becoming aware of what exactly shame is and how much of it I have. I guess this is what they mean by ""healing is not linear"" because it completely came by surprise just how sudden and intense I got triggered these past couple days. Has anyone else here dealt with something similar regarding repressed emotions and rediscovering feelings?",1679218723.0
413,Can someone help clear stuff up for me?,7,11vdk4z,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11vdk4z/can_someone_help_clear_stuff_up_for_me/,14,"I'm not asking for a diagnosis, I'm seeing if this could be something that was missed, and if it could help with a future session because I felt like my past sessions haven't gone anywhere and was missing some clarity on what I was feeling. Also, this is going to be a bit jumbled so I apologize if it seems like everything out of order.

I've been depressed and anxious for as long as I've known, can say I was becoming aware of it in middle school as it was progressing. In 2019-2020, I was hospitalized and admitted into outpatient, then inpatient about a year into my outpatient program due to other problems. They diagnosed me with MDD, Dysthymia, and GAD, but I also had concerns of trauma but the psychologist wasn't quite sure about PTSD because I never really experienced any symptoms. Maybe I should have talked more with them, but it's too late now.

I don't know if it's even a thing, but I've always internalized/bottled up my feelings. Only recently and after a lot of self-reflection, I've realized that I dissociate a lot. Sometimes, I'll be having a conversation with either a friend or family member and randomly remember stuff from my childhood. Nothing happens on the outside, but on the inside, it drains me so much that I really just want to be left alone after it happens. Ironically, I'm super aware of what I'm doing and what's going on in the surroundings, but maybe I've just been in denial about it too.

On a more extreme note, I've seen and experienced lot of violence/anger from siblings. I don't feel anything in the moment, but I'll feel extremely uncomfortable with what happened when it's all over and done. My sleep has also always been restless and I'll wake up with some feeling of despair or anger.

All of these compounding problems have led me to being unable to commit to pretty much anything. I spend most of my time locked in my room playing video games because they give me a sense of belonging (I keep my room pretty clean and tidy though, so there's that) but I need to accept that I use it to further dissociate and to avoid my responsibilities as an adult. I don't have a job because I know that I'd quit about a week in due me being able to handle the stress. Can't pursue further education either due terrible school experience and work ethic.

Right now, I can't afford any therapy or see if I have PTSD. I don't want to rely on family to pay for my sessions (my mother just got heart surgery so that's a big dent in finances). I would talk about this with a therapist though if I was able to afford it.",1679207340.0

Basically, I rent in a very expensive city and I have to stay in this area for school. I currently live alone: I had to move out from living with my roommate after months of emotional abuse/boundary crossing/some physical abuse. 

I have very little money left and can’t afford to rent and go to school anymore, but I’m so so scared of looking for new roommates because the idea of not having a safe space I can lock/don’t need to leave makes me want to throw up. I don’t have any friends I can rent with, and have pretty bad social anxiety around meeting new people.

But I feel like this is where my mind goes. I find it weirdly calming in a setting of terror and hope. Like I can relax in it?

439,this whole 'processing your emotions' thing is so hard.,10,11v4eoe,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11v4eoe/this_whole_processing_your_emotions_thing_is_so/,2,"The last two days have been really really weird. I don't even know how to put it into words because I don't actually know what is wrong with me, but I've literally just been crying...like a lot. I know what triggered it, and even still, I don't really understand how to process it because I don't ever cry like this. 

Basically, my therapist assigned me homework last week to try to reach out to a few of my closest friends and tell them how much they mean to me. This is something I struggle with because I am terrified of rejection and being abandoned, but, I did it, and received so much love back. 

Today, I went to one of my closest friend's house. She's a bit older than me, and sort of like a mother figure. When my parents kicked me out last year, she took me in and let me live with her and her family for over six months. She is genuinely one of the best people I've ever met and seeing her interact with her children really solidified this for me. She's an amazing mother, the sort of mother I wish I had. 

She's even offered to pay for my cap and gown for my upcoming graduation from Grad School and I just can't wrap my head around that. Today was the first time I visited my friend and her family since I finally moved out and got my own place and being with them today was really jarring. I don't know how to explain it, aside from being around them feels home. 

I've known these people for literally less than two years and I truly don't know how I ever lived without them...which is what I'm pretty sure triggered all of these emotions in me because while I know that I can't rewind time, I can't help but feel as though I was robbed of this type of acceptance and love as a child and that sucks. 

idk I guess i'm just trying to process this and understand what's going on in my head. Its so overwhelming and sort of came on unexpectedly. Has anyone else experienced anything like this?",1679182043.0

441,Second guessing a breakup and whether I have 'too many needs',3,11v9x59,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11v9x59/second_guessing_a_breakup_and_whether_i_have_too/,7,"I broke up with my partner last Monday.

When we met, it was amazing, we had a super strong connection with lots in common (and separately too) and communication was consistent, I saw her regularly, she was reliable. I felt secure in that way (which is rare for me).

We both have CPTSD as it turns out (I am recently diagnosed).

The thing is, she has anger issues (that she self-admits). And a few weeks ago, we got into our first argument. I'm one who's worked really hard to move away from anger (my mum, while she did her best, was the prickly, emotionally invalidating type who had anger outbursts). And my partner became super defensive and then needed to take 3 days space (still texting though), to re-regulate. In my opinion, this argument could have been a conversation, and while I was teary, I was calm and emotionally expressive using NVC. Anyway, we talked about it and I thought it was resolved.

THEN we had another argument a week later. This was way worse and definitely a argument that could have ended as a conversation. But she became heightened and needed to leave again. This triggered my abandonment wound and I begged her to stay. My bad. But also, the defensiveness flew back in and again. I was confused at how it escalated so quickly and again I'd been calm and using NVC.

We discussed this argument later and tried to mend it. But I kept feeling insecure about her anger issues (I'd seen the intensity on her face and in her body as she was driving after her brother made a comment to her that others would be annoyed about but not disregulated) and they scared me. Especially with my past.

After the arguments, I needed more reassurance from her because of my abandonment fears. And I'd express my needs clearly e.g. 'could you please hug me right now' or something like that. I know I need to be able to self-regulate and that's on me, but she said the extra reassurance was too much to handle. I'd also ask questions based on the conversations we'd had, and she would have increasing impatience, seeing this as reassurance seeking when I was trying to understand because my mind blanks out a bit in conflict.

They reminded me of how my mum behaved (a big source of trauma) and a relationship I'd been in before that lasted for 5 years before I noticed abuse (he'd started hitting things out of anger and was a routine gaslighter) and I was experiencing emotional flashbacks.

I had to end the relationship. 

Now, I am second guessing. My partner said she'd stay and support me as I worked on my anxiety. But I still can't trust my perception of what's normal and not normal or reasonable and not reasonable in a relationship. 

After 7 ended relationships, I can't help but think I'm the problem. But I work on my stuff, I try to heal and become self-aware. Sometimes I stayed far too long in abusive situations, others, I feel I was too co-dependent and ruined a good thing. Others still I feel I was too picky.

I feel like I don't know up from down or wrong from right. I feel like I can never possibly be happy in love.

How do I trust that my perception is right? Are my needs too great?",1679196220.0

Left home at 17. Cut all ties permanently with my parents in my early 20's. I hadn't seen my dad's side of the family (from the UK) since I was a baby, but one of my Aunts and two cousins reached out on facebook and I met them my junior year of college. They seemed so sweet and forward thinking...nothing like my parents. But it turns out it was just better packaging. And I'd rather know garbage is garbage than have it shoved in my face in a pretty box with a velvet bow. 

I remember the first time this crap happened. Where my Aunt would insert herself in my life, talk to me every week and ask questions about my life, always saying I could confide in her. Then a year and a half or so down the line, her children would email me saying my problems were too much for their mother and how dare I burden her with anything bad in my life. They would then go into judgement mode on what was or wasnt my fault, based on things I had never talked to them about. Only their mother. God I wish I could have seen them for the fucking snakes they are the first time around...but instead I blamed myself and shut into my own world even more. 

But this time was different. This time when my aunt reached out, the only problems I'd talked to her about were physical health issues...I thought I was in the clear this time because I thought...there's no way in hell physical health issues/having an auto-immune disorder could be considered my fault. Maybe before they blamed my trauma on my ""poor choices"" (if they could even be called that) but no decent person alive would blame me for this right?

But that was the part I hadn't understood. My family isn't decent. None of them. My cousins gave input about doctors appointments. My aunt set up weekly zooms and was not happy when I missed two. She asked me specific questions and told me to message her between zooms about test results or anything else that came up. It's been less than a year since she reached out and reinserted herself in my life. Guess what happened two weeks ago. 

I wake up one morning to find out from my cousins that their mother has blocked me because she can't handle the stress of my health issues. And how dare I burden her with anything bad in my life, when they've told me not to do it before. (But their Mom reached out to me and constantly asked me to tell her what I told her and they knew full well I was talking to her about health issues since August last year. I hadn't heard a micro-peep from anybody that anything was less than copacetic, so I read this message in a total state of shock.)

My cousins laid the guilt on thick, saying that my health issues were giving their Mom health issues and I wasn't allowed to talk about anything accept the good things in my life from here on out..or I'd send their mother to an early grave. 

When I was in shock I apologized, but that apology quickly gave way to anger. (Their mother has high blood pressure and shingles, but in so far as I'm aware, I've had much worse health issues....and I'd never use it as an excuse to act like this level of a disgusting human.)

There is such a rich stupid irony in telling a girl with lupus and PTSD, she's causing their mother too much stress and that the mere knowledge of me having health issues is causing her to have health issues. But hell, that's not even the grossest part. You know what is? 

As soon as she saw how angry I was...as soon as I took the, ""What the ever loving hell?!"" Stance...You know what one of my cousins did? She talked to me about me and her mother's amazing bond. And how good it would be for their mother to know about the good things in my life. She then offered to pay for therapy while ignoring whatever questions I had asked. 

So I told them I was hard passing on all of it. And blocked them. They can all burn in a fucking fire for all I care. I have lived this reality for most of my life. The mini adult from early childhood, who acts like their parents therapist and mediator, all while getting perfect grades and scholarships in talent x, y, z,....all while pretending I didn't have my own wants, feelings, needs and desires...all while accepting abuse without putting up a fight...because I was told if I ever did try to fight back I'd be kicked out on the street...even as young as 9 I was told that.

 I would seriously rather die than ever be that person again. But hell, at least my parents were clear cut about expecting a performing puppet. This comes across as so much more insidious. Whenever my Mom set psychological traps, they were often God awful and volatile, but the shock value was minimal after awhile...because God awful and volatile was just an extension of who she was. I seriously didn't see this crap coming...either time. 

There's a place for garbage. Dumpsters. Landfills. People who have to deal with garbage usually get paid. But I felt like I was minding my business, trying to live my life...and twice now got fedexed garbage on my front door step.",1679208020.0
444,Music helps me,1,11vhl7o,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11vhl7o/music_helps_me/,2,"Music helps me so much. I am struggling but it's a way to heal and learn. I was inspired to make this post because I came across the song ""Dogs"" by Pink Floyd, a song which I had never heard before. The lyrics made me think of my healing in a new way. Below are the lyrics, and I recommend listening to the song as well.

&#x200B;

You gotta be crazy, you gotta have a real need  
You gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street  
You gotta be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed  
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight  
You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking  
And after a while, you can work on points for style

Like the club tie, and the firm handshake  
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile  
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to  
So that when they turn their backs on you,  
You'll get the chance to put the knife in  
You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder  
You know it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder as you get older  
And in the end you'll pack up and fly down south  
Hide your head in the sand,  
Just another sad old man  
All alone and dying of cancer

And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown  
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone  
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around  
So have a good drown, as you go down, all alone  
Dragged down by the stone (stone, stone, stone, stone, stone)

  
I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused  
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used

Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise  
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze?

  
Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending  
That everyone's expendable and no-one has a real friend  
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner  
And everything's done under the sun  
And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer

Who was trained not to spit in the fan  
Who was told what to do by the man  
Who was broken by trained personnel  
Who was fitted with collar and chain

Who was breaking away from the pack  
Who was only a stranger at home  
Who was ground down in the end  
Who was found dead on the phone  
Who was dragged down by the stone",1679221111.0
445,Navigating a friendship/potential relationship with someone who had c-ptsd,5,11v8si5,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11v8si5/navigating_a_friendshippotential_relationship/,1,"Hi,

I recently met a girl who has c-ptsd.  I spent *a lot* of time with her in the first month after we met, she was going through a rough time and seemed like she just needed a bit of support in moving on to her next chapter.  It sounded like where she was headed was going to be a healthy environment for her, so I sat and listened while she processed things out loud in the hopes that she'd find the strength to go.  Initially it seemed like she wouldn't be coming back but gradually she started talking about plans to return.  I'm still not 100% sure if she will, but I'd like to talk her about the possibility of a relationship if she does.

My concern is that expressing my feelings will change the way she looks at the support I've given her so far, and how she percieves the place we met.   It started out sounding like she just wanted to get away and never come back, but I think she realised this could be a good place to heal and grow too.  So I don't want to fuck any of that up for her and leave her feeling confused and isolated if she suddenly feels like she can't come to me for support as a friend?

She spoke a lot about how much she values open and honest communication, even from people she ends up rejecting, so I wouldn't feel right if I didn't share how I felt with her. I'm unsure of how to do it in a way that minimises the potential for pain. 

Additionally, I'm interested in any videos/podcasts/books/etc that anyone here has felt helps supporting friends better understand what you're going through.  I've been looking into it myself but I figured you've probably all seen or listened to something and thought ""this is what my friend needs to watch if they want any hope of understanding what's going on inside"".

447,It hurts when my mum and older sister bitch about me to each other whenever I feel upset with them.,2,11vcrdy,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11vcrdy/it_hurts_when_my_mum_and_older_sister_bitch_about/,1,"It happens a whole lot, mostly instigated by my mother but sometimes also my sister as well (though less). I don’t do anything outright aggressive or horrible. 

I just take on a slightly more annoyed tone whenever they do something that really frustrates me — this time it was my sister automatically assigning me to make a call to a service centre for an activity booking that she made herself to ask some questions, and we’re both deathly afraid of making and picking up calls, but suddenly I’m the one being told “here’s the questions I have to ask, call them now”; the answers to the questions she had were listed clearly in the booking confirmation and i put it in front of her face to read that everything was clear in the booking confirmation (i said they already had our pick-up address, then showed it to her) and she was literally looking everywhere else but the very obvious, differently coloured section that i was pointing at when I said it. so I moved that section up to her eye level, and she kept moving her eyes up to look at the sections above, and I did it again saying “here” and pointing at that section, and she still wouldn’t see it, so I got frustrated and just less calmly said to look at the section I’m showing her and pointing at. 

Next thing I know, I look over and my mum is privately texting my sister (and my sister back at her), gossiping and bitching about me getting frustrated. It’s blatantly obvious and I see the words right there, and it’s very clear that they were talking shit back and forth about me. After I looked at my mum’s phone and looked away, the next thing she does when I look back is completely shield her phone from me by putting her hand there to block it and turning / tilting the phone away from my line of sight. 

My mum and her abusive behaviour throughout my entire childhood (I’m in my mid-20s now) is literally the reason I have a terrible need for validation (I literally cry as soon as I perceive that some rando on the Internet thinks that I’m not a good person, I HAVE to be completely good and make no mistakes and make nobody angry to to be treated with love and respect), and the reason why I’ve suppressed so much of my anger and negative emotions for 2 decades. I was never allowed to be angry, that got me insulted, emotionally + mentally abused, and even hit. She’s a huge contributor to my clinical depression, CPTSD and eating disorder. And she’s supposed to be a “changed” person now since realising from a therapist she only met 3 times that she was the cause of so much of mine and my sister’s suffering for years. But then she does a lot of shit, including this, to show that she hasn’t really changed and maybe doesn’t want to or think she has to.

And it hurts even more when my sister, the person I’m closest to who parented me, engages in this secret badmouthing too. I feel betrayed. Unloved. Love in this family feels conditional from every single person — you deserve to be loved only if you don’t show any upset or outright anger towards me, you’re not worth shit if you express anything negative feeling towards me. I’ve never done it to my sister, or to my dad. Sister doesn’t get any badmouthing from anyone. Dad gets a lot of outright and covert badmouthing from my mum, sometimes told to us, otherwise to her sisters or friends.

I’ve only recently been coming into daring to express my anger and frustrations, just very slightly. And mum and sis have been like, “yes feel your anger, yes anger is good and it’s progress, it’s ok to feel frustrated and angry even if it’s towards us!”, and then this happens. So it’s okay when it’s big depression, suicidal, SA-triggered PTSD, and ED anger, but not okay with its small frustrations. It’s okay when it’s towards someone else, but not okay when it involves them.

We’re on family vacation and together almost all the time. I had to walk behind them to cry to myself, and cry at the front of the car quietly, because of how shitty and worthless and unwanted I felt. I wish they would just kill me and leave my body to rot somewhere so they can spit on my grave all they want, especially my mum, and I wouldn’t know or feel any of this shit.",1679204700.0

I went to my doctor on Friday for this weird symptom that I’m thinking might be derealization? I haven’t found the right word for it and struggle to articulate it.

i've had several big disagreements with my closest friend over the past 3 months.  It's hell.  It feels like hell.  i keep crying, getting triggered and prepare myself to cut him out of my life.  then i calm down and try to accept that this is still the same person who's helped me during times predatory men have tried to manipulate me, has acknowledged the difficulties of my life, and ultimately, while we might always not agree on how i should solve my problems, he doesn't try to control me or turn me into someone i'm not.

&#x200B;

So, I know that I experienced trauma as a child from growing up around alcoholics. But I feel like my mind repressed something else; I have gaps in my memory and it's like when I try to analyze them my brain won't let me. Also, I apologize in advance if this seems scattered, I'm kind of tired and obviously a little bit shaken.

I started having rape fantasies when I was pretty young, probably around 11 or 12. (I always chalked that up to me getting exposed to a lot of non-con fanfiction at an early age, but now I'm not entirely sure.) 

I have a very hard time feeling comfortable around men (I'm AFAB, nonbinary). And even when I have had a male partner, and felt comfortable enough with him to have sex, penetrative sex just wasn't really possible because my body wouldn't let it happen. I can't just chalk it up to nerves because even when I'm not emotionally nervous, my body just won't allow penetration. Even in a non-sexual context. I can't even put in a tampon because my body ""closes up"" and I start having an anxiety attack. 

I thought it couldn't be a repressed memory, because that seemed too dramatic, but when I couldn't even put in a tampon without having an anxiety episode I couldn't help but wonder if maybe something had happened? Again, I have these gaps in my memory that I just can't seem to bring myself to remember. I just wasn't sure if anyone here had any similar experiences and maybe advice.",1679190671.0

460,Has a job worsened your C-PTSD symptoms due to a toxic environment?,6,11v19mu,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11v19mu/has_a_job_worsened_your_cptsd_symptoms_due_to_a/,3,"tw toxic work environment, gaslighting, love bombing, suicidal ideation mention

I (21) just quit a job that I've been at for approximately 5 months. It was a job I got completely by luck and at first I was pretty happy with it. My boss seemed quite understanding and supportive, but I didn't realize that it was actually a toxic and unprofessional environment. 

I experienced near constant gaslighting and love bombing, where in a single day I could be told I was the best employee she had ever hired and then an hour later treated like I was the stupidest person on the planet and incapable of doing my job. For reference, I have been diagnosed with ADHD so there are times where I am forgetful or procrastinate, but I was selling products although I was not sales and provided excellent customer service. She promoted me without asking (and without additional pay) to be a social media coordinator, and when I tried to explain that I would not be able to handle both jobs (I worked 20 hours/week), she refused to have a conversation about it and insisted that it would be fine.

A few weeks ago, my boss (84) walked up to me in front of both of my coworkers (in their 60s) and threatened to fire me. She believes that it's necessary to call every customer, and that texts/emails are not acceptable as they aren't as personal. I REPLIED to a customers previous email, but my boss did not get the full story (she thought I started by emailing), and once I tried to explain she told me that there are ""no excuses"" for my behavior. I think it's also important to mention here that she had refused any accomodations for my ADHD (I was doing poorly so I couldn't get the motivation to fight that). Even though I wanted to walk out that day, I figured I should wait until I had another job lined up before I quit. At this point, I was suffering from almost daily suicidal ideation and I was barely functioning outside of work. At work I was almost constantly anxious about what she might say/do, if I might get fired, and if I was genuinely doing okay at my job. 

Since it's a small business, there was no HR department to go to with my complaints so I stayed quiet and tried to deal with everything. If you do try to have a conversation with her, she's incapable of admitting that she was in the wrong and so she tries her best to pin it on you. If you try to explain yourself to her, she sees it as you being ""defensive"" and ""refusing coaching"", so I didn't feel that having any kind of blunt/honest conversation would be productive. 

After that day, she started regularly making passive aggressive (and truly aggressive) comments to me vocally, through email, and on paper. My therapist and I decided she was trying to something along the lines of ""constructive dismissal"", where they force you to quit so they don't have to fire you to pay unemployment. I have actually been in a staff meeting where my boss said out loud that if she fired someone she would get out of paying unemployment and that she ""always does"". 

Wednesday of this week she interrupted me in the middle of a phone call with a prospective client (again, I'm not supposed to be sales), to chew me out about something. The second I got off of the phone, she made more aggressive comments, essentially leading to ""what have you been doing the last few days""? She requires that every staff member fill out a task sheet that shows every task you have worked on, every person you talked to, etc., and you have to turn it in at the end of every day. I have done this, so she has a copy of my forms. At this point, I was so frustrated that I could feel my entire body shaking. I am not generally an angry person, especially not this angry, so I knew then that it was time for me to quit even if I didn't have another job lined up. I told her ""I quit"", nothing else, turned in my keys and walked out. I have never quit on the spot like that before, as I'm typically a person to give a two weeks notice at a job, but I knew I couldn't stand it anymore.

Since then I have felt extremely relieved and the suicidal ideation has definitely decreased. However, I'm having flashbacks/dreams and a lot of general anxiety about the job and quitting. I don't regret quitting and honestly I should have done it a lot sooner. I feel like I can't stop thinking about it no matter how hard I try and I'm almost wondering if this, in a way, has made my C-PTSD worse. I was already insecure about myself from my previous trauma, so working already made me anxious and exhausted. 

I know that trauma from work/work environment is a real thing but has anyone else experienced this? Do you have any advice? How do you deal with the anxiety of a similar situation happening in the future? 

TLDR; I was in an extremely toxic work environment and quit but have been having flashbacks, nightmares, and increased anxiety since. Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice?

I did (and still do) consistent, hard, true work to heal. I received my diagnosis with Complex PTSD in 2016 and have come a long, long way. 

I have absolutely crushed it in the career game. Highly successful career thus far and mostly in high stakes, high stress roles. For the most part, I have thrived and “performed”. Honestly I believe now in retrospect that I have been masking and overachieving for a sense of security that I never had growing up. 

Except….now…I hit my threshold. My company is performing at random layoffs over the last several months, even high performers are getting raises and getting axed in a 48 hour time period. Existing employees are on receiving end of inherited workloads of those less fortunate. All the while, management is preaching empathy, grit, and resilience but in the same breath doubling down on “performance culture”, or else it’ll be you next. Legit, I am not exaggerating. 

I am just wholeheartedly burned out. I have nothing left to give. I’ve been in a constant state of freeze, fight, flight…picking fights with my SO, becoming so distraught and lost in despair that an entire weekend goes by and I’m stuck in freeze. 

So I decided to give myself the grace and courage to take short term leave to get my emotions and body stabilized. I called my boss to let them know that I was executing a claim for leave, and their response was “do what you need to do but know this is a stressful job, so you need to think about that.” Up until this point, I have showed no signs of stress, haven’t missed days outside of scheduled PTO, have received high remarks and raises for my work and expertise.

I searched for answers here and on the internt about the question I have but I didn't find anything. For context, I was physically abused as a child. I'm 20 and have been living on my own for 2 years. I have repiratory and ""nasal"" problems that started  years ago but it never bothered me that much and for some reason I kept forgetting it when the opportunity came to tell a doctor (super wierd because I had problems daily). 1 month ago I finally went to a otolaryngologist and turns out I have pretty severe asthma and a nearly complete blockage of my nose. The meds have really changed my life but this made me realise that this isn't the only case when I either don't feel physical pain that much or I just block it mentally. There are other things like the fact I don't feel hunger unless I am very hungry. 

Is it possible that with the abuse I suffered from as a child I came to block any sort of physical discomfort and if so, how do I get this sensitivity back? 

It might seem a bit idiotic and not that big of a deal but to me its quite a handicap for everyday life because it prevents me from seeing the problems my body is facing so I can't fix them until they end up being so big that they're harder to fix.

I was sick of feeling this way and was very eager to get help. I grew up in a family that never talked about anything (Irish Catholics) no affection, no hugs, no I love you. There is nothing significant that happened in my childhood (no physical abuse or DV) but the emotional neglect was clearly very taxing on my mental health.

I scored very high on a trauma survey and when i read about the symptoms and started working more with my therapist, it’s definitely something I am experiencing.

I grew up with ongoing extreme trauma in every direction of life, and yet when I was younger my body just responded by overachieving and seeking happiness. I always felt like if I used the pain as motivation, one day I’d be past all the hard stuff and be free to live the beautiful life I built myself. So all of the pain just fueled my inspiration to make beautiful things and see life as a gift. Masking came easy to me and I felt I could relate to most people and easily make friends.

In early 2020 I got long Covid that completely changed me. All of the pain suddenly hurt. I no longer felt inspired to achieve - the bare minimum feels impossible. Masking is no longer an option and some days I don’t know if I have a single friend. I used to take solice in my own mind; thinking deeply about the universe, and just my own company thrilled me - now I can hardly think in full sentences. In my free time, all I can do is sleep. Over the past 3 years I’ve seen every specialist, taken every test, went on an SSRI (which did help a small percent). I’ve been in “talk therapy” for years with no talk of goals or direction. 

I feel unrecognizable from who I was 5 years ago. Most days I feel like a vegetable or dementia patient, unable to think or function at baseline levels. I have no sense of self or confidence because this new me feels the opposite of what I identify with.

It seems like everyone around me is at the peak of their life, finally figuring it out and sharper than ever. I feel like I reached that at age 15 and am too burnt out to exist now. I’m way too young to just accept living like this, but I have no idea how to get back to a semblance of myself. Do I accept that this is me now? Do I fight for cognitive repair? Do I keep taking more antidepressants?

My partner and I were 21 or 22 years old then. The relationship lasted for about a year. I was deeply in love with my partner, but in 2020 he broke up with me. We were in different cities, and the pandemic made it very difficult to be okay. We met once after 6 months to catch up, and a year later I messaged to return a few things. He responded that he'd confirm the time with me, and I didn't hear from him after. I felt abandoned all over again, but again, I respected his decision. Two months later, he messaged me to catch up but didn't address the previous message. I was hurt and caught up, didn't feel safe to speak to him, so I never got back. I felt I had moved on and wished him well until he messaged me while on mushrooms. He told me how he wanted to say he was sorry, etc. How he feels bad that we don't talk...

I went into a trauma response. I couldn't breathe right. I felt like all I needed was to kill myself. I couldn't live. That there was no point in me. The only obvious thing was to die. I wanted to get under the covers and not go out again. For two weeks, I was obsessed with what he said and what he thought of me. That I was being mean, that I'm a bad person for not being normal, for not being in touch, for being too much, for being a loser. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, I couldn't think clearly. Steeped in Constant Terror.

Later, I messaged him back, but this feeling persisted. I thought it would go away if I was vulnerable and honest. But it didn't go away. All I got was a cold message of apology and how we should be away from each other. I was mortified. felt like a ""crazy"" person everyone leaves. A crazy, desperate person no one wants. 

After my therapy session, I found out this was a trauma response. Fawning. It's been a year and a half since this event. 3 years since the breakup. I still feel my chest pound, get running obsessive thoughts, and feel like I have no value if I hear of him, see his Instagram account, or see his photo through a friend's account. It still feels like he haunts me. I'm constantly thinking about when he'll pop up and preparing myself. I used to get revenge fantasies where I could see him and beat him up with jiujitsu.

I've had trauma responses since. When I run into his friends, I see some pictures of him.

I've grown over the last year. I am a psychotherapist now and love the work I do. I'm fairly good at it. I'm confident, outspoken, more authentic, loving, and present. These few weeks have been especially tough, and I feel more vulnerable to thoughts of him, feeling abandoned all over again, feeling shame over my trauma response, feeling shame over not being able to connect with some friends from that part of my life, and not being able to have a healthy acquaintance with my former partner.

The relationship wasn't particularly abusive. It was a little invalidating. But I was super anxious through much of the relationship. I would plan my way of helping myself if and when he abandoned me. It would feel like a test. Overall, I'm so miserable because I spent so much time feeling unloved, unspoken for, and unable to express myself over the last few months. At the same time, I felt unseen, deeply in love with, and attached to him. I have been single since because I'm miserable on every date, and the people I like don't want to be with me.

I'm aware how I'm so attached and yearn for people who don't want to be with me. To a point, I feel that is what I deserve. This week, I've really been hating myself. But I'm so tired of reliving this again and again. feeling the shame, again and again. I'm aware this is rooted in the neglect I've faced throughout my life. Raised by a mother with depression and mania who threatened to kill herself if we wouldn't eat an angry, verbally abusive father. Sometimes this doesn't make a lot of sense. I felt like killing myself when my father and I used to get into fights. I'd want to take revenge.

477,"Why do ridicule myself over past trauma and minimize everything I’ve been through. My therapist is telling me I went through severe neglect and abuse, but I don’t think what I endure was that bad.",12,11urxna,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11urxna/why_do_ridicule_myself_over_past_trauma_and/,7,"This is a long post so I’m going to try to keep it objective as possible. I have always struggled with self esteem and self worth issues so I decided to get help about 4 months ago. I have been sharing everything that I went through as a child and he is telling me that I went through severe neglect and abuse. 

Him telling me that I was severely neglected and abused doesn’t sit right with me, I don’t think my child hood was the best but I don’t think it was severely bad either. I don’t know if this is some kind of survival mechanism or what. 

My childhood didn’t start off great, I was 6 years old when my brother was hit by a car and I witnessed the whole thing. He was out in a coma and required tons of medical attention and rehab the next four years of his life.  A part of me feels that I was probably put on the back burner during this time while my parents took care of him. 

At around 11 years old my parents would go through a pretty nasty divorce. The household was already hostile before this, tons of verbal abuse towards each other.

The next three subjects are what 
I self shame myself for and minimize in my life. 

I think my mother was physically and emotionally abusive towards me. I was 9 or 10 the first time she hit me, and it wasn’t a whipping, it was a slap across the face as hard as she could. As I got to 11 or 12 she would literally beat the shit out of me by hitting and kicking me and I would never hit her back. These would be the result of me telling her to leave me alone and that I didn’t want to be with her, I had a lot of anger towards her for the way she treated me emotionally and divorcing my father at the time. 

^^^ on top of all this going on, I was being bullied at school for having big ears. My first day at middle school I was made fun of in front of the whole cafeteria for the way I looked. Kids on the school bus were constantly picking on me everyday on the way home. One day I got off the bus and I just lost it, I couldn’t take it anymore and I just broke down in tears hating my life and wanting it to end. 

I asked my parents to have my ears pinned back and this has resulted in extreme self shaming.  Now as a grown man, I am extremely insecure about the fact that I was bullied as a kid and had surgery to get away from it. I have been beating myself up for years, telling myself I should have been stronger and stood up for myself. For the life of me I don’t know why but it has made me so insecure and caused so much self hatred that I had to try to get away from the chaos.



On top of all this, my parents woke me up one day and sent 8 hours away to a military school which is probably the most fucked environment a middle schooler needs to be in. The physical abuse there was worthy of the school being shut down. 

These are just bigger events that happened in my life. My therapist tells me all of this was severe neglect and abuse, idk if I quite feel that way. Maybe it’s because I minimize all of this  to deal with it. 

Does anybody struggle with with self shaming ? For the life of me, I have zero compassion for myself. Especially about the whole bullying thing and having my ears pinned back. I still criticize  myself for not being stronger and ruminate on it everyday. I would like to leave this in the past and just move on with my life. 

My self worth is horrible, I don’t think I’m good enough for anybody and I’m pretty damn sure I’ll be alone forever. How in the hell do I become happy with myself and not have so much self hatred and shame with in me ?",1679154646.0

She then told me things would be different. She would put her needs above mine for once and I thought that was fantastic and supported her. I soon noticed things changed.

In lots of ways I have a good life - I am in a good marriage, I am poly and have a good new relationship that is developing slowly. There are issues with the second relationship - but they are more me not trusting or worrying that I am about to be abandoned.

I spent 6 years of my childhood being told I wasn't enough, that i was disgusting for the things I wanted - that I had been taught to want - that no-one could ever possibly love someone as disgusting as me. My entire life I have lived with the knowledge that there is something dark and unloveable at my very centre - something that I have to hide.   


I did the work. I went to therapy - I know it wasn't my fault, I learned how to enjoy sex without guilt. But still I feel that part of me has to stay hidden. I feel that I exist rather than live. I want, and am desperate for, reassurance. My husband gives it readily but my new partner is more reserved emotionally...I feel at times that I am going insane as the need consumes my thoughts, 

I seem confident, good at my job, successful - but my world is so small. I work from home, I go to the office once a month when I have to, I go to do my hobby once a week....but I avoid days out, fun things with family or friends (I don't really have many)...I hate the thought of being out in the world on my own. I know it isn't normal - I know that I should be enjoying life...but I can't. It affects my family - they do things without me as i am always catching up on cleaning or work or some other excuse that means I can stay in all weekend. 

I am not depressed. I just feel unworthy of the world. I feel less than. I don't put effort into taking care of myself because I don't deserve it...it isn't even that I don't think I deserve it - I am embarrassed at the idea that I might feel I deserve it. Because what it someone found out that I thought I deserved more than I had....more than I was. That was one of the big tactics when I was young - make me believe nice things and then laugh at me for believing them. Make me ask for things I want and then make fun of me for asking. Wanting things is hard - I want to be a real person. But I am afraid of that want.",1679186113.0

I’m currently home on spring break and going through an IOP program, and I’ve realized that my college friendships are a little weird. I would like to specify that this might not be my friends being terrible, it is likely at least partially me imagining things like abandonment. 

Sometimes it feels like I’m just expected to do things with my friends. Me and the rest of my friends will text and be like “when does everyone want to eat dinner?”, while meanwhile, the other two friends will just be like “Dinner!” And expect that other people will be there. In their defense, it is the same time every day, but it still feels weird. It’s especially weird that they do that, and just expect that I’ll be there every time, when sometimes they won’t show up and won’t tell anyone. Like yeah, you’re totally allowed to go out to eat instead, but please tell me? (I would like to specify that I did talk to them about it, and asked if they could tell me, and then like 4 days later they did it again, so uh nope ig) 

I feel terrible saying no, and I’ll just do whatever they want to do. I feel like I don’t even want to share my opinions on things we do, cause I feel like they’ll hate them or judge me. I also feel terrible if I refuse to go hang out with them ever. I’m afraid that they’ll decide they don’t want to be my friend if I do that. 

Sometimes I genuinely forget that I’m allowed to make my own decisions. I’ll just exist in a neutral state and do whatever they want to do. I’ll have no goals, dreams, opinions. Just neutral. Literally all the time unless they’re both off campus. Idk why I do it. 

I’ve had situations where I’ll just sit there while one of my friends talks at me about their special interest. For like 20 minutes straight.

496,Just a curious thought about crying,2,11v25gi,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11v25gi/just_a_curious_thought_about_crying/,1,"I cry very often (compared to up until 3 yrs ago). Crying has a very social component (among other things) in that it is a signal of distress to other people. You are crying for help without actually having to approach someone and ask. And you are communicating your distress openly and sharing it.

I noticed that when I cry it's usually alone; I often cry when I'm outside, on the street or in the metro or in the woods, but if I think other people may notice I can stop almost immediately. I cry outside when I cannot hold my tears in, but as soon as another person comes too close I am able to stop immediately. 

I find that a very curious thing - something that sends such clear signals of distress (bc when we're crying we ARE distressed) to others I do not allow others to see.

Like I am not allowing myself to send out these signals. I know I've shut down my emotions when I was little bc when I showed them I was laughed at at best by my mother, so, yes, I understand how this can happen. But it still amazes me how damn strong this brainwashing is. No, other people must not see me crying, showing emotions is weakness, weakness will be punished.

Now, I have been having emotional flashbacks for roughly 2.5 years now and crying is the most prominent reaction that goes with an EF, and still whenever I cry outside, I am able to immediately stop crying whenever someone comes closer and I start again once that person has passed me. And even stranger still is the fact that most of my flashbacks revolve around ""There's no one there"" and ""I am rejected/abandoned and I need to do xyz on my own or I'll just die"" or ""I just want someone here with me, I want a hug"" and as soon as someone is closeby I turn my tears off like a faucet and turn them back on once that person is at a safe distance.

Okay so I’ve worked as a prison officer in a violent jail for 18 months before being accused by other staff of bringing in contraband and having inappropriate relationships with prisoners. I challenged all accusations and came out clean but the place was racist and I believe I was indirectly bullied the whole time. I really enjoyed working with prisoners but was paranoid the whole time that someone was always watching my actions ready to report me. I guess I never knew my perpetrators although I fought the system consistently.

At the time I had panic attacks, tearful, rage issues etc, but also slept stupid amount of hours. I used to have nightmares but today struggle with managing my emotions/expectations of myself/ low self esteem. 

In the UK I’ve just been given antidepressants and put on NHS counselling waitlists, but I feel like I’ve been struggling for years. My daily life is affected by it but I can’t seem to get a diagnosis. I’ve done a lot of CBT privately

I finally bit the bullet and decided to go for a paid private psychiatric assessment which is costing me a stupid amount but I have to know what’s going on with me. I feel like embarrassed and frustrated getting only labelled as ‘depressed and anxious’ when I think something more serious is going on.

They read my journal, and then threw in my face certain stuff I wrote while not even giving a damn I wrote in there the I was suicidal.  They took my phone away. They coerced me to quit a job that meant a lot to me and then told me how worthless my job was and how I didn't make a difference (yes, in ABA therapy progress is slow, but the appreciation those kids had for me is undeniable).

——————————————————

I was a planned pregnancy, born to two parents in their mid 30s with established careers and already had one brother and another soon on the way.

My first memory of this world was my mom smiling down at me while she bathed me as a baby, still too young to sit up on my own.

My new family seemed like the ideal little setup from the outside

but,

sometimes things just don’t work out.

——————————————————

**Part 1:** my father

——————————————————

My father is an ex-army veteran. He moved to working as security at a hospital where he met my mom, a physical therapist. Later he transferred his job to working in a prison as a corrections officer and then to a psychiatric hospital where he was chief? He also did police work with a police car and everything. (For all the years he’s worked there I never actually knew his actual job title, but he was in charge of a lot of people that I do know and people called him chief).

My father had ptsd and I believe cptsd from coming from a bad home environment himself and from being in the army and watching friends of his die. He hated his father for being a violent drunkard, passing out on the floor and abusing his mom, him, and his siblings. I find it ironic he turned out the same way.

The older we got the worse he got. He’d come back from bar fights bloodied. He only got one dui because he was usually able to flash his badge and the cop would let him go. The house reeked of alcohol and piss because he would pee in the kitchen sink on top of the dishes. Just like with his father, it was not an uncommon sight for me to come home from school to find him passed out on the kitchen floor.

My father was a violence loving narcissist. My brothers and I all agree on that. He could never be wrong, nothing he can do can ever be wrong. He always has to be the center of attention. He’d play his music on his giant stereo system at 1am on a school night in our tiny house with thin walls. Try to turn it down to sleep he’d shove you away cursing and threatening. He’d disappear for weeks without explanation or notice, not even a text, and then he would return again.

He’d punch holes in the walls and even broke two doors (one partially, just a long crack in the wood, one completely completely destroyed, along with the wall on the opposite side where he leaned into it to kick the door in). He’d threaten to bash our own head into the walls, not because we did anything wrong, he just wanted to.

My mom once came to me terrified that he’d try and murder us. She wanted to go to a shelter but I disagreed since I was told all the shelters near us sucked. Whenever she called the police they always took his side. She ended up getting a restraining order against him. That’s how it ended and how we found some peace. 

She didn’t tell us right away that she got a restraining order, I was having nightmares every night that he would come back until she told us he won’t.

Classic of my father, after he got kicked out his immediate response was to cancel all the credit cards and lock my mom out of as many bank accounts as possible. I remember sitting in the car with my younger brother next to bank while she was at the atm with a strained look on her face as card after card didn’t work. My mom was no longer working at this point due to disability (more on this later). Because of my father’s actions we couldn’t afford a lot of basic stuff like wifi, decent food (we relied heavily on free lunch and food banks), the trash bill (we’d travel around town to dump our trash instead), new clothes, car repairs, the list goes on.",1679164199.0

I've known for a while that I have a lot of sleep anxiety and seem to dread the idea of ""wasting time sleeping"". I realized though that my desire to stay awake worked a lot like an addiction. I desire that constant state and even when I'm awake It's painfully to think of being asleep.

I then realized this also applies to happiness. After years of abuse and neglect I've been trained that my ultimate goal should be to be happy. And that anything other than perfect happiness is utter despair and just wanting to be happy again. 

Its not the sadness or anger that is unbearable. It's the lack of happiness. So what if I treat it like I don't need to be happy?

What I mean is this, once I remove the pressure I've put on myself to be happy, I'm at peace. And I don't need that constant happiness in order to function. I acknowledge how uncomfortable I am and choose not beat myself up over not liking it.

510,Intense Back/Neck Pain after Therapy Session,2,11uyjhk,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11uyjhk/intense_backneck_pain_after_therapy_session/,3,"TW: Eating disorders/Anorexia

TLDR: I had a therapy session yesterday where I finally discussed the beginning of my eating disorder, and since I've had sharp/intense pain in my lower neck/upper shoulder blades area.  Has anyone else experienced this?  How long did it last/was there anything that helped?  I am familiar with John Sarno's *Healing Back Pain*.

&#x200B;

I developed anorexia my freshman year of high school and it's been my life's main focus ever since.  I've been at a healthy weight and have had a great relationship with food for many years now, but I know a part of my brain has still been stuck in that time, particularly my time in college where I was a lot less intense with my ED than I was in high school, but still in it enough to feel attractive and therefore not unvaluable.  Logically, I know there were a lot of problems during this time, too - a lot of suicidal ideation, SAs, not truly feeling emotions, more family dysfunction, etc, but it still *felt* like I was ""safe"" compared to the bullying and family dysfunction I experienced beforehand.  I feel somewhere my brain/heart glorifies that time because everything *felt* good, even though logically I know it was far from.  So I've been spending years trying to figure out what's been keeping me stuck, and I've made great progress.  Special shoutouts to *Body Keeps the Score*, Neurofeedback, and now Somatic Experiencing, which have helped me immeasurably after years of confusing brain fog and fatigue, which popped up after graduating college and getting to a healthy weight.

*Body Keeps the Score* helped me a lot because, I think with my anorexia in particular, a lot of physical symptoms masked my emotional/psychological issues (I also self-harmed for a couple of years before my anorexia, so emotional suppression leading to self-destructiveness was my MO).  The book led me to Neurofeedback, and also to Somatic Experiencing, where I can focus on my physical symptoms - ie, tight chest, tight throat, numbness in arms, etc - and have the space and guidance to find what emotions/memories these responses are attached to and work through them.  I feel great shifts after sessions, so I really do believe in the physical/mental connection.

I've rewired so many things well, but overall still have that ""stuck in past"" sensation.  However, I feel like I've cleared enough of the other stuff to be able to see and focus on that ""stuckness"" and start communicating through it in therapy.  The line in my head is ""The belly of the beast"" - I feel like I'm ready to enter it, to revisit those years in college to remember how imperfect and human of a time it was (versus a fuzzy fantasyland, as my mind holds onto) and even revisit the onset of my anorexia in high school, which my mind actually doesn't remember very well - it doesn't really ""go there"".  I feel like taking the glory out of it and revisiting/healthfully working through the pain will stop it from being a safety response and will help me be present, because it's felt like I'm missing so much on life by being stuck in the past.  So I had a non-somatic therapy session yesterday finally broaching these times in my life and, again, I felt a really great shift inside of me after - like a lot more space in my chest filled with clean, clear air.

I don't know when I noticed the stiff neck, but by an hour after my session it felt like I had a pinched nerve where my lower neck meets my shoulder blades.  A part of me wondered if I slept weird, but my morning had no pain at all and I don't recall my morning feeling any different (my therapy was 11a-noon and I woke up around 8:30).  I'm used to feeling these physical shifts and know sometimes it takes a day or two for them to settle, so I was thinking ""okay I might be out of commission today, but tomorrow it will probably settle"".  Well I've woken up today and my pain is even worse, and is taking up more space in my back.  I've never had pain like this, and definitely never lasting so long.  No exercise or movement prompted this.

Post-*Body Keeps the Score* I bought other books that felt like they could help, one being John Sarno's *Healing Back Pain*, since my lower back would often feel weak  (not in pain, but just would give out when standing and such).  I've since lent it to a friend at the time who was struggling with a lot of arm pain that I believed to be psychosomatic, and he and I aren't speaking anymore (for many good reasons).  I looked it up on Amazon this morning and ordered it to be delivered tomorrow, but am hoping I can use some of my day today to hopefully get better.  I know the basis of the book is chronic back pain (or any pain) that doesn't seem to have a physical cause might actually be emotional.  I'm surprised I'm feeling such intense pain since I'm already a believer of this.  I'm trying to meditate to see if I can feel what emotion this pain is connected to, like in my SE sessions, but I can't find anything in particular.  I don't know if it's simply because I entered such an intense territory of my life finally, and so it's something I'll need to work through in therapy.  I fear this a bit because my sessions are once every two weeks, and I don't want to have this much pain for that long (especially since I work at an intense company) so I don't know if anyone's had an experience like this and knows of ways to help between therapy sessions/in general.

What a puzzle our healing is!  The good news is I feel a lot of benefit from the session, especially mentally - maybe it's such a huge shift that my body is creating pain to hold back such great change because it's scared.  I'm okay with that because it's been a long time coming, and it will be worth it, but seems like it will have its ""final boss mode"" struggle to get to the other side. Any input would be super appreciated - thank you!",1679169233.0

Academia is a small pond; word gets around, and the humanities in particular have backed themselves into a corner by preaching about their ""priorities and ethics"" without practicing it. Not only will everyone she respects know who she is, but whether or not I go public in any capacity (and I DO have photo evidence)  -it's still a small pond that has a promise to live up to.

Basically, because that woman never once bothered to teach me how to do taxes, I was doing them wrong over and over again. Even while using Turbo Tax to do it.

Where I should have been getting thousands of dollars in tax refunds, I got none of that, and ended up owing the IRS about $140 when a real tax expert finally helped me do my taxes correctly.

The funny part though: that woman didn't know how to do taxes either! She was telling me to do her taxes for her, which means I was doing both her taxes and mine incorrectly for years because, like I said, I didn't know what I was doing, and apparently she didn't either.

It's hard to know how to feel about this. On one hand, I'm pissed cause she laid a very heavy burden on me, to do taxes for her without knowing how to do taxes myself. As if I somehow magically knew how to do taxes in an environment where she restricted and filtered any and all information I would ever get to see.

But on the other hand it's funny as fuck, cause for me, I only messed up for about 3 year's worth, and missed out on some refund money and have a small fee I need to pay now. She's been doing her taxes wrong for at least a decade before she started getting me to do it incorrectly.

""If you wouldn't have...""

I can't count the number of times I've heard a statement that began with these phrases. So much so that I actually began to believe them. ""I must be broken. There must be something wrong with me. If I hadn't-""

STOP.

Don't do it to yourself. Cut that sentence short. It's not ""If I hadn't"" it's ""If they hadn't."" It was their lack of self control, their brokenness, that made them into what they are. 

I know it's easy to give them excuses or justifications, especially for abusers who also showed kindness at times. And those moments of kindness become a weapon in your own mind against the reality of what they are. But the truth is, humans are complex creatures, and one human is able to be both kind and abusive - and if they are both, their violence STILL wasn't your fault ❤️",1679096076.0

I guess the title says it all really. I engaged in self compassion today during my therapy session. My therapist and I were doing “chair work”, basically having a conversation with yourself. Mine was between current me and 12 year old me. Speaking to my younger self, I told them they deserved someone who would look after them, listen to them; they didnt deserve to be alone. I wished I could reach back in time and give them a giant hug and a shoulder to cry on.

It works. Today, engage in some self compassion (specific to your own experiences of course). Let yourself now, or your old childhood self, know that they didnt deserve a single bad thing that happened to them. Whether you say it out loud or journal it, just let yourself know somehow. And don’t let anyone stand in the way of that self compassion. Don’t let anyone tell you that you’re just wallowing in self pity (as I’ve been told before); you’re not. You’re taking steps to heal and better yourself and if anyone wants to stand in the way of that, well they know exactly where they can stick their opinions.

(I'm not even on TikTok or Twitter because those just scare me). Mostly because it causes me severe anxiety and depression and on rare occasions....the dreaded flashback.

The purpose of this post is a vent. Since I'm female bodied but identify mostly as gender fluid, I still get the Instagram algorithm pushing stupid mom content (no offense to anyone who's a mother, but I think you know of what I speak). I'm child free by choice and because the pressure of raising a child without being fully healed makes me think I'm going to repeat cycles of abuse unknowingly so it's best not to have that happen. 

Anyway, in the video reel this mom has her 3 or 4 year old daughter with her and says something like ""I gave birth to my best friend, I tell her everything and she tells me like it is"". And all the comments were like ""omg me too my daughter is my bestie, I tell her everything"", ""she's my mini me"", ""my daughter is my clone"" etc. . Thousands of views/likes/comments. 

Now, as someone who's mother used me as a therapist before I understood what object permanence was and many years beyond, this triggered me. 

1. Your child is not your ""friend"", they're your child and your their parent. You parent them, you don't friend them. You can be nice and have a close relationship, but never would I consider a parent a friend just like a teacher shouldn't be a friend to a minor student . Have mature relationship boundaries ffs.
2. Your child needs to have friends their own age to learn and develop properly. As a parent one would expect you to have friends your own age (or adult aged) too. 
3. Your child is not your MINI ME CLONE. They are a unique individual who's inherited their own unique set of traits that makes them their own person separate from you. If you treat them like they're a clone they will lose sense of self. 
4. Have any of these people even heard of enmeshment? 😞

But then I went through prolonged trauma during the ages of 10 to 14, and during that time, I didn't develop, I actually regressed a damn lot. For example, my speech was just gone, every aspect of it, and people who did not know me for an extended period of time could not understand a word of what I was saying. 

I made it through school from the inertia of my childhood, but the qualities needed to do my homework from start to finish, and on a daily basis, were gone. I didn't get a year off after school to sort this mess out because my parents forced me straight into uni. I graduated, but only after a mental breakdown and a year off. And feeling like a fake, because I didn't have the capacity to fully take in the course materials, and to, well... Actually study.

So anyway, for the last 2-3 days, I have been trying full-time to read an engineering textbook related to my field. And in that time, I've managed about 20-30 pages **in total** .

It's not like the book is extremely challenging to read. It has new concepts that make me need to re-read some sentence or just stop for a few seconds to think about something sometimes, but it is manageable.

I feel like the aspects that make it difficult for me to read are, in no specific order:

* **Procastination:** the inability to actually start the reading, and come back to it after taking a break (which I need a lot of);
* **Lack of attention span:** I can sometimes manage no more than a paragraph before my brain comes up with something that sounds really exciting, like picking up my phone or googling something I wanted to google some time ago but forgot to;
* **Fear of potential problems encountered while reading the book?:** this one is weird, but it's like, my mind is racing forward and asking questions like, what if I encounter a problem at the end of the chapter that I can't solve? Or some sentence (usually half-handedly explaining something that isn't very important) that I can't understand no matter how hard I try?

I feel like the 3rd reason is actually really important, because I can deal with novels much better than with technical books, though I still usually just read them for a day or two in a row and then my brain blocks them out and I forget to continue, sort of like it's too stressful.

I'm 20 years old and have been suffering from multiple mental illnesses at different points in time from age 9 onwards (severe depression, (social) anxiety, and an eating disorder).

I've been in inpatient treatment twice last year because of severe depression, but I didn't really respond sufficiently to any of the seven antidepressants I tried that year. I left inpatient treatment still feeling broken and unable to lead a normal life. 

The psychiatrists suggested that antidepressants might not work for me generally (yet they still have a hard time believing me when I tell them that I don't notice a difference after trying a new medication).

They also said that I'll probably live with depressive episodes for the rest of my life and that I just have to get used to that, which scared me immensely after having lived with moderate/severe depression for the better half of a decade(without a complete remission in-between).

I really have a hard time believing that I just have to accept having depression for the rest of my life. Especially because everything started with me experiencing a couple of traumatic events in my childhood. Before that, I was a relatively content child. Some of my relatives could even confirm that my whole mood and outlook on life changed during that time period.

**This is why I wanted to ask if you have experienced a reduction in depressive symptoms after dealing with your trauma (e.g. in trauma therapy)**.  I feel like my depression doesn't improve because treatment always focused on the symptoms rather than the cause.

Lewis has the chance to go back in time and meet his mom before she leaves him on the doorstep of the orphanage, his goal for the entire film, but at the last second he hides and lets her leave him.

There are people who deserve to be treated like humans. And people who don't, like you. You never fully knew why, it was just part of the fabric of things.

Imagine a tree being chopped then blamed because it gives no fruit. Instead of being watered and cared for to help it growing back faster, it has to pretend to be like all other trees.  It has to make fruits with its own blood and flowers with its own tears to keep the fiction going. The tree feels naked with no leaves, humiliated, because it comes so easy for the other trees, tall and intact and cared for, to give fruit. 

Everyone says that all of it is normal, you are just imaginining things and you should stop complaining, because you've been chopped years ago. But a tree takes years to grow. It needs to be respected. It needs to be watered. It needs sun and peace and innocent joy. Just like all the other trees.

And when it's back tall and strong, then yes, it happens. Overnight: it just...dares to bloom. Beautifully. Majestically. The other trees look in astonishment. And soon after, fruits will start hanging from its branches. Ripe, and sweet, amd well-earned after having to be born twice.

Does it matter that it is the first time our tree blooms in a very long time?  No, it does not. This tree had been chopped. And it grew back. Is it its fault that it was chopped? No, it is not. Is it its fault if the whole society is blind and trees are treated like machines? No, it is not. The tree is a tree. All it knows is growing.

Now the tree has nothing to envy to the other trees. In fact, quite the opposite. Now the other trees ask for advice. Whenever someone gets a branch chopped, they ask ""how do I water myself now to grow back strong like you?""

In my family several females have begun to imitate my hairstyles and clothes…..and to the point of recreating photos of mine……it’s why I went 100% NC.

I’m not up on a pedestal because I think I’m better than everyone else. I’m up on a pedestal because people put me there.

And so I act like the better person they all think I am. I spend most time alone and have more happiness that way.

I’m disgusted at the thought of sharing my life with others……authentic hardworking and kind hearted people are set up for death in this world.

I’ve almost been killed twice. Stalked stolen from and abused severely for kicks.

I’d sooner end my life than share it at this point.",1679153663.0

I know i really shouldn't because it's something I'm consciously making the decision to do. I also notice that caffeine makes me dissociate more.

547,Advice on my marriage,2,11urarl,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11urarl/advice_on_my_marriage/,1,"Hi - I've been recovering from CPTSD my whole life, even before I knew the language for it. Discovering the diagnosis has been life changing. I was lucky enough to find a good-enough therapist and have been working on tamping down my inner critic, shedding my self-loathing, and stepping away from black and white thinking (go me!). So many positive changes in myself, and I'm feeling the hopelessness shed off of me after two steady years of hard work on this stuff.

And yet... it is bittersweet. It feels like I'm awaking up to the relationships around me and I'm able to see them more clearly. Before when I was stuck in black and white thinking - my marriage wasn't bad so it was good. I never questioned what I wanted, because I already had a good marriage, something I didn't really deserve. Now that I am exploring more grey thinking, and asking myself what I actually want... it is sort of breaking my heart to see my spouse isn't what I want. My marriage isn't good, and in terms of the grey scale, is closer to bad than good.

Married for 14 years. For most of those years, I was compliant, suppressing my reactions, my thoughts, my feelings like I'd done my whole life. It's what I had to do to be loved. I truly believed I deserved to be invisible, and co-created a marriage where I was invisible. While in the throws of CPTSD, it was comfortable. I kept slipping further into CPTSD, which was my clue to keep trying, to keep looking for help. Enter the good-enough therapist who - EVERY SINGLE TIME I talked bad about myself, he pointed it out, helped me thought-correct. I learned a bunch of other techniques that worked for me and discovered this subreddit, and listened to Pete Walker's book for the first time. (Again, go me!)

My spouse isn't a bad man. I care about him, but when I say 'I love you' back to him, it doesn't mean the same as it did before I starting my serious healing.

He struggles with mental illnesses of his own. His memory isn't great. He doesn't do it on purpose, and yet every time he forgets things, even small things, I have to fight falling into flashback. When he forgets something important to me, I go into flashback hard and have to fight the flashback and my own emotions to not over-react. It makes me feel like I deserve to be invisible, that I'm silly for thinking anyone would see me, really hear me. I know that's the inner critic talking - but several times a week his lack of memory triggers me into emotional flashback.

His memory is not likely to improve. I don't know how to cope with this. It is a lot. My good-enough therapist is not focused on CPTSD, and in these nitty gritty type questions he relies on his general knowledge. I can tell the language I've started using around CPTSD, the 4Fs, and emotional flashbacks just doesn't land with him.

The marriage has been not-great for a long time. Over the years I've tried, on occasion, to request changes. More listening, more affection, more foreplay, and sometimes there will be improvements for a week or two, and they fade back into me being invisible. We haven't had sex for roughly ten years, following an incident where he crossed a 'no' boundary and I've never been able to see him as safe in the sexual arena. (I have a history of sexual abuse as a child, and sexual assault with first spouse.) Even before that incident, we were struggling with intimacy and sex. Back then, we couldn't afford therapy, so we just sort of limped along. I acknowledge my side of the no sex between us. It is difficult on so many levels.

I'm in my late 40s, and discovering my own sexuality by reading AO3. I'm masturbating every night (for the first time in my life I have a consistent libido - direct consequence of asking myself what I wanted for the first time in my life.) Based on the sex spouse and I used to have, my current desires in this arena make me believe very strongly that we aren't compatible. I have discovered several lovely kinks, and he was boring vanilla (and not very generous or willing to learn.) For example, he has a hard time holding my hand. He has an aversion to touch, or being touched. Since the incident, he has been afraid of hurting me, so has been even more reserved. (This isn't limited to no sex, this marriage is no-physical-affection - a peck on the lips before bed. A weekly hug if I ask.)

Spouse and I are trying to work on our marriage. Ideally we would love to find a couples counselor, but after 6+ weeks of hunting and no one is available (we are limited by insurance) we are trying to work through Gottman's book 'The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work.' Every exercise makes me sadder, and spouse happier. It makes me see how far the gulf is between us, how much we don't know each other, how far into crisis our marriage really is. 

Spouse is trying, but... when we talk after the exercises, and I try to explain my feelings over the years - he isn't connecting to it. We are miscommunicating about our miscommunication. A third party, versed in my mental illnesses and his mental illnesses, would help us both navigate this. That's not a possibility atm.

He is trying to improve, and leaves a nice note (for example), my emotional reaction is resentment, and annoyance. Five years ago I would have been overjoyed. But it sorts of feels too little too late - especially after seeing how distant we really are.

My question to anyone who has been here or close to here : how do I separate out my true feelings about my marriage and spouse, versus the CPTSD reactions? Any insights on the triggering aspects of our dynamic? How do I value my sexual desires in all of this - since we've been affection free for so long?

Thanks for reading. The insights offered in here have helped me be brave enough to make this post. Sending safe internet hugs to any who want them.",1679153082.0

Up until the ages of 16-18 I would uncontrollably wet the bed almost every night. I would go through phases where it would not happen for a couple months at a time, or would happen very sparingly. However, for the most part it would occur anywhere from 3-7 days of the week.

No one outside of my immediate family knows about this issue (to my knowledge) and I have never seen a doctor about it.

The issue has slowly gone away over the past 2-3 years and happens very sparingly now (a handful of times a year).

I have just turned 20 and have started to suspect / realise that I may have been subject to abuse primarily from my alcoholic dad during my childhood. I say suspected as I have only just started remembering events from my childhood that I realise were not normal amongst other families. A lot of my childhood memories up until around the age of 15-16 are a blur and I only really recall small flashes. 

Without going into too much deal, my parents had an extremely messy divorce when I was 16. Shortly following this I got heavily into drugs, consistently and occasionally excessively using everything except hard stuff - primarily weed, alcohol, mdma, lsd, shrooms, etc.

As of late I have begun slowly tapering off my drug usage and have slowly been realising and remembering the events of my childhood. I have started seeing a therapist and have yet to bring up the bed wetting. Could this be related to this at all?

555,Can parents split one of their children black?,4,11ukddu,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11ukddu/can_parents_split_one_of_their_children_black/,7,"TLDR: Can parents who think in black and white still take basic care of their children, but decide they are 'bad' aka split them black?

This might be a dumb question, but I'm really struggling to understand this one myself. My entire childhood and young adulthood, I always felt like different rules applied to me than to my older sister when it comes to my mother. I was quite an outgoing child when young, and always loved making friends, but as I grew older I became more reserved, quiet, and socially anxious. I basically went to school and then spent my time in my bedroom drawing or listening to music. However, I never got any trust from my mother and she always got angry about little things unexpectedly. She made me feel like I was a very problematic teenager, when I did literally nothing. Looking back I see myself as a vegetable version of a teen l, literally zero joy, and did not go through 'puberty' until my mid 20s. It was a very scary time. Even as a young adult, her fury would rain down on me for the most bizar things. For example, she got really angry with me because I started dating a boy in a neighbouring country, since that wasn't ideal that he lived abroad, or something?

I've never seen this type of constant anger and criticizing towards my sister, UNTIL RECENTLY! I moved abroad for years and came back, so I was out of her radar. I come back and she has all these bizar accusations towards my sister that make zero sense. Aka ""she didn't show me her wedding photos straight away, she waited for months! It must be because her husband is angry with me, because she would've called me asap to come see them in the past!"" (Her husband is not angry and wedding photos take months to be processed and developed by the photographer....) and then giving my sister the silent treatment whilst complaining to me.

Is this splitting? Does she always split one of us black for no reason? Or is this just a typical codependency dynamic? As in she always resents one of us because she puts all her energy into one child and then does not receive what she wants from them? The latter would also make sense, because I remember her being very claiming as well, inserting herself into my life when she wasn't invited. An example is her straight up breaking into tears when I got my highschool diploma and my boyfriend at the time wanted to take me out to dinner to celebrate, because how dare I celebrate with someone else after 'all she's done for me'.

Sorry for the long story, I just really want to make sense of this, and why she used to cling to me like that and moved on to my sister when I left. I'm happy to not be her main focus anymore, but seeing her act this way towards my sister, who was her perfect angel who she fully trusted growing up, is kind of wild. I don't blame my sister for any of this btw, she is also extremely traumatised by both of our parents.",1679134956.0
556,Recieving gratitude is I guess we all need,1,11uuqbg,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11uuqbg/recieving_gratitude_is_i_guess_we_all_need/,1,"I was listening to Huberman Lab podcast on gratitude. The science behind gratitude and how to practice gratitude. Dr. Huberman explained a lot of things. And I realised something while listening. 
We just don't become who we are because of our thoughts (as per the saying: You become what you think); what we receive also defines who we became. 
As child I never received gratitude or any sort of happy or positive emotion. So I find it hard to feel happy or appreciated or valued. 
During my college my friends they've said thank you so many times, like thank you for helping with assignment, you saved me today. Thank you for calling and waking me up otherwise I'd have missed lab today. And I was happy with them, I kind of forgot I was once happy but remembering the time makes me happy. I was able to do things, graphic designing, learning new language, managing my finance, managing myself. 
But after coming back home, I was rarely appreciated for any good thing I did. Instead I was told how I was worthless for not doing masters degree, I was a burden for not having a job, for not making money. For being skinny and what not. I barely recieved any good or kind word from my family. And it affected me way too much. I'm not able to do things I was naturally good at. From what I received I've just became a empty, hollow person.

When I thought about the time I received gratitude, I realised : Man!!! I was a good human. I was capable of doing good things, I was capable of giving someone a sense of comfort. 

I'm going to practice gratitude the way it was described in podcast. I'm going to live. 
With that I was really really disturbed because of my phobia and having a hard time, so I posted about it here and received a lot of kind messages, people telling how they're also afraid of something and they feel the same. That was first time in my life where I was able to calm myself not continuosly thinking about it and worsening things. I received tips from fellow people with phobias. Someone validated that it's not my fault for reacting the way I did. That one post and conversations in comments really helped me that day.

They often make a lot of jokes, and in general are light-hearted/funny/fun. I've worked at this job for 2+ years and for my first year of working here, I did not and would not engage in banter with this coworker:

1. I didn't trust myself to pick up on all the social cues and could easily misinterpret a joke or say something back that wasn't funny and in fact mean.
2. I didn't want to get myself in any kind of professional trouble so it was best to stay away from it

Eventually, over a long period of time I warmed up and have been able to crack jokes here & there with this coworker and to my knowledge it's always been fine.

Now, for context I walked into work today very grouchy. Wednesday night I realized I made a dumb mistake and had to redo a personal project and all day Thursday I had shooting pain and numbness down my left arm along with some mild arm weakness (I have spinal issues - not a heart attack) and I was very fatigued. I slept from 6:20 PM to 7:20 AM to be at work at 8 AM and I was still fatigued, grouchy, and my arm was definitely still hurting in the morning. Thankfully, it is better tonight.

Of course, no one at work knows any of this and this coworker who is usually a jokester is in the office. They haven't been around in awhile as they've been offsite doing work and they say something about having a really busy weekend or something to another coworker and how they're not happy about it. Off the cuff half asleep I respond with a sarcastic, ""sounds like a you problem,"" they didn't respond much to it- I didn't think anything of it. Totally missing the context cues. 

Then, later that morning they were at the copier as was I and their apple watch wasn't cooperating, so I simply said, ""Maybe Siri doesn't want to take orders from you today."" At which point they tell me they're not in a humorous mood today and would appreciate it if I didn't joke with them. 

I just said, ""Oh, sorry! Yea, no problem, you're good."" & that was the end of it. First thing that I thought was, wow what a well adjusted human setting good boundaries, wish I was better at that...at which point I realized I was the one pushing the limits and the reason why they needed to set a boundary in the first place and was the one being disrespectful & I went to bathroom and cried. Usually, when I cry at work its not for a work thing - this is the first time I ever cried over a work interaction. Granted I recognize it was a cry based on the build up of stress since Wednesday, but still. 

However, it's clearly still living in my head rent free now haunting me and I can't help but wonder, I don't like it when others have to set boundaries with me and it makes me feel icky, like I did something horribly wrong and I never want to make others feel like I did, but when I set similar boundaries with others they must be feeling like I do now and that doesn't make me feel good about myself. 

As for the joking with this coworker or at work in general goes, I'm going to back off of that. Simply because of how easy it is for me to make a tasteless joke and I don't need avoidable/unnecessary stress. Especially because I got so comfortable that I inserted myself into a conversation to make a tasteless joke that I wasn't even apart of to begin with. Ugh.

But, ya does anyone else struggle or feel guilty when someone has to set a boundary with you?",1679114167.0

Hello. I have something that’s bothered me for my entire life. I have an addiction to spanking. It’s always on my mind from the time I wake up until the time I go to sleep. The addiction started from early childhood. I started getting spankings since I was a toddler, and by the time I was in pre-school I was spanking my dolls and even other children in daycare.

My caretakers praised me for ‘whooping’ another girl at my preschool. I remember being in timeout and I couldn’t understand why. Spanking was a regular topic that I heard of and experienced as a child. Older relatives would reminisce about their childhood beatings and not long after they would reminisce about mine.

My caregivers loved to talk about my spankings I got as a toddler, because I was ‘A bad little girl’ and my bad behavior was corrected by spanking. They would congratulate themselves on correcting my bad behavior and if I asked them to stop bringing it up I was told to shut up.

‘We’re adults, we can talk about whatever we want.” Is the response I would receive. I was left feeling violated and wrong. The worst part of it all was I could NEVER remember those punishments and hearing every little detail would cause fear in me.

The childhood punishments and exploitation would only get stronger for me. When I was around six, my grandma spanked my cousin and I for playing in the mud. Not only were we spanked in the backyard, but my grandfather was recording it on the cam recorder. I remember watching him with TERROR as he smiled and pointed the camera at us.

At the next family gathering, during the 4th of July, my grandfather showed this film to our entire family. I guess it’s not a big deal, we were fully clothed. Whenever I brought it up and asked my grandmother why she allowed this to happen, she simply told me that I was accusing her and would cry.

My own mother said that it’s not that bad and it was my fault for playing in the mud. When I type this, I feel like a whiny idiot begging for attention. Maybe it wasn’t that bad. 

Now that I’m a 26-year-old adult still living with my relatives (all alcoholics), I’ve come to realize that my caregivers have a sick obsession with spanking children in public. 

I have a whole list of spanking stories that fucked me up and contributed to my current perversion. I won’t list them all, but it is safe to say that I am addicted to spanking. Everything about it turns me on. I cannot get aroused unless spanking is involved. When it comes to watching porn, I cannot get excited about anything else but spanking. It gives me a high like no other. 

I’m a member of a spanking porn-site and I draw spanking related art. I love imagining myself as a little girl getting spanked by someone way older than me. It’s on my mind non-stop and I’m not sure if I’m doing this out of spite or if I truly like it.

I’m so confused and I’m wondering if there is anyone here who has developed a fetish due to trauma. 

Side note- I feel so much shame posting this. My mind is telling me ‘How dare you talk down about your religious and perfect relatives? You’re a sinner compared to them, they aren’t kinky YOU ARE.” Even though I’m in an adult body, I feel the need to submit to them as if I were a small, punishable girl.

She would lose contact with other family members that are nice to us, she would lose contact with me, I would lose another family member. I want us to stick together, not to be torn apart.

I have a well paying job and am working towards moving out so that she can come live with me. We just have to hang in there a little longer. Or maybe she can go live with her boyfriend. But please stop suggesting CPS. I know it can be good, but in our current situation it wouldn't be.

I often find myself feeling surprised that he hasn't left me yet because he has told me that he feels hurt that he is constantly having to prove his love to me. before i call him to get that validation, the danger seems so imminent. 

&#x200B;

the source of this trauma could be from apostatizing after being a devout christian (aka finding out the thing i had convinced myself that loved me most wasn't real) or not having an emotionally available father or being in a relationship with a narcissist for a while. idk. my mom who is so loving and supportive always tells me whenever i don't accept certain help or things that i need or don't do something for myself like put sheets on my bed for a while or something, that she is afraid that i don't feel like i deserve love or good things. i know the church told me i deserved hell and not love all of my formative years so that's probably a part of it.    


bottom line though, i don't want to hurt him. I want to help him as much as he helps me. i feel indebted to him--not because of anything he's said but because i feel like i'm taking and taking and not giving. he says that i do things for him which i do, like cook or help him clean or buy him random presents and stuff. but during my panic attacks, it is so hard for me to feel like he loves me even though i'm the one making hurtful accusations and he is usually always patient, kind, and validating.

Ironic, because my abuser is currently serving 30+ years for child rape and assault.

I’ve had slivers of memories about it surface throughout my life, but would always convince myself it wasn’t real; that I’d made it all up. Then shove them right back down for another decade. Almost like I knew it was there on some semi conscious level, but if I could maintain this delusion that I’d made it up, I could really let myself believe that.

I have diagnosed PTSD from a separate unrelated event in my 20s. It took me 5+ years to actually fully process that, the dissociation alone was 2-3 years. The only thing that got me though that, was micro-dosing psilocybin over the course of the last year. It was the hardest thing I’ve even done, but it did work. (Not for everyone, and not to be taken lightly WHATSOEVER)

Which brings me to my problem. Even though the doses were small and infrequent, I do believe this was partially responsible for me recovering those childhood abuse memories again now. I was wary of this prior to starting the shrooms, but at that point I was near suicidal so it was a risk I was willing to take.

So I’m at the point now where it’s either time to fully address and start healing my CSA trauma, or to take a beat and let the rest of my memories resurface in their own time. I told my doctor I was hesitant to try emdr for fear of remembering the full events. He suggested ketamine infusion therapy, intensive outpatient, or tms therapy - which sounds a bit terrifying. 

But the thing is, there’s another option. My abused made recordings of the abuse. They exist, in some evidence locker somewhere. And I can’t stop thinking that maybe if I could just know vague details without actually having to see it, that maybe I could finally have some sense of closure…although I suspect this idea of closure is wishful thinking.

I live in the UK and am currently on a waitlist for an ADHD/ASD diagnosis and if I never self-diagnosed myself I would never have had the motivation to actually pursue a real diagnosis. Additionally, the healthcare system in this country is on the brink of collapse and can take years for neurodivergent people to get an assessment with ADHD/ASD. My family and people around me all think I certainly have some sort of neurodivergency aside from CPTSD and I have researched these issues for about 6 months now. 

For people with short attention spans especially, they need to hyper focus on their issues in order to actually get real support which is what I did with my CPTSD/ADHD/ASD and I am now further along in my mental health journey.

I never got to make friends. How could I relate and just be a kid. I saw everyone as immature, when in reality I was the wirdo who was too much in my own head. Heck I probably thought I was better, but deep down I remember I wanted to so badly fit in and join in the fun and laughter. I'm such a lonely 23 year old even though I know so many faces. 

I can't even write a fucking email without questioning it 1000 times, and my family says I'm a loser because I don't want to go to college. I know I don't have the mental capacity to go but they wouldn't understand. They keep reminding me how much I waste my life and it kills me but they think it's supposed to be motivating. 

I want to stop fawning so badly, but even though I'm so aware of my behavior, I can't make it stop. I can't confront anyone, ab anything. I always go with the flow of everything to avoid conflict. And I mean everything. The worst part is that now I'm so aware of the way ppl have used me. Aware of how they manipulate me. All this time I thought I was being a decent being, I've just been a push over. The butt of a joke. Laughing at me instead of with me. And it bring tears to my eyes. Yet, my inner critic keeps telling me I'm a bad person every time I wanna do what I want to do. I feel like a narcissist looking for validation even when I post here. Even when you guys tell me I'm not, part of my brains says yes you are yes you are yes you are. I feel like even when I tell my own story, I'm twisting it in such a way that it makes me the good guy. I don't know, all my life I've been gaslight and berated by both parents I remember looking up if I was a psychopath when I was maybe 9 or 10, because my mother would tell me I was anytime I would get angry at the mistreatment. I've lost any ounce of anger. I don't know what I would do if anyone as much as raised their voice at me. I'd probably freeze like a rabbit. I hate it so much. They made it feel like I should be grateful for the beatings because of the lessons they were teaching me. Idfk what I'm rambling on about, but you all are the only people who ever hear anything I have to say. Thanks everyone and have a ncie day, I really hope it's good.",1679060548.0

My mom (who has passed away recently) raised me on tough love and I feel like I struggle with knowing what genuine love is. I was so used to her always nagging at me, putting me down and being negative (I still love and miss her - there were good times). Now I see some of her traits in my partner. 

My partner is a very grumpy individual.  He has a lot of complaints, everyday usually in a bad mood and will lecture me over small things. I am used to it but at the same time I am sick of it. It reminds me a little bit of my mom who I miss a lot, but I don't know if I'm doing this love stuff right. We agreed to be life partners, for the most part I enjoy him. I'm just sick of his negative attitude and lecturing everyday. 

Like, for example: my birthday is coming up and I'm planning a get together. I asked him to help me pay for the venue since it's my special day. He said sure, but only if people actually show up. he said he won't pay for anything if one or two people show up and he has a huge hunch that's what's going to happen. He feels like no one is going to show up and that he is going to spend an hour with me on my birthday. 

His video game is coming out the week of my birthday and he is stressing to me in a lecture how he will be spending most of his time playing it, and not to expect attention from him other than on my birthday. I smile and say okay. 

Why lecture me about it though? why lecture me that only a small amount of people will come to my get together? why lecture me and remind me that my birthday is just a day and not to expect more from it?

i try not to be bitter or think too much about who i “could” have been. but even though the trauma started really early for me, i have memories of having a pretty strong sense of self and a lot of confidence until age 11/12

by that age my mother had been tormenting me about my weight for a couple of years and then when i moved to a new school and lost my friends/support system, i finally developed an ED and then all the other manifestations of trauma just piled on from there 

but before then, i remember literally not caring about my weight at all no matter how cruelly she would speak to me. its not that i ‘loved’ my body, more that i was totally indifferent to it

another example is how i behaved at school - even though i was labelled a “problem child”, before age 12ish i remember genuinely being amused by the fact that a lot of people/teachers found me annoying because i was loud and talked a lot. i remember feeling kind of like “if they don’t like me then there’s literally nothing i can do about it.” no fight, no flight, no freeze. just that elusive sense of self assurance that i can’t grasp or emulate now no matter how hard i try 

it’s almost worse knowing how my brain used to work compared to how it works now, ie “if they don’t like me then i am worthless and inherently unlikeable and should hide away so as not to subject anyone else to Me.” now that i’m putting all this effort into healing myself back to a mental state that i actually had once, there’s an added frustration there that i can’t really describe. it’s like i’m looking something that i know for sure is *somewhere* in my house but i’ve torn the place apart several times already and still can’t find it",1679073523.0

I’m coming to the age of 22. I’ve been through 16 traumatic events. No. That isn’t an exaggeration or a joke. I was diagnosed with CPTSD at age 15, but could have easily been diagnosed even before then. I grew up in a *really* bad area. The town itself is super nice! It’s pretty. Is surrounded by water, and forestry! The people whom reside there… is another story. Lots and LOTS of crime. I have one word for you. ✨Bremerton✨.


Anyways. That town. Caused a good majority of my trauma. It pains me to physically go back. I’m in an abusive relationship though, and going back is going to be my only way out. What resonated with me the most/messed me up the most. Was nearly being stabbed/killed at school. I was only 15 when this happened. Two weeks later.. my grandmas house burnt down. She blamed me for years for it, when it wasn’t even my fault. Long story short, we went to a park to have a picnic, to destress from the whole school situation. I saw smoke, coming from across the bay. Where her house was. So I told her and my mom “hey Nanny’s house is on fire”. They didn’t believe me.. until they heard on the scanner that yes, her unit was indeed, on fire. 

My grandma blamed me for YEARS for that. The cause? A man had flicked a LIT CIGARETTE INTO A CARDBOARD BOX. (PS, fuck you, you ruined both our lives). My life was a living hell for 3 months while she lived with us. I wasn’t allowed to sleep in my BRAND. NEW. BED. That mind you, could fit BOTH OF US as it was a full size mattress. So. I slept on the floor with a single blanket and pillow for 3 months. God forbid I slept in the bed while she wasn’t sleeping. She threatened to off herself multiple times over that. I was just a kid. Still in school. Raising my autistic brother at the time, as well as my mom was lazy. She would sleep from 4AM-3/4PM every day. So it was on me, to take care of my brother. 

Flash forward to now.. I just feel so hopeless. It seems like I cant go a year, without a traumatic event coming up. Something out of my control. Always. 

Why am I a target for the universe? Why am I being made to endure so much, as someone so young? Does it ever get better? I just recently got a puppy, who was my SDiT for my CPTSD. I was diagnosed with CPTSD at age 15. As well as severe anxiety, and major depressive disorder. Recently, I was diagnosed as being on the ASD spectrum, and having BPD. So.. I got myself a dog. Who I was training to aid me with my disabilities. Mostly.. my panic attacks. I easily have between 2-5 a day. Usually, when I am alone. I cannot handle being alone due to some of the events I went through. In the end.. he had to be rehomed due to my abuse situation. My most recent… traumatic event, as I have been without a service dog for years. Since 2019, when my old SD, Batman, had to retire, and I had to move across the state. Without him. My life has been a living hell. My mental state is drastically declining every day. I wish that WASNT me being serious. 

I wish I never had any traumatic events. That I was NORMAL. I want to go thru day to day life, without worrying when my next traumatic event will be. Trying to shelter myself, so said events DON’T HAPPEN AGAIN. 

I just want to know… when it will end. When will the trauma end? Will it always be like this? Am I just… cursed?! I don’t want to keep living, if this is truly how life will be because oh my fucking god dude. Sometimes I wish they never diagnosed me. Sometimes… as selfish as it is.. I wish the trauma happened to someone else. Sometimes… I just wish the years and years of therapy, got me somewhere. Somewhere I felt safe. Somewhere I felt ok…",1679081936.0

So I just discussed this part of my trauma with my therapist.  I was underfed in my first two years leading to lack of appropriate weight gain, and what would have been called failure to thrive.  When I was around 2 1/2 I was hospitalized for the flu and at that point my height was 90th percentile and my weight was 2nd percentile.  This was in the 1980s so I guess doctors back then were idiots because when I recovered they just sent me home with my parents.  No call to social services?  Did social services even exist back then?  IDK

Anyway, we started getting WIC, maybe the doctors pushed this as a solution?  I don't remember being hospitalized, but the WIC clinic was one of my earliest memories.  It was, I think, our first visit after I was discharged from the hospital.  I was with other kids and adult helpers in a room doing a craft while the moms were in another room (maybe getting a nutrition lesson?).

The craft finished, the moms came back and I went to show my mom what I made.  She completely ignored me like I wasn't even there, and I realized that maybe it wasn't my mom.  I had gone to the wrong person.  But then I realized that I don't know what my mom looks like and I don't know who she is.  I'm thinking I don't know how I got here, or why I'm here, or where I am.  I just stood there confused and in a daze.  

My therapist said a toddler would react to ""getting lost"" like that.  But I didn't react.  I didn't cry or try to go to anyone for help.  I think I was dissociated out of my mind.  My therapist said I must have been taught not to cry already, that crying wasn't safe, or was ignored so much that I knew it wouldn't summon help.  

So now, I'm newly thinking about how much I must have been laying around dissociated, starving in my first two years, with no energy to play, explore, or even cry.  I'm seeing myself in a new way.  Sometimes **still** when I dissociate hard, I stop protecting myself, like I don't care whatever happens to me.  And I see that's what I was doing as a baby, unable to do anything about hunger or other discomfort.  So I dissociated myself out of my body, perhaps waiting for death.

Also, how fucking much did my mom ignore me that I didn't even know her face???  WTF?",1679055148.0

I don't look down on her for this... but she would downplay the importance of like, KNOWLEDGE (not formal education, like actual learning) and would accuse me of being pretentious like it was the worst crime. I've worked hard to be the least narcissistic person in my family, give me a break.

But this one in particular pisses me off. I basically grew up in the Shameless house. I've told her this. And I can't tell you the amount of times I would say something relating to the kid and she would tell me I ""don't know what it's like because I'm not a parent"". That pissed me off to no end. Half the time, I fucking WAS the parent. I can't imagine caring for anyone more than my little sister. And I wasn't legally required to! Believe it or not, some people take care of others not of obligation, but out of the goodness of their hearts!

So I texted her wishing her a happy St Patrick's Day (we are both Irish, but I more than her... like I said, the Shameless house). We got to talking a bit, but when I mentioned my plans for the small business I'm trying to start, she completely ignored it. Then an hour later it turned into her ranting about her problems with her psychiatrist... THEN telling me I had to get one ""it's important to take care of your mental health!""

I don't know if she just doesn't understand why having my strengths being respected is important to me, but that really hurt for some reason. It makes me feel narcissistic. But it's like... I don't need to be praised for having more education than her. I just need to be... heard? Or seen? I just wish she could see me for the guy I really am, not the guy she apparently wanted me to be. Which was different than *I* assumed.

I also realized I have a lot of problems she doesn't have. For one, I don't struggle with feeling powerless due to the abuse (I ALWAYS fought back, and I acknowledge as a 6'2 guy I'm lucky to be able to do this) as much as a fear of success. Because every time I did something that made me feel good about myself, one of my parents would say something nasty or (if it was my mom) orchestrate something behind my back to sabotage me. It's been six years since my mom died, but my dad still does this with these snide, passive aggressive remarks. I'm the one putting a roof over his head and he wants my business to fail?

Can anyone relate? I wanna hear your stories. I just feel so ""other"" right now and I don't want this shit to ruin my people's holiday, haha.",1679114562.0
609,Ongoing longterm therapy is sometimes counterproductive.,16,11txfai,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11txfai/ongoing_longterm_therapy_is_sometimes/,14,"I have been in therapy for probably about 6-7 years. In those years I have noticed that there often comes a point where Im in it too long and start to feel like I need to work on pretty much every aspect of myself. Almost everything you say/do is challenged or questioned. Although it is often with good intent I find myself needing a break sometimes. Which Im going to take now after a full year of therapy. It was a very fruitful year but I think at least for the next few months its enough. 

Sometimes therapy makes me feel so dysfunctional but then I see myself being functional in many areas of my life and its confusing. I guess in therapy all your trigger points come up and this is often the part of you that your therapist sees most. There is often a lack of focus in the things that do go well. Which makes sense, but it also creates a skewed image (in my case at least) of who you are as a person. 

Last session I got so frustrated because the whole conversation everything I said was challenged. ""How can you find a way to deal with the frustration you feel about the life you have been given?"" ""How can you come to terms with people not always responding how you want them to?"" ""How can you find a way to express your anger?"". Towards the end I got so frustrated that I exploded a bit and stormed out (my therapist and me are ok again tho). I dont have an answer to these questions and I dont think I will find them soon either. I think I just need to kind of.. go through the struggle? Allow myself to struggle with it instead of always looking for a way to feel better or make things less intense? Its exhausting honestly! 

I think taking a break can be a good thing sometimes. The nature of therapy is to look at yourself, who you are, how you function. But sometimes it makes you hyperaware of yourself which also kind of worsens things.. focusing a bit less inward can give some peace as well in my experience. 

Anyway, I already came a really long way in processing my trauma so this might not be applicable to everyone. The first 4 years of therapy was pretty non stop for me too. But maybe someone can relate and needs to hear this too.",1679073573.0

I left the back door slightly open when I was 12. My dad broke my collarbone.

He yelled at me and got in my face about leaving it open, I escalated in return, he hit me so hard that his palm of his hand broke my collarbone.

After this happened he started threatening to kill me on a regular basis. I would be running as fast as I could to get the train to his house and he would call me screaming and tell me that if I miss the train he is going to ""drive down there and break my neck""

I flash back to this violence every day. 

When I have episodes about it, I feel terrified that I will be beaten for speaking about it. 

When I got home to my mom's house after it happened she told me he didn't mean to do it and I had to forgive him. 

I feel like nowhere on earth is safe for me to feel this pain. 

I feel like if I cry as hard as I want to about the decades of terror he put me through, I will literally feel the bone break again.

He spent the next 15 years gaslighting me about it. 

I wish he had been 8 inches to the right with his punch and collapsed my windpipe and killed me, at least then he'd be suffering the rest of his life in jail.

All I feel is terror, that I ""did something wrong"" that won't be explained until after I've been beaten. He just showed up at my mom's house and did that to me. It always feels like he is hovering outside my door.",1679086999.0

I am a massive foodie, with a catch: I don’t really like eating the actual food.

Isn’t that ironic? Well I do like eating actual food, but because I have an eating disorder, I hate it too. I swear, I’m CRAZY about cooking. Always watching cooking videos, cooking recipes to get better at the hobby, yet seldom actually eating. I’ve got quite a bit of knowledge about cooking techniques, secret ingredients, nutrition, and how to get quality food for a low price.

But… well, you know how EDs are. The tug of war, between the irrational ED voice trying to gaslight me into starvation, the actual reasonable voice who knows how destructive (potentially deadly) that is.

Often I cook/bake and give it to others, instead of eating it myself. Apparently this is a common ED behavior, it’s allegedly a way of vicariously eating? But I like doing that because food brings people joy (unless you have an ED duh). Combined with the negative self-view that people with depression/social anxiety/EDs/CPTSD have, feeding people and getting a positive response is one of the few positive traits I can even begin to find about myself. Oh and I‘m diagnosed with all 4 of the mental illnesses mentioned above, isn’t that nice 🤡 

When I was in the early stages of my ED, it was awful because I think I hadn’t adapted to it yet. The hunger, exhaustion, and nearly passing out when I stood up was all too much, and I thought I’d have to spend the rest of my life this way if I didn’t want to look ugly af. I was suicidal to start with, so this compounded that, and I thought, “Spending the rest of my life this way is horrible… I can’t eat, I struggle to sleep, I want to be dead, I’m suffering 24/7, nobody would even miss me if I died”.

It’s been some time now and I’ve gotten totally used to this starvation lifestyle, which seems nice on the surface, but is actually terrible. Oh and yes, I do have professional help.

615,"Not to sound shitty, but: I envy people that easily don't care about if they want to have children or not / If their partner is capable of having children or not / If they want a traditional family at all",2,11udfse,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11udfse/not_to_sound_shitty_but_i_envy_people_that_easily/,9,"Posting this in any other sub and I'd get crucified. But I need to get this off my heart *somewhere*: 

\[TRIGGER: MENTION OF VIOLENCE, INFERTILITY, OBSESSION\]

Since I was little, I had an obsession with having kids. It started out as very normal; just a big mother instinct and a caring nature. However, as time went on, the idea of a ""happy family"" became a coping mechanism. I grew up in a heavily abusive household -mother, father, the entire family was broken. When I lay in bed, crying after my mentally unstable mother had beaten me up for ""not smiling on command"" or ""stealing a book"" (taking it without permission), I would often cry and imagine how I would act the opposite. How my partner would act different to my father. In general; how I would want a family to look like. How a family that *loved me,* would look like too.

As time went on, this simple fantasy took roots. Not ""noticably"" at first, but vividly. It grew stronger and stronger -till it was everything that held me from slaughtering my mother with a butcher knife in her bed. Which...yes, sounds extreme, but it's true. Because as much as I wanted justice & revenge, this little obsession reigned stronger than that. Not only because I would get time in prison/people would avoid me for being a killer, but also because I knew it would hurt my mother so much more. Call it irony, but my mother shared my obsession. She has untreated NPD & BPD and had/has regular fits/obsessions with how my father & I were supposed to act like. Including elevating herself as the ""holy, untouchable"" mother figure. 

So...what's with the title?

I'm not really sure how to explain it still. But...I think my obsession as grown into its own form of monster. A monster...I can't ever tell anyone about.

It's like a coin-toss, really: On one side, its positive impact is huge. It is one of the things that keep me optimistic and excited about my future. It helps me keep developing skills I normally wouldn't care about. Like cooking. Or ironing clothes. When I think about a potential partner, I not only judge potential red flags for me, but also how it would impact future children. Plus, it still keeps me from doing revenge shit on my mother. Just the daydream about becoming everything my mother wasn't -fullfillng *her* goal of having successfull children that love their parent - keeps me feeling like justice has already happened. On the other side...any form of potential drawback...I can't chose. Any even slight ""potential"" that my dream might fail gives me a nearly instant panic attack: Infertility. A baby swap at the hospital. My mother somehow stealing my children or turning them against me.

Due to this, my stand on many positions is already crooked. And hence it's why I can't tell anyone. For example; infertility. I'm not saying that it's a bad standard to call someone an asshole, when they leave their infertile partner. Infertility ain't sterility. Plus, too many don't consider alternative options, or treatments (Ironically, I share the opinion here). However...I'm going to confess that this scenario on paper alone is enough to make me go into a frenzy. Mostly because I knew that this would be a breakup/divorce reason for me. But again; not for the ""normal"" reasons I just mentioned. It's not because of my partner. It'd be me. I would go nuts. Trapped between societal/moral expectation to stay & my obsession, it would only take so long. Maybe I could calm myself until options are clear. But it'd still be noticable.

It's such a weird situation. On one side, I logically agree with all the things that are progressive. A family does not have to come from Ma and Pa. Adoption is an option. Etc. But this is the point. The monster/obsession...it has a mind of its own. Every idea going against it, gives me a physical reaction. For example; when I had an endometriosis-scare. I was internally dead for weeks. It was incomparable to any form of depression you might picture. It was not the idea that I wanted to die...but that there was no reason for me to live. Just meandering out the unchangeable.

I can't tell anyone about this. ""Coin-toss"" is both the most hidden and biggest trauma thing I have. People think it be just a stubborn, asshole choice if I would. But in truth; I don't *have* a choice. I lost any form of control long ago. Like, you think I *LIKE* this??! You think I *LIKE* to already *know* that I would potentially hurt someone I truly love, someone for something they have no control over, because of something I have no control over and could barely start to explain? 

 Even worse; I don't fucking know how to treat it. To cut it, would also cut one of my few consistent life-lines and throw me into despair. It's both pushing and forcing me to go on.

Like a specific moment of walking under a tree in my grandparents backyard and feeling afraid that a bird is going to shit on my head. Weird stuff like that. I have little to no memories of childhood friends, just the “essence” of how it felt to be their friend, and maybe one or two tiny, brief moments. I don’t know if it’s due to therapy or getting older and living away from my parents that I’m remembering things. Up until now, since I was about 18, I’ve felt very disconnected from my life experiences. Almost as if I died when I turned 18 and was reborn into a new body and mind. Also, in the last six months have been dealing with an episode of DPDR and borderline psychotic paranoia triggered by a stressful conflict with my mom. 

One thing that is strange, however, is most of the memories flooding back to me are just movies or books I was into as a kid. I always got super absorbed into movies and books and basically used them to escape mentally. Not always due to trauma (I was just “fascinated” by things easily and was very sensitive.) It frustrates me that I’m not regaining memories of actual people, like former friends- just flashbacks memories of emotions felt while immersed in these stories. Kind of like the emotional flashback you get when reading an old book- remembering where you were when you first read it, what the book smelled like, what was playing on the radio, etc.

I finally got the willpower to stand up and go out the back of the school building. It was cold walking to our car.

 ....However, imo, the bootstraps mentality they espouse, albeit in fluffier language, can be harmful for people dealing with actual trauma (if that's where their treatment ends) - but *is* probably a functional approach  for the majority of their customer base:

 People who've had legitimate hard times and struggles (because they're human) and who haven't been taught good, self compassionate coping skills (because: capitalist hellscape culture).

I just wish these 'therapists' and 'healers' hadn't co-opted the word 'trauma' and made it synonymous with 'difficulty'. *Everyone experiences difficulties and deserves support for what they personally struggle with*. 

NOT everyone has experienced difficulty that profoundly affected their development, or shattered their sense of basic safety in the world. This isn't 'gatekeeping suffering', it's maintaining a meaningfully useful semi-clinical definition of trauma

But in the absence of good, nuanced therapy and psycho-education being freely available, there's essentially a gap in the market. And we all know who and what tends to fill those.

I’m suffering from c-ptsd symptoms resulting from treatment I was given for anorexia and other mental health issues during my youth. I’m 28 now; I utilised this mental health service from between the ages of 14 to 19. 

The mental health issues I was suffering during this period of time was due to childhood trauma. Because I went undiagnosed, my time at this service only made me sicker because they treated me on the assumption I had emerging BPD (but I didn’t know this until I retained my records years later).

TW for specific examples of mistreatment and mention of a suicide attempt.

I’ve been stripped and searched by nurses, fed on the floor, had food thrown at me, had my NG tubes pulled on by staff, and stitched up without anesthetic (because I did it to myself and therefore didn’t deserve it). I was also constantly ignored, told I was attention seeking/not sick enough (including not thin enough)/wasting resources/never going to recover/faking my distress. My therapist fell asleep during one of my sessions but I felt like it was my fault, so I kept talking until she woke up because I didn’t want her to feel bad.
On one occasion, my case worker watched me attempt suicide after I “absconded” from my appointment. She didn’t intervene, she just watched with her arms crossed, inconvenienced. It really haunts me because I honestly felt like she wished I had died so she didn’t have to care for me anymore.

This has all followed me and as a result, I can’t recover from my eating disorder. It’s too entrenched in the trauma and I’ve come to believe I’m not sick enough for care. I see a psychologist every week (and I have done for four years), but I’m so, so stuck. I’m currently in a relapse (ED) and I cycle between trauma work and ED work, depending, but I haven’t “moved on”. Nor have I been able to give trauma therapy a proper attempt due to my constant ED relapses. My brain wants to be “sick enough” and it somehow feels that if I can go back (into the same cycle I was in when I was young, or the weight where people took me the most seriously), I can resolve the pain.

I’ve had some realizations/experiences lately that point toward OSDD - but I don’t know. Maybe it’s just CPTSD since that can be a dissociative disorder in itself. I’m just so confused. I’ve heard voices lately, distinct from my own thought process, that sound like younger versions of me. I also was able to put words to this experience I’ve had as long as I can remember where I get this loud, deafening almost whisper/vibration sound in my head. I try to etch-a-sketch it by trying to sing a song but I can’t. It’s like another language I can’t decipher. It leaves me feeling sick. Whatever it is, I know I have heavy dissociation, derealization, and depersonalization issues. 

I got the loud whisper last week on Wednesday, and then Friday I heard a little (maybe) me voice. It felt disembodied but not like a stranger. She said “I’m so hungry” - which is funny considering one of my symptoms lately has been severe, extreme non-stop hunger no matter what I eat. My husband and I eat the same and he’s never hungry after. I thought maybe it was PMDD cravings or my thyroid, but it’s been nonstop and painful and overwhelming. I was like “yeah I get it I’m fucking starving” but I think it’s connected to the next thing. 

I’m starting to accept that I was probably sexually abused by my step-great-grandpa as a kid. I had a few other experiences as a child that would count as molestation but they were when I was older, and already had issues. This is something that seems like it should’ve been obvious based on the signs. Probably ages 3-5, possibly until 6 or 7. I have a really hard time saying it out-loud or even typing it. He is dead. So is my grandma. But I still feel so guilty essentially accusing someone of something I don’t have concrete evidence for. I don’t want to be wrong because it means I’m a bad person, I don’t want to be wrong because it means my childhood was even more so a lie. My therapist says it doesn’t really matter what happened, or the “facts”, because of the things I am and have been experiencing. 

But I know how my body reacts. I have many little bits of memory that scare me. I’ve had stuff come back in dreams too. I know it’s not normal to have your grandpa pop into your head during sex, or masturbation. After he died when I was 16, I went downhill very fast with my Anorexia and self-harm. I felt so much guilt, and I didn’t know why. I don’t have many memories before age 8. That’s when I moved to Florida temporarily, and therefore wasn’t around him anymore. I also know that’s the typical age most people start having memories, right? When I came back my grandma was sick, and my body had changed. I wasn’t little anymore, I had early puberty. 

When I was little, like up until age 7, I held my poop for very long periods of time. It stopped after Florida. I was really sick from it. My family tried everything. I thought it could’ve been from my Autism, but it could’ve been trauma too. I have a memory of my grandpa giving me an enema but I talked to my (other, still living) grandma, and she said she’s the only one who ever did it. So what is that memory? 

Why do I get flashes of their house? His room? Bathroom? When I close my eyes, and regress to a younger state. I can’t stand the smell of grape soda, his favorite. He always drank it in the middle of the night. I would get up with him. I hate the smell of anything that resembles his aftershave. It’s what his bed smelled like. I remember even as a kid it would make me sick and feel this gnawing pain in my guts. I remember when he gave anyone else attention I was jealous.

I was his “best friend.” According to everyone he loved me more than anything. He bought me everything I wanted, fed me everything I wanted, made me look pretty and got me photo shoots & took polaroids of me. When he died my dad asked if he did anything to me. He said he always thought he groomed me. I was so angry at him for saying that, and I denied it because I couldn’t believe that could be the case. Despite the fact that when I masturbated, I felt like he was watching me. Back then I didn’t know what grooming was. It wasn’t until after my rape when I was 22 that I started having weird blips of memory and sensory memories come back about my Grandpa, that I looked up grooming. I became angry then at my dad again. If he thought that, why did he wait until after he died to do something? Turns out my dad might have sexually abused my sister so maybe that’s my answer. 

I think whatever happened, I either dissociated from heavily, or happened before I could form proper memories. Or he framed it in a way that seemed normal and good, hence the grooming. I have a pattern of dissociating heavily in sexual situations. I’m currently in a healthy marriage with the most amazing human, but I feel like I am going to ruin it eventually because I can’t get better. He doesn’t feel that way. When I was with my ex, he was very abusive and sexually dominating of me. I let him to whatever he wanted and left my body. I don’t know how I learned this, I just didn’t know I could say no. Just like I don’t know how I learned to put things in my vagina, and I don’t know how I learned about sex and being sexy so young, before I even had internet access. 

The only other possibility is that I’m just experiencing the trauma my mom went through being sexually abused because she never dealt with it. I know that trauma can be passed down. But she wasn’t abused by this person, so that doesn’t fully make sense. Maybe it’s both. My dad was sexually abused too. I don’t know. 

I just needed to get this all out. Lately I feel like I’m losing touch with reality, I’m under a lot of stress, my PMDD/CPTSD are so severe and I’m in pain daily, trying to get disability for those things plus many more and my Autism, and I’m terrified I won’t get it and we won’t have anywhere to live. I can’t work and have no money. I have an immune deficiency also and can’t get Covid so I’m really isolated. I’m also terrified that I am just coming apart and can’t stop it.
 
I feel stupid and don’t even want to post this but also I do. That’s always the result ultimately - there are two distinct halves of me at war. One that doesn’t want to be right and doesn’t want to be wrong, one that thinks I should die and another that’s terrified to die, one that wants to post this and one that doesn’t. They are never in communication with one another and they make my life miserable. I make my life miserable.",1679096213.0

Symptoms of being emotionally neglected growing up and parents who were unable to emotionally differentiate from their kids and treated them as objects and extensions of themselves lead to the adult not being sure what they want in life, what they like/dislike, etc.

After moving from fight or flight survival mode to now thriving mode over the last few years, I've put a lot of time into figuring out who I am, and what I like. 

But it seems like most people, just know what they like. They've seen a bunch of movies and tv shows and can comment on them, while I have nothing to say about it. They know different foods and cultures and go visit aunts and uncles and have dinner with their neighbors and many culture, entertainment and social activities that I never was subject to. 

You say, ""oh just go and do those things now"" but it's different because I still had to navigate healing and maybe I don't fully enjoy all those cultural and entertainment stuff because I've moved on with life, saw what the past was, and am still healing. 

It makes me hesitant to share my true self, because honestly I never got those experiences like other people, my parents avoided other people and said negative things about them. We didn't have extended family nearby and we never had family bonding or talking to neighbors or all the social life many people take for granted. I feel like most everyone I talk to are very different from me in that aspect. They always have extended family nearby, like ""oh I'm visiting my grandma who lives nearby"" and unlike me *who when I went no-contact with my parents, there was no grandma/grandpa, aunt/uncle or cousins who I could go to.* That was it for me. They have their childhood friends, or that group from college. I was always trying to fit in and even through therapy and all that effort, now I am slowly starting to find out what I like and to eventually feel the same as others.",1679067209.0

Waiting with my moms sick dog who's had on-going ear and paw infections and mast cell cancer that leaves her itchy all over, on benadryl daily and risks for anaphylaxis and other issues. 

We've been dealing with this sometimes multiple vet trips every month because the infections weren't staying away when she was at my moms because my mom drinks and leaves the house a literal shit hole and won't even feed the dog some days. Its been over a year now.

I've gone into debt just getting a hotel for a few weeks bc my landlord flipped when she was in my room less than 20 minutes at 11 PM to get her asap to a vet the next morning when I first saw how bad her infections were a year ago.

She's had weeks of being better here and there but now I'm at my dads, he's post-stroke, cancer, covid and now with beginning dementia and always an abusive and misogynistic asshole before that, but between my own autoimmune issues and trying to not fail out of my last few classes of college again from family stress, housing instability, and my medical, its a nightmare. He won't let me keep her here without my mom there and he was sexually harassing her (divorced 10 yrs and he cheated and was abusive) and making her cook and clean while he just sat on his ass, sundowned  and flipped out about his checkbook he couldn't remember doing.

My mom finally came back after another relapse but she refuses to even shower or do anything, even though she's on probation for assaulting me last year and not following up.

And I'm just tired of it. My mom will probably pay for this vet visit but im here holding the bag as shes getting worse and we're months from getting to the right specialist and that dog is pretty much my last reason to not just drop her leash and walk into traffic right now.

I'm lucky if I get my minimum needed grades to pass this semester and my professors don't care about circumstances even with proof. Like I didn't ask for my dad to get covid and then vascular dementia while I was moving and still using a 529 thats tied with my childhood SSI in his name and needing housing and he suddenly thinks I'm the enemy. 

Now I'm at risk for homelessness again and the school is giving me shit about my ADA accommodations as I try for on campus single housing for my literal autoimmune conditions and other issues that had me dropping out in the first place and my SAS is in limbo.

I'm tired. I'm just so tired of being sick, and not being able to go out or even eat most food anymore and always asking whats in meals and not being able to eat it, and all my doctors and the visits and the meds and risks and the bad news and the less and less ability to get out of this cycle and live.

I dont have friends, my last old friend I tried to reconnect with has antisocial personality disorder and literally bragged about putting in her opinion to cause drama and thank God for emdr work bc I finally listened to the warning signs and shut down and didn't engage to just get away but fuck there has been so few good people that were around for more than a moment and I want to live and do something with my life and not be so disabled but I can't even get scholarships to help pay for my necessary medical and it feels like a sick joke that I can't get free at this point.

I see othe people like me online, people I wish I could reach out to, but then my mind screams they're like my family or my shitty old friends or worse and I just shut down and don't reach out even online.

I have value damn it. Regardless of the medical or the abuse or the fact that my life trajectory is not what I planned when my dad kicked me out at 17 for not liking my new friends all of 2 months to my alcoholic violent mom and it fucked everything up that I didn't bow down for once bc my brother never did but he did so much wrong to me and the family and my dad just gives him 15k for Christmas right in front of me.

Why. Why can't I find safety to just finish pushing out of here? Why am I paying for their shitty mistakes and their shitty lifestyle choices and why can't I at least just be healthy enough to know this won't be my only place in life and I'll actually have something good.

Why does it just keep getting worse and why aren't I good enough to get help when I ask and get out? 

I hate it here. I just want the dog and I healthy and somewhere safe without strings at every moment and abuse at every corner and memories that won't stop and a world that would let me and so many others just die in the street. I'm not lazy, im in pain and I don't know if I can get out.",1679073892.0

People like that should not be allowed in any mental health support subreddit. It's frustrating that random abusive people can walk in and hurt vulnerable and unwell people any time.

I'm feeling pretty bad today to begin with. Feeling anger because I am frequently targeted by bullies when I go outside. I feel unsafe when I leave the house. Two different strangers have threatened to hurt me unprovoked. I just try to find quiet places to go for a walk.

I have autism and believe a lot of bad things have happened because people can see my neurodiversity, I don't know how to mask. I've experienced poor treatment from neighbours. The neighbour's daughter stands outside my window and calls me crazy. The senior male neighbour beside me does the same thing and complains about everything I do, like the size of my garbage bag if I go outside to take trash to the dumpster, how miserable I look because I have a blank expression, that I don't greet him (Why the fck would I say hi to someone so terrible?) or how I should be ashamed that I need a ride from my parents due to my autism making driving impossible for me. I have been called slurs by medical workers at the hospital for my refusal to make eye contact and difficulty speaking. I have been asked insane questions like ""Did you rob a bank"" due to my inability to make eye contact and visible anxiety while speaking to them. I've experienced poor treatment from trades workers who came to install appliances at my condo despite the fact I was courteous to them. They did not install the appliances correctly, the washer and dryer only go on hot setting, not cold, also leak while washing. I can't help thinking they did this out of spite since they also said cruel remarks about me while I sat by quietly like how weird it was that I didn't speak, as well as complaints about my facial features. I do not have the money to call and get the appliances re-installed properly.

I keep hearing about how it feels like this magical and mind blowing treatment to people that changed their life so much, but it didn't work at all for me, it had zero effect and was honestly just an hour of therapy wasted.  I don't remember the majority of my trauma or my youth in general and am apparently repressing a lot and we do have the suspicion, that I may have a dissociative disorder, so maybe that could play into it, but I don't know. Do I just need to be patient and try it a couple of times?  
I found a center for therapy resistant depression, that offers treatments like tDCS and rTMS, but I have to wait a month until I can even apply and who knows how long it'll take to actually get an appointment. These treatments do give me hope though, because I have been in different kinds of therapy for ten years and on different kinds of medication for seven years and nothing has ever helped, even with everything I try outside of therapy.   


I have honestly given up hope on ever getting better and being able to just live, but tDCS does give me a last little spark of hope, so I was wondering if anybody had experience with it or maybe was in a similar situation as I am in now.

My parents killed a housecat I used to have just for fun and to make me suffer they knew how much I cared about her and they killed her just because. I self harmed all through out middle school and high school because I found it easier to deal with the physical pain than the emotional pain and my parents just mocked me for it I didn't know what self harm was I just did it because it made the pain go away even for a little bit and I got bullied relentlessly and nobody did anything even when I got pushed off a snow bank and had my leg broken in front of the the entire grade school I went to nobody even stopped to see if I was alright when I physically dragged myself across the asphalt to get into the school and climbed up the stairs one good leg not one single person. And when I stayed at a camping resort where there was a guy who everyone knew was a horrible person and knew to stay far away from the owners didn't do jack shit even when he chased me up the hill to the building the owners stayed at and when I told them everything about how he threatened to stab me and my friends to death with steak knives and leave our bodies in the forest where no one will find them and how I ran full sprint up the hill while the guy and his buddies were chasing me the owners just told me to fuck off like how can you just do that a child comes to sweating scared out of their mind and is begging for help you just told them to fuck off.  And now I'm finding out a ton of stuff that is making a lot of things make sense but aslo feels like a punch to the gut like my parents just said that I'm a physical mess with my body being the way it is but I found out after over hearing my mother on the phone that I was preterm and also about 10 years ago my mother quit smoking which I don't get she knowingly had a child and only decided to try quitting after I was born did she not think that maybe try stopping before you decide to have the kid that will be messed up when you're smoking while you're pregnant with said kid, I don't get the thought process and this was back in the early 2000's where I'm pretty sure everyone knew smoking while pregnant bad.

I'm Kris, I went through domestic and emotional abuse from my father and now my mother has absolutely lost it. My dad was violent and never harmed me physically, but would drag and hit my mom and older sister. Eventually one day when my dad was going ballistic, my mom called my grandma and my grandma heard everything, and my grandma called the cops. Cops called cps. Mom got restraining order but didn't stop dad from sending us gifts and letters and coming into our house when we were gone to give us stuff. My mom says my dad is on one year probation right now. I still have nightmares and thoughts about the things I went through. There's so much more it would be too much to talk about. Just a couple months ago, after my mom left my dad (not divorced yet but technically not together anymore), she got a boyfriend. She has BPD and has always been gaslighting and narcissistic. She constantly, every time, goes for the same abusive piece of crap guys. And never learns. She's had maybe 4 or 5 boyfriends. I'll call her current boyfriend Dick. Because of the constant harassment from my dad, I couldn't handle it and I get scared very easily and I could never look my dad in the eye and I would flinch at the sound of his voice. So my mom suggested I stay at Dicks house so my dad has no idea where I am and I don't have to worry about him trying to talk to me. I accepted, even tho I didn't really want too, cuz I already saw red flags in Dick and didn't really like him. Stayed at his house for about 2 months, more red flags came in, and I was scared shitless. My mom said he would move in with us when we bought a new house. I didn't know he and her were dating until I was at his house, because I thought they were just coworkers and he said he went through domestic abuse and wanted to help. They've only known each other for 4 months. One day, with my sisters over, (one is a teenager the other is a toddler), we heard them having naughty time in the room RIGHT NEXT TO US. My sister was absolutely horrified and I was angry, REALLY angry, but also very upset and wanted to cry, I banged on the wall and then texted my mom and Dick complaining about what they were doing and pointing out how bad and horrid manners it was, couple hours later, my mom comes in the room and screams at me. For 2 hours straight. It was exhausting. I was thinking of just running away or ending it all. I could not stand it. She told me things like ""you're liberal you shouldn't have a problem with it"" and that apparently gen z doesn't care about people having sex? Like, what? What in the world does that have to do with me not wanting to hear people have sex? Can't vent to my siblings because one is too young to understand and my other sister is a mini versions of my mom. As soon as my mom left the room I called.my grandpa to pick me up asap. He came and I've lived here ever since. The thing is, I'm still a minor. My mom could force me back any time. I made a document of screenshots of what her and her boyfriend said to me (her boyfriend threatened me over text and when my grandpa brought it up to her she waved it off), just in case something happens. I do not have the mental state to deal with going back there, to deal with abuse, the people that abused me, and the constant harassment from my father that still goes on to this day. Apparently my mom gave him my grandpa's address. Thanks a lot mom. My dad keeps sending me letters with these empty hearted ""I'm sorry""s and I have not responded.to a single one. I don't want to. I don't have to. He can burn in hell. But one of the letters concerned me, he wrote that my mother and sisters missed me and wanted me back. I don't want to believe what this really implies because it scares the living shit out of me. My mother said she was completely done with my dad but apparently my sisters are still seeing him. My mother and sisters may miss me but they also ignore the obvious red flags in Dick and I've talked about how much this shit has effected me and every, single, freaking, time, they ignored me. They want me back and that scares me. I'm a minor. My mom has full custody over me and my grandpa has nothing. She can force me back any time and there is absolutely no reasoning with her. She's out of her mind. She's crazy and toxic. And she's turned my sister into her. It makes me want to cry and throw up thinking about it. I don't know what the hell to do.",1679098673.0

The past 3 months have been absolutely horrible. I have never been so dysfunctional. I've always been high functioning, even at my work, but now I can barely shower and the only times I actually get in the shower is to try and calm down not actually to bathe. I don't have the energy to eat or drink water, I was in the psych ward recently and lost 13 lbs in a few days and they practically force fed me.

I can't sleep. I overdosed on my medications to try and calm down and I think i fucked something up because ever since then, the second I doze off I jerk like I'm being electrocuted. Normal every now and then, but this is every time I start sleeping. I literally can't sleep. If I manage to sleep, I have horrific nightmares. last night I would keep waking up and then going back into the nightmare but it would repeat and be worse. My chest kept being caved in and I could feel the pain from it then I'd restart again. In the worst of them it was time for my chest to be caved in again and I just started screaming ""(NAME) YOU NEED TO WAKE UP. WAKE UP RIGHT NOW (NAME). WAKE UP!""

I always know when I'm dreaming but it's always horrific and I can't help anything.

My therapist is done with me because I am too high needs. But offered no alternatives. I'm still working with my dietitian and she's encouraging me to use this opportunity to go into residential treatment.

I've been struggling with my temper, like I'm in a constant state of pissed off and my pissed off is literally trauma defcon 1 (as my dietitian puts it). Like I will literally set myself on fire to hurt someone. I don't care, in my head it's kill or be killed even if it's minor. I think I am stuck in the time I was nearly murdered and tried to kill someone first. It's always on my mind these days.

I feel like even a residential couldn't handle me. I have too many problems that no one can help with. No one is experienced enough to help the breadth of my trauma.

639,husband triggered me and i can't calm down,8,11tvuvh,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11tvuvh/husband_triggered_me_and_i_cant_calm_down/,47,"He snapped on Wednesday night. We were laying in bed and I asked him to close the bedroom door, and he acted like I was being annoying, rolled his eyes and huffed, but he got up and tried. But, the door didn't want to latch. We live in an old house and sometimes the hinges don't hold right or moisture makes the door threshold not fit right, etc. And this set him off. 

He started yelling, and swearing. He slammed the door over and over really hard. and when he still couldn't get it, he started throwing stuff around the room and at the door, yelling at me, because he was angry. I was still laying in bed and just shut down. I think I disassociated, I don't remember. I kinda of held my breath and moved over as far away from him on the bed when he crawled back in, still really mad and muttering to himself. I waited until he was fully settled back in and I got up and went into the bathroom, locked the door, and had a panic attack. I couldn't stop crying and I was trying to be really quiet, and I listened to him laughing at something on Youtube on his phone, like nothing had happened, from the bedroom. And I didn't go back to bed until he fell asleep. I didn't feel safe next to him. I couldn't shake the feeling that he could've really hurt me, if he wanted to. I felt like I was going to get hit. 

I grew up in a super abusive home, where I'd get beaten for the smallest things. And it was the exact same fear. He knows I have cptsd / ptsd. And he has anger issues, which he keeps promising he'll work on and for a while it'll seem like it's working, and he's getting better. He's in therapy, he's learning calming techniques, but every so often, like once a week, he'll blow up. Over something really tiny. I don't feel safe. I don't think he'd hit me, he never has, but I can't shake the thought that he \*could\*. If he got mad enough, he \*could\*. And I'm a lot smaller than him. I'm disabled. I wouldn't be able to defend myself. I feel helpless, like I was when I was a little kid and my parents or siblings were coming after me. 

Since his most recent blow-up, I haven't let him touch me. Anytime he so much as sets a hand on my arm to get my attention, I flinch him off, without even meaning to. The other night, he rolled over in his sleep and laid his arm over me. Normally, I love that and cuddle into him, but then it just made me feel sick and panicky, like I was being trapped, kinda claustrophobic, and I moved his arm off of me as slowly and gently as I could, because I was terrified of waking him up. He's apologized a couple times. And, like I said, this isn't his first blow-up, far from it. And I don't know why this one is affecting me worse than the others ones ever have. It's been almost 2 full days and I still feel shaky anytime he comes into the room. I'm making excuses not to let him touch me --- aka, saying my fibro is flaring and making touch painful, which isn't a lie, I'm just using it more often, now. I've been walking on eggshells, trying not to make him upset. I haven't asked him for anything, haven't asked for help with anything, have barely talked to him out of fear I'll say something wrong and make him upset. It feels awful. I really do feel the exact same way I did growing up, where I just shut myself down, kept quiet, kept my head down, and just made every choice on the basis on whether or not it would make someone upset. Going to illogical extremes, even, like eg. not asking him to grab the laundry out of the dryer even though I hurt, because what if I did it wrong, what if I forgot to start the dryer and he gets pissed? What if the dryer didn't dry everything fully and it's somehow my fault and I get hurt? What if I washed something he didn't want washed, yet, and he gets mad? All these fears, the same level I'd have to worry about as a kid, fears that make no logical sense, but they're all the kind of inane, ridiculous shit I'd had to tread carefully around, because even doing something like washing the dishes wrong--- aka, not rinsing them the way dad thought I should --- would (srs physical abuse warning) get me boiling water poured over my hands. 

I can't stop feeling triggered. I've been on high alert for days, now. Barely slept. Barely eaten. I feel sick to my stomach any time I see him, and can't look at his face. I'm terrified and none of my coping skills are working. Not really asking for advice, because I know most of it would be ""leave"", which is actually impossible for me, right now. I just need to vent and get this off my chest because, maybe putting it in words will help, I don't know.",1679070229.0

I've gone through some small ups and downs -- some problems at work, some successes, a dismissive psychiatrist, a bad therapist, some good therapy books, lots of social difficulties, a couple new people I'm proud to call friends, some new hobbies ... small steps and I've been hopeful for a while that I'm making progress.

But now, nothing big has happened in the last several months but I just feel exhausted. I'm not sure why or what, I'm confused more, it's nearly impossible to get myself to sit down and do work. Hobbies are ok to do, but it's affecting my job quite a bit now. I can rest for long times (days) and it doesn't help me have energy. Physically I'm fine but mentally I'm running low. It's not depression, I'm not crying, I don't feel overly stressed, and so I just don't know what to do to help myself.

I'm hoping for some insight from people why I feel this way? Is this normal to just hit a period where nothing feels quite right? I still don't have a whole ton of hope for my future, I can't really envision myself being happy but for the first time I can envision myself still going 5 years from now, but maybe only with a mediocre life that I don't enjoy. Part of it is that I feel like I'm too old (30F) to really accomplish anything with my life anymore, and a lot of options for making friends or joining groups or learning skills are just gone, though I do have some options. I have had an impossible time trying to find a romantic partner, and that's probably the worst. I feel like I'm trying to catch up and I just can't. I'm not sure if there are other things contributing to this feeling, but it's really heavy.

I want someone to tell me they're proud of me and happy to see me, but I don't have anyone I'm close to and I feel like people avoid me. I feel like if I tried to explain to my parents or my ancestors what I've gone through and how and why I've been trying to heal, none of them would understand and they'd call it a waste of time. ""Everyone has problems. Just do what you're supposed to do. You're making it too hard.""

My name's Luke. I'm 25. I come from a moderately-sized town in the Tarheel state. Prior to June of last year my life was one of comfort. I had a good steady family and a great home, there was food on the table. All of that changed for me in June. My mom had went outside to relax on the couch that was outside on the front porch of our home and had fell asleep (she had been drinking slightly, so that contributed to her tiredness I can imagine and she didn't get much sleep due to having PTSD herself from a physical abusive).  


Someone who was riding by on a bicycle saw this and figured my mom would be easy to rob. I don't like to think about what happened (if they were assaulting my mom or something like this, I don't really want to think about it) and she woke up, she saw this person trying to rob her and she called me outside, telling me to grab something. I grabbed my hunting rifle, confused on what was going on. I ran as quickly as possible to the door. 

I opened it and I saw someone, they were on a bicycle. I ran to the side off the porch and before I knew it, there was pops. The pops of gunfire. I kept seeing muzzleflash after muzzleflash. The light illuminating the dark summer night. I remember that he was shooting at me too, the bullets were hitting so close to my feet I remember the dirt kicking up (if that makes sense). I remember the sound of being shot at. It was all so quick and before I knew it, a entire magazine was emptied. I didn't even have a chance to shoot, do anything myself. I was scared, I didn't want to truly harm anyone but this person did anyway.

I looked over to my mom who was on the ground.

I saw her laying on the ground and I shouted if she was ok. She was not. I'm not going to go over what happened in this part. It's still really too much for me and it's just awful. No son should ever have to see this, be through this situation. 

Since then, I've had difficulty maintaining relationships (dating) and I feel like most people hate me for not doing enough that night. I am distrustful of most people. I feel like most people are out to hurt me in some way. I'm trying to get counselling and help for this but it's been difficult.

Hi! I'm new to the board here basically trying to get some general info about what I'm dealing with.

I'm trying to learn more about CPTSD and can't find as much info about it as I wish I could(usually the search engine defaults to PTSD). I was told by a doctor that I have the symptoms of CPTSD. However the more I learn about it, the more questions I have? It's clear to me its the correct diagnosis but I don't seem to have the ""fight"" triggers in the way I keep reading about. My ""fight"" responses tend to put my anger inward towards myself, though I wonder if that would be more easily explained by ""flight"" or ""shame"" responses. My friends don't seem to think I lash out at others, or get angry at others in any way they felt was odd. But they do see the intense feelings of self loathing I have for myself that seems to come out when things get difficult for me.

 So is this something that happens to others? Can you get ""fight"" triggers that go ""inward"" instead of lashing out? Or is this explained by something else going on with CPTSD like ""flight"" or ""shame"" responses?",1679099887.0

A few things stood out: the amount of artwork that showed explicit signs of me struggling with the trauma of COCSA & CSA, and the schoolwork.

At 17, I had wrote a six page essay where, instead of focusing entirely on the topic, I was screaming for help, and that I was being abused from all directions. My heart broke as I read what my younger self was hoping someone would hear. What did my teacher write at the end?

""Aww, how sad. Great work! 12/12""

I'm literally so f$%king pissed off because this isn't the only assignment I found of this nature. Time and time again, I was failed by the same teachers who held the very same assemblies about child abuse and what signs to look out for.

Dealing with CPTSD while upholding my current job has gotten to be overwhelming, to the point I'm considering applying for SSDI so I can truly focus on long term healing and then slowly implementing stressors back into my life. 

Does anyone have a lawyer they would recommend in the tri-state area they've worked with before? Or, do you have any advice on how to go about this? I would love to talk to a lawyer about my personal situation and see how best to go about this. 

If it helps, some of the abusers I've had have actually gone to jail (and been on the news) for other victims, so I do have documentation outside of my personal experience. 

Also, to clarify, are we able to work after approval for CPTSD SSDI? Does SSDI limit how much you can make as well? Eventually/in an ideal world I would like to implement some work as I continue to work on my long term mental and physical health.

Hi everyone, my family is very dysfunctional. My siblings are way older than me, and apparently, it was hard for them growing up, to be honest in their minds, and mine as well. My childhood was a happy one, but as I grew, I noticed I was different from my friends, and it wasn't a happy one, it was a very lonely one.

I don't have many childhood memories, so I assumed I had some deep trauma that made me forget as you see in movies. But through therapy, I discovered I had no specific trauma; nothing happened to me. However, it did happen to my mum and siblings. So what happened is that they transmitted that constant fear to me. That explains why I only have happy memories, but very few though (I can count my childhood memories with my hands until I was around 12 - 13 years old, and ironically I have a very good memory). The explanation is that I was in constant fear, and adult fear but being a child, I only understood the surface of the problems and pretended my family was doing a good job of hiding everything from me, playing my part. When you are in fear, you don't register memories. This also led to massive ADD, and according to my massage therapist, chiropractor, psychologist, and psychiatrist, it also led to a perpetual fight-or-flight response state (and other stuff), which explains why I am an athlete but also stiff as a table no matter what I try.

So my question is, what type of meditation can help me release the fight-or-flight response state? Please do not recommend yoga. My wife is a yoga teacher, and I practice every sport you can imagine. Ironically, the only thing that has helped my back is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, which my psychologist recommended for self-confidence and to remove some of the fears in me, and it worked (a little). So I do believe my stiffness is mental.

I would appreciate it if you could share some links or podcasts, preferably not on YouTube.

I've repressed a bunch of memories and feelings that were present throughout a huge number of years growing up (from 3 or 4 up to when I moved out of my parent's place). Those have come flooding back recently. I'm in my 30s now.

I'm still reeling, and trying to make sense of it all. I feel like CPTSD resonates with my experience, but I also feel like my situation is unique/different. There was no physical abuse, and my parents did definitely love me & my brother, and let us know that throughout our lives. But it was NOT the happy childhood I have been telling myself it was for many years. Parts of it were happy and good, but I've not given due credit to how bad the parts that hurt were.

I have already reached out for therapy for this.

I am pretty unsure if I actually have CPTSD, or something else... I haven't really looked into whether something else might fit better than CPTSD, or where to begin even looking. I know I need to talk to a therapist to get an answer, but I'm just trying to find some grounding with wrapping my head around this.

>Growing up...

My mom has always had love for me, an intense desire to be a good mother, major stress and anxiety, and immense self-doubt with a randomly-occurring persecution complex. She never stopped trying to be a ""good mother"". She would constantly try to praise me, validate that she loved me, validate that I was supported, but I found that very stressful to deal with - it always felt (and still feels) like she only loves a fake version of me she made up herself. Her anxiety and stress would flare up bad if she felt like she was being a bad mother, or if she felt like her kids (mostly me) didn't actively exhibit/express love back.

I remember crying in my room because she kept saying things like ""you're such a good boy"", ""you're such a smart boy"", ""you're such a nice boy"", ""you're such a handsome boy"" instead of actually getting to know who I really was. It took 10 years of telling her, multiple times a week, that I didn't like mayonnaise or salad dressing for her to even begin remembering. Or what my hobbies were (other than the few she 'decided' to attribute to me, even years after I dropped them). Or lots of other *real* likes and dislikes that I wanted her to see in me other than the facades she assigned to me through praise and assumption. I still recoil when praised by anyone.

She suffers from some serious mental health issue herself, but has never ""liked"" a therapist enough to last more than a few visits, as far as I am aware. I only know they told her some things she didn't like hearing, but there ARE bad therapists out there, especially back when my mom would have been looking. And she has suffered from legitimately bad interactions with doctors/health-professionals before.

Anytime I tried to tell her that I loved her, and I knew she loved me, and all the expressed validation just felt forced, and family love shouldn't feel forced - that she didn't have to *try* so hard to verify it, that it was OK... it was like I was talking to someone in a different language. At most she might say something like ""aw, you're so sweet"", then not acknowledge it in any way again. I remember at some point, I don't know when, realizing things wouldn't change with her and giving up trying.

My dad, meanwhile, also loved me (and my brother) a lot. He was and is extremely reserved and silent. We are and have always been on friendly terms, and I have never felt like I know him, other than that he does love us. It feels like a lot of his energy goes to managing my mom's moods, and he basically just 'checks out' other than that so he has space to pursue a small number of his own interests (reading, computers, a bit of sports).

Growing up, between the ages of around 4 to 7, my parents relationship was not good. They got close to a divorce, and I'm almost certain they stayed together because of me and my brother. They both loved us a lot, thought of themselves as nice and self-sacrificing, and I think they would have tried very hard to make things work - harder than they should have tried, I think. I remember exactly once (I would have been around 5 I think) walking in while they were fighting and saying ""please stop fighting"", or maybe ""why do you fight so much?"", but nothing changed and I never tried again. Things got a bit better after I was ~8, but far from perfect - their relationship never really felt like a loving one from then on.

My mom's anxiety would come and go. When it was bad, I had to be *constantly* on edge. I remember feeling the hairs on the back of my neck stand up when she would walk through the room if I was relaxing in it - I had to be always ready to make an escape to my bedroom to hide out, or to respond abruptly with doing a chore if she was angry about not enough getting done around the house (she had to carry the burden of cleaning almost 100% on her own - my dad did not help). She would yell at my dad over often extremely trivial stuff, or cry over very slight wrongs (or things that weren't wrong at all, like perceived persecution that didn't exist).

My dad never seemed able or willing to really help - at most he would put in a token effort only briefly after a fight. I remember my mom yelling at my dad, at least several times, about how he was poisoning their kids against her because he never helped with discipline, and she had to ""be the bad guy"" because of it. For example, grounding me if I played too much videogames - reasonable stuff, she never physically abused me. She only spanked my brother once (unjustly) and has regretted that her whole life. But it wasn't being disciplined that bothered me, it was the anxiety and stress that come from my mom that hurt. I resented my dad for not being willing to help alleviate that, and it made it feel like managing my mom's moods was all up to me.

>Anyway...

At a young age I learned I had to put on a very specific face for my mom, to manage myself around her stress/anxious persona, and to very very carefully manage her sad/depressed persona when it came to the surface. I remember hiding in my room playing videogames or reading to escape, only leaving my room to ""make an appearance"" around the house the bare minimum that would not lead my mom to fear I was avoiding her. Which involved being out of my room a lot more than I wanted - about as much as I could possibly stand. I remember psyching myself up to have the emotional energy to do that, and to put on a face that everything was perfect and I was a wonderful loving son and she was a wonderful loving mother.

I remember planning out when I went outside my room, with thoughts like ""I really wish I could just stay in my bedroom, but my mom's voice sounds relatively not-very-stressed right now, so maybe if I go outside my room for a couple hours then if things get bad later I can hide out then and excuse it as 'doing homework' or something. If I stay in now maybe I can stay in all evening, but if she gets angry later she will *expect* me to make an appearance to validate she isn't alone in the family, and it will be much harder to deal with then."" In retrospect I wonder if this is why I learned to always do my homework at the last minute - I wanted it to be a truthful excuse I could use to escape to my room if I needed it. If I finished my homework early, I wouldn't have that escape, and homework was one of the things she would relent to me hiding away for. Sometimes plans like that worked. Sometimes I would go out when she was in a 'good mood' to save up an excuse to hide away later, then she would have a downward spiral and would *still* expect me to not hide in my room... and I would just feel utterly defeated and in despair at how much of my life I had to sacrifice for her needs.

I had to be extremely attentive to her words, her tone, her body language, how her footsteps sounded (angry or not), and how things things changed moment to moment so I could figure out what ""mask"" I should put forward that would not aggravate her stress (or anger or sadness). I remember doing something similar to try to alleviate stresses between her and my dad. I remember finding it all deeply exhausting. I remember her (a few times) saying ""sometimes I feel like you don't like me"", then me feeling like 'oh god I've been letting my mask slip' and trying *extra* hard from then on out to put on a face that would convince her I did, making up excuses for why I was tired, or distracted, or whatever came to mind that I thought would work as a lie. I did love her, and still do - but I definitely did not like her, at least most of the time.

My mom has said multiple times that she would be very hurt if she is lied to, if her kids did not feel comfortable being honest with her. But by that time, I had been lying for years, and I knew I could never let her know how I felt or how much her actions pained me. My impression has always been that if she knew how I felt, it would utterly destroy her, so I carefully manage things when I do visit even now. Throughout my life my mom has sometimes used me as a sort of 'therapist' to unload her worries/stress on and get affirming ""it will be ok"" or ""I get how that could be hard"" or ""your pain makes sense, that was mean of them"" responses back. She's tried to limit how much that happens, but it did every once in a while. Still does.

There were times when things were good - when my mom actually seemed to enjoy life and relax. There were times we would laugh, or play games, or go out into nature which was a godsend. But they were unpredictable, became more rare as I got older, and I learned that they could go downhill very suddenly, so I stopped feeling relaxed even at those times. Plus I still had to maintain my mask even when things were good, to remain consistent with who I pretended to be when she *was* stressed. Most of the rest of the time my mom was doing her own thing, luckily, and I found a measure of peace in that regular distance.

>Since then...

My whole life I've been able to have low-key friends. Not many, but some I would consider very close. Not that we talk about emotions ever. Any time I'm faced with someone that I want a deeper connection with (especially romantically), I've *always* fallen into this mental mode where I try to express that love by just doing whatever the other person wants. By being willing to do *anything* - go to the restaurant the other person wants, do the activities the other person wants, do what the other person would find comfortable, find enjoyment in what the other person enjoys, move at a relationship pace the other person is comfortable with. I don't feel like I have any opinions of myself with those things, and I want the other person to be comfortable with me without wearing a mask. It feels like my heart is crying out ""please see how much I like you and want you to be happy, and let that be enough for once"". If I try to put on a mask so I can ""have opinions"" about where to go or what to do, it feels fake and manipulative, and my mind feels revulsion at that. Not surprisingly, that hasn't led to very good or deep connections.

I've only these past few days that I have connected the behavior when I want deeper connections to my response to my mom's behavior growing up. I had very much repressed how bad things were and how much it hurt as a kid. I remember crying in my room, thinking thoughts like ""you're killing who I am mom, my childhood is being ruined - I'm losing my grasp on just being myself - all I can be with you is the fake and superficial loving son you want me to be"".

Anyway I don't know who the hell I am anymore. When I was younger I had some vague thoughts like ""I'm going to flourish when I get on my own, I can finally live my life"", but, well, that has absolutely not happened. I almost feel like I treat my own sadness and loneliness inside with the same sort of masking I used to cope with my mom's negativity. Like my subconscious is going through life just barely putting in the bare minimum of effort needed to convince my conscious brain that everything is OK... and it's exhausting, so anything more than that is impossible, and I just float through life barely existing.

Is this classic CPTSD? Or distinctly different? Hard to tell? Does it sound like there may be other factors involved (ADHD, autism, etc)?

Her advice was as follows : **making a list of 50 positive traits about oneself, then keeping a small promise to yourself every day.** 

I'm posting this here because the first part doesn't seem too tricky to me, however the second one, as someone with a lot of issues around memory, including obviously CPTSD but also ADHD, sounds incredibly difficult - I can't remember if I ate this morning, I won't remember a ""promise"" to keep to myself. Do you think this is sound advice ? Do you think it could apply to us ?

Also, if you happen to have any other content recommendation that breaks down the healing process in such small and easily achievable steps, please do so. A lot of the advice I see is still fairly broad and vague, like ""have self-compassion"" - but doesn't actually say how to do so and I'm left thinking I'm just not good enough to understand.

I'm  at my wits end with this, so need an opinion. English isn't my first  language, hopefully that won't create any confusion. Throwaway because  family knows my main.

I (F39) am  married to my husband (M42) and we have twins (M6, F6), also a house  with a big mortgage. We've been together for 8 years.

I'm  writing this because yesterday he yelled at me that ""it's enough that  we have one mental case in the house, we don't need two"" and then yelled  at the kids that ""mum is making me insane"", right hand balled into a fist as he was clearly thinking of hitting me, and once the kids were  out of sight he grabbed a couple of plates and said he wants to throw  them out of kitchen window. Didn't do it though.

All  of this is very unusual; he normally never yells, let alone behaves in a  threatening way. Now he's gone, said he wants to stay away from me and  the kids and needs to think what to do because he says I'm turning him  into a person he doesn't want to be.

The  same mechanism has been repeated many times over and I'll try to  describe it. I have CPTSD from severe emotional abuse as a child and  teenager by my parents (diagnosed), and I also have ADHD (diagnosed) and  am on the spectrum (undiagnosed). Due to this, I've suffered multiple  burnouts in my life and since the kids I've been permanently exhausted.  My husband knows all this and is somewhat sympathetic, though he also  sees all of our problems originating from my issues.

Yesterday  the argument started because I was so exhausted I started crying while  trying to remember what I needed to do (I was meant to take the kids to  their football practice, I couldn't find their gear, and in the middle I  realised I had lost my wallet because I lose things when I'm stressed  out). So as I'm fervently trying to find the stuff while getting the  kids dressed and trying to think what to do with my lost wallet while  crying, he starts telling me I need to calm down and questioning me in a  manner that I find aggressive and am scared of, and I feel he doesn't  care I'm on the verge of a breakdown, and also we were on the clock and  having to answer his questions was slowing me down.

But  he says this what feels to me as aggressive questioning when I'm  already running out of time comes from a good place and it's his attempt  at helping me/trying to understand things. For example he can demand me  to explain a particular sentence/words I used if my expression was  inaccurate/illogical to him which gets me stuck in long conversations  about my word choices, slowing me down from resolving the issue at hand,  or asks ""why haven't you"" type of questions of things already happened  which I feel does nothing to help the issue at hand either.

This  is a trauma trigger for me, my parents did the same in the sense that  whenever I had a problem or was crying, that made them anxious so they  got really aggressive/abusive and therefore whenever I had a problem  they created another problem on top of it - having to deal with them.

My  husband knows this but he feels I don't trust him enough/know him well  enough because I get scared and triggered when he does this questioning,  even though I know logically that it's coming from a good place. It's  true that sometimes where he's getting at is very helpful and makes  sense, but the delivery is so cold and aggressive (to me) that I don't  even register the content. (I would not call it abusive though in any  way.)

I've told him I'd just want a hug and/or some sympathy in these situations but it never happens.

Because  this pattern constantly repeats, my husband is slowly losing patience  in me and faith in our relationship. He's very sensitive to blame and  reacts with anger to it, and when I'm triggered I ask him to stop  harassing me while I'm just trying to survive and this drives him  absolutely furious because he feels he's genuinely trying to help and  I'm being unfair.

Now he's shaken  by the violent urge that struck him, and thus left, leaving me obviously  to deal with the kids and the household and work alone. But I am  relieved because I really need to think as well.

I  told him yesterday I'm extremely exhausted and he responded saying he's  tired too, which is probably true. When I'm less tired it's easier for  me to bear his questioning, I still hate it and it doesn't help me at  all, but I can keep my mouth shut and not cause an argument.

**My  question is: Am I being unreasonable hoping he would understand that if  I'm so exhausted, it's near impossible for me not to be trauma  triggered?** This is the core of it - he thinks I should feel  happy because he's trying to help, and not blame him for harassing me or  kicking me while I'm down, which is what I've told him he does.

For  the record, I am in therapy (for CPTSD), he's never needed therapy, and I've forced  him into counseling a couple of times but he hated it when I said how I  felt and forcing him again felt so stressful to me that I discontinued  it. He always says he didn't have any of these problems with previous  partners. I have not been in very long (over 2 years) relationships with  anyone before him because of trust issues, so he's been the authority  of what's normal and what isn't.",1679045681.0

666,Is there such a thing as an acquired learning disability or disorder?,3,11ttvu6,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11ttvu6/is_there_such_a_thing_as_an_acquired_learning/,5,"This is one of those things that I have struggled with for a long time, and tried to ask different people but they always just assume I’m being unnecessarily hard on myself. I hear a lot of “Noooooo, no, you’re really smart, don’t say bad things about yourself!” 

I appreciate the sentiment, but it’s actually just _more_ invalidation. And it further feeds into self isolation, since I seem to be unable to articulate the problem in a way that leads to constructive discussion. 

I don’t equate learning disability with low intelligence. I feel like I _am_ intelligent, but I struggle to learn new things. 

In school, learning was effortless for me. I got bad grades later, in high school, but only because I rarely ever did homework, so if homework grades were averaged in with test scores, it came out to barely a passing grade. I always got A’s on tests, and scored high on the SAT standardized tests. 

My most recent job was in cybersecurity. I lost that job about 5 years ago. 

I had begun to learn programming while working there, so I decided that I would continue in that direction.

Since then, I dedicated myself 100% to learning programming. I did not work at all. All I did the whole time, with a few breaks here and there, was learn and practice. I completed a full stack course within the first couple of years, but then continued to pursue deeper understanding by applying the techniques to a whole bunch of different web applications, none of which I ever really finished. I have nothing to show for all that time and effort. 

Earlier this year, I decided to just stop. I’m not sure if I will ever continue. 

The problem is, every day was a wild roller coaster ride. If I would try, for example, using a certain technique in a different way that makes sense to me, and it doesn’t work, I would become obsessed with figuring out _why_ it’s not working, and I won’t give up until I either learn how it _does_ work, or find another technique that does work. 

But during that struggle, my emotions are off the charts. It doesn’t matter what my logic tells me, that I know I will figure it out eventually because I almost always do. My inner critic is screaming at me, and I _feel_ like the most stupid person ever to exist. I’ve been in tears of frustration so many times. 

It seems that the only way that I am able to learn is by following detailed step by step instructions. If I get past the first step or however many steps, and then a step doesn’t work, the inner screaming starts at full volume. I also express frustration by pounding the desk or wailing in agony, etc. My boyfriend ignores me, which is totally fine. But I think it bothered him, and he worried about me. 

This requirement - having step by step instructions - is not negotiable. I have been told by instructors and other students, and observed in discussion forums, that some people are able to “connect the dots” and do not require every little step spelled out explicitly. I’ve been told it’s expected. But I have learned from hard experience that I simply cannot connect dots if any steps are omitted. 

_Is this normal?_ Being unable to infer anything? I always feel like r/restoftheowl while everyone else seems to be skipping happily along, following the same instructions with missing steps. 


But then, if/when I solve the issue or learn a new thing, it’s joy and elation like I can’t get from anything else, not even drugs or alcohol. Accomplishment! 

It’s an infinite cycle. Stupidest person in the world, smartest person ever. Almost nothing in between. 

That’s why I decided to stop until I address some underlying trauma issues. 

So, now I don’t know what to do with my time every day. Even with the roller coaster ride, I always felt motivated to get other tasks done so I could program. I often sat down to program in the morning, and didn’t stop until 5pm, the time I set for myself to stop for the day. 

Also ,the idea of actually getting a programming job terrifies me. Not the getting part; the actual job part. I believe that every single person who ever hired me has regretted it. With very few exceptions. I have identified some specific things to not ever do again, but I’m still confident that I will still be unable to integrate with any group of colleagues.",1679065923.0

For starters I’ve always been outcast and abused and have rlly low self esteem. First time it happened via Snapchat when I was barely 13 with some Indian 20 year old and I got scared but didn’t understand what was even happening and blocked him after a week. Then it was on and off from 14 to 15 and a half. 

For about 8 months last year when I was in a very dark place older men and sometimes boys would message me and because I wasn’t getting affection anywhere else, I was willing to do what they wanted which was usually video calls and nudes and yeah…to get the slightest ounce of affection in the form of compliments. It made me feel sick and gave me nightmares but at the same time I was desperate to be shown kindness and love so it would keep happening over and over again and I would pretend I liked it.

I’d block them eventually but then another guy would come along and the cycle repeated. Sometimes I would refuse but then I would be forced to penetrate myself and masturbate (I didn’t enjoy it at all but my body would still react ig so I used that to tell myself I wasn’t being groomed it was my fault) via blackmail and doxxing on video call even if it hurt and I really couldn’t fit what they wanted me to use. I’d have bleeding and pain afterwards and get yeast infections from it. Since there was no one there irl I don’t know if it even counts as sexual assault/rape despite me being coerced/refusing and being hurt sexually bc like, ppl say “you could have just turned off the device” and there’s no laws in most places counting forced/coerced cybersex as such, but it’s not that simple. In the moment you feel trapped and alone like you have nowhere else to turn which really makes me feel like it was my fault even more and like I must’ve secretly wanted what happened.

I have a panic attack when I hear certain phrases now like “good girl” even if it’s a friend or coworker saying it with no ill intent and I go clammy and start shaking and can’t really breathe until I move away. 

Here’s one of the main grooming stories out of like my dozens ig:

——————————————

I met him on r./rape. I believe he has since deleted his account. I’d made a post about memories of childhood molestation and I couldn’t figure out if they were real or not. Romulus messaged me privately, telling me to take deep breaths and not to feel and that he was good at helping people work through sensitive memories and deal with them and to tell him everything I remembered and he’d help me report it. He acted so kind and understanding but also formal which somehow made me trust him more and for hours he listened to me open up about all my problems. How my friends talked behind my back and bullied me, how my mom was angry and distant, how I felt sad and insecure about my body, my SH issues and possible molestation. 

Around maybe the five hour mark instead of replying with the usual words of sympathy and helpful suggestions he replied like this:

R: can I tell you something?

M: yeah sure

R: on second thought, don’t worry. You’ll run away

M: I won’t 

R: promise? Ok then, truth is…your stories have been making me hard

M: oh

R: I’m sorry I know that makes me a bad person

For some reason I’d decided to comfort him bc he’d been so nice to me the past few hours and cared - or at least acted the part- when nobody else in my life did. Afterward, I asked him how old he was and he said 24. Then he asked if he could see me in underwear so I could help him out with his erection. I declined but he kept persisting until I gave in then he said I must be a catfish boy and he was leaving unless I sent photos of my lower half naked to prove I was a girl. I felt hurt so I did it. I felt gross and told him that but he said it would get easier the more I did it. It went on for about 2-3 weeks, this little routine where we’d make up code words and everything and he’d always tell me not to tell anybody about what he and I did.

He would message me with the code word and say what type of things he wanted me to film for him and send him, and he would command me to call him daddy and tell him about the things that made me upset to get him off, and describe how illegal and dangerous it was because for some reason that turned him on. I would have to exaggerate my past molestation for him to find it more interesting and recreate it for him. After he’d tell me how proud he was of me, how I was a good girl and deserved better, how pretty I was even with the scars, and he’d ask me if I still felt disgusted about my body and all the things he’d ask to send him. My answer would always be that I still felt gross then he’d say it were best if we didn’t talk anymore and block me. He’d also act distant and block me if I said I couldn’t sext with him because I was busy at times. Then he’d make a new account and message me saying he was sorry, rinse and repeat. That or I’d message him first begging him not leave because he was my only friend and I’d offer to do whatever sexual stuff he wanted for him to stay.

On our second last meeting he brought up my past grooming and acted really jealous telling me I didn’t need him if I have so many other men, then saying I didn’t satisfy him anymore and was boring and he was stringing me along then blocked me. It was a few hours later when he messaged me for the final time, telling me the real reason he kept pushing me away was because he couldn’t stop thinking about me and wanted to meet in person, but he acknowledged that was dangerous for me and impossible. The last messages were:

R: you’d do anything I told you to, right?

M: within reason yes

R: you’re such a good girl…you’ll do just fine in the world. You’re smart and beautiful and you can get so far without me. I want you to block me, and no matter what don’t unblock me.

M: so this is proper goodbye?

R: yes, now stop stalling, be a good girl and block me.

That was the end for the most part, he did message me once more on a new account asking me to unblock him several weeks later but I pretended I didn’t know who he was and ignored him. I did get attached to him for a short while and missed him, I don’t anymore but it took a while to see it as grooming bc he didn’t act like a typical one..",1679054831.0

i understand how schemas and self limiting beliefs function pretty well but im just wondering if anyone else had experienced like, adult experiences just reaffirming their schemas strongly? let me elaborate, i can understand how this can happen in the case of like, attracting emotionally available partners because that kind of treatment feels normal and safe and thus the pattern is affirmed. 

im a bit more baffled in my life when it comes to abandonment and emotional deprivation in friendships. it seems that no matter who i surround myself with, even when i actively seek out kind people with similar interests, i consistently get left out, not invited and  am not offered any help or support even when i ask. which all just affirms my belief that i just have to suck it up and do everything by myself. 

likely part of it is autism symptoms (which may just be from cptsd) leading to social difficulty and noticeable weirdness or awkwardness. but i really try so so hard to be a good, kind friend and to do nice things for people and just be decent.

677,Triggered at work,1,11tyesk,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11tyesk/triggered_at_work/,7,"Trigger warning; rape/SI/no consent interaction. I'm on mobile, please excuse my formatting. 

Bit of context, I've (34F) been diagnosed CTPSD, GAD, Bipolar 1, and ADHD. My CPTSD was diagnosed due to a very abusive father, but ultimately, I was raped at 16 by an ex and that really sealed the deal for my provider to diagnose. 

So my work. I work at a front desk, my desk has one route into it. I have one door outside, a locked stairwell (I do have a badge), a very slow elevator, and a locked back section to the rest of the building that I have to be let in. Most the times I actually do fairly well. Every so often I have something that is triggering. 

One male patron wanted to shake my hand, okay no biggie, he didn't for it just asked. So I did, eventually it progressed to putting both his hands on me and holding for awhile. I got so uncomfortable, went to HR and she supported me to say no. Just full stop. I did and he stopped. 

We also have a lot of homeless walk in. One night, when no one was around, I was lone, a guy came in and was clearly high, started getting irritated with me and it escalated. Totally didn't feel safe after that. But I moved on and worked through it.

This week though, I've been struggling. Since I have BD, the daylight savings really messed with me. I was getting like 4/5 hours of sleep every day since last Fri, which can enduce hypo/mania. So I've been utterly fixated on preventing that and struggling. So Wed, I was pretty sad/completely drained. Since I sit at the front desk, everyone sees me. Generally about 100 people a day, most of them I know from a daily basis. Most people noticed, asked if I was okay, I told them yes, and they moved on and let me have my space. 

However, one lady, who I've had issues in the past telling me to ""smile!"" Whenever I'm resting. She's older and very much of the ""motherly grandma"" who feels she can butt in everyone's business. She's sweet, but invasive. Anyways, she saw me and I thought, oh shit, she's going to tell me to smile. Ioved to look like I was typing up something on the computer.

This is when it got tense. I saw her move around to behind my desk (it's a long L shape, so you could fit 3 chairs back there, but only one way out and only one person actually sits back there). I got instantly tense because I didn't know what was going to happen. She came towards me (cornering me) and said, I'm going to give you a hug. I know she meant well, and just wanted me to have a better day. But I said ""No, I don't want to be touched"" she then said it's okay, I'm just going to give you a hug, and I said again, no, I don't want to be touched. Then she put her arms around me. After she walked out of my desk she asked if I was mad at her (in regards to my attitude) I said this (indicating my face lol) has nothing to do with you. 

Now, the aftermath. Not only were my boundaries crossed, but I was also made to feel guilty that I have emotions. I don't know how many times by professionals I've been told that saying no is acceptable. Yet, it isn't always the case, clearly. What, because she's an older female that makes it okay? When I was raped, I told my assaulter no many times. I begged. He said all kinds of crap to make himself feel better about the situation, like he was just being persuasive. So although this situation isn't that, I definitely feel triggered and can't stop thinking about it now. I've had SI since that happened. I had it before she left the desk, it was the quickest, most intrusive thought I've had in a long time, just a simple thought of SI to escape. I felt all my power had been taken from me. 

I went to my boss and she gave me the rest of the day off. Came back yesterday, spoke with HR, who is also my boss as I work a few hours a day for her. She both were extremely supportive. They made arrangements to get me a different position, whether I want it permanent or just when I'm having a hard time. HR is going to talk to her today after her shift, and after a few weeks, is going to send out a trauma training. We also discussed accommodations. I have an appt with my therapist next Tues, and an appt appt Sat. 

But when I walked in today, all the other teachers (part of my work has a daycare, they were in the playground) were huddled in a circle around her and several looked at me as I was walking in. 

My anxiety is through the roof. I've already taken meds. I just don't want to be here. I like majority of the people I work with. It's just the position is not working for me. I don't want to lose my job. But I'm so drained and unhealthy. I want to run away.

Talking has become difficult over the years, as weird as that sounds, thanks to my cptsd (I believe). I generally have a hard time with speaking - stringing words together - and it's not necessarily due to social anxiety. I don't get nervous either I just buckle and my words get jumbled - frankly it being due to the fact that I don't really talk much. The most talking I'll ever do is at uni and participating in my classes at that - when it comes to friends I immediately go into listening mode and it's more a subconscious thing that makes up for my own \*perceived\* lack: my struggle with talking.

The ""talking muscle"" isn't exercised much. And my own cptsd makes it difficult TO exercise it I think.

But where it gets me these days is that I can't even articulate my introspection. I say this because I think I'm pretty introspective and reflective - I can have ""sophisticated"" thoughts on things - I'm pretty passionate about social issues and psychology/mental health - but I can't even articulate these passions beyond thoughts. And that makes me feel so sad and inadequate. Just wanna add something to the convo but when I open my mouth my words tangle together.

This just happened earlier with my mum. We were talking about how divorce is stigmatised in our community - and every time I had some introspection to share my words just jumbled then it shut me up and I just listened to my mum for the rest of it. My messy wording makes me sound ""unintelligent"" in a way - like it makes it seem like I don't actually know what I'm talking about..when I do..it makes my mum think I don't understand her level of introspection when I do. Sometimes she assumes I'll ""never understand this misogyny"" when I DO.

My word jumble speaks otherwise. Literally.

682,DAE have trouble going”home” bc of their trauma? How do you deal with it? TRIGGER WARNING: SA.,1,11twn5p,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11twn5p/dae_have_trouble_goinghome_bc_of_their_trauma_how/,2,"I left my country 7 years ago. I (25F) was sexually assaulted repeatedly by maternal grandfather. He died way before I moved away. My older sister (31) was sexually harassed by his son, who was (still is) married. Last year, he tried to harass our maid while she was picking fruit from our tree. The the only one in the house was my little sister (19) and they locked the house and left him outside. They told my mom.

My mom refuses to take any kind of measures against my uncle. She still talks to him normally, all because according to him “none of that stuff ever happened.” My sister whom he touched doesn’t “care at all,” she is married and currently pregnant. I think she is trying to avoid having to deal with my mom’s reaction, bc this affected her and she has talked to me endlessly about it before my mom found out. 

I saw my family in another state, they usually come to the US for summer vacation. We grew up that way because we temporarily lived in that state when me and my siblings were younger. 

My sister is about to give birth, and she is apparently devastated that I’m not going to be there. But she hasn’t spoken to me or texted me in over a year. It’s only when I call my mom that any of my siblings talk to me, excluding my oldest brother who is actually my everything. She wants me to go back to help her decorate the nursery in my parents house, bc in my culture people visit you after giving birth in your parents house, not your own. She also said she is ✨seriously ✨ not sending me any pictures of my nephew if I don’t go back bc that’s my responsibility since I’m the younger sister and she did this for my other sister when she gave birth. It honestly feels like blackmail.

I went home 3 times since I moved away, but the last time was 5 years ago when my parents took away my passport and kept me from coming back for 8 months after I finally told them about my grandfather, because I was “bringing shame to the family.”

I love my family, it’s not their fault what my grandfather or uncle did, but my mom continuously suggesting that “I’m lying” and mentioning her brother and father in front of me for no reason triggers me insanely. When I saw them last summer, I stayed with them for a month. My mom did the same thing and I had a panic attack worst than any other one I have had in YEARS. I know I can’t take it, and my grandfather’s pictures are everywhere in our house and she refuses to take them down. 

It’s not about whether she accepts it or not, I don’t care anymore, she made it clear that even if he did that she “has to pray for him so God forgives him.” We are Muslim, parents are a big deal for us. 

It’s about the fact that I can’t handle that kind of environment. It’s too toxic. Everyone still talks about him in my city bc he was a “religious, kind example.” He built mosques all over the city, so I hear his name every time I go to a mosque there. It will be Ramadan soon so there is no way that I won’t go to the mosque if I do visit. 

Point is, my sister is giving birth soon, Ramadan is coming up, and both are occasions where families celebrate together, but I can’t celebrate with mine. 

I’m tired. All my sisters are mad at me for not going back, my brother is disappointed that I’m not going back bc he misses me and I haven’t seen him in 4 years, but he is not mad at all. My dad stopped talking to me this past year after he saw my panic attack bc he feels helpless every time he hears my voice bc I’m sick and faraway from him. I think he regrets how he used to treat me once he found out. I tried to tell him that him talking to me helps me, but he just “can’t.”

I also don’t trust my parents not to take my passport again. My father is my legal guardian in my country, so he legally has the right to stop me from traveling. 

I can’t go back, but it’s breaking my heart. The older I get the worse it gets. I don’t know how to cope anymore. Therapy and meds sustain me, but I’m running out of strength. My depression is worse than it has ever been, and I barely get out of bed anymore. Idk what to do.

So I’ve been out of full time work for coming up on 5 years now. In these 5 years I’ve attempted 4 different times to hold down full time jobs that I applied for and was hired for and failed at all of them. I believe 3 weeks was the longest I made it at any of the 4 before I had to quit or was fired for missing days due to panic attacks and all the rest exc.

I had my monthly facetime checkup with my psych aprn who scripts my meds the other day and told him how horrible I’m doing (I’m currently in therapy again as well have been for 4 months trying IFS therapy) and he said he thinks I should def apply that the attempts at working look good in my favor exc. 

It’s just based on everything I’ve researched and heard even ppl with great documentation and severe illnesses exc get denied and somes appeals even eventually get denied as well. I also worry that since I’ve gone though so many therapists I only have one long term mental health professional I’ve been with and that’s him…this aprn I see who does my meds and I’ve been seeing for 8-9 years now. 

I mean maybe that’s good enuff since he can provide all the diagnoses and records of the million meds I’ve tried exc. I guess I can list out all the shrinks I’ve seen including my current one altho as far as them being able to actually talk to them if that’s even needed idk I mean some of them are from way back. 

I’ve been diagnosed with Gad, SAD, cptsd, panic disorder, non specific depressive disorder and ocd so uhh ywah  I’m pretty Fkn bat shit lol and I’m def disabled I mean I’ve tried to work I want to work I don’t want a hand out but I’m desperate now. Savings are dwindling and while my older sister helps me out here and there knowing my situation with 100 bucks here 100 there which I feel so pathetic about but am grateful for but it’s just not enuff.

I don’t wanna be on disability forever but idk at the age of 33 after everything I’ve tried for so many goddamn years now I think I may be fooling myself holding on to any illusion of hope for a future for myself, and that includes ever being able to work a job again of any kind. I couldn’t even Fkn do a work from home job I was having panic attacks from being so overwhelmed logging on to my laptop in my own fucking living room for Christ sake.

Anyway I guess you didn’t need the whole life story sorry so basically just wondering if anybody here who is familar w the system or who has applied and been accepted or denied or whatever knows if it’s worth a shot. 

I know I said I’m a desperate so it would seem like duhhh of course irs worth it but at the same time I am so fucking exhausted mentally n physically 24/7 and have such little to nonexistent will and energy to do anything that I would feel like such a Fkn jerkoff if went through with all the paperwork and the gettint a lawyer possibly and the auto denial they basically do to everyone and then the hearing before a judge and just the massive headaches I know would lie ahead 

Tl;dr: familar with applying for mental health disability? With the system in general or you personally applied and we’re accepted or denied know if irs worth it or it’s rly just really low chance of approval even w a lawyer and good paperwork and diagnoses and doctors backing me up exc…

I feel like emotional flashbacks aren’t really officially a thing among psychologists - at least in the country I’m living in. Why are emotional flashbacks only emotional? Since the trauma is chronic/lasting and happening during childhood years it makes sense for me that the brain wouldn’t file every single traumatic event and give visual flashbacks to each and every episode. The brain and personality was also not developed, and the trauma becomes “engrained” another way. And that way it makes sense to me that flashbacks appear only emotional.

Has anyone tried journalling, or something like it, for coping with cpstd? 

I journalled a lot as a teen, but I find it hard to get into it as a regular habit as an adult. 

I had limited, but positive experiences in the past (about 10 or so years ago) with blogging, but not specifically about mental health. Then, in the past 2-3 years, I thought maybe it would be good to blog again about how I am doing (specifically about my mental health), and also some things that happened to me, including the beravement of my dad and anonymously sharing about challenges I had at work. I did connect with some other people blogging who were like me. What I guess I mean is that I was also disheartened because I found blogging on a major site online (I won't specify which one) to be very spammy. I felt weird writing about my childhood, mental health symptoms, serious life events like a bereavement that happened to me, and people would ""like"" my post who were not real bloggers, but people or groups trying to bump up their SEO, or so it seemed, to promote themselves, or some products. I also found people, or people pretending to be real people, who were very thinly veiled scammers using sites they made themselves on the major blogging site. I then started to feel unsafe sharing online, although I took care not to share my location, job, first or last name. This most recent experience of blogging I had felt a bit like sending a message in a bottle in the ocean, except the ocean was the internet full of spam and scammers, with only a few ""real "" people here and there who were like me.

Has anyone found a way to share about their mental health, or a way of journalling privately, that has worked for you? Has anyone else tried to blog or share their ideas online in ways that were safe and positive? 

I would be interested to know either way, about both what has worked, or not worked, for you.",1679049676.0
696,Stuck,1,11ts7o1,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11ts7o1/stuck/,1,"For background:
Non- binary AFAB 29year old

Hello, I had CPTSD suggested to me a few years back and then again a few times recently by medical professionals. But I haven’t been formally diagnosed, my mental health team think my symptoms are more to do with poorly managed ADHD and just want me to stick to a medication regimen of Ritalin…

Anyways, I had a really turbulent upbringing which led to homelessness from a young age and doing things I didn’t want to to get by. I got myself together and managed to appear normal for some time: going to uni, working away, long term partner… before covid hit I was working in the refugee camps in Greece and broke up with my partner of 5 years due to being away all the time. When I came back I got another tough job working with young people who’d been sexually exploited - got into another relationship but just kept freaking out and pushing her away. Essentially I got what I thought I wanted and became single, quit my job and then essentially made myself homeless. I put myself in all the exact same situations I was in when I was a teenager.. I start living in a van I did up and started travelling around planting trees and doing forestry work and trying to stay out of trouble. Then I met someone, I had red flags from the beginning but I felll for it. To cut that but short I had an absolute meltdown afterwards and couldn’t function panic attacks daily, unable to eat sleep or regulate myself.. I managed to get my shit together again and finally got a council flat, but then had a serious rock climbing accident and spent two weeks in hospital and had a bunch of operations on my mangled arm. I was starting my post grad in two weeks. Anyways, I start my postgrad still woozy on painkillers, I pull through do well, I even get a modelling contract and paid to work on a film with my pal by creative Scotland- so lucky with the opportunities, and go away with all my pals to Morocco and whilst there I suddenly can’t do anything. Finally my life is together and I’m so proveleged and I can’t do anything. I get back , it continues, I drop out of my postgrad thinking I might be able to focus on creative stuff/ modelling, but I can’t do it. I meet really nice people and every time we try to be intimate I just can’t.

I don’t understand it, it makes me feel sick I’m so so lucky and privileged right now, I have my own flat with my dog and I get disability and jobseekers- so I’m comfortable, but I can’t enjoy it or be productive with it. I just feel so guilty. And I can’t get the person who gave me red flags out of my head. I feel like people hate me over it, that she’s spreading lies (for context she’s v well known where I live and owns a studio a stones throw from my flat). But why should I care!? I know I try to do the best by people but I’m crippled with anxiety about what is said and if I try to put work out in spaces that they will put me down or make people not let me perform/ publish with certain organisations etc.

And yeah, I guess the main thing is not being able to be close to anyone now and having zero drive for anything.

Sorry this just turned into a moan. Poor me, the government give me money so I can live a comfortable life without doing anything…

My mom was panicking. She was running about, practically tossed her phone to me (while her mom was on the phone), and was just upset. I walked upstairs to get ready, where she heard me talking to my sister. My mom just proceeds to start yelling “HEY!” at us from the bottom of the stairs. She was claiming it was to get our attention because we were distracted. I’m 18. I’m a college student (back here for spring break). I know how to get ready to leave the house. 

I got an emotional flashback. I froze. Started staring off into the distance. My mom ended up complaining about how grumpy I was being, while I’m just trying to manage my freeze response. I said something along the lines of, if you don’t want me to be upset, don’t yell at me. My dad, who abused my mom for their entire relationship up until about a month ago, started complaining about my mom again, and she was probably upset about that. 

Tonight I tried to address the issue with my mom, and tell her that I’m not okay with being yelled at. 
Me: “Oh also, would you be able to try and avoid yelling at me?” (Positive, minimally confrontational tone) 
Mom: “You already said that” (said really negatively)
Me: “Yeah. I just wanted to try and talk about it.”
Mom: “Well you already said that.”

I’m really annoyed about this. She recently quit therapy, but she’s still out here doing stuff like this. I just don’t want to be caused to have emotional flashbacks for no reason. I also don’t get why she won’t let me talk to her about it.",1679039354.0

TLDR the title from freeze response and shame I guess. 

I (young female) have been seeing my therapist for five years now. I went through many other mental health providers prior to him that I proved too difficult. He’s the only therapist who has had the patience and grace and endure my refusal to speak the majority of the time. The first three years of our sessions was just a constant crisis stabilization. I was in and out of the hospital and unable to cope with much else let alone begin to process the trauma causing my “hysteria”. 

However, the last two years I’ve been in a monumentally better place which is evidently and ironically the perfect time for everything I ever wanted to forget to suffocate me slowly right when I got a glimmer of hope 🙃 Our sessions have been the most trauma focused as they have ever been. There was one appointment years prior we tried to do EMDR but I went into a spiral. For the past two years I have not been able to look at him during our sessions. I shit you not. 

I can return eye contact when he comes to get me in the waiting room and I’ll keep my head up until he’s asked how the last few days have gone. After that, I deflate like a balloon. My head goes down and to the side and I will spend the rest of the time staring at the wall or floor. 

I can’t look at him during the session and can’t acknowledge his presence. The closest thing is I can sometimes look at his shoes but that just upsets me, especially if he has on the brown ones. I struggle immensely with disassociation and I’ll zone out in my head or the past for minutes. Sometimes I can hear him trying to move in his chair or he’ll wiggle or lightly tap his foot to get me back to where I’m at least aware I’m staring at the wall. 

He’s never commented on my inability to look at him. I guess if he did say something to me I would cease to exist on an atomic level and crumble from being exposed. I am aware and hate how difficult I am being but that serves to make me feel worse. Ahhhh the wonderful things trauma does to you. 

Even after our session is over and we are scheduling our next I can’t look at him.  And I won’t when I leave.  Not until the next appointment. I’m sorry for this long ramble I just am at a complete loss on how to address this shame and total shutdown.

I left mortified and angry. I felt like my father when he yelled at me all my life. Now I’m sitting in my car debating to quit. I don’t know how I could make sense of this or show my face. I’m in a whirlpool of self hate and deep shame, regret, everything. 

She said I was angry at something else and while it’s partly true, I was irritated by her commentary and instead of simply ignoring her, I felt that sheer rage and anger consume me and I wanted to argue with her about it. I’m not sure I could ever make right with her but above all even go back. 

Before we fought, I saw a coworker I’m in love with but does not love me. I tried to make eye contact and they ignored me. I felt the same unlovable feelings I’ve carried my whole life.

I’ve taken Ativan every day this week because my anxiety is so bad. I can’t sleep, I can’t function, I just feel my life is going to be over in a few days. The event in question is an ultrasound on my genital area which is incredibly triggering because I’ve dealt with so much medical abuse and neglect around it. I am an intersex man and they are looking for gonads, which ones and where they are. The results are also causing me a ton of anxiety because if they find ovaries then I’m straight up killing myself, if they find ovotestes I don’t know what I’d do, and if they find testes then that just means pursuing surgery which brings up even more anxiety even though it would be the best of the three outcomes. It’s also the most probable outcome but I can’t trust anything about my body anymore because of how much gaslighting I’ve experienced. They also could find a mix of gonads. I’m pretty certain I have testes, I mean I have a confirmed prostate, so I don’t see why I should be so upset by the what-ifs. I don’t have anyone who can come to support me so that’s not an option. And because my genitals are visibly ambiguous Im already feeling the shame and embarrassment of someone looking down there. I feel like I’m going to be seen as a freak or mistake.

I’m seeking genuine feedback with this post and trying not to come off like a pity party. I’ve been feeling down lately because I’m single, unemployed, and feeling like my friendships aren’t reciprocal.

Since I’m having social issues in all the major areas of my life I’m questioning if it’s something about me or my behavior. I’m trying to look inward and figure out how I can improve but it’s difficult when I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong. Context below.

Jobs: I am constantly getting rejected or ghosted from jobs despite previously being successful in my career. The only offers I have received have been for temporary contract roles with no benefits. 

Dating: My ex-boyfriend broke up with me right before the holidays because he “wasn’t ready for a relationship”. We still talk but he’s constantly giving me mixed signals. Stuff like calling me on the phone and talking for hours but then rejecting any invitation to hang out. Telling me I’m hot and then gushing about other people he’s sleeping with. Etc. I am trying to date other people but nothing is clicking, I keep getting ghosted/stood up, and I’ve swiped through everyone in my area on multiple dating apps.

Friends: My friends are all settling down and getting married, buying homes, etc. so they have less time for me. I regularly reach out to people and try to initiate group events, but get shut down because there’s no time that works for everyone’s schedule. I have been trying to branch out and make more single friends and that goes well until they get into a new relationship and then disappear.

I tried to confide in my best friend about how lonely I’ve been feeling and she responded by getting angry with me and stonewalling. She said it upsets her that I feel lonely because she does so much for me. I apologized for making her feel unappreciated but she has remained cold and distant, barely speaking to me for weeks despite being constantly active on social media. 

I feel like I must be doing something wrong for so many people to be treating me like this. People regularly compliment me on how I’m thoughtful, fun, and a good communicator but then don’t treat me well. I exercise, have good hygiene, wear well-fitting clothes, etc. so I think it’s a deeper problem.

Am I expecting too much from others? Am I too negative? Is it bad luck or is my whole personality bad? I’d appreciate any guidance on how to figure this out.

So, for some weird reason, my Facebook has been showing me reels about motherhood and when it is too old to have kids. Apparently I am in the “right” age for having kids and, while I don’t personally believe there is such a thing, it made me kinds realized that, even if I had the chance. I wouldn’t have kids at my age and I kinda felt surprised by all the comments of people saying that they married and had kids in early 20s and such. 

Like, I do know it existed in a disconnected way but it’s lately that I was like “oh it’s real” but it’s weird to me because, I personally feel a lot much younger and with a lot more things that I want to do and heal before being responsible of a human. 

It kinda makes me feel behind? But I mean I spent most of my life up to now feeling sort of away of myself. Trying to deal with tons of mental health issues and relearning what I should have known already that I don’t think I am at that level or if I’ll ever be at that level of being a mom… and I know what is to have a mentally unstable mom.

But more than the remain childfree or not situation. Is the “grief” from my lost years what bothers me. 

I honestly feel like I’m anywhere between 17 and 21 not 30 lol and I didn’t enjoyed my life during all that time. I didn’t make what I wanted to do and what I wanted to be a reality. 

I did not live “adventures” outside of my head. 

I think I don’t even know my sexuality and personality completely, I even need to google many “basic” self care skills because I couldn’t learn that when my peers where learning it.

So she taught me different ways that I could try tapping techniques today to regulate my nervous system and still prepare for EMDR next week, and to be honest my mind is completely blown!

But I was wrong! This actually works and it even helped with my post op pain. I just had to get on here and share because I am mind blown! 

Basically the technique I went for was placing my hands on my knees and alternating tapping from left to right at a count of 1-2 while I focused on my breath. Every time my mind drifted and I started having negative thoughts I just brought it back to the 1-2 count and I did it for about 15 minutes and my mood shifted entirely. Don’t get me wrong I still feel shitty, but the irritability is gone and instead of running down my to do list I’m just relaxed and staying in the present.

Honestly my healing process continues to amaze me because I can now tell that I AM GETTING BETTER!",1679005837.0

I was diagnosed with CPTSD in 2017, I also dissociate and struggle with addiction. I like to think of myself as ""high functioning"", but I've noticed over the years that I am not as motivated as I used to be. 

As a seamstress I'm lucky that I have a skill that is hard to find. I have over a decades worth of experience, and I'm a personable person. So, I've kind of abused my skill set leverage and connections to take a lot of time off work. 

I'll mostly text in that I have a migraine, or that I'm not feeling well. I had covid twice, it's easy to think I have a weak immune system. I feel bad cause most of the time I'm lying. But on those days I call out, it's mostly because the weight of the world feels like it's pressing down on me. I dissociate and get stuck in this apathetic fog. I was plagued by nightmares the night before. I feel sick to my stomach with anxiety. My body is sore with how tense I always am. 

Work can be impossible on some days. I consider myself lucky I can miss as much as I do, but the guilt is getting to me. I trust some of my co-workers, but I have pervious work place trauma and I'm finding it hard to open up. Should I just keep being vague in my excuses and hope that the guilt doesn't eat me alive? Or do I open up and share that I have a mental illness that makes functioning impossible on occasion?

I have two siblings and parents who are together physically, but my moms narcissistic and my dads emo. Unavailable…they fight all the time (mostly about money) and when my moms not fighting with my dad, she’s fighting with me.

I grew up in a dysfunctional family with some pretty traumatic events (I've treated some of them with EMDR), and yet I feel like the emotional cheating I experienced in high school is triggering me more than technically worse things that happened to me.

So, in the beginning of my relationship with my then-boyfriend, he was flirting with THE most popular girl in high school, to the point where all of his buddies were making jokes and asking when they were going to date. 
Everyone agreed that she was the prettiest girl in school, he would smile and text her when I was with him, I saw the conversations they had publicly on Twitter (and their private message lol), etc. Even back then, he was very good at gaslighting me and I felt bad for being jealous but also miserable because I wasn’t as perfect as her.
In the end he broke up multiple times with me, he got closer to her but they didn’t concrete it since she was moving in uni, and he got back together with me. 
He never really assumed what happened or apologized, he just denied it but for 2/3 years he sometimes still sent her nostalgic messages. 

In short, I always felt like a plan B. During the whole relationship I had nightmares of him cheating on me with this girl (or others), or I had nervous ""urges"" where I'd go through his cell phone to see if he was still talking to her, I'd get all worked up and he'd call me crazy. 

It was an abusive relationship that I stayed in for almost 10 years, he made me insecure and not just with this girl (I eventually found out he cheated on me several times lol). But even now that it's over and I'm feeling better without him, when I think back on that period with this girl I feel a lot of shame, anxiety, and I still have nightmares about it.

I'm hesitant to talk to my therapist about it because I'm afraid it will seem ridiculous compared to other things I've experienced. However, it is really something that creates a lot of discomfort for me.

People have told me that this was not my fault  and that it was bad, but I worry that they're biased. I need to know if it really wasn't a big deal, I need an unbiased opinion. As a child, I was socially isolated. I was the youngest in my class, and didn't understand how to fit in. I had one close friend, A, who wasn't bullied like I was, but isolated due to her shyness. When I was 12 and my classmates were 13, A made a Friend, B, and we would often spend time together. B was nice to both of us, but also mean to me. She would put me into painful holds when I didn't do what she wanted and scratched me. She would belittle me and call me fat, although A was chubbier than me. We often had sleepovers, the 3 of us, and B would touch my breasts under my clothes, in front of A. I would tell her to stop and try to push her off, but she would hurt me until I stopped struggling. Over time, I kind of learned to try to ignore it in hopes of just getting it over with. Later, she touched my genitals under my pyjamas but over my underwear, too. A witnessed it all, but ignored it, and B never did any of this to A. B would call us both her best friends. We would lend each other comic books, share secrets, do friend things, and I spent time with her voluntarily, though usually only if A was involved. When I was 15, I got a boyfriend and when I told her that was why she had to stop, she did. Around the same time, circumstances made it easier for me to avoid her and I did so increasingly for some years before telling her I didn't want to speak with her.

Referencing the baby as ""he"" and occasionally ""she"" but more often than not as male because neither of us wanted to dehumanize our baby by calling the baby ""it"". Just seemed so impersonal.

It's still very fresh so I don't know how I'm going to be affected long term, I've mostly been crying a lot. When we found it, I immediately shut down and started shaking. The next day I messaged my GP to get a referral for a therapist and I should be getting an appointment soon. In the meantime, I don't really know what to do with myself. I can't unsee what I saw and there's a lot of shame around this being a family member. There are a lot of emotions.

Despite being diagnosed on paper with PTSD (my therapist and I agree it’s likely CPTSD) and fitting all the criteria, I keep convincing myself my trauma isn’t enough. I watched my dad as he was dying in hospice for hours, unable to breathe on his own, gasping. His abuser was in the room watching me cry over his body. It was unexpected. I sat with him until I couldn’t take it anymore. He didn’t want to die. I know he didn’t do what he did in hopes it would end in death. It wasn’t gory, but seeing him dying like that was horrific. The weeks leading up to his death were horrific. I didn’t actually see him take his last breaths, but I saw him dying. A lot happened before, during and afterwards that I’ll spare details of. Why am I convincing myself this isn’t enough to have PTSD? Why am I downplaying my trauma? My PTSD was also caused by numerous SA’s. I just don’t know why my mind keeps telling me my trauma cannot possibly be trauma. The imposter syndrome is horrible.",1679026429.0

Fb friends have ""real"" lives with kids and car trouble and stuff involving many factors, while I stupidly spin in circles around my fears, haunted by long-over situations that I can't shake off. No one relates, no one replies. I *hate* that I desire acknowledgement and I know I'm being judged... why wouldn't they, wondering what it is that I could have to complain about? My parents certainly do, and I can barely look my father in the eye; I was the golden child who tried so hard to be the best first born but fell flat on my face and didn't get back up. They can sense that I've given up but they don't understand why. I don't understand why I am finding it so hard to get my feet under me. It has been over a dozen years. I don't know why people in my building won't look at me, why friends stopped calling or answering my emails. Everyone's lives seem to be a dozen paces beyond me while I'm clung to by ghosts and shadows. Why can't I shake myself free? Do I hate myself that much?

Confusion is the place where I live now, and I wish someone could help me leave it. But being bipolar and having cptsd without adequate support and treatments it pretty much guarantees a rough road that few have a map for. So few people understand either of these things that I'm not likely to find much sympathy, not even from people in one camp or the other.

735,I think I am about to make the hardest decision of my life,25,11supae,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11supae/i_think_i_am_about_to_make_the_hardest_decision/,38,"I think I might be ready to make the hardest decision I have ever had to make in my life and that is to divorce the absolute love of my life, my wife. Looking back now I can see that when we met, she was in a very protective and overcompensating state which came across as kind of arrogant and prickish because she had left a very physically abusive relationship. I almost broke it off with her because of this but I could see something clawing under the surface to get out so I decided I would stick it out for a bit longer and boy was I glad I did. Under that hard protective exterior was the most kind, caring, genuine and loving person I had ever met in my entire life, and I knew at that point that this beautiful person was the one I wanted to live out my days with. I’m not going into the details of the issues that caused her CPTSD but let’s just say it was multiple instances (sexual and physical abuse as a child and adult) across many spectrums that I know this gentle being did not deserve to suffer through. Like all couples we have had our issues with communication both from her perspective of stuffing her CPTSD (initially misdiagnosed as BPD) deep down inside and ignoring it along with my own issues of being wound up inside my head (Getting tested for Asperger’s next week actually). So, as you can see, not a recipe for good comms between us!! I know I failed her in many ways as a husband because of my issues in showing her on the outside what I felt on the inside, that she was everything to me. I thought that my actions were enough, but I know they weren’t, and I know now after researching CPTSD for over a year exactly what I should have done to show this woman how she means the world to me. I have never and I never will do anything to intentionally hurt this woman no matter how much she chooses to hurt me in this stage.

                Fast forward to the last 2 years and things went downhill, we tried marriage counseling but the marriage counselor said there wasn’t really much we could do because of her BPD (which was actually CPTSD) keeping her closed off and not wanting to communicate. Which after all my research I can see clear as day now and understand why that would be so hard. We took a break from that, and she started seeing a therapist which is where they told her she has CPTSD instead of BPD and about a month after the start there things really went to shit. She said she had to get out of the house because she needed time to get her head right and moved in with her sister and left all her of pets with me and 99% of her stuff about 7 months ago. Now my personal opinion with this is not so good as her sister is diagnosed Bipolar and is just an overall manipulative and vindictive person whose only purpose is to serve her own goals and her brother-in-law is a hot-tempered ass most of the time. Both of those types of people are triggers for my wife, but nothing I could say would convince her that living there is not conducive to a healthy healing environment.

                The first few months weren’t too bad, but communication started slacking when she bought her motorcycle and started riding with groups of other people for “therapy” as she called it. Now to backtrack a little bit, when she was 17, she ran away from home to live with this same sister and did pretty much the exact same thing with the motorcycle “therapy”. Once that started she started lying to other people telling them she was divorced, going through a divorce and telling people about her life which included past things from her life, my life and our life but all mixed together which showed me that something wasn’t right inside her head and that she was most likely having some very hard struggles which I know therapy can cause by bringing up all the repressed emotions. I asked her to come home and watch the animals for a few days so I could get away and get some time for my own mental health and she refused, I’ve told her I need to schedule my colonoscopy because I have Ulcerative Colitis and was due over a year ago and she ignores me. Since then though it has just gotten progressively worse to where she is now emotionally abusive, manipulative and I am 100% sure has had at least one emotional affair and almost 95% sure of a physical affair as well. How far that went I don’t know.

                Now it may make me seem like a pushover, but once I found out I told her I could understand where all this was coming from and that I was willing to forgive and work past it, but she continues to just purposely ignore me and pretend like I don’t exist (no real direct comms since January). I’ve given up so much these past 2 years for this woman, no sex, no love, no support yet I have tried to be there for her and to learn and be better for her every step of the way. But at this point with the lies and the affair and the emotional abuse I am just dying. I have lost 21 pounds through all of this and suffer from severe depression to the point that my own therapists are putting me on Prozac and Xanax. I am just completely broken and lost and trying to keep it together just to type this. I love this woman so much and I can’t bring myself to admit that this “woman” is the same gentle, sweet, nurturing, and loving woman that I fell in love with and married. I know she is having a very hard time and I can’t help but feel that I if I divorce her that I am abandoning her in a time of need even if she doesn’t realize it. I feel like I’d be divorcing whoever this woman is and at the same time it would also take away the love of my life who is buried somewhere down deep inside of her in a protective vault which feels like I’m just putting a gun to my head.

                My logical side tells me that for my own sake I need to do this and suffer the heartbreak of losing her and abandoning her but to save myself in the long run. However, my heart tells me that this isn’t the person I married, and I need to be there for her and in the end this will all pass and will be a learning experience for all that will make things stronger moving forward. All the wonderful memories I have of her and the life we built together and the plans for our future are just completely foreign to me when I think of it in the perspective of whoever this “woman” is that she has become the last several months who tries to be “hard” and “strong” when I know for a fact the woman she really is fragile and deserves love and support.

                Sorry for the long post, I’m just rambling because I am extremely lost and confused and hurt and just need to vent a little. I’m just looking for perspectives from anybody else who has been on either side of a similar situation. Thank You for Reading.",1678974541.0

One thing that really helped me to start was this subreddit, I was no longer alone, there was people who understood it, people who have made progress. Thanks for showing me and for being such a safe community. It’s been very tough and I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD. 

Therapy has brought back memories and overall made it a bit harder for me with trust, what i need and my triggers since it’s like I’m going through it again. I was in an abusive relationship.

My bf has been to big help and I love him, but I can’t stop feeling that I’m this huge weight pulling him down because im now so much more sensitive to everything. I’ve had so many conversations with him that I appreciate him and I don’t want to ruin this, or make him responsible/be my pillar through all of this. I need consistent routines everyday and i need plans to execute in the way we made them, i need help with planning my days, i need help with getting out of bed and sleeping and so on. 

He has his own life and stuff gets in the way of plans, which I understand, but because i’m in this state it can really ruin me, make me overthink/break down. It’s like I have this inner conflict cause I know it’s nothing, but i feel so upset, lonely, un prioritised and so on.

I will accept any form of abuse and still believe that it will change even when my body is telling me it’s uncomfortable, I start dissociating, constantly smoking, and feel tense, just not good all the time.

My current boyfriend I met on tinder and we clicked right away as friends and it soon moved to sexual/romantic. He started saying very romantic things and when I told him about my past he would be shocked and say that he would never do those things, he’d be my peace, etc. At first I was a bit put off at how fast this was going and told him to dial it back. He did for a bit, and that made me trust him and I felt safe around him. I loved being around him. I stopped smoking. I looked forward to spending time with him. We communicated well.

There were several red flags that I brushed off because of this.

Then we moved in together. The month we did I found out he was sexting random people on discord, and was in a NSFW server. I found out he had taken a picture of my (clothed) feet and posted them to the server. When I confronted him, he seemed genuinely distraught and sobbed and told me how sorry he was, he’d never do it again, he felt so embarrassed and ashamed, etc. He got me gifts and I felt so..disconnected from everything immediately.

I forgave him despite this and proceeded to try and trust him again. He said I could check his phone whenever I wanted.

Then I found out, again, this time he sent more pictures (ones I had taken myself) and also sent them a video of us doing sexual acts that I consented to (I havent had a good history with sex. I was groomed). But obviously I didnt want him to send it and I told him how nervous I was that’d he would do that. 

I confronted him and he kept trying to convince me they were old, before I found out the first time, and he stopped, then doubled down and said that he DID do it again but it didnt satisfy him and he stopped. I told him this was illegal and creepy, he agreed but said he was just “showing me off”. I took him back again because I felt so confused and I still loved him. 

I’ve been trying so hard to trust him but I cant. 2 days ago my mom bought us a bedframe and while putting it together he got super frustrated and said “tell your mom not to buy this shit again” and kicked a bag of clothes. I didnt know how to react so I went in the bathroom and he knocked a few minutes later sounding incredibly guillty. But I feel so different towards him now. I am scared for our future.

I broke up with him and he told me he cant accept it but he wont deny it. That we can talk more after his therapy appt. But I already feel so hollow. He’s being so nice to me but I want to cry everytime he is.

In the car, he told me he cheated because it made him feel good, wnd he didnt care, he wanted to do what he wanted. And that scared him. I didnt know what to say.

 I still love him so much. Everytime he’s nice I wanted to hug him and cry. Please tell me I’m making the right decision.",1678999003.0

All my laughs are fake ones. I could sit with anyone and talk for hours with them. Talking made the whole world a little easier. I could talk and talk and talk endlessly. All I wanted to do was talk as a kid. It brought me so much unexplainable joy to share experiences. 

But now life has fucked me up. After multiple repeated horrible traumatic experiences and the realization that my childhood had actually entailed quite a lot of abuse, I have become isolated and secluded. All I want is to be left alone yet simultaneously I want someone else to stand by me in silence. I have no friends anymore. 

Battling through severe depression and CPTSD and social anxiety makes relationships so terrifying and exhausting. I don’t have the energy to even maintain eye contact. I find no joy in normal conversations. I don’t want to talk to anyone. I’m terrified of physical contact. I feel like people around me are so shallow. From being the bubbliest, brightest, most talkative person in the room I’ve turned into being the quietest and seemingly saddest person in the room. Complete polar opposites. I never thought my personality was going to take such a huge turn. 

My gay self used to always crush on most quiet girls and would always go and try to make them laugh as a personal achievement. With the first girl I loved, I’d enjoy me acting as the sun and her being more like the moon. It was a rather traumatic experience with her. Now I’ve become that “quiet girl”. And God… how I wish someone would even bother to try making me laugh. How I wish someone would sit by me and tell me stories of their life and I can just quietly listen and nod my head. How I wish I could just have a partner in solitude. I want someone else to make the first move platonically. I’ve been making the first move my whole life and now I’m sick.

I realized I’ve been looking for that on vacation feeling. I’ve been out of abuse for a while now and I found life to be….not exciting. 
I realized that leaving my abusive home situation as a young teen / teen / young adult to spend time with my ex gave me something to look forward to- even if it was for a few hours. We dated for nearly a decade so that vacation feeling has had a lot of time to marinate in my brain. I was more present because I was so excited to leave. I was myself- or who I thought I was at the time. I made memories and life wasn’t so stagnant. 
I’ve been trying to get through this with therapy- I know it’ll be a process. I’ve Giving myself tasks / things to do that bring me joy. However, I’m feeling such a lack of joy, presence and energy because of that search. To the point where leaving the house is exciting due to that period of time currently. I’m much older, I’m in a healthy relationship and I want to be better. I want to feel better. 
I even noticed things being different with my partner. He and I are equal, I don’t rely on him for freedom, happiness or peace. He compliments my life and I’m so lucky. But this feels different- it feels like I don’t love him enough? because I’m not doing that. I do, this love is just nothing I’ve experienced in my life.

A lot of depression, a lot of anxiety, a LOT of stress, a lot of all the grit between them all. All. of. the. time.

when i feel good, i imagine meeting my “boyfriend” and me being the perfect girlfriend to him and the bliss that comes with that, and it helps boost my mood even more.  
today, i noticed i also do the opposite. i’ve been going thru some hard things and gaslighting myself and being hard on myself, not knowing how to let myself feel the weight of the situation. today when i was leaving work i imagined the origin story of my imaginary relationship again, but it turned so dark. there was brutal gang r-word happening to me in my story, and me pushing people in my life away afterward and me spiraling. it was like an automatic imaginary story just generated and i didn’t have control over it, i started tearing up every few minutes bc i really FELT what i was imagining in my head. this kind of thing usually stays with me for a few days. maybe it’s my brains way of making me process emotions i’m too scared to feel? or maybe it’s emotional self harm? like watching gore?? does anyone else experience this?",1679007898.0

We are both queer and considering being on the aromantic spectrum, as well as young and inexperienced so I think we are seeing it more as an opportunity to explore ourselves and our sexualities. I'm fairly certain I don't have any romantic feelings for him, I don't really see the appeal nor have the mental capacity to be in a romantic relationship and he doesn't want one either anyway. We dated a few years ago and I think what I thought back then were romantic feelings was instead just a crippling fear of being alone and feeling abandoned or rejected, I think the way I saw it was that if I was in a relationship with him, I wouldn't have to worry about losing him or doubt that he doesn't like me, which obviously I know now is a toxic mindset to have but I wasn't aware at the time lol. All I care about right now is that he's in my life in one way or another and I'm important to him, anything else we do is just a bonus perk, so we have sex because it's something we enjoy doing together.   
Recently though I've been struggling very much with being super on guard and hypervigilant around him, to a point where it's almost like I'm doubting everything he says and internalizing it to mean he doesn't like me or he's just with me out of pity. It's like I almost can't believe anything else and it makes me feel very guilty because he's done nothing but say and do things that disprove that, and yet I still can't believe him. I feel like I am projecting my own mindset very hard, like I'm assuming what I think he feels is the truth when in reality he's probably thinking nothing like it. I know its coming from a place of low self worth and feeling like I'm a burden and unlovable, but I don't know what steps to take to help let my guard down. I'm scared that at this rate I'm going to self sabotage this relationship do to my own fears. It's very upsetting because I want to be able to love and trust him, but I guess I'm just terrified to, and it's frustrating because it feels like it seemingly came out of no where. I have been very anxiously attached to him in the past, but that started to subside once I found out I had CPTSD. I feel like I was able to trust him before, but I'm also unsure because being anxiously attached often made me doubt if he truly cared about me, but in retrospect I think it was because I wasn't getting the affection I wanted from him which made me feel validated and whole. I was very emotionally dependent on him and sought reassurance a lot and I don't want to fall back into that territory. I'm scared internally maybe I'm still seeing sex as a way to make me feel better about myself, but I want to unlearn that, I want to do it because it's something I like.  
Does anyone have any advice or perspective on what steps to take to start letting my guard down around him and trust him? I am in therapy by the way, so I guess this is something I should touch on there.",1679015601.0

They have suffered neglect, physical, and emotional abuse, and are struggling to cope. Our parents are making minor improvements, but it's not enough for my sibling (understandably so as my parents are bad in many ways), and my sibling is engaging in destructive behaviors.

Their current situation includes substance use (vaping, smoking, using weed and that is it as far as I know but they have not been telling the truth) , hanging out with problematic crowds, skipping school, dropping hobbies, and constantly talking about wanting to leave the house. They feel deeply let down by everyone, are unable to focus on anything constructive, and express that nothing has meaning.

They're in distress, worrying about their own death, our parents fighting, and the possibility of them harming each other. They believe no one cares, no one helps, and everyone wants something from them. They can't see our parents as safe people anymore and feel intense emotional distress. They are the same time also extremely angry, explosive, unwilling to try solutions like therapy or staying in school.

Therapy hasn't been successful, as they refuse to accept help or attend sessions. Due to their trauma, they struggle to open up to anyone or ask for help.

I have tried finding an alternative place for them to stay temporarily and to support emotionally but it is always hitting a wall as they are upset that I cant get them out of there, but we don't have a strong social support system, making leaving the house difficult. Social workers are involved, but they don't seem to be able to make much of a difference.

I'm looking for advice on how to:

1. Keep them from having an explosive relationship with our emotionally immature and unreliable parents.
2. Encourage them to stay in school and pass their classes.
3. Prevent them from imploding (I'd like them to engage in hobbies, hang out with good friends, and continue to have hope).

Any suggestions on alternative forms of therapy or strategies that might work in this situation would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help and support.",1679005238.0

Sometimes when we do talk it's good for a while. I start to self-gaslight and think maybe it's ok. Maybe they are safe.

But no. they always end up saying or doing something that stresses me out and leaves me thinking about it for days or weeks after, sometimes killing my ability to focus. I hate talking to them because I know that I'm going to be for lack of a better word, disabled, afterwards. So it's like I have to plan it around when I'm ok with having my mind ruined for a while. 

They say ""why don't you call more"" as if they've ever actually accepted the explanations when I did give them. I stopped trying years ago. I guess I have to live with the guilt of being ""confrontation-avoidant"", in addition to other ways they've told me since I was a baby that my personality is bad and wrong, because what is the point of confrontation if it doesn't actually do anything and only ruins my week or month.

Since one of my parents had a lot of loss in their life their personality changed. They haven't screamed at me in years. But I'm still always waiting for it. They feel like a volcano to me. Dormant, but for how long?

I learned young that I can't rely on them at all for any kind of mental, emotional or health support.

My ex parents (I refer to them as my ex parents because I don't see them as my parents anymore) abused me. My ex mom is a narcissist and she made my life miserable.

My ex uncle s*xually abused me, my former teacher s*xually abused me and my ex parents didn't protect me from any of it! I have a suspicion that Melody (ex mom) had something to do with the abuse from my uncle. The nature of the abuse from him was complicated. To make a long story short inappropriate pictures were taken of me and I don't know what he did with them, but I do wonder who was paid for them.

I don't know how much my brother knows about my uncle. I tried to tell him because he just had a little baby and I wanted to let him know that he needs to be careful around that particular family member with his little girl. And he just completely dismissed me. He acted like I didn't even say anything and when I pressed the matter he brushed it under the rug.

I wonder if what happened with him was an open secret. I tried to tell my ex dad about it because he had grandchildren and my ex dad's word for word response was, ""Well he only has one little one left."" (This was before my brother's daughter was born).

Anyways, I drunk texted my brother last night and we got to talking. We didn't talk about anything too deep. I sent him pictures of my and my husband's new house and I think he was really impressed.

Earlier today he and I were talking and he said he was proud of me. I feel conflicted about that. I didn't do anything to earn the house. That was all my husband's doing. I am disabled and I can't work a normal job. So my husband has been supporting me 100% and I am so lucky and thankful to him. He went into a very lucrative field which allows me to focus on writing.

He didn't say he was proud of me because I have nine published works out. He didn't say he was proud of me because I use my stories to try to expose my abusers and help other people who are going through something similar. My books aren't memoirs. A lot of people get confused when I try to explain. They are horror-romance fiction books with vampires, zombies and werewolves. I incorporated real life events that happened to me in the narrative. I wrote a dedication to one of my abusers saying that I'm not ashamed of what happened to me and he is the one at fault.

He didn't tell me he was proud of me for anything I did really. He told me he was proud of me because I have a house with my husband.

It just doesn't feel like I earned it. And it feels shallow. My ex family is always been wealthy and really values material things. I feel weird because I've wanted this for so long but it just feels empty.

I don't think it would feel as empty if he had read my books or seen reviews or how my books have impacted people and said he was proud of me for that. I don't think it would have felt as hollow if he told me he was proud of me for how much I was healing. But no. He's proud of me because I live in a nice house with an impressive backyard and pool because my husband has a good job.

I wish he was proud of something I actually did. I have a lot of mixed emotions about this.

The house isn't big but it's not small either. 3 bed, 2 bath and it's built in kind of a U shape around this really cool pool area. So I also feel like kind of a fraud because I don't know if he thinks I'm living in a huge mansion. Maybe I'm just being paranoid.",1678995247.0

So I’m 35 years old and I’ve been diagnosed with severe depression (MDD) that is treatment resistant, I’ve tried multiple antidepressants (now at 200 mg Zoloft) but nothing works. I’m in pure agony every day and (TW) I’m suicidal and feel defeated. I don’t want to die, but I can’t continue like this, crying every day and basically suffering nonstop. 

I’m in weekly therapy (and I’m seeing a psych every two months) and my therapist talks a lot about my trauma, about how I’m traumatized… but I haven’t been diagnosed with CPTSD because it’s not something people in my country knows about, since it’s not in “official” in here. I always feel like it makes sense in my particular case, but yesterday I read that people with CPTSD don’t have abandonment issues, which is basically my “only” problem. Is this true? They say that it’s more common in borderline personality disorder, but I don’t fit the diagnosis, I believe. Or maybe?

Basically, I have childhood (and mostly adolescent) trauma, and also in the last 6 years I’ve been abandoned by all my friends and my partner. I’ve lost all my friends, and I can’t seem to overcome this. Every day I feel like it’s the first day after being left alone, and I can’t stop ruminating about it, even if it’s been years. I just cry and hope they come back. It makes no sense, I’ve tried it all, but it’s like my mind can’t process these losses, at all. I feel so crazy, so so so lonely and feel like it’s all my fault and I’m unlovable and toxic and a terrible person. It's been 6 years with my partner and I still want to vomit when someone says his same or tells me about him. I'm the craziest person alive. My childhood trauma is basically neglect, being abandoned/neglected by both my parents and watching (and sometimes experimenting) psychological and emotional violence.

I’ve always started shaking from anxiety when someone calls me out, belittles me, or just straight up downvotes me on something I’m genuinely curious about or have something insightful to say. It’s like a punishment. And punishment is all I knew. I hate when I actually try or want to do good and I’m downvoted or someone tells me off. 

I’m now in my 30’s and it has been this way for decades. Started when I got online on deviant art and live journal. I panic and I mean panic. I shake like alcoholic withdrawal when someone is mean to me. It feels like the end of world.  Sometimes I will have a panic attack and that negative comment or downvote will haunt me all day, put me in a flight or fight response and I snap at family members and co workers all day. 

Either exposure hasn’t worked or I’m doing it wrong or is there a chance social media just isn’t for me? I don’t have anything except Reddit where I ask questions but Im wondering if its possible I’m just overly sensitive and it’s best I should l avoid things like that altogether since I cannot overcome/triumph my fear of rejection? 

I chose to ask this here rather than self improvement or no surf because I know this issue is from my abusive childhood. It’s not about “manning up” or “pull myself up by the bootstraps”. I have tried. I’m just not sure if I need a different type exposure therapy or I’m just the person who cannot handle the negatives of social media. 

I can tell myself all sorts of things like they’re no bodies, it won’t affect me directly, could be a troll, but I’ve been trying for over 20 years and nothing has worked. It’s like my brain will not listen to my soul; they’re two separate entities. 

Has anyone experienced this, overcame it or has to cut it off? 

I’m also going thru a bit of weed withdrawal - trying to get my life on track so I’m sorry if this was a bit aggravated. I’m definitely feeling more anxious than usual but any suggestions and support is appreciated.

E: Thank you for the the wonderful answers. All of you had something insightful for me to think about and it really reemphasized how much healing I’m gonna have to work through.

I'm experiencing really traumatic, fatal situations every night and it's making me super stressed and feeling not well rested during the day. For example, one night I was in a fatal car accident. Another night, I was in a high rise as it was actively imploding. As a lot of you probably relate, often, I feel sleep is my only reprieve from all the tough stuff I struggle with daily.

And it shows how they connect, heal, communicate with each other. I've just never seen a show that is so closely linked to healing trauma. it's like what the show is all about.

I never learned healthy communication when faced with conflict, so I figured I'd ask here what in your experience would be an appropriate response.

Please only serious replies!

At work, I'm facing a technical issue, so I used our ticketing system to ask for help.

One person replied directly in our chat system and spent an hour with me yesterday to help diagnose this. He seemed to care. We did not fix it but track it down to a cause before we ran out of time.

Today, the same person referred me to their office hours (i.e. 1 hour out of the day once per week during which they will be available to anyone with questions).

So I basically need to wait a week before I can join this office hour and MAYBE get chosen to talk to this person (since there will likely be multiple people in chat) and MAYBE get a few more minutes of their time - when yesterday one hour wasn't enough.

I understand that a person in his position is bound to be busy, but this response seems both uncaring and in extreme conflict to the help they provided yesterday.

My ""automatic"" response is one of passive-aggressiveness, along the lines of ""Well, I guess I won't get any help and will have to do this on my own..."" - which is the truth when it comes down to it.

But I'm sure there HAVE to be better responses...

I could say ""You know, I feel a bit confused and hurt by this sudden change"" - but while this may be healthy for ME to express my feelings, I have yet to see anything useful come of doing this...

Can you provide with a few examples of what could be healthy responses to this situation and this person?

My parents really helped me and I opened up and tears of bottling up emotions came out and it took about a year, but I began to feel happy and relaxed, something I hadn’t felt since a young teenager.

I excelled in my career, found some ‘genuine’ friends, found a girl whom I thought was the love of my life, found respect from my family and colleagues.I felt amazing, untouchable, confident, carefree and above all else happy with life and myself.

This continued for about 8 months, until I got a new position in another company. Initially things went well, but my collègues were heavy drinkers and one night invited me to go out with them.

I initially said no, then yes and then my girlfriend rang telling me she wanted to spend the evening FaceTiming. So I told my collègues no.

One collègue in particular, the ‘ring leader’, became really irritated with me, shouted at me and slammed the door in my face. (We we’re in shared accommodation). Everyone followed her to go out.

From that moment I felt like my whole headspace collapsed. I felt my confidence drain away from me, I felt cold and I felt my world get very small.

I spent the evening in some sort of anxiety lockdown where I couldn’t think and my muscles started to tense up, it was like being back to how I was before addressing my anxiety and depression.

My relationship with my new colleagues deteriorated and I ended up quitting. My relationship with my girlfriend deteriorated and we finished it. My friends stopped calling. My confidence and happiness disappeared. 

The world seems cold now, I don’t feel a part of it, I don’t feel connected to anyone and feel like everyone is a threat.

I have no desire to make friends, although I know deep down that’s what I want.

I feel angry, dead inside, self loathing, bitter and frustrated and just want to wake up feeling stable, hopeful and with self love again.

I try everyday, I’m back at my old job where things were going well, yet my old friends/collègues don’t really interact with me anymore. I’m treated like an outsider, maybe because they can see how depressed I am, even though I try to hide it.

She said that a lot of children who were neglected fantasize as a way of having hope.

I realized my fantasy growing up was this:
That my mom was actually my aunt or something. And that my real mom was out there looking for me. And that there would be a day when we were reunited and she would tell me how much she loved me and that she would never leave me again.

But now I have to officially tell myself: “She’s not coming. She is already here. Your mother is who she is and it’s good that she has improved and you just gotta love her where she’s at.”

809,How do you cope with physical symptoms?,5,11sohii,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11sohii/how_do_you_cope_with_physical_symptoms/,3,"I experience a lot of physical symptoms. 

I'm tired a lot of the time. I have a lot of headaches and sometimes 'episodes' where I'm extremely nauseous and have a bad headache, short of breath. When that happens I usually lie down in bed and put on a podcast and try to fall asleep. I have a weighted blanket that helps. 

A lot of the time I feel immense physical restlessness, I think that's the worst. I can't do anything, I can't sit still, can't focus and can't relax. Recently those times have started to spiral into more like panic/anxiety attacks where I can't catch my breath. 

I really don't know how to cope with those moments.

I live in 'care', I have my own appartement but there is a small office with staff 24/7 in the building so I can reach out for support. But they can't help me much, they're trained to do things like help me plan my day, get groceries, practical things like that. But they don't really understand what goes om when I'm feeling so physically stressed and uncomfortable and I tend to have to explain what's going on because there's often new employees, and explaining everything ends up with me being asked about my life story which is obviously not going to help me feel better.

What also doesn't help is that I've been in 'therapy' since I was a young child and I've never had proper treatment. Always just conversations that lead to nothing. I'm 21 now and still haven't had any therapy with a plan, not even CBT or something like that. Recently just any time I feel really bad I also feel like I will never get better. I know the moment will pass but I also know I will feel awful again within a few hours, or tomorrow or next week. I know that's not a helpful thought but it's starting to feel really endless. So I'm not just experiencing my CPTSD but also this feeling of hopelessness of getting better. I know I need professional help but there doesn't seem to be any available.

815,'Strategic Detachment' as a survival mechanism for heroic children who survive adverse childhoods,51,11s4i5m,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11s4i5m/strategic_detachment_as_a_survival_mechanism_for/,13,"I was reading ""The Six Pillars of Self Esteem"" by Nathaniel Branden. It's an older book but pretty good. I read this part of the book and it hit close to home. I was wondering if anyone else could relate with this, and if there is a different term for this ""Strategic Detachment.""

""Strategic Detachment: Many children undergo experiences that place enormous obstacles in the way of the development of self-esteem. Everyone knows this. A child may find the world of parents and other adults incomprehensible and threatening. The self is not nurtured but attacked. The will to be conscious and efficacious is assaulted. After a number of unsuccessful attempts to understand adult policies, statements, and behavior, many children give up—and take the blame for their feelings of helplessness.

Often they sense, miserably, desperately, and inarticulately, that something is terribly wrong—with their elders, or with themselves, or with something. What they often come to feel is: “I’ll never understand other people. I’ll never be able to do what they expect of me. I don’t know what’s right or wrong, and I’m never going to know.” To persevere with the will to understand in the face of obstacles is the heroism of consciousness.

The heroic child who continues to struggle to make sense out of the world and the people in it, however, is developing a powerful source of strength, no matter what the anguish or bewilderment experienced along the way. Caught in a particularly cruel, frustrating, and irrational environment, he or she will doubtless feel alienated from many of the people in the immediately surrounding world, and legitimately so. But the child will not feel alienated from reality, will not feel, at the deepest level, incompetent to live—or at least he or she has a decent chance to avoid that fate. To persevere with the will to understand in the face of obstacles is the heroism of consciousness.

Often children who survive extremely adverse childhoods have learned a particular survival strategy. I call it “strategic detachment.” This is not the withdrawal from reality that leads to psychological disturbance, but an intuitively calibrated disengagement from noxious aspects of their family life or other aspects of their world. They somehow know, This is not all there is. They hold the belief that a better alternative exists somewhere and that someday they will find their way to it. They persevere in that idea. They somehow know Mother is not all women, Father is not all men, this family does not exhaust the possibilities of human relationships—there is life beyond this neighborhood. This does not spare them suffering in the present, but it allows them not to be destroyed by it. Their strategic detachment does not guarantee that they will never know feelings of powerlessness, but it helps them not to be stuck there.

We admire such children. But as parents we would like to offer our own children happier options.―        Nathaniel Branden"" Full book: [https://www.booksfree.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/The-Six-Pillars-of-Self-Esteem-by-Nathaniel-Branden.pdf](https://www.booksfree.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/The-Six-Pillars-of-Self-Esteem-by-Nathaniel-Branden.pdf)

This really hit home for me, I relate with it on a very deep level. When I was 5-6 years old my father became very abusive. (there's actually a dateline episode on him that i was in!) He was doing all sorts of messed up stuff and my mom thought he was gonna kill her (he went on to kill a policeman in Montana). We had to leave my half-brothers with him which saddened me; my family was shattered. around the time i turned 7 i resolved that i would grow up to be a good father and husband and make my family my #1 priority, be loyal to them and contribute to society. I had friends who had that good life, and their parents told me I was smart and could go to college and would do well in the military if i joined. I knew that I was going to have a better life than the single parent section 8 housing we had to live in because my father refused to pay support. I went to Iraq, became the first to graduate college in my family line, went to Mexico to teach English, and I moved around the US to climb my career ladder.

People tell me often that I'm very brave, However, I'm pretty sure I suffer from arrested development. I've been on psych meds since i got home from iraq in 2005. I sometimes react to things as if I were a little kid. I also give off a child vibe to kids. Children I don't know will often speak to me like I'm a fellow child, and I enjoy playgrounds with my kids like I'm a child as well.

I guess I wanted to ask if anyone can relate with this and if they've found a way to overcome this arrested development. I'll be 40 this year and i'm just trying to be the best me I can be.

I once had about two solid months of happiness, when everything had clicked into place and I honestly thought I had found my way to a solid life, that my good karma was finally coming due...and then it all came crashing down without warning. And the rest of the year was hard.

There have been varying degrees of difficulty. I'm doing better than I was a few years ago, overall. But I'm still having a hard year.

Some people have offered me vital support in dark times, and I'm deeply grateful. But those same people tend to disappear sooner or later. I haven't found anyone who stuck around continuously and indefinitely.

I've worked very hard to find healing. I've read a lot of books, seen a lot of therapists, and done a lot of journaling. [I've written about what I've learned](https://old.reddit.com/user/moonrider18/comments/83c7k2/some_of_the_best_posts_ive_written/), and I'm proud of that. I've also done a *lot* to help others one-on-one (which has an upside and a downside, as I tend to exhaust myself helping other people).

I have financial advantages that many other people could hardly dream of. (Though I'm not yet healthy enough to work a full-time job.)

All those details and caveats aside, though...the last twenty years have all been hard years.

And honestly, life was pretty hard even before that. I learned to hate myself when I was nine years old. =(",1678942931.0

I’ve been educating myself a lot about CPTSD in the last year after reading Stephanie Foo’s What My Bones Know and identifying a lot with her story. 
Before reading it, my therapist said I have relational trauma, and after reading this book I tried asking if he thinks I have CPTSD but I got a little nervous and wasn’t the most direct, and he didn’t say no, just that I have relational trauma again. In another session where he learned more about my mom (who he’s described as a narcissist), he described her experiences as complex trauma.

So I’m wondering, what is the difference between relational trauma and CPTSD? 

And then also looking for advice: should I try to broach the subject of a CPTSD diagnosis again with my therapist? I think the thought of having a diagnosis would give me some comfort, but I also don’t want to needlessly pathologize myself, if that makes sense? 

I’d appreciate any thoughts or insight!

I feel like everything I do will be an inexplicable way for me to 'run' from my childhood but no matter what I do everything leads me back to those awful years at that house. 

I am able to avoid it with social interaction but the minute I am by myself with time to think I realise how different and isolated I am due to my experiences. I am so alone and I am so alien. I don't think I was meant to develop outside of that house. Sometimes I think I would be better off stuck in that endless cycle of terror, because the day to day unfamiliarity and the constant explosion of obligations and expectations is too much for me.

I don't know I think I've freaked myself out. Either way I feel like everything I do leads back to me sitting in that house and wondering if I'll even survive. I wasn't programmed for anything outside of sheer survival.",1678930131.0

Today, at 32 years old, I made my first ever dental appointment. I actually cried at the end of my phone call with the dentists office. My mom was a teenage mom and had two infants by age 18. Me and my brother. My dad was murdered a few weeks after my brother was born so my mom was alone with two children. My life from there included my grandmother who was very involved in our lives- she lived with us. My mom was very young and she had a lot of growing up to do and was rarely there for us. She ended up in an abusive relationship that my brother and I also suffered the consequences of. She later had my sister with the abuser. I have significant childhood trauma and as a result of that I have struggled to do many things for myself in my life. My mom never had health insurance for us growing up and when she did finally get it for my sister and brother, I was already 18. She never took me to a dentist and I have had lots of problems with my teeth as a result. I do forgive her and know she was a kid herself, but it does bother me that she didn’t take care of me the way she should have especially now that I have my own child. I have never told anyone that I’ve never been to the dentist as it causes me extreme shame especially because I am an adult and have been for a while. I choked up today saying it out loud to the person over the phone. She told me she was proud of me for taking that step.

I was beat up and hit by kids older than me, one even videoed it and sent it around and you could see me crying in the video. I was pushed in lakes and threatened with knives. I was constantly put down, told how ugly I am and how worthless I am, it was made clear how inadequate I must be.

This has crippled me now in my adult life. I am terrified of dating and rejection. If a girl rejects me it causes me to spiral and flashback to feeling like a disgusting and inferior boy.

I’ll be 30 later this year. And I can’t believe how old and burnt out I feel. I feel so sad and fatigued. and totally overwhelmed. i don’t have a job right now, and I don’t think I have it in me to get back into my healing business after this sabbatical I’ve taken. Especially when I barely have the energy to do simple tasks like make coffee sometimes, let alone help someone else in their own healing.

I think I derived so much of my self worth through external accomplishments, because academics were the only thing I had control over in my turbulent home.

Now I feel this emptiness when I try to take steps professionally. Nothing is sticking or feels fulfilling. I’ve toyed with the idea of grad school, a course in coding, etc. nothing is really lighting me up (yet). I can’t even focus on my screen long enough to update my resume.

When I look at the state of the collective right now, I’m so overwhelmed. **how do people like us that fall apart survive financially in an increasingly capitalistic, dehumanizing world?** For those of us who had passion as our driving force out of impossible circumstances, what do we do when we can’t summon the fire?

He’s my biggest support in the world and I love him dearly. He’s always been so caring about my trauma responses especially when we’re intimate. No questions asked, always goes to my care plan and takes care of me and helps me navigate the situation. Not to get too detailed but I have only rather recently gotten confirmation about actually being traumatized in a specific way by my father if you catch my drift. My fiancé used to coincidentally wear the same boxers as my father and he threw them away and bought new ones when I got triggered by them without me even having to ask. Something that has come up again in our relationship is my fiancé wanting to shave his head. He’s a young man and has a receding hair line. It’s always bothered him and he gets a lot of hate for it. He wants to shave it to help with his confidence. I am a full believer in a person expressing their style,their body and hair the way they choose. I dress very alternative and he supports me in that which I appreciate. The issue lies in the fact that my father has a shaved head, and I don’t think I will be able to be intimate with my fiancé if I even slightly associate those two things. To make things more complicated, my fiancé is a marine. We see each other in person very rarely. I want him to shave his head and help with his confidence if that’s what he wants to do. Does anyone have any advice or wisdom on this situation. I will be consulting with my therapist of course, but I thought it might be good to hear from some peers to see if anyone had dealt with a partner innocently triggering them on accident. I love my fiancé and I want to support him. I told him that if he wants to shave his head I support him and will love him no matter what. But I’m not so secretly scared about what feelings might arise within me. I want to move on with my life and not let my father keep having power over me. But of course it’s not that simple.

I don't have any friends really aside from some online friends but they barely even talk to me anyways. Also one of them recently randomly invited themselves to my place. Like bought plane tickets without planning with me or even asking if it was ok and proceeded to SA me so that's one less friend.

I haven't had a boyfriend in a long time either and the last one was in another country and was a super fucked up situation all around. Stress from that triggered my first bipolar manic episode so yayyyyy. I have decided no more long distance relationships which severely limits my pool of possible bfs.

List of reasons I don't feel good enough:
I am 100+ lbs over a healthy weight. I constantly call myself fat and ugly but don't see it changing anytime soon. Last time I tried to diet it took 8 months to lose 25 lbs and I was miserable the whole time. I also have a type and am not attracted to fat guys. I struggle with sex as it is so I really need someone I am attracted to. I know it may be vain but it is what it is

I don't really clean and since I have been working from home due to COVID I have only been showering once a week so that at least I look clean for my therapist. I never go anywhere anyways. I also only brush my teeth when I shower so ya. I leave food and trash around and due to that have litteral clouds of fruit flies that you can hear swarming in my apartment.

I also don't cook. My microwave caught on fire and my oven won't heat up and due to the mess and bug infestation I haven't gotten maintenance up here to fix it. It's been this way for months and I'm just too ashamed and feel no amount of cleaning I do will ever be good enough. Even if my appliances were in working order though I still wouldn't cook cuz my abusive single dad I lived with never taught me shit and didn't let me do shit so I don't really know how. I just get all my meals delivered.

I also hate driving. I'm 29, going to be 30 in June and just got my license last year. Driving makes me extremely anxious. I actually haven't used my car in months cuz I'm WFH and didn't have anywhere I wanted to go bad enough.My car actually needs a new battery now. I used to Uber everywhere but now that I have my own car I find myself going places less than before because I'm afraid to drive but feel I have to if I want to go anywhere now because otherwise it defeats the purpose of having a car.

Only thing I have going for me really is my career as a game developer but I don't think that is enough for people to overlook these other issues.

I am a perfectionist and have a habit of putting men I like on pedestals and thinking they deserve  the very best and so could never like me/I could never be good enough for them.

I'm not sure if I want biological children because of my genetics and because I have 0 pain tolerance but I feel like the choice is quickly being taken away from me. One of my boyfriend's I dated for five years and he not once brought up marriage so how am I supposed to find someone who will accept me, date, get married, and have a kid before I can't?

I brought up the topic of not feeling good enough to my therapist at our last session and she just said to do something that makes me feel good enough. I told her nothing I can do will and she didn't really have anything to say.

TRIGGER WARNING ⚠️ Descibe some physical abuse. 

They say we're empath/empathetic, and some folks claim it is a gift and we must cherish it. To me, it is NOT a gift. The only reason I'm impacted by the mood of others is because of the household I grew up in, with a moody parent. When they were in a good mood, all of us should be in the same mood. When they were in a bad one, all of us should be too. If they were in an even worse mood, I knew I would have a heck of a day trying to survive without having their wrath unleashed on me, because when that happened, I knew what was coming. Either I was getting a beating, or one of my siblings, and that was horrifying enough because when they would scream and cry, none of us could have done anything to stop it. So NO! It is not a gift that I'm able to read people's moods, and it is even a curse that I'm that easily impacted by them. It is not fair to me, and it is not fair to them either. People around me, including my partner, should be able to be in whatever mood they're in, without having me come in into the picture and start feeling down too, and that only makes them feel bad about it, which makes me feel even worse because who the hell am I to tell them how to feel and what mood to be in? How is it that now they're comforting me when it is supposed to be the other way around, me comforting them or even just letting them be? 

Please help, because I can't handle this anymore. I can't be this easily influenced by the mood of those around me and start acting accordingly.

Or maybe they don't?

I overthink it because I don't want to upset people, or be alienating

One example: when I moved in with a friend and a new girl, me and her were getting along and watching shows together a lot and kind of talking through them. This was usually in the evenings. I'm more quiet within the first 30 min of waking up. I told her that. Also one day we were watching things and I felt like SHIT. I told her that earlier, and reiterated that on the couch (I was curled up with heating pad, etc.) And so I was much less talkative but wasn't bothered by her usual commentary, I was just less reactive because I was tired and a little grumpy from pain (at life, not her).

I overheard her telling our other roommate that ""she doesn't know what to expect with me"" and that ""I'm a different person everyday"".

It was hurtful, and this isn't the first time I've heard this.

Ik because of trauma I have a fawn response and can be people pleasing, however I felt like I've gotten so much better, and wasn't masking, was being real by saying ""I'm quiet when I first wake up"" or ""I'm not feeling well"".  Do people maintain being bubbly and happy when they are sick? Do I maybe have DID??? (ik no one on here can answer this lol) sometimes I can also mirror when I'm anxious, again, been way better woth that. Also sometimes my ""accent"" fluctuates, but I live somewhere not where I grew up with a very different way that people say things for about 8 years, and when I hear someone with my home accent, or I get a little passionate, my home accent gets stronger is this abnormal? 

I have no idea how my personality changes, but I do know my *mood* changes quickly some days. I try to be communicative as fuck when that happens, though I do tend to shut down sometimes and verbal communication becomes very difficult. In those situations I try to express that I need some time to decompress.  Sometimes the only thing I can do is open my mouth and make a hand gesture.    I hate that, but it is what it is. I've also gotten a lot better about that! 

So has anyone else been told they have multiple personalities? What is the difference of mood and personality? I've looked it up but am still confused.  Are people just being mean? I don't always pick up on bullying. And I do become more withdrawn when triggered but I've learned a lot of skills and have been able to utilize them pretty well over the last few years or so!  Are people just hypercritical because they dont/won't understand me or am ""HI, it's me, I'm the problem it's me""?

I can also be super duper shy when I meet someone for the first time, and open up at different paces depending on how much I start to trust someone i also feel like i tell people that ""im sometimes really shy at first, but ill warm up"". Like i FEEL like i spell things out for people but still get ostracized(maybe too dramatic but feels like it!!)

The idea of leaving everything for someone else feels me with dread. This is because in childhood and worklife, I was punished for not taking care of things that shouldn't have been my responsibility. 

This arose because others were lazy or felt the need to shift responsibility. And now I can get anxious, about things that others should do or help with...",1678927312.0

Today, I had a piece of thread tangle, and it got me thinking. It took a lot of patience and time to untangle it. I found myself getting frustrated, but reminding myself that frustration wouldn't help me. I had to take my time and untangle each piece very carefully, to avoid them breaking. 

Our brains are like that. Chaos, trauma, abuse, they leave them a tangled mess, and the only way to heal is to carefully pull at each thread. And frustration with those tangles - ourselves - can keep us from actually working through the tangles. 

Be patient and kind to yourself as you work on untangling those knots. Seriously, I mean it. Take breaks, be gracious with yourself when you need them. This is such a hard thing to heal from, and it's never your fault that it's so hard. 

You are enough. Right now, today, wherever you are in your healing journey, you are enough ❤️",1678922393.0

I was her FP most of my life and had a lot of shit with that and with her spiral into alcoholism. My dad also used to have some anger issues and their divorce was messy af. Ny mom passed when I was a teenager. I've always thought most of my trauma stemmed from that stuff, including the fact that as a kid I would go looking for validation from older men online and would show them things I shouldn't which has a lot of trauma and guilt attached to it. Recently though, I decided to have kinky sex with a guy I was getting to know. Anytime I've had sex previously I feel like I've gotten anxious and basically just dissociated, but with this it was worse. I started crying and went between feeling like I was out of my body and being very present just wishing it would end. The guy did nothing wrong, the second I used the agreed upon word he stopped, I just honestly had those awful anxious feelings before it even started and went through with it anyway because I felt like I had to (not his fault, totally on me). I'm now getting pieces of what I think are repressed memories of sexual abuse from my grandfather. I know he was abusive towards my mom and her siblings (it's why she had the issues she did) and I vividly remember times where he physically harmed me, but these memories are new and I'm not sure if they're true. I'm not sure if I'm just creating them in my head to somehow make things make sense or if I truly have repressed memories that are now making their way to the surface as I'm having awful reactions and feelings connected to them. I'm a mess right now trying to cope with this and I don't want to talk to anyone because I don't want to say it and then be a liar if it's not true.

It brought up a lot of feelings, mostly guilt. Guilt that my brother is feeling bad about being in the middle (even though I told him to let me handle it and refuse her, especially because she has a whole ass husband/ my dad who is not blocked to go through, who thankfully doesn't give enough of a shit to ever try to talk to me), and that familiar guilt that maybe I'm bad for cutting her off. 

As we on this sub know, NC is not a decision made lightly and a lot of my lifelong trauma is from her. I still cry about some of the things she did to me. She had infinite chances and proved to me every time she wouldn't change. I know I made the right choice...

... but the guilt is eating me. I have a support system who will tell me I'm right and it's okay, but they love me so much and my brain is interpreting it as bias.

So someone, please, tell me I am right. Tell me I am not a bad person for cutting her out. Tell me I'm not bad for wanting nothing from her or nothing to do with her. Please...

I'm just so tired, I've lost everything good in my life, usually whenever something like this happens I make another suicide attempt but every attempt I've made has failed so I stopped since all that would happen is I'd be in immeasurable pain but for some reason I just would not die no matter how hard I tried or what method I did, I'm so tired of living like this, I'm absolutely miserable but I know I can't use death as a way to escape, I don't have anyone I'm close to to talk to, I don't have any form of comfort, I've been thinking of buying a sword and cuddling it because the only time I ever feel safe is when I have a weapon with me because nobody was ever there for me nobody stood between me and my abusers fits of rage so I had to learn to defend myself and being smaller and weaker than others since I was a preterm baby weapons became an equalizer since it didn't matter how big and tough someone was compared to me weapons didn't care so weapons became a comfort object for me. And another thing is I have haphephobia or the fear of being touched, after my parents made me strip down ass naked as my father beat me to a pulp I eventually grew to loathe any kind of physical contact that came from others even if it was a high five or a handshake the thought of someone touching me made me feel a mixture of fear anger and disgust and I hate it, I see everyone with romantic partners and I both crave it but I'm also repulsed by it, I want to be loved by another and held but I'm afraid of being hurt by someone I thought I could trust and be open with and the only ""relationship"" I've ever been in was when I was being forced to date I girl because a guy who was a creep and a pervert shipped me and the girl for some reason and the guy even wrote fake letters to me pretending to be the girl but one of my friends who had the guy in his classes when he was in middle school told me that the hand writing was the guy's and not the girls, and after about 3 to 4 months of this I broke up with the girl saying that I didn't have any romantic feelings for her but had no problems with being friends if she doesn't mind and we could just put all the weirdness behind us which she agreed but for some reason after I broke up with her I started feeling like I was being an asshole despite both of us agreeing to just be friends, after everything was sorted out the guy still tried making me date the girl but I've already been through enough of his nonsense and I've already got out of the whole mess and I was in no mood to go back into it so I stopped interacting with the guy all together. Also in middle school there was a girl who was honestly very kind and caring towards me and even whenever I went into a depressive episode she stayed by my side through it even when I had no idea what depression was since nobody ever taught anything about mental health in school, she never asked anything out of me for her help, she never put her hands on me, she never verbally assaulted me or called me slurs because of my autism, and I think I might have developed a crush on her but I'm not sure since I've never been taught about feelings and would like someone's thoughts, these were the typical feelings that I had (I loved her smile, I loved hearing her laugh, I really enjoyed spending time with her even if it was just talking, I enjoyed that we had a lot in common, and when we were at the graduation ceremony I got dressed in some dress clothes that I wore to plenty of funerals and she was wearing a dress and all I could think about was how great she looked in the dress.) And ever since I went into high school it felt like something was missing or like there was a hole inside me and I didn't understand it. And now I feel so alone, I feel like I have nothing to live for or give myself to, I don't have any dreams because I was never allowed any form of individually and I had to do what my parents wanted me to do even if it made me miserable, I have no goals in life besides just survive, I don't know who I am beyond my trauma, I feel like I have no identity beyond angry bitter and broken, I just want to be fixed, I just want to be happy, I just want peace and quiet, I'm tired of being angry all the time, I don't know if I could go on like this because this isn't living this is is just torture, breaking someone down to nothing over and over again until there's nothing left to break.",1678938803.0

I've developed auditory sensitivity from the events, and barely remember anything about the child abuse one. When I think or feel like I'm in the same events again, I panic.

That while he were on break he dated someone but he said he wished it was me. That I encouraged him to go slow in our relationship. I thought I made it all up. I couldn't believe I got the wrong message when he said he never meant those things. I blamed myself for everything for years.

I hate how I posses things. It feels as if it's all happening again and I don't know how I should react to it until it hurts too much causing it to spill out, even if it's normal things.

TW: S.A. AND POTENTIAL AB\*SE

This is not my main account. I’m just using it for privacy.

I never really lacked anything as a child. I went to school, lived with my family, and we went on vacations several times during my childhood. However, my family was incredibly dysfunctional.

My parents divorced when I was maybe 3. I can’t remember how old I was, and tbh, I can barely even remember them being together. However, I do have a few distant and faded memories of going places with both my parents, and even one of waking up in between both of them as they slept. But my father was an alcoholic, and physically abused my mother in front of me, to the point of her needing medical help. I don’t remember this happening, despite being there, but it did.

Around the same time--maybe some time later--I was seeing what I later in life realized was a therapist for children. I would go, and sit in the room full of toys, often accompanied by my mother, and the therapist would have me look at flash cards or ask about things. This continued for a little while, and I think I was four by the time I stopped seeing her.

We had moved, as well, around this time. My mom’s bf was living with us now. I was too young to really understand why. I don’t have a whole lot of clear memories from around this time, but I do remember, several times, being really really upset or angry and screaming, and then being locked in the bathroom, sometimes with the lights off. I’d of course scream and beat the door--I think most kids would. Later on I would be told about my “really bad tantrums”, and how I was so uncontrollable that my mom’s bf had locked me in the bathroom. My mother would also frequently spank me, sometimes even with my pants down.

I hated that man. I don’t know what triggered it but I didn’t like him. He was my first bully. He would call me the same names and say the same things as the mean kids at school would. It would of course make me freak out at him, being a kid. But he was always, always in the right, somehow. According to my mom I was just supposed to ignore him. In my view, my now stepdad had stolen her from me.

Life at school hadn’t been easy either. I was now in grade school, and I wasn’t understanding assignments. I would cry every day before school, say things about how I was stupid and couldn’t learn, until I was pulled out and sent to a different school. A smaller one.

I didn’t enjoy school. Every day, when I got into the car, I’d cry, or else be upset. I didn’t always know why at the time. This is important for later, I promise.

Over time, I developed extremely bad social anxiety. I would be completely unable to go in public--really, beyond my own front yard--and be comfortable with it. I was put in therapy for it, which my stepdad started to make fun of. Things were awful for me around that time--I didn’t even eat before leaving the house, because my anxiety would quite literally make me sick, and embarrass me, which in turn triggered more anxiety.

I was also being S-A’d by my mom’s husband around this point. He’d teach me how to do things, and I’d do them despite sometimes crying. This eventually led to him taking my virginity when I had just recently turned 15--I had sent photos to a boy, and mentioned to him that I had put a hair brush up myself. My parents found the texts and I got in huge trouble. My stepdad decided that would be the time, since in his words, the hair brush had already taken it. This continued for years.

During a fight with my mother in my late teens, she basically blurted out that I had Asperger’s syndrome. I was shocked. I think I cried but I don’t remember to be perfectly honest. It turns out, the therapist I had seen as a toddler diagnosed me. I felt betrayed and horrified. But both she and my stepdad insist that this was to “protect” me.

I wasn’t protected. I wasn’t made to “think less of myself” as they claimed they wanted me not to do. I lived with my bully and my abuser. I felt like something was wrong with me, even asking a few times if I was autistic and being told I wasn’t. Even typing all this out makes me want to punch my screen, I am so angry. The “horrible tantrums” that made me get locked in the bathroom. The fact that I was “weird”, or “annoying”, or “overreacted” to things, or “obsessed” with certain things, or the fact that I was always “screaming” in the car after school. How “spoiled” I was as a child--after all, why else would I have “tantrums”? I’ve been doing more research lately and I realize that all the supposed flaws I had as a child were autistic traits. It’s no wonder I have confidence issues. No wonder I developed anxiety and depression. No wonder I probably have PTSD.

I’m sorry. I am just so, so, so, angry. I’m grieving the fact that I grew up without a crucial piece of info about myself. I always thought something was off. Would things have been better if I knew? I really think so. But now I’m in my early 20s and I feel like I’m starting from scratch.",1678907018.0

I started laughing about them. The doctor seemed shocked at the stuff I had been through. Told me, ""You would have never known you have been through that, but it's not normal to laugh about the things you have been through."" I, of course, looked at him like, huh? And said, ""Um.. if I don't laugh about it, imma cry about it."" I immediately felt as if I was  stupid or wrong for having a coping mechanism that was different.. It's been a week, and this conversation hasn't left my mind... 

does anyone else have a coping mechanism that is unusual?

My roommates cat loves me dearly and always either wants to be purring on my lap, or within 5 feet of me no matter what I’m doing. I love him dearly. I don’t want to sound ungrateful but especially on days where he’s been in my lap all day multiple days or i’ve had a long day and he won’t leave me alone, I find myself very briefly getting angry at him sometimes for how affectionate he is. I’d never hurt him and when I do find myself getting angry, I usually just let it pass (it passes quickly as it comes) and if i find i’m overstimulated I just take him off my lap and put him on his bed. 

But he’s revealed a weird trigger that id love others insight on; feeling that he loves me too much. 

I’ve had this issue before of getting a very brief but intense anger towards people that have had crushes on me in the past. I don’t think I feel the same way anymore, but I remember telling a friend that “they (the crushes) should have a better taste in people.” 

Idk what the point of this rant/question is. I’m getting into better relationships now where I feel respected and liked and there’s even the possibility of a romantic relationship soon. I have good chemistry with this person, we’ve both stated our boundaries and feel comfortable pursuing a relationship out of friendship,so literally the only thing that’s left is for me to initiate it, which I don’t know if I can do tbh. 

I have friends and loved ones who love me and openly express it. I’ve worked hard to make a community around me and it feels like the only part of it that refuses to budge or move or adapt or be open at this point is me.

I know it’s trauma related and I want to be able to meet the people that love me at the point their at and be willing to be vulnerable but I feel stuck (and sometimes mad). I don’t know where to go from here.

I can only take this as she isn’t aware of what is going on, is aware and doesn’t know how to respond, or is aware and isn’t able to face it and respond. 
Either way there were also other yellow flags that means this relationship goes to rest too. 
Nobody seems to pull through so there goes my family. Just like that there is no family anymore.

Just eccentric bad habits that need a little discipline. A little structure. Some boxes, some alarms and some routine...right?

It sounds like such an excuse. But I'm starting to realize that those ""bad quirks"" could be worse than imagined. 

*Why I come late?*: I have no concept of time, because I was only taught to do stuff to avoid direct pain and suffering. Hence I don't have a feeling of hurry until I am threatened by e.g. getting hurt, kicked, losing money. *Why I make little sense?:* I have executive dysfunction. Too often I literally can't ""see"" the structure until someone else points it out. It all makes somewhat sense in my own head.

As time goes by, I start to realize that I might need extra help. Tools & people to work as my crutches. Someone that regularly re-reads my papers, to point out inconsistencies/wrong citings. Something that ""tricks"" me into being on time. 

But no one believes me. My issue with structure nearly got me kicked from college. They thought I was cheating, because I didn't cite a very tricky source correctly. This was my first ever scientific paper -I only escaped due to that. When I asked for help afterwards, everyone just gave me theoretical seminars, and courses. Except: I KNOW how it's done in theory! I just have trouble putting it into practice! I'm getting lost in my own head! I can't ""practice"" my issues away! I try to practice it away since I was a kid!

They think I'm just making excuses. That I'm lazy. That I don't care about people's time, or just ""aren't made for college then"", even though I am smart and could tell you enough about the topic on hand.

And because I'm a ""low support needs"" autistic, I'm not going to get any official help, most likely.

So, my ex and I broke up about a year ago. We are still quite close, and he’s the only one I feel safe going to with my SH and suicidal ideation (besides my therapist).

Context: I am diagnosed with ADHD and cyclothymia and have a history of childhood emotional abandonment. My ex was with me and supported me when my mom died, when my childhood home was destroyed and when I was at my lowest and made an attempt. He represents so much to me, being the first person to really stand by my side through mood swings/grief/general unpleasantness and the only one I’ve been truly vulnerable with. When we were together I spent most of my time at his place because I couldn’t be alone and needed to have some nearby to talk to and hold me.

He has a new girlfriend now and I think she’s great (yes, I deal with feeling jealous, but that’s a me issue). They’re moving in together soon, which, cognitively, I think is great for him. But that also means he will no longer live in the apartment that became a safe space for me to heal. I feel like I’m losing a significant source of physical safety (the apartment) as well as officially losing emotional support from 
 my friend as he takes this next step.

Further, he recently told me he can’t continue to hang out with me if I’m so consistently emotionally charged. I feel him pulling away and sense that he’s tired of me and puts up with me now out of a sense of duty or something… He says that I am one of his closest friends, but whenever we see each other, he ends up ignoring me to text his girlfriend or invites her over and ignores me to talk with her. 

I just feel… so alone and confused. While my friendship with me ex is hard (and I know many people would say it’s not worth the emotional pain), he is also the only person I have nearby who is emotionally safe to me. 

I also feel so so so embarrassed and ashamed that I’m now essentially this ex girlfriend who can’t let go and is begging for scraps of affection. I feel sick about how I react when my abandonment issues are triggered. I hate what the past several years have caused me to become.

There's a diner that we like to eat at that's literally across the street from the section 8 apartments I used to live in.

Like I'm experiencing both at the same time, like I can almost see it out of the corner of my eye. 

It's really hard to explain. The who I was (and the socioeconomic situation I was in) vs the who I am are worlds apart. 

And my mom especially was extremely bitter toward anyone who was more privileged than us, but always couched it in morality. Like it was immoral to go out to eat or own a house or get clothes that weren't from Dollar Tree. And that poor people like us weren't allowed in nice spaces. She made it very clear I wasn't even to go into the restaurants across the street (at the time it was a local pizza place and a cafe) because we couldn't afford anything there and anyone who bought food there was selfish and wasteful. It took me years to realize that this wasn't a morality issue (though there's definitely a valid argument that you can't be *rich* and moral) but a bitterness and jealousy one.

It means that one or both parents could also have it and possibly my siblings.

If I ever say thank you to my family, it feels extremely weird. I would say that I never saw it in others and others weren't courteous with me. I tried to develop it through internet research and while dealing with tons of different issues.

In my extended family, there's a lot of people who go over the top. But the ones that were most adamant about this were huge narcissists and bullies. The rest were trying to avoid abuse, but there was a general lack of empathy a lot of the time.

So it was a double whammy for my manners. It wasn't modeled, but I was ridiculed so much by the ""just don't be a weirdo"" police and the glaring narcissists. I was compared to the good kids and seen as lacking.

I actually was in therapy with an awful therapist. I can just see her rolling her eyes at my non-issue.

I do believe in courtesy, but I am not good at it. I was selectively mute as a child. A lot of the bullying I experienced was over a REAL struggle.

Sorry if it's hard to read I'm on my phone and my mind is all over the place

About 8 months ago my ex broke up with me while I was visiting my family because I told him how I felt unappreciated. It was a tough break up because it was my longest relationship, even tho it was toxic as hell and I was relieved he dumped me, I was still crushed. Every few months he tries to message me and get back together under the guise of being friends but I know him and what he means. Every time he messages me I have a panic attack and get really scared that he will show up to my house. I never really knew why I got so worked up whenever he would try to reach out, I had some ideas but I thought they were irrational. 
Today in my therapy session I told her about him reaching out and how I react whenever it happens, she was confused because I never talked about him even while we were dating. After our break up I brought up bits of what our relationship was like but never went into details. Today I brought up the thing I thought was the reason I have panic attacks when he reaches out. He's made 4 different Facebook accounts to message me because I block him every time he messages me. After his recent attempt I went through every single account with his name and blocked it, even it had no pictures or it was old.
When we were together if he wanted to have sex he would touch me, rub against me and kiss me when I wasn't in the mood. If I'd say not now or no, he would ignore it and keep going until I'd give in to get him to stop. He'd try to guilt trip me by saying it's been so long since we had sex or please I'm so uncomfortable can you play with it. 
Sometimes I'd get really angry at him and sternly say no and ignore him for the rest of the day. Sometimes this worked, other times he'd keep going until I gave in. I didn't do this every time because I was scared of an argument happening, he has bad anger issues and I was worried he'd hit me. He raised his hand to me one time when he was drunk because he didn't like something I said, so I know that he would hit me if he was mad/drunk enough. He would ""playfully"" slap me to get me to hit him back and to wrestle, there were a few times he slapped me too hard and I'd full on smack him back. He knew about my trauma, attachment issues and how sensitive I am and he used it against me. He knew how lonely and desperate for love I was and love bombed me to trap me, making sure that I wouldn't leave. Abusing my caring nature and my instincts to protect for his own disgusting, greedy purposes.
After I told my therapist this she told me that what he did was assault. I don't know why but hearing someone else confirm what I was scared of being true was relieving but it also ruined my day. Now all I can think about is all of the times that I gave in and let him do whatever, how I'd just lay there letting my mind wander and hoping he'd be done soon. I feel like shit thinking back to how complacent I was and how I let him take advantage of me while I was in a vulnerable state. 
I haven't self harmed in months, almost a year, but this is the closest I've felt to relapsing. Thinking about all of the things he's done and I've put up with makes me want to shed my skin and rot in a hole. The only good thing that came from this was I now understand why I react the way I do with physical contact since the relationship and the panic I feel when he tries to contact me.",1678929237.0

I really thought I had my CPTSD symptoms under control. I was on and off Prozac for a while and it miraculously got rid of a lot of my flashbacks and intrusive thoughts. They used to be a constant, but they were exacerbated by both my ovulation and my period start. Recently, these symptoms have come back but first only when I ovulated. Now I have them again about 4 days leading up to ovulation and about 4 days before my period. So I’m struggling really badly for at least ~10 days a month. Around my ovulation I am more angry/ high energy and anxious and around my period I am more depressed/ low energy and anxious. 

My thing is that Prozac gave me terrible trembling and headaches even at low doses, and a lot of birth controls (especially depo) I have tried have actually made me feel even more unstable plus they have given me acne. Has anyone had this experience with their menstrual cycle and perhaps had some success with a certain medication specifically for PMDD?

My flashbacks have been worse, my anxiety has been worse, my eating habits have been worse, my memory had become much worse, and I can’t sleep. I go to therapy, but I don’t think it’s helping. I haven’t felt a positive emotion in so long i don’t even remember what it looks like. I just fake happy all the time so no one questions me, but I don’t think I can do that anymore. I just don’t know what to do.

934,I feel selfish because I am worried about my sister being pregnant and she hasn't processed the trauma from our upbringing yet and will pass it on to her child,37,11rjton,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11rjton/i_feel_selfish_because_i_am_worried_about_my/,19,"My younger sister just surprised the whole family last week saying she is 3 months pregnant.  

She's 26 and married and her and her spouse make good money so I'm not really worried about that part. But I know just from myself talking about getting therapy for the abuse and my other mental health problems with her that she hasn't processed any of it yet for herself and still downplays the abuse our parents put us through.  

It also doesn't help that everyone else in our family either downplays the abuse or is in denial about it still and she spends more time around our family still than I do.  I am pretty much low contact with all of them except her and she still visits them on a regular basis.  

It also worries me that for a long time she didn't want children like me and she married her spouse knowing he wanted kids and she still got married to him knowing that.  I know people can change their minds on having kids but I don't know it just feels like her husband might have pressured her at least a little because before this year she felt very strongly about not having kids like me and it was something we bonded over together.  

 I am still baffled that wasn't a deal breaker for her but she's is her own person and can make decisions for herself. Our Mom died when we were both young teens and we didn't have any women role models to turn to after she died so this might have affected both of us differently when navigating adult life as a woman.  

I knew this was coming but I have ADHD and I guess tuned it out or forgot after she got married in 2021 and I wasn't on medication for it yet so when she texted me the pregnancy ultrasound pics I was surprised all over again. 

I feel extremely selfish for being so worried about her having a child but I think it all comes down to I just don't want her to repeat the abuse cycle our parents did and cause trauma to her future child.  I am afraid that I will not be able to sit back and freeze it out like I did as a child and might damage my relationship with my sister defending her child from potential abuse from either her or her spouse or anybody else really. 

I guess I'm venting mostly right now since its been on my mind a lot and stressing me out. I still have to gauge how open she wants to be about it right now without pushing her so I haven't talked super extensively about it with her yet.

 I was curious if anyone could relate on here or been through something similar?",1678848363.0
935,"When I dissociate alot, different moods almost feel like living in different worlds. Like splitting states. Does anyone relate?",3,11s0fn2,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11s0fn2/when_i_dissociate_alot_different_moods_almost/,4,"Hey. So I have childhood cptsd and adult retraumatization.

Since I started dissociating alot again, I noticed that I was living in very different ""moods"" throughout the day. I feel and act very differently depending on if I am scared, being silly or flirty or having fun, and just regular me trying to get things done.

I feel like there is one central me that is kind of neutral that wrangles all of my other moods. Like control center. When I get in other moods, I feel differently about things, and I sometimes communicate differently with people- I assume because each mood has its own needs that it is trying to meet. Sometimes I get lost in moods but they're generally an overarching feeling I get while command center is still cutting in, sternly in control. It is concerned with things that need done, completely removed from emotion. I noticed it can do positive or negative things depending on if I am working to meet my egos needs or my needs. This control center is what sticks around and fixes things when I have to dissociate out really hard. Also, i use weed and delta in high amounts 24/7 which I imagine is a huge contibutor..   I have to use such high amount that i am falling over before control center calms its sternness.

I get really afraid of my moods because the bad ones are just misery and agony and all encompassing. If I know I'm going to have a bad day, I'm not afraid of the thing I have to go through. I know I can dissociate enough to survive it. I worry about the moods I have afterward- hours of anger, fear, confusion, and urges to self delete.

I noticed this recently because I started communicating with a couple of people throughout all states, which is something I usually don't do- I only socialize in certain states. Since talking with people consistently, I realize how much of a goddamn mess I am and how quickly I switch between states. Sometimes I can be messaging someone and the tinent and tone of the message can change between sentences. 

I got really high a few nights ago and that stern control center voice was having me do some things I needed to. Then there was another part of me that was like begging against it that it didn't want to, but the other won out and I continued to do the thing, even though I genuinely didn't want to and was telling myself no. I was on ALOT of drugs that night but I assume it exacerbated the theme.

I use drugs to shift in and out of good states which makes the problem much worse and I'm working on that.

I understand I need to integrate my states and that this is likely fragmentation from disccoiating from my retraumatization. I was probably a few years off in early abuse from having DID because this almost sounds like alters. It's weird. 

Does anyone else relate? What does this sound like?

My friends and family get frustrated with Me because they don't understand I have so much going on within my head and when I am not functional enough they seem frustrated because they only see face value and not the literal hours it takes me to regulate bad moods daily and to shift out of them. They see it as me lazy, or not putting in much effort. I don't know how to verbalize to them what is happening inside me. How do you help your friends and family understand what is happening to you, and why you often act differently? Or alternatively what to do when you choose to instead isolate and then they are upset that you haven't been there for them.

Recently I was in an emotionally abusive marriage and was gaslight several times daily and it has fucked me so hard. I have just like different layers to my mind and on a daily basis I'm working within them and through them and they even sometimes seem to have different ideas or feelings about things so it's confusing. Mainly because I'm trying to divorce my husband and I'm getting really confused about going through with it. Because I have different feelings regarding the divorce depending on the time of day and mood and how safe I feel. Any advice is helpful",1678895613.0

&#x200B;

So, this is something that I've been grappling with for a long time. I experience a lot of shame do to some pretty severe childhood emotional abuse and neglect and growing up with parents who are addicts and committed some pretty awful financial crimes on people who I consider my friends and their families. I also have pretty severe ADHD that went undiagnosed until I was 22 years old. I used to get pretty heavily shamed about how I was obnoxious or annoying for my ADHD. My parents used to tie me to kitchen chairs at dinner because I was always try to get up and move around. 

Now, at 26 years old, I still struggle with a lot of that shame. Sometimes I just feel like I am defective. This feeling was exacerbated last year when my parents kicked me out and I decided to cut contact with them. I feel like my decision to cut contact was selfish, which is something that my siblings have told me multiple times. 

Because of this, I just have an incredibly hard time understanding that I deserve \*anything\* good. I am constantly paranoid that my friends are only interacting with me out of pity, because I can't understand why anyone would choose to be my friend. 

Today, this was really triggered because I posted something on social media about how I am graduating in May with my Master's degree. That post resulted in several of my friends telling me how they want to crowdfund to help me pay for my Graduation Regalia and want to come support me at my graduation. I don't know how to deal with this. I am so grateful to have such generous and amazing people in my life, but I cannot help but feel like I do not deserve them. I love my friends so much. They are my chosen family and have been there for me through the hardest moments of my life, but I know that this shame I experience impacts my relationships. 

I know that it is probably incredibly annoying to have to keep assuring me that I am not annoying them, or deal with my anxiety and occasionally self-destructive behavior and I think that sucks because they shouldn't have to put up with that. I was to be a better friend to them and I don't know if that is something I can do if I continue to harbor this much shame and self-hatred.",1678838418.0

I was going through some crap yesterday and this thought hit me hard and I was like ""woah."" What do you think? 

\_\_\_\_\_

(In case you're curious, context: My partner of 5 years and I are used to being together basically all the time, we were in college together and were both taking most classes from home, but we graduated last year and he got a ""real job"" in January and I am struggling with the transition into him being unavailable for so many hours every day. Then by the time he gets home from work, he's so tired that he doesn't remember any of the conversations we have during the evenings after work, so this keeps happening: I say something about something I already told him about. He says ""Oh that's the first I heard about it."" ""No, I sent you a message about it and I told you in person later."" His response is usually either ""I don't think you did"" or ""oh, I don't remember."" And it happens with important things: My first doctor appointment with my new doctor in our new city (we moved and I have a lot of unaddressed health problems), we JUST moved a second time like 2 weeks ago so stuff I've told him about like internet hookup, rules of the new community, etc. It's like his exhaustion from working has stolen my best friend from me. 

And now he is on his first work trip. I dropped him off at the airport yesterday, and he will be gone for 4 days. I am NOT handling it well. I feel like a child that needs a parent to take care of them. Now that he's gone, it's never felt so obvious that I have no idea how to love myself, and that when I'm NOT alone, I am totally disconnected from my own needs and desires because it's so much more important for me to be tuned into other people's desires and prioritize them over my own. I am AFAB but agender and I am very much not the type of person that wants a bunch of special treatment in relationships, but yesterday I found myself suddenly out of the blue wanting him to stay in his hotel room and talk to me instead of going out to dinner with his coworkers (which I didn't ask him to do because I know that's not good) and at the same time I want to just give him ""the silent treatment"" because I want him to bend over backwards to try to make me happy again (which I also am not going to do because I am not my mom).

But we didn't. Under no circumstances did we deserve it. YOU didn't deserve it. 

I think it's a lot harder for us to see what was done to us as an indicator of who did it, because we were raised to love this person.

I was bullied throughout middle school and no one had my back. No one defended me as I was insulted, ridiculed, and harassed for years on end. 

I had friends, but I didn't have anyone I could depend on. I felt so alone throughout that time of my life. All I had was my music. I was fortunate enough to have been able to escape to home school and the Covid Pandemic.

Then, I had been sexually assaulted during my freshmen year by an older family member. At first, my mom cared, but now she's tired of my ""being depressed."" She said I have no reason to constantly feel the way I do. That it's over and I have no reason to feel like that.

I met a guy in my post-sophomore year and I thought he would understand. Nope. More pain. He used me sexually, ghosted me afterward, and would also ridicule me, making it very clear that I was not wanted, that I was an annoying, unfortunate burden that he wanted to be rid of. More pain there. Another wound opened, atop the old one of my bullying. I feel so much pressure. I thought I had someone who could understand me, but I was made to feel less than.

Now my junior year. I felt so alone. All I have is my schoolwork. I have friends, but I'm never invited anywhere. I spend most of my days in my room rotting on my phone while other people my age are bonding, having fun, and laughing. 

Now my senior year. Everything is largely the same. I'm a straight-A student, I'm taking hard classes, am in honors groups. I'm loud and confident, but deep down, all I feel is constant hatred and disgust for this facade that I'm placating. I feel so hurt deep down, all the time.",1678893863.0

It’s frustrating because I feel justified in being upset about the most recent things that happened. First thing: last week my coworker (J) yelled at me. Some context, one coworker (B) emailed me about a client he wanted paperwork for. I cant do the paperwork he was asking me about because 1) I don’t do those and 2) the client needed their intake done. J told me to direct him to another coworker of ours (A), who does them. I directed him to (A) who does them. A emailed me asking about scheduling the client for an intake session. And I emailed her back saying one was already scheduled and asked if she wanted it done sooner. J (who’d spent a lot of time getting the client scheduled), came to my office and proceeded to open my door and yell at me to not email A. I was on the phone with someone and in a meeting so not only was her response super rude but unprofessional and disrespectful. I respect why she was angry but that gives her no right to yell at me. Especially when I was on the phone with a client who fucking heard her yelling at me. I’ve since talked to my supervisor about it who said she would talk to J. I believe she has but I’ve never heard an apology from J, I don’t trust that I will, and I have to keep working like nothing happened. This is the second time she’s been disrespectful to me and when I tried to talk to her about the first time, before I even opened my mouth she immediately said that what she did wasn’t disrespectful. Which tells me she knows it was. Again, no apology. I’m mad at her because I know I don’t deserve to be talked to like that. I’m mad at myself for not being more assertive when that happens and I’m hurt because J and I are supposed to be friends. I normally get along with her and it hurts that she just does this and never thinks it’s wrong. 

Second thing, last night when I was at one of my game nights (I go to two), one of my friends tried to fucking make out with me. We were venting to each other because I’d been triggered that night. We were walking to our cars and normally when we greet each other or say good bye we do a side hug. I thought we were doing that but he fucking leaned in and kissed me on the mouth twice. One of which he tried to use tongue. It was super ducking uncomfortable. He was like “you know you’re my special girl”. I still cringe at that. I don’t like him that way. I’ve never liked him that way. He’s about 20 years older than I am and I know he has social delays but that’s no excuse. I had to sit in my car and cry because last month was shitty and I’m trying really hard to better myself and get my emotions under control. Game night is one of the few ways I’ve been trying to stay out of the house so I’m not isolated and now that’s awkward. Ive been SA’d before and it brought that back. I’ve at least been able to message him to never do that again and set a boundary. He messaged back an apology and said he got carried away but I’m not up for talking to him right now. I hate carrying all of this. I hate carrying shit from my past too. I don’t know how to let it go. My negative emotions cause me physical pain and discomfort.

I went through the resource library this morning and many of the tools there have been familiar friends to me over the last two years. I wanted to share a couple more I've found in my travels that I can honestly say have REALLY helped me out of some of the worst trauma fogs.

[https://www.youtube.com/@TimFletcher](https://www.youtube.com/@TimFletcher)

Tim is a counselor at an addiction treatment facility in Ontario. He has literally an entire library documenting the complex trauma recovery process and how it plays in to the addiction model. All the pitfalls a recovering addict has to deal with during and post recovery. 

His video series is broken down into a deep dive into the individual components that make up trauma and he does a live stream very Friday night that I rarely miss and if I do I watch the repeat of it later. At the end of each session, he addresses the topic for the night from a ""christian/biblical"" perspective. Please, please, please don't let that element dissuade you from taking in his wisdom. His knowledge of the topic has been invaluable to me and has been a key component of my recovery process. My trauma informed therapist gave him a two thumbs up when I shared the site with her. In her words, ""he gets it"". My therapist doesn't suffer bullshit lightly. 

Another recommendation from my therapist was this book. A key component of trauma is shame and this book gets to the heart of that shame and how to move through it whilst being compassionate towards yourself

**Self Compassion, ""The proven power of being kind to yourself."" Kristen Neff**. I'd include the link to the book but its about a mile long. You can also find numerous talks of Kristen's on youtube. 

This audiobook changed my relationship with myself in ways I could go on about for days. Some may have heard of Brene Brown from her TED talks on vulnerability, something for which many of us as survivors long for. This has been a huge part of my recovery process and I've listened to it multiple times and I still go back to it regularly for it's wisdom.

The break is over and we are committed to working through it together (in terms of the relationship, he will still have to work on his personal trauma separately too)

He has been experiencing a lot of mixed feelings about being in a relationship, but also a lot of mixed feelings about not being with me. All the mixed feelings about being with me have boiled down to fear & trauma about the future because he simultaneously loves being with me and is happy, but is terrified of “what if” scenarios of our relationship becoming like his abusive one. I experienced the same fears in the beginning but pushed myself to face those fears, and now he’s doing the same. 

I have been patient with him and loving, while also not coddling him, and told him he has nothing to be afraid of and also told him I’m also afraid. 
I want to give him the space he needs when he needs it but also he wary of when it’s gotten to an unproductive point for us.
I haven’t wanted to coddle him but I also feel like I’m balancing a fine line of potentially making him feel worse about stuff and spiraling. 
I want to be sure I navigate this correctly/well for him as my partner, but also me as I have my own trauma so I have to retain my own boundaries. 

Any advice? I know reassurance personally helps me, and has seemed to help him, but I wonder if there’s other things I can do when he’s actively struggling with a trauma reaction that doesn’t equate to me doing all the processing for him.",1678899795.0

If you don’t want to read the below (my experience) I’d love to know if this is common with CPTSD and f you’ve found anything that helps.

I (26F) grew up in a childhood that was extremely chaotic due to my mom’s behavior (BPD) and my angry dad’s alcoholism and witnessed domestic violence a few times. When we got older she divorced him and then married someone else who was bad in different ways. A more secretive alcoholic, was very manipulative and of course became mildly physically abusive to my mom too. 

Anyway, I’ve always had this desire for someone to *change* for me to show me I’m worthy. I’m not sure if it’s because I’ve always so desperately wanted to have a healthy relationship with my mom, but I’ll never have it and she won’t ever change. If doesn’t help that my mom’s behavior hasn’t really changed while I’m an adult so it all has really compounded.

I know for a fact this  definitely influenced my relationships. I picked someone who ended up being a liar and cheated on me. I found out about a year ago. There was mild emotional abuse similar to the way my mom did, mostly gaslighting. Overall I have this huge sense of loneliness, being an outsider to all of my friends living their lives while they’re young. I isolate myself and busy myself excessively so I don’t think about how I’m not good enough for anyone. I feel like I have so much baggage that I constantly think “if one more thing happens…” The worst part is that I’ve been in therapy for almost 10 years and have tried many meds. I don’t actually know what to do but I feel very alone with this.

Just walking around carrying this sense of shame. It almost feels like I’m holding a sign saying “I’m worthless!” but hoping no one notices. The pretending to function well all while being passively suicidal and getting triggered at least once a day. 

I’d love to hear if any of you feel like this. Sorry if I did a terrible job describing my experience",1678870380.0

All the dishes were dirty so I gathered them up and washed the few things for the coffee, I was planning on washing the rest when I was done. There were no spoons, they were all dirty. 

There is usually a spoon my partner uses to measure out ingredients that sits in a little mug. It isn't special, the same as all of our other spoons. He keeps it there so he doesn't have to wash a new spoon every time he makes coffee. He gets annoyed if I take it to clean and don't replace it, he also thinks I wash it too much (every two or three days).

It's such a stupid little thing, but I  my partner came out and saw me making coffee. I misplaced the spoon I was planning on using and was looking for it, then he said something sarcastically about it. It's frustrating that I can't remember now exactly, but it offended me a lot. Something like ""That's what happens when you don't do it right"". I can't recall now. I'm terrified I'm projecting. 

I was just trying to make coffee for him, but it felt like he was making fun of me for a really simple error that took me a minute to fix. 

I don't like being so sensitive to criticism. It's hard even knowing if I was offended for a valid reason. He said it looked like I slapped him after he said it. I told him that I didn't like how the first thing out of his mouth to me in the morning was sarcastic and passive-aggressive. He seemed to think that what he said was fine, but apologized anyway since I was offended. I did too, in case I'm being overly sensitive. 

But am I wrong? Isn't hurtful when a partner is passive-aggressive? Is saying something like that supposed to be hurtful?  How do I tell if it's real or if I'm projecting some past thing onto them?",1678896159.0

But I'm so full of ennui. I've had it since I left my parents home. Just.... Chronic boredom. Every new job I start is exciting at first and I get bored and depressed within two months. I can't stand routine. I do my hobbies and I try to stimulate myself but the boredom is still there.

I'm a bit of a stimulation seeker, even watching TV with the husband I might have to fiddle or do some embroidery. I'm constantly tapping my feet or legs.

Says me not showing because I say he neglects me is the same as him not saying ILY. Am I being gaslit?,4,11rqjph,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11rqjph/my_f36_ldr_boyfriend_m26_stops_saying_i_love_you/,12," Please don't criticize me that I should know better being the older person. I need support, please and advice. I feel my mind is not clear.

I started dating him since Nov 2021 and since January 2022 he started to press to bare myself on cam and have sexual activity like that. We hadn't met at that point. He said that I'm the one that's hurting him, because I don't trust him or something of the sort. He relented for a while on various occasions.  
We met several times.

He started to threaten to break up with me many times, when we'd have arguments, usually about me complaining about his behavior and he'd accuse me back, or because of the cam thing. I would stand up to him, but as time went on I felt more exhausted. My life circumstances were not helping me, as I was most of the time alone, working from home, in a small town where I didn't really have friends.

From Nov 2022 he entered officer school (Europe) and we spent less time together. He will graduate March 24th. I could still see making effort, while he seemed busy, to contact, talk. It fluctuated, but he'd tell me about his day in text, then give me some short calls or a few minutes during the day. In the evening, we'd spend half hour on cam, more or less. He told me to be patient because starting February he will go up one rank and he'll have more free time. He also started to press again for the cam thing, which he had stopped mostly since entering the army, or at least he didn't react negatively when I didn't. He started to become colder and colder as I was refusing him, not saying I love you, not contacting me, being short on reply. He started to complain about various things about me, one of them being that I am not sexual on cam and show all my private parts.

It was a very stressful period for me on New Year's Eve I lost my livelihood, a small business I had. I was in the middle of winter with bills to pay and a bit of savings. I'll start a new job on April 1st, in a different city and I don't have enough money to pay everything. He started to press me on Feb 9th and said he is breaking up with me, that I put him off about being closed, not being sexual on cam. Again I could not sleep for 48h, I was in shock and a wreck, could not function. The part about being closed is that he found on Holidays some antidepressants in my purse and I hadn't told him about those. I was prescribed those because he had threatened break up in October again over the cam thing and he was being very cold to me and I couldn't function, I was a wreck and hadn't slept in 48h. I begged him to not break up and eventually he agreed not to. I never told him about those, because I was afraid if I'd tell him his treatment was the main reason I was taking them that he'd get upset and he'd be angry and withholding again.

Back to Feb 9th, again I begged him not to dump me. I also told him I had been sexually ab\*sed in childhood so I would freeze over the cam thing. He said he is sorry I went through that and later that I should just get over it. I cracked and I did whatever he wanted sexually. He seemed very happy, attentive and affectionate, but it only lasted for some days, then slowly he started to talk less, prioritize me less. He had said us being sexual would bring us closer. If I was sexual I'd get a lot of anxiety and feel needy and scared. I would have been calm(er), but after the next day he'd be usually less attentive to me. I kept asking if he loves me, and he kept saying yes. He'd tell me that multiple times a day.

A few weeks ago I told him I felt he lost interest and if that's the case he should tell me because I can understand people's feelings change. He told me he loved me more than before. I said that he is saying the words every day, but he does not spend time with me and I feel neglected, plus other things. He thanked me I said this to him, and said he'll put more effort in the future, because he is just tired and stressed and that the same had happened to his previous relationship, the girl dumped him because he was not being attentive to her because of his stress and she thought he didn't love her. (This part is true, as I knew him even when they were together, we were platonic, before dating, and he suffered for her.).

Eventually he lost his temper because the discussion was dragging on. We both spoke but I can repeat myself when I'm anxious. He became cold and withholding and didn't contact me for 2 days. After, he said he loved me but has some anxieties about us.

The only thing that changed was him saying good morning every morning first. Less effort in texting and calls as before or less in some days. I told him again I felt alone and he said there's nothing he can do and I'm making him sad saying that. But the thing is now I see him on social media for 1-2 hours every day almost, he plays computer games 1-3 hours every day. So to me it feels like he is using excuses and could carve time from that. Also it takes a few minutes to check in and send little texts.

Yesterday he told me good morning and I love you, I said it back, then nothing from him until 6pm. I called him we spoke 6 min and said he'll call later. At 8 30 pm he called me, he was getting ready for a game and asked to see my breasts. I said no and that I need companionship and time together for that. He tried to stream the game for me, and when it was no possible he said he'll close and wants to play alone, cold, no I love yous, and he says that at the end of every call. He said he'll call later. He called at midnight, but I missed it and minutes later he was in bed and said he has to close. I said I don't like that he stops saying I love you when I don't show him my breast on request and that I need time, intimacy together to feel sexual, otherwise I'd do it for everyone on the street and I'm asking for things normal in a relationship. He equaled him not saying I love you because I won't show my b00bs with me not doing it because he won't spend time with me. And now he's also not wrote, as he does every morning.

He also said in one oh our last talks he is tired of me doubting his feelings and that he feels it is established he loves me, he is with me and will be with me. But how can that be established if be breaks up every few months, and reacts like this at sexual stuff?

**Am I being gaslit?**

Tl;dr: LDR boyfriend stops saying ILY and contact if I don't do what he wants se\*ually, last night he stopped saying ILY because I refused to show my b00bs. I told him I'm not in the mood because he doesn't spend time with me and I need intimacy to be sexual and i don't like his attitude. He said that me not being sexual is the same as him not saying ILY. In Feb he threatened break up for not being sexual on cam and show everything and other reasons, and took it back when I cracked. He said this will bring us closer, but I don't see more effort. Say he's busy in officer school (Europe) but he has time now for video games 1-3h every day and social media (1-2h). He'll say a good morning and I love you and text a couple sentences throughout the day or less, then call in the evening for some minutes (5-10), sometimes 30 min, but he's usually also gaming when he spends more time with me like that. I asked if he lost interest and he says he loves me more than ever. I told him before I could see words and actions, but now he doesn't spend time, with me, among others.",1678869797.0
964,Can't focus/remember things after I moved out of toxic household,1,11ry9v8,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11ry9v8/cant_focusremember_things_after_i_moved_out_of/,3," So, for starters, I was a bright kid. I was good with my memory. I could study pretty much effortlessly. As time went by, my mental health suffered a lot due to abuse. I wasn't nearly as good anymore.

But something weird happened after I moved out. I somehow feel like my mental processes have gotten so much worse from being already sub-par. Just to add a note - I'm actually pretty happy. Nothing crazy is happening in my life.

1. I **forget a lot**. And I mean a LOT. It has been a year and half since I moved out of my abusive household and I have forgotten almost 90% of my memories of being abused. It sometimes gets to the point where I start thinking my abusers weren't ever abusive. I also forget pretty much everything mundane as well like planning to do the laundry and forgetting it. Not once, not twice. Every. Time.

I also tend to forget things that have happened a month or so ago. Like things will be really blurry for some reason and I can't remember unless someone tells me every detail about it.

2. My **attention span seems to have gone down** significantly since I moved out. Another thing I wanted to mention is that **I zone out really, really frequently**. Over 50 times a day and that's just when I'm aware that I'm zoning out.

To put it simply, I feel like I'm no longer a person but rather just a space filled with white noise.

I have never felt like this before. I'm not able to focus on my education because of this. I'm not even able to focus on things that are important to me because I keep zoning out. I really need to study but I don't know what to do. Has someone else felt this way? How have you dealt with it?

**TLDR**: Memory and attention span have become worse since moving out from abusive household. Struggling to stop zoning out as well.

I think she’s twisted her memories to suit this narrative.

I don’t have autism (confirmed with psych’s). Even though I may have previously had a couple behaviours that could be seen as spectrum traits. But my therapist sees those as trauma responses.
I.e. AvPD which I’ve mostly overcome now through years of self work.

For one, I think it’s normal that peoples trauma doesn’t start to really show till they reach about that age (8+) where they’re staring to gain self awareness.

She’s deeply avoidant of confrontation, so she won’t say this in front of me. But I keep hearing from others that she’s insistent on this view.

It infuriates me and makes me so mad.
I want to have a relationship with my mom who was always the “good” parent growing up for me.
But I’m so angry with her ignorance to what growing up was like for me and how I feel it affected me.

I wish she would be honest with me and talk about it so we can figure it out together. But I feel like I can’t have an authentic relationship with her while there’s this dishonest avoidant chasm between us.

throwaway for obvious reasons. 

this is gonna be tmi and all over the place, apologies in advance

when im in therapy and my therapist acknowledges that i have trauma or that something may be wrong with me, i find my body reacting in strange and upsetting ways. it feels too shameful to mention face to face with her but when i hint towards potential/possible trauma (i havent really opened up about many lived experiences yet, not that it would explain this reaction) or answer questions about myself, sometimes i get partially aroused down there. i dont feel sexual when it happens and i find it really repulsive of my body to react that way. its happened mostly while she's asked me about what i experience like symptoms wise. i dont know maybe its like my body feels like being open is wrong of me to do or its a bad thing and thats why it reacts that way, maybe its like a shame thing. and when my therapist says that i shows signs of blah blah blah trauma induced mental issues, it just happens. i hate it and it makes me feel like im a sicko who gets off to the concept/possibility of being fucked up or broken or something. and i cant help but feel like it isnt unprecedented for me either like when ive self harmed in the past ive gotten aroused to the point of dripping or like having wet spots in my underwear without even noticing. i didnt expect to but it just happened and the first times i remember ever getting aroused as a kid was when i was playing as a bad guy and when i would play/imagine being hurt. it really damages my sense of self and i just feel so... gross for these reactions. its followed me throughout my life and really influenced my sexual desires and hyper-sexuality, especially in the past. it just feels like im attracted to being bad or being hurt. and by bad/evil i dont mean abusing anyone else, i have never harmed anyone, never will, nor have i ever wanted to, its more just like stop being kind/taking care of myself i guess, like let myself go and be indulgent and get into bad habits like sleeping around, drugs or criminal stuff.... sorry for the non-sequitur... but yeah like its not something i like about myself and i feel like its attempting to infect something thats supposed to be good and normal and not sexual with therapy, i dont get it i just dont get it. i dont want it or even feel sexual it just happens and im cursed to feel all of the shame. my body just reacts to whatever it reacts to, honestly i dont really even get it with therapy like its not a surprise to me that ive gone through trauma and stuff and i havent even been super open with her except for the base work we're doing now. i just feel so disgusting and pathetic and depraved that things like that make my body react in that way.

I recently started a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaIUEK5y2rruzQe2i-dHozQ) for my two Black boys, aged 5 and 7. My intention is far from vlogging or Youtubing as I am not an expert in either, but rather to document their childhood and create memories full of joy, play, adventure, and moments of love - something I didn’t have growing up.

I mean they are 7 now and looking back on all of their videos (*after all my cloud drives were getting extremely full and I needed to delete stuff to make space*) I realized how much intentionality I had put into capturing their childhood on video. I was talking this through with my therapist late last year while I was working through some of my childhood issues and I had the breakthrough of connecting it to ***trying so hard to have good memories for them to hold onto, something that I never had***.

Personally, I don’t have any good pictures showing something memorable from my childhood. And I’m not sure what part of my childhood my brain is protecting me from, but every time I try to remember something from an event or place in my childhood, my brain comes back empty or the memory is very fragmented. You know It’s like a case of infant amnesia or repressed memories.

You know that coping mechanism where the brain may unconsciously block a memory due to its association with a high level of stress or trauma? - to protect the individual from the emotional pain of recalling them - hiding the memories like a shadow in the brain. That’s what it feels like for me.

But for my boys, I want them to have joyful memories to look back on. That’s why I started this [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@PlayVentureBoys/featured).

I had two interviews last month which were busts. The first I missed due to someone having wayyy more experience than me. Which is TOTALLY fine. I understood.

But I just keep nailing the pieces together, and they're all the wrong pieces, and they all fall apart, because I don't know how to build and I have nothing to build on in the first place. It seems futile, but there is no other option.

Other people make sense. I can see what makes them tick. I can see their wants and their needs. But when it comes to me, what *I* like,  who *I* am? I have no idea. Because there is no me. There is no me before all of this. This *is* me. Unstable, lost, confused, empty... this is all I am. How could I be anything else? I don't want a relationship, a career, consistent hobbies, or even a certain style of decor in my house. I just want to be in the position where I can even want for those things. But I don't know how to do that. I don't know if I will ever know anything other than this.

I suppose some would say it's a blessing. They'd say ""well, then you can become anything you want to be."" But I don't know what that is, although I have tried. It is so tiring, and so unnatural, and it slips right out of my grasp every time I think I might be on to something.

All I want to be is me, and to really live, and I wish that wasn't so hard to achieve. If you've gotten through this, I would love to hear your story, because right now it feels impossible.",1678778645.0
