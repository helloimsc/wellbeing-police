5,My battle with schizophrenia.,15,11xjv9d,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/11xjv9d/my_battle_with_schizophrenia/,3,"…and additional mental illnesses 

Hey!  My name is Peter.  I just want to give a testimony on my life experience battling mental illness, especially schizophrenia. 

I’ve been dealing with mental illness for probably my whole life.  I didn’t start taking medication until I became ten years old.  At first, I didn’t have much respect for psychiatrists, but now I do.  When I was ten, I started out on an antidepressant, Zoloft.  One day, I attempted suicide for the first time, and I don’t exactly remember the motive.  So I took twenty Zoloft.  I didn’t even think of the long road ahead or the consequences of my actions, but I did it anyways.

After I took the twenty Zoloft, I went and hung out with a friend.  I told him what I had done.  Later, I went home and started getting tired so I tried to go to sleep.  I started getting drowsy, and then moments later my mother heard of what I had done, and I thank God for my friend, for if he had not told her what I had done, then I would be dead by now.  She then woke me up and contacted a very kind and loving friend who was like family, and they were extremely worried about me.  

The next thing that happened was an emergency trip to the hospital.  I was rushed there being completely unaware of everything going on around me.  The best I can describe it as not existing, as what probably happens to someone when they die, (and I’m a Christian, so I do have religious beliefs) so the feeling of being dead is temporarily not knowing anything until the second coming of Christ.

This was the experience I had until arriving at the hospital, were they pumped my stomach.  They had to put a catheter in me, and make me drink liquid charcoal.  I spent a week or weeks in bed rest waiting to be cleared to go to the mental hospital.

This is just one of many suicide attempts in my life.  Each time is usually the same, I’ll attempt suicide mainly by overdosing, go through hell in the E.R. and come out on the other side in mental institutions with equal tribulations making friends for life.

This is the first part of many testimonies concerning my life’s battle with mental illness.

Thank you so much!",1679411797.0

I use to have insomnia (and sometimes still do). I started out drinking 2-3 years ago. Not much, maybe a shot a night. I felt it helped a little bit being anxious and it felt like it helped me sleep better. As time progressed I kept drinking more and more because it just wasn't enough. I am now up to at least a pint or more every night (and I get messed up because I guzzle it) and on the weekends now I have been taking shots during the day. The strange thing is I always had such a hard time trying to fall asleep, yet through the daytime I always feel like I can sleep.

I always tell myself this is the last weekend or night I will drink but it never works. I get withdrawal symptoms such as the shakes. And all day I have the craps and have to be by a bathroom. And on top of it I'm only 23! I don't want to say it's not my fault as it is but it makes it even harder to quit when I am in a family of alcoholics. I feel really bad about myself, I don't tell many people because I don't want them to think down on me and I feel really embarrassed if I had to talk to someone about this problem.",1679418312.0

I'm happy for him to be free of that, but it still feels like he's gone. Barely texting, calling, hanging out. He's ghosting me, unresponsive. I'm grieving a friend who's not dead.

But my mental health was horrid, just back and forth delusions, not eating because thoughts of dying to poisons etc. I was so aggressive, I couldn't make friends because of how manic and aggressive I was. 

I hated it but loved it... hated the symptoms, loved what it did for my art.   
I cannot find joy in art any more because I'm so medicated to not feel anything, it means I dont hear voices, and it means that my moods don't just swing back and forth. 

But I struggle to find that love for art. I'm an artist, I studied in university art, I studied art all my life. and then when i went on Quietpine and venlafaxine. I could think clearly, it was silent, it was heaven for my mind. but my art suffers, I find myself aimlessly squibbling on the page. no joy, no emotions, I cannot imagine images in my head as easily, it feels like a brick wall, when before I could almost smell, hear and feel everything I was imagining for my pieces. I'm not phased by anything much anymore, I fake smiling but feel nothing behind the smile. 

I tried coming off the medicine, because I want my love for art back. But the symptomps came back.   
I've been crying myself to sleep, because I remember just how wild my mind went, how many drawings I did, how manic I was and how much I drew. Now? I get a drawing maybe once a month. 

I feel trapped.   
I want to love art again, it's my life, my calling.   
But my mind doesn't stop. It's only silent when I take my medicine. 

I feel I either have to choose suffering with my symptoms, or my art suffers.  
I want to feel again. I want to feel alive. Yes I have a job, yes I am functioning part of society now, but I feel nothing, I'm dead inside. What do I do?   
Any suggestions would be nice. I dunno if I should risk changing medicine, but it's working for my symptoms I feel, I don't hallucinate, I dont feel delusional, but then again I don't feel anything. But it works? I dunno, can I not have my symptoms while also be full of energy  and hyperactive enough like I used to, to be able to do my art?

I've hated psychiatrists ever since because of the label they put on me that doesn't even begin to explain how real and profound those experiences were for me. I've come to accept that they were delusions but I can't let go of how good they made me feel. 

Now I'm being told that I'll have to be on medication for many years or lifelong. This is being enforced against my will through a continuously reinstated community treatment order in Australia. I have repeatedly been reported to show no insight into my illness and all they seem to want is for me to acknowledge that it is a permanent condition that will require ongoing medication.

I hate antipsychotic medication because it robs me of all human emotion, spiritual connection and motivation due to the blockages of dopamine receptors. 

My experiences were so profound and like a spiritual enlightenment and I feel that psychiatry just tries to put me in a box and doesn't understand the first thing about what I've been through. Forced psychiatry has decimated my free, rebellious and adventurous spirit and left me a shell of my former self

They reminded me of my old favourite song, Cirrus Minor by Pink Floyd, which I haven't heard in years. It was so pretty. Then I heard footsteps and felt someone standing next to my bed, who then was tapping me on my butt (random?) in a friendly way, like you would pat a horse or so.

Hello,

My name is Leon and I am an aspiring video game developer. Currently I am working on a visual novel with my programmist friend (I am the designer, writer and artist) about people suffering from different mental health issues, as well as those on the spectrum. I am doing research right now and I'm currently looking for people with schizophrenia to tell me a bit about living with it, how it affects their everyday life, relationships, social life etc. I want to write accurate and relatable characters that wouldn't just portray symptoms listed in articles on the internet, but reflect real day-to-day life struggles.

With this game I want to spread awareness and hopefully crush some hurtful stereotypes about people struggling with mental health. And since I also am one of those people (borderline, bipolar and PTSD) I know how much these things can hurt us, whether it comes to employment, school, or just building relationships.

I will gladly answer any questions you have in DMs, so feel free to write to me.

30,My battle understanding my mental illnesses…(mainly schizophrenia),2,11xn72v,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/11xn72v/my_battle_understanding_my_mental_illnessesmainly/,2,"My journey understanding my condition with mental illness(Depression, bipolar, anxiety, schizophrenia, etc.) combined with religion.(Christianity)

I’ve spent my entire life being lost trying to understand why I am the way that I am.  I’ve lived a life full of sin, regret, misery, remorse, and being in fear.  When it comes to depression, I’m much better now than in days past.  Depression is a severe feeling of sadness with no hope of escaping.  I don’t know what the statistics of people who recover from depression are, but I assume very few overcome it.  I haven’t fully recovered from my depression, but I have managed over the years.  The Christian description of depression would probably be a feeling of condemnation.  A very deep regret for the sins you’ve committed in your lifetime.  And I guess you can’t escape this feeling but by seeking God and praying for salvation and forgiveness.

I would assume that bipolar is closely related to depression, with the exception of having extreme happy moments.  On one hand, with bipolar, you can have a sense of happiness, being very upbeat and optimistic with few troubles.  This can continue in long or short periods of time, then can be followed by equal time lengths of the complete opposite of happiness. The other side of bipolar is long or short bursts of negativism and pessimism with many troubles.  I guess to relate this to Christianity is to be experiencing tribulation.  You have to endure the hardships in this life and pursue God.  On this journey, you have to seek him relentlessly, you’ll have very happy moments and sad ones.  But when you find him you’ll be at peace.

My experience with anxiety.  I still experience anxiety to this day, but I’ve progressed tremendously over the years.  Being anxious is an awful feeling, you have difficulty sitting in one place for long periods of time.  You feel you have to keep moving frequently.  Also, you’re extremely nervous around other people and are scared to death about what they are thinking, just being around other people makes you uncomfortable.  The most basic definition I can give is an extreme sense of fear as the result of a troubled history.  To relate this to Christianity would be to maybe choosing the fear of the Lord.  Possibly choosing a life of precaution and fearing God.  I’m not a preacher, far from it.  I’m still pursuing God and am still in the beginning stages.

Finally, schizophrenia.  My understanding of schizophrenia is the inability to recognize the difference between reality and fantasy.  This is the worst mental illness, in my opinion, that any person could endure.  You perceive notions and ideas that seem totally realistic then later cause a sense of absolute fear and dread if those things become true.  The best example I can give is, living this life presently as your current self, then someday in the future becoming a famous singer or celebrity etc.  If possible…I’ll explain in a simpler manner, right now I’m a 32 year old male currently enrolled in college, and I’m under the impression that in the future, whether before I die or afterwards, I will turn into a famous person, (singer, actor, athlete, etc.) and I don’t know if this notion is plausible.  Realistic or something to disregard.  It seems awesome that I could be one of these people but with dreadful consequences with this belief.  I have an incredibly hard time describing this belief or way of perceiving.  I guess from a Christian standpoint, would be a complete mystery and such a difficult notion to possibly comprehend that no one, not even me could explain, only God understands this concept.

Thank you very much!

I have/had challenges with mental health and am a massive champion of therapy and mental wellbeing.

I don't totally know what I'm asking here, but if you have schizophrenia, how can/could/did your parents help/support you and what can I do to best help my girl? How can I give her the best chance of living with schizophrenia if it does develop?

Please read entirely before judging. Please don't jump to ""go to the doctor"", I've heard it enough times. Please just read. I need a more in depth answer.

I'm 17 years old, assigned female at birth, and I'm worried I might be developing schizophrenia (yes I've read the rules word-for-word, please keep reading before deleting my post). At the very least a combination of 1 or more disorders including psychosis (bpd, bipolar, psychotic depression, etc)

A few weeks ago I was diagnosed with C-PTSD. I currently have a therapist who I'm still warming up to. I have been taking an SSRI at half the highest dose for 2 years now. I started the SSRI because I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and General Anxiety Disorder. The SSRI helps with my anxiety, mood swings, and ptsd, but doesn't help with my depression.

My biological grandfather is schizophrenic and I first start experiencing bouts of psychosis when I was 11 years old. (Yes, actual full blown psychosis, not ""maybe"" psychosis). I've told my experiences to my mother multiple times but all she's done is shut me down or say ""that sucks"" and never bring it up again.

The past 8 months my mind keeps swinging back and forth between ""I'm definitely at risk for schizophrenia"" and ""there's absolutely nothing wrong with me"" every few weeks. I feel like I'm 3 people fighting eachother trapped in one body.

I'm terrified of doctors. 
Where do I start seeking help without being shut down, treated like I'm crazy, or immediately admitted to a psych ward? 
I'm terrified of losing my rights or being touched without consent. Terrified doesn't even come close to how I feel thinking about it.

I have some s*icidal ideation but I haven't truly attempted or planned for 2+ years now. But my psychotic symptoms are getting worse and I just want it to get better without doctors poking and prodding at me.

I’m a 27 year old male who got diagnosed with Schizophrenia and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. I probably have an undiagnosed form of ADHD. I’m going to my psychiatrist next time about the possibility of ADHD diagnosis.

I personally stopped taking my antipsychotic and antidepressant medications like 3 months ago. I had informed my psychiatrist and therapist of my decision.

Without my psychiatric medications, weird things started to happen in my mind and body. 

Gradually, I have increasing weird symptoms/experiences of the following:

I experience strong and clear impression on my senses and heightened emotions especially lovely feelings with lust combined.

I can feel almost all the range of emotions in a music, like it’s a feeling of a running wavelength and I’m experiencing the far highs all the way to the deep lows like a dynamic, continuous roller coaster as the music plays

Side note: I have a strong passion for electronic dance music especially the house and future house music genres. I feel like I want to dance the way some women in nightclubs dance, and I’m not shy about it.

Vivid appearances of existing, beautiful/attractive women that are very stimulating/pleasing effect on my mind. It feels like a highly adaptive/selective mania when it comes to the feminine beauty.
- very strong colors, some extra brightness-added effect, very high in chroma of hair, face, skin tone, clothes, shoes, etc.
- Face makeups/cosmetics
- The feminine bodily curves 
- feels like I have a special eye lens to those I’m attracted to.

The voices (not auditory hallucinations) of women also brings up heightened feelings of excitement, love, and lust.

Basically, whenever I interpret someone/something/idea as attractive/beautiful, it automatically produces super-heightened mixed feelings of excitement, love, and lust that varies depending on the context.

I’m feeling erotic pressure sensations throughout my body whenever I physically stimulate with self-sexual intentions in my mind. 

Side note: I was just exploring my bodily manifestations of schizophrenia. To be honest, I don’t have any malicious intent on my own body.

It feels like the touch/pressure nerve signals throughout my body have the capacity to integrate with the normal pleasure pathway signals of the male reproductive system that go through the involved neural connections in my brain.

I’m glad I have good enough self-control and discipline as I don’t act out on inappropriate/perverted urges and temptations that sometimes arise in my mind.

These are just parts of all the things I experience in my Schizophrenia. 

I too have visual and auditory hallucinations. I have difficulties in thinking too.

Thanks for reading. It’s very nice to be part of this sub. 

Have a good day to you all!",1679340833.0

I am a twenty-three years old female. I was diagnosed with unspecified schizophrenia disorder and I don’t know that that means or if I trust it. I am sorry if anything here comes off as disrespectful.

Hey everyone, I was recently taken into an urgent care facility that only focuses on mental health. My wife had been noticing my behavior was becoming pretty strange, I was getting more and more paranoid and “disconnected” from my surroundings, and I was having a lot of hallucinations both visual and audible waking up and going to sleep, however never when I was fully awake. I was also experiencing delusions but I won’t go into that unless I need to. 

When I went to the urgent care I had explained that I frequently feel unreal, like almost as if I’m high but I’m completely sober. I went on to say when this happens I start to feel really uncomfortable, anxious, and generally unsafe and almost unfamiliar with my surroundings. It almost feels like if I could describe how I visually perceive the world as sound the way I would use to describe it is “too loud”.  

She asked me a bunch of questions on other things I’ve been experiencing and I was told what I’m going through is psychosis. I don’t actually know if what I’m going through is that or not because I’m always aware that things feel off or scary or what have you and even when I’m delusional or paranoid I know that I’m just being paranoid or something. I thought a hallmark of psychosis what’s that you’re unaware? 

I’m starting to ramble and I have a million things to say and a million questions to ask but does anyone know if I can rule out what’s going on my own? I know something is wrong with me,and I know it’s only getting worse but I don’t think I’m for sure able to trust that’s it’s what the doctor says. I think it could be depersonalization and derealization and not psychosis. I have no explanation for my mood/behavior/delusions though.

Tldr: Diagnosed with unspecified schizophrenia disorder and psychotic disorder along with my preexisting condition of BPD. I am waiting for another appointment and I’m taking medicine for what they say I have until then but I still feel awful and scared. Side note schizophrenia runs in my family, if I truly have it I’ll be number 6 who has it.",1679341017.0

My friend Harold developed schizophrenia as an adult.  We used to be good friends in high school so I had reached out the other day to see how he was.

He seemed friendly and we shared a meal at a coffee shop, but I noticed he seemed to have sudden inappropriately facial gestures, disorganized speech, tended to get quiet or loud, went on rants, and would start repeating things.

He essentially told me thanks for the invite but that he's better off alone as he hates me cause I'm ""one of those people"". Then went on a rant about how bad life is for him and lonely he feels, but then how much he loves his life so I shouldn't worry and to leave him alone. He finally just said bye and left 

I get how hard it is for him to have this condition and that people in the past have treated him differently cause of it, but I tried being a supportive friend and listened to him.

Essentially he told me to get lost and I can respect that, but at the same time I'm left worried that he's pushed literally everyone in his circle and family away and how detrimental that can be. 

I'll give him his space, but I'm kind of left wondering if I should give up on the relationship (I'd hate for that to happen)... Or does anyone have any thoughts or advice?",1679318670.0

https://www.reddit.com/r/HighStrangeness/comments/y55zh6/magick_explained_by_the_cia_perfectly_repetition/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share 

So I had this hypothesis about a language that can make you psychic in a sense. Basically, language is arbitrary, but there are many markers found in different languages. The sapir whorf hypothesis that our world view is changed depending on what language we speak and think in. 

So if you really wanted to, you could create a brand new language that would make you psychic. How? First we look at what other languages are doing. The few examples I know of are. Russians being able to discern different blues because they have so many words for blue. A desert tribe in Africa that uses the cardinal directions instead of left and right. An island language that changes when you become an adult man. Chinese  having only present tense. There is also the money centric and comparison laden English ge that would make you prophetic language. 

So if we really wanted to, we could create a languabut also able to move things with your mind. Even if the world view, strong, has been debunked then we could always slowly change our species to be psychic. Instead of living on old languages that were shaped by the culture. Instead we could, the link says with enough repetition you can change reality, make a pretty good new language and become psychic

I got ripped apart in r/conlang for mentioning this like the movie ""the arrival"" which was based on the sapir whorf hypothesis, which prob plays on semantics on why some languages might be innately psychic in nature.

Anyways just wanna say to hell with those linguists lol. I hate them for hating on my delusion that you could create a psychic language to rewire your brain. Or even use language as a form of therapy for schizophrenia, which I've been giving advice about but no one really believes me that listening to foreign music you don't understand can slow down your thoughts just enough for some relief.",1679332798.0

when I'm aware I see my personality changed I'm emotionless cold  reclusive my eyes are dead I'm catatonic my brain in foggy I see demons everywhere the trees glitch I hear voices they say terrible things my brothers say Im delusional also i feel depersonalization-derealization
everything feels altered and like I shouldn't be looking at it.  it feels like I'm constantly in a liminal space I feel empty even though I have everything I feel alone though I'm not maybe I actually am alone my dad doesn't even listen when I try to get help.

when I see people they seem lifeless
everything feels desolate devoid of life except demons and voices desolate but I feel watched dead but I'm alive I definitely don't want to be I draw what I feel it will deeply compel  or disturb anyone I show I posted it and a few people that saw it we're schizophrenics some broke out in tears others
said they felt the same way

 I heard a quote:  ""art disturbs the calm and calms the disturbed"" 

everyone I meet either thinks I'm autistic or askes if I'm ok some want me to explain them I do yet no one cares

Im heartless, emotionless, fearless I feel nothing at all nothing for anyone I have Alot of family I feel no connection they feel like strangers even my mom I've never really had friends only two everyone could die right now and I wouldn't feel nothing not even shead a tear anyways I have none left nothing to give no one
before this happened I used to be the nicest person I was homeless I got Christmas presents I gave them all away to kids who didn't have any until I had nothing left and I only got put to the ground because I was nice no one cares in this world 
now look what happened it made me schizoid 

my eyes are dead
I feel nothing
I want no one

One of the problems I ran into several times when I was attempting to seek immediate help during an episode -- is that they would ask a question similar to the title about whether you are experiencing some symptoms of psychosis/schizophrenia but because I didn't understand what that meant (for me, at least)... I would say no. I am ""high functioning"", or at least they see me that way, so any symptoms I tried to bring up were dismissed as unrelated. It wasn't until I finally stopped them and said, ""***What*** do you mean by that?! People keep asking that but when I try to tell them they say I'm clearly not psychotic and dismiss it"". It was then, as I started to explain what I had been experiencing for several years (actively *trying* to get help for it, knowing *something* wasn't right), that we finally worked to eliminate/exhaust all other options with 6 - 12 months of outpatient observation to determine if it was Schizophrenia or not. I'm curious what others experience with this. If you are in need of immediate care, in the middle of an episode, or obviously just losing it... yet still seemingly perfectly sane and ""normal"" on the outside... do people notice or do they dismiss you entirely? Did anyone else not understand what was meant due to stigmas and unable to get the proper help when originally seeking it? The clearly obvious symptoms that I know now I have which are part of this condition still wouldn't be outwardly observable during most interactions with others... It's... in my head. I interact with others outside of my home to briefly for them to observe anything significant other than thinking I may be a little weird. Lol.

Anyone on this subreddit who presents mainly with hebephrenic/""disorganized""^(1) symptoms to the exclusion of other classically schizophrenic symptoms, and who has benefited from clozapine? What have your experiences been like with both pre-clozapine disorganization and post-clozapine disorganization?

On a similar note, if there *are* people who fit this category of pure hebephrenic benefiters from clozapine (which I assume there are, possibly just more rarely occurring), I'm curious as to why we don't see more off-label usage of clozapine for severe forms of ADHD involving disorganization.  This ties back to what dictates a severe enough level of disorganization in thought and/or speech as to dictate usage of an antipsychotic, or if the usage of the antipsychotic is indicated when there is dopamine supersensitivity in the striatum making stimulants (methylphenidate, amphetamines, etc) problematic to use as they can then *bring out* previously latent ""positive symptoms"" like proper hallucinatory voices and so on. Which then further reinforces the ""subtypes of schizophrenia"" model where there could be some people who are virtually indistinguishable from people with ADHD in terms of their speech and even thought patterns, but have some ""dopamine supersensitivity"" proneness giving them the diagnosis of schizophrenia, and for whom treatments may uniquely need to be devised.

^(1). I'm using scare quotes because disorganization is itself a multi-faceted in cause and level of pathological implication, sort of concept. See this articulately worded description by another user on this subreddit here in a comment on this post: [(1) Would this count as ""disorganized speech""? (and looking for other examples) : schizophrenia (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/wnqgjm/would_this_count_as_disorganized_speech_and/)

My father has been diagnosed with schizophrenia since long time ago, around +20 years ago and his condition through the years went worse, he used to be fine if he took his meds on time, at first when he used to take his medication or when he goes to the hospital if his condition became bad after they release him he became fine, but now nothing works at all not the medication nor the hospital, they even can't accept him if something happened, they just give him his meds monthly.

The problem with my father that he is a heavy heavy smoker, he used to smoke lightly before he got sick, but after his diagnosis he became addict and can't control himself, if we didn't monitoring him and restricting him he will consume more than 2 or 3 packets in a day.

Now he has inflamed lungs, so if he has any organic disease that requires anesthetic or injection they can't treat him because of his lungs, they asks us to treat his lungs first and stop him from smoking, but we can't, he's stubborn and he turn into a violent behavior like shouting and disturbing us if we don't give him cigarettes.

The other problem is the big one for my family, he goes outside our home wandering around, he has no ID or a phone because of his mental illness, oneday, long time ago he went into a car wash station and wanted to shower then the police took him, next he took his passport and went to another country and recently he went to his old company he used to work in then the security called the police and they took him, we been searching for him like crazies, we can't hold him like a hostage in a small room yet we can't let him out!

We are trying but we don't know what to do, I want my father to be cured, at least I want his consciousness to return into his mind and to stop smoking no problem with me if he still on meds but at least I want to see some results.

Instincts rule, a primal blur.

But as we grow, we shed our skin,

Evolving from the beast within.

&#x200B;

A race we run with more inertia,

Some weighed down, some flew too far.

But in this struggle, we'll find our own,

A new identity to call our home.

&#x200B;

We reach the threshold, a brand new day,

Walking tall, in our own way.

But as we soar, we lose our roots,

Neglecting what we held as truth.

&#x200B;

Some crawl back to what they know,

The safety of the familiar, refusing to grow.

But others find the strength to hold on,

Embracing change, with each new dawn.

&#x200B;

We've flown too high, for some it's true,

But others stayed, for far too few.

A balance found, a life reborn,

A future bright, a new world born.

&#x200B;

A novel existence, is it feasible?

To sever ties with our primal feel?

Let me pen my own song,

Craft my lyrics where I belong.

Let me sing this new melody for you to see,

A path yet untraveled, a fate yet to be.

&#x200B;

This journey never ends, we'll always strive,

A constant push to stay alive.

A race we run, with no finish line,

The weather wants you to surrender,

the weather wants to play with its food.

The weather wants you to consume,

to serve, to submit, to die if it asks you to.

Easter bunnies laugh in delight

as the negative space throbs

with form and electricity

and just when the actors hit their marks

and the lights shine bright,

the medicine man declares

that everything is evil,

but our hero draws his cigarette

and snarls that everything is innocent

while shooting stars

hallucinate themselves

under a perfect half-moon.

in defiance of your telepathic game show.

I tried to ask these questions below to my doctor who gave me the doomed (remember: the literature says hebephrenia has the WORST neuroprogressive and functional outcome, worse than even the voices-type paranoid presentation, and results in eventual dementia in majority of the cases) hebephrenia diagnosis,  but he just thought I was arguing and ""splitting hairs"" and that I needed to accept my diagnosis and stop wasting time.

Here is what I attempted to ask him:

1. Why is my thinking considered ""disorganized""? Please be as substantiated in your response as possible because it matters for me to have an accurate model of myself and to know, why on earth, the things I say are intrinsically meaningless (aka disorganized). Is it because A)  you are comparing it to some imaginary potential for me without the supposed disorganization? And if so, *why* is that imagination of yours credible, if you haven't even encountered it?   
Or is it that B) my thinking is disorganized with respect to some average person? Average person of comparable IQ? Person of average IQ? Average person in some other sense, because IQ is a meaningless descriptor, racially biased, etc.  Average in *what?* So on. And if the latter, why, given the average person is far more incoherent for the \*same level of information density\* than me? And if it's not the case that they are far more incoherent, please give examples.

2. Why is the diagnosis of schizophrenia conferred rather than ADHD, based in part it seems, on the increased fragmentation of thought in response to stimulants? If presence of agitation is a criteria that separates out the schizophrenics, I am confused, as people with ADHD have been reported to have trouble regulating emotions. If paranoia is the additional criteria, then why I am I considered paranoid given the threats I spoke of in the past were legitimate? The cut off in diagnosis seems unclear--what is the ""sweet spot"" of disorganization as to solely land oneself in the territory of ADHD? How is it operationalized?

3. I've learned the verbal/affective game through extensive roleplay, being an actress and learning the *normal* (dare I say, boring and lacking in descriptiveness?) verbal patterns, as to simulate myself as a person with no mental conditions.  I can be impeccably organized when I rattle off details about scientific papers at this point, and have gotten such feedback from my peers.  I only regret not *playing the game* early enough in my treatment as to indicate a more squarely Asperger's like presentation and demonstrate an extremely high degree of intelligence and organization of thought, and instead resorted to bro-like jokes, the kind exchanged in the moldy narrows of alleys and playgrounds and a weed smoke ridden haze of dreamlike thought, thinking that *that* was the way to build rapport, after I got so much feedback in my teens that I was too rigid and not being ""chill"" enough to interact with my peers.  

Would playing this game, presenting an utterly precise and organized affect (by simply *not reaching* for material that may be beyond my current cognitive limits--as there is a negative relationship between the complexity in the topic one is trying to describe and their organization of it), for a sufficient enough time, be enough evidence to scrap the schizophrenia diagnosis? Or would the fact that I shared free-association dream like thought and spoke of the pain I've experienced in life through a joking, sometimes even emotionally heightened lens, be a permanent ""black mark on my record, far more indelible than even a criminal record?",1679172240.0

I know he needs to see a doctor/psychiatrist, that’s the plan, but we haven’t spoken to him about it yet and I just need some sort of advice or reassurance.

My brother is 22 and I am 20. We haven’t always been close but these days we spend a lot of time together and I’ve started to notice some abnormal behaviours that I didn’t see before.

-My main concern is that he recently confided in me about a delusion he experienced a few months ago, while high on THC concentrates. He believed his neighbours, two women in the apartment above and beside him, were evil witches, and that a hole in his ceiling was a camera they were watching him through. He said he felt very frightened by it and wanted to run away. He says he knew/knows it was not real but it still scared him.

-Another thing that worries me is sometimes he shares theories and ideas he has that don’t make much sense. He is *very* intelligent and philosophical by nature so he has always enjoyed discussing the meaning of life, human nature, etc. But lately I’ve noticed his theories are disjointed and confusing although they seem to make perfect sense to him.

-We both have smoked weed since we were teenagers but he uses dabs/THC concentrates and oils while I just smoke plain flower. When he uses dabs I notice the disjointed thought patterns a lot more. He also drinks a lot of hard liquor and has a history of depression.

So I guess I’m just wondering if any of you kind folks would be inclined to think these are symptoms of schizophrenia.

Now it is worth, and I find myself telling the voice to be quiet and it’s like I can’t breathe. There has also been other things like the time I thought a woman trapped inside my wall, and i used to hear her scream at me. I was also convinced that when Covid happened aliens would coke for me. I was actually terrified in the night. I also used to have king of “visions” of a white humanoid figure randomly. Another big one is that I believe I have a type of control over the universe and can make things happen with my mind. Are these signs of SZ?

I thought I'd share some habits and stuff I do frequently to not harm my body when my mental health is low. Not everything is doable or affordable for everyone, I know, but maybe you find some stuff helpful. I also don't do everything all the time, sometimes I don't manage and on very bad days I don't do any of it. But frequency is key, so a really bad day doesn't shake up my health. 

# Every day:

**Mornings:** 

\- after waking up I let some **fresh air into my room** and sometimes I even shake up my bed. I always let fresh air in though

\- straight to the bathroom (I always have to go in the morning). I use a **manual bidet** so I feel clean down there, even if I don't manage to shower. I also put my feet up in a squat position so I'm done really fast

\- I **drink 750 ml of water every morning** and **add my supplement drops** into it. I have a big jar I use to drink out off, so I start my day off with lots of water. On good days, I add some lemon for taste. I fill up my big water bottle (1,5 l) so I can drink enough throughout the day.

\- **Brush teeth with electrical brush** (less exhausting and more effective). To be fair, I don't always manage to brush my teeth in the morning. I always try though. 

\- change into **clean underwear**. Makes me feel so much nicer.

\- **no internet** for at least the first hour or two in the morning

\- some stretching on good days

**Evenings:**

\- I always have dinner (see general tips further below)

\- Let **fresh air** into my room while I **brush my teeth**, **wash my face** (on good days) and **use the toilet** (so I don't have to go at night)

\- no phone in bedroom

\- on times where I had trouble with hallucinations and sleep paralysis in the dark I wore **wax ear buds** and a **sleeping mask**, so I know instantly I hallucinate because I can't physically see or hear

\- **Big bottle of water** next to my bed so I don't have to get up to get water

\- I don't always have breakfast, but if I do, I have **porridge with berries (frozen) and oat milk I make in the microwave** (2 minutes and super healthy). Sometimes I add nuts. On bad days I just have nuts and an apple or nothing

# General tips that made my life easier:

\- on good days i **cook massive amounts (8 Portions) of freezable stuff (like red lentil curry)** and put it in containers to freeze, so I still can have healthy food when I feel like shit. Also I don't have the pressure to eat it all in a week, it can stay in there for months

\- healthy **canned soups** for days I don't have anything in the freezer

\- **rice cooke**r is a life saver!!! you just put rice and water in it and it does it's thing. You can also use whole grain rice for the extra fiber

\- **frozen slices of whole grain bread** i put in the toaster and vegetable spread for when I don't feel like making food. Sometimes I add a carrot or so

\- **no or very little sweets or unhealthy snacks** (I'm mostly too lazy to eat them anyways)

\- having **no smartphone** helped my focus so much, still struggle sometimes though

\- **wash cloth, deodorant and dry shampoo** for when I can't shower (and the bidet for the intimate area)

\- **short hair** because it takes longer to grow to a certain length and is easier to maintain

\- I love climbing, so I always make sure I go to the climbing gym, even when I struggle. It's the one thing I really force myself to, because I don't want to lose my gains and I would regret that when I feel better. It makes me feel good in my body and helps with my mental health. It's good to f**ind a sport that you really enjoy**

\- **yin yoga** for days I really can't move. You just do basic stretches on the floor and don't move for minutes, but it still makes the body feel better. 

\- **hot water bottles** (I use boiling water) give comfort for when I need a hug or feel cold inside (or out). I put them on my chest when I have anxiety

\- **dish washer**

\- I **don't iron my clothes** or seperate them before washing. I just throw them in and hang them up, it does the job and tbh doesn't look a lot different

\- write everything down in a **physical calenda**r I check frequently so I don't forget (appointments, things I need to do/buy, deadlines...)

# for the people with periods and menstrual cycles:

\- **menstrual cup** makes me not hate my period so much (I only have to change it twice a day as compared to 5 or 6 times a day), 

\- **comfy menstrual underwear** for the extra layer of protection

\- **agnus castus** to take care of my very bad pms

\- **tracking my period** (very hard for me to do) so I know if mental health struggles are connected to my cycle

# for the people that work on a computer/study:

\- I listen to **classical music or techno beats when reading**, it helps my focus and understanding. As long as the music is rythmic and has no vocals, it's good for focus

\- **blue light filter** turned on always",1679066073.0

for the third time. my brother has committed the heinous act of defiling religious statues. because he takes the Torah literally almost word for word; and thinks that the statues are forms of idolatry. god tells him to do these things. 

well, this time he got himself deported (from Israel, where he's been 1.5 years) cuz of it.

he's been in an Israeli psych hospital for 7 weeks. i know very little of his status except what my mom says, and shs does not have a very good grip on reality. she's delusional when it comes to him.

it seems like my moms willing to sacrifice everything for my brother.

well, he's supposed to be deported to us in less than 2 weeks now. we don't know if he has violent thoughts or if he has had violent command hallucinations. we don't know if he wants to re-enact Abraham's covenant with god and kille his own son to prove his faith.

we know almost nothing because he, for the first time in 25 years of this nightmare, has refused to allow the psychiatrist to discuss information about him with my mother.

also, my mom has been under such EXTREME stress that she had to be emergently hospitalized for broken heart syndrome -- literally when the human is under SUCH SEVERE emotional distress that thejr heart fails. she is ok but she could have died and has a long road to rexovery.

for perspective this is a condition I've seen in Ukrainian refugees whose homes have been bombed and families killed. (i am a nurse.). that's how intensely stressful this has been for her. 

that doesn't mean she's got a grip on reality though.
she does not grasp the sense of danger all the rest of us feel (especially his ex wife for their 11 year old Catholic son.)

246,How do I talk to my schizophrenic sister?,7,11tqpi3,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/11tqpi3/how_do_i_talk_to_my_schizophrenic_sister/,6,"Hi everyone,

I'm writing to ask for help with communicating with my schizophrenic sister. I believe she is actually paranoid schizophrenic, based on her previous history, but now she seems a bit better somehow. She refuses to take any kind of medication, however, and when asked to go to the doctor, she gets very angry and refuses because she believes that the doctors will hurt her. We have gone back and forth over the years talking through email, but sometimes she goes many months such as the last period which was around 11 months of no contact. She often believes things that aren't true and has delusions as well as opinions and thoughts that are not logical at all.

We are now speaking again, but I feel like I am walking on eggshells because anything that I say she can potentially take as a threat and then she will stop talking to me again.

I don't know how to speak with her a lot of times, because for example, she believes that the United States is a communist country and will defend that to the very last. She told me that smoking cigarettes is outlawed in America. She also believes that myself and my other sister are planning to hurt her, even though I live in another country and my other sister doesn't even have a car and lives further away from her. She has admitted in the past that she believes myself and my mother were going to murder her, and she had thought about murdering us first. I fully believe her as well that she had these thoughts and I am actually thankful that I'm in a completely different country now because that frightens me.

I don't know if I should somehow give in to (some) of the delusions that she has or if I should argue against them, I don't want to say anything to push her away, but at the same time I don't believe many things that she says because they simply aren't true even if they are true to her perspective. Should I simply ignore those things and move on to a different subject or how should I react? 

Any information would be helpful, I would really like to keep communicating with her if possible, but it is so very difficult because of her schizophrenia. I don't want her to shut me out as she's done before. 

Thanks again!",1679058683.0

Hi all,

I hope everyone is doing well? I don't want to cause any offence so I deeply apologise if I do.

Last week, my wife kept saying she had brain fog, then struggled to sleep and eventually on Sunday looked like she had woken up after having a stroke or something. She wasn't making any sense whatsoever and was slurring her words.

Over the next few days she gradually became extremely paranoid. She thought that everyone was out to get her. She kept hearing police sirens and eventually tired to run away as she thought she wasn't allowed in the house any more. On Tuesday (her birthday), I decided to make the decision to take her to A&E, at which point she was section 2'd under the Mental Health Act.

when I visited her the next day, it was like she didn't even know who I am which was heart breaking. Her symptoms were mostly as follows:

* Extreme Anxiety
* Extreme Paranoia
* Hearing and seeing some things.
* delusional thoughts that could not be shaken. She was adamant they were true.
* Not eating, not looking after herself.
* No emotions, I was crying and she just looked at me with a blunt face.
* She could not organise her words at all.
* Repeating and recycling the same words and phrases all linked to her job.

She has never shown any even slight symptoms as far as I'm aware. I think what triggered this is her job, as it's stressful, she was working too many hours due to lack of staff, and there was also a significant event happen which meant she had to write a witness statement. She blamed her self for the event for some reason, and kept thinking she had been fired and the police were coming to get her. She had done nothing wrong.

She has gone from being the most bubbly, caring, kind hearted person you will ever meet, to someone with no emotion, very little memory and it is heart breaking.

The doctors think that it is likely stress / sleep deprivation which has caused the psychosis, but I'm so scared it's schizophrenia as her Grandma had this, but no other family members.

I guess my questions are:

* How long does this usually take to recover from?
* Is stress / lack of sleep psychosis likely as it was so acute?
* What can I do to help best?
* What things can help in this situation that I can take her?
* I'm also interested to know more from people who have recovered similar situations and how long it took. I'd like to be prepared for the worst so I can give the best support possible.

I really appreciate any help you can provide.",1679054866.0

I am male, 26 y/o. I like to read books and though it may be difficult sometimes I try to engage myself with other people’s writing everyday. I like to read because it gives me insight and I get to know people through the characters they create if it is a novel. Time to time I dust my calculus book to practice math. Do you like to read? If so, what do you like to read? Now I am reading Sycamore Row by John Grisham and The Man in the High Castle by Philip K. Dick. Totally different books, I know, but I find it entertaining to find similarities between two different worlds.

The Voices became more apparent in 2020. I am currently taking 60mg fluoxetine in the morning, 200mg quetiapine nightly, and a monthly shot of airiprazole with another 10mg during the day. I think this treatment is working for me. I am taking vitamins as well. Let me know if you’d like to know what vitamins I am taking - there are a lot. I am covered by insurance if you are wondering how I am able to afford treatment.

i was seeing a therapist for a while for other  stuff but i had to stop going since i was essentially tired of giving  away information to the enemy (not referring to the therapist) and while  i think thats kind of inherent of all therapy/“help”, im not sure my  better options. i am about 90ish maybe more percent certain that what i  believe is true (it is true, i need to say this) but i do occasionally  have doubts (even though it is true) that perhaps i am experiencing a  mental health issue, previous therapist while i did not get into the  details too much described these as “delusions”, i stopped seeing her  shortly after that for the reason i mentioned at the beginning of this  paragraph.

i guess my issue is i cannot tell if this is real or not (its real)  and its kind of ruining my life! majorly. the stress of all of this and  my other issues which i should be seeing a therapist for is really  causing me a lot of problems. im trying to hold on, you know not hurt  myself or end it all but im really exhausted. so i guess what im doing  here is indeed a cry for help. im not really sure what could come of  this. i can’t explain the details of what i believe, nor can i really  trust anyone like at all. i know any responses to me if im right (which i  am) would be controlled too. so theres actually not really any hope.  but considering my best option at the moment would be ending my life  which maybe isnt such a bad idea but it would be quite painful since i  do not have a good method to end my life aside from very painful ones,  im doing this anyways… i guess. just in case maybe what i believe and  all isn’t… somehow true which i think is pretty ridiculous considering  all which i know but you know i don’t really WANT to believe any of  this. i may have been graced with a very serious and important truth but  its kind of actually terrible!

until i can get this issue sorted out i cannot work on my other  issues and all of this is only destroying my mental health. i dont even  know what im doing. all of this is just so much im so tired of all of  this and its all so scary and i just. the mental anguish of not knowing  and going back and forth and feeling like a fucking idiot for giving  away information when its obviously true then having a mild moment of  wondering what if this isnt true and then getting upset because its just  their own influence on my brain and

been emailing people and the program that people said to contact is  full so i am kind of stuck i do not know what to do i am not sure this  is even an okay place to write this i mean i dont know what i am even  doing at this point i am experiencing other things similar and i do  recognize they wouldbe considered i guess maybe something of this sort  but then again they can be explained so i dont even know what to do… i  am also 16. some of this stuff started a few years ago but its becomign more and more and i am having a more serious thought on suicide and other things and i am worried of safety of me/others or something maybe

i would give more information on it but i cant

i do not know if this is a good place to write it once again please  dont be mean im just not sure what to do ive run out of options, checked  all therapists/psychologists n stuff with my insurance, contacted  county emergency thing, just nothing. im thinking ill probably just end  it, i cant take all this its too much for me

"" If you are concerned, please see a doctor. "" i cant by the way! i cant find any! i don i dont i dont think i could trust them anyway either or something what am i even doing holy shit i really should just end it i think

TW re:auditory halucinations, jealousy 
.
.
.
Sorry if I break a rule since I'm not that familiar with reddit and my desire to debrief is stronger than my motivation to read rules.
I hear voices as I type this. It's annoying rn but it could be all consuming later. Hopefully not.

I feel like I had a breakdown last week. After years of trying to find and maintain stable housing since I aged out of care I thought I found a decent place with a roommate that's nice.
Almost too nice in a way. I feel like I get suspicious of things going good all the time because I'm always waiting for the penny to drop.
Anyhow I had okay housing for the first time for almost a year now - now its not sustainable since it's out of my price range, but it's mine. (And my roommates.) They appear to have healthy boundaries about understanding depression when I don't do the dishes for a while. They too struggle. I worry that they're being too lenient. We'll now their cousins are about to be homeless and I feel pressured to look for housing so that their cousins can move in - but I'm a full-time student and am burnt out. It's nearly the end of the semester and I'm so far behind.
---
Back to the breakdown:
I'm laying in bed scrolling through social media and I start hearing an argument from the people upstairs. I tune it out at first since it's not too rare. But I start picking up on bits and pieces and the more I listen the more it seems like the people upstairs arguing with my roomate. 
They're swearing and yelling and their baby is crying my roommate raises their voice and begs them to reconsider.
It's been going on for 20 minutes so I am getting upset and worry about being kicked out by association although what my rm says is logical. So I text my roommate telling him that he should come back down. I reach out to my significant other through text and explain that I'm scared things might get physical.
He responds in a non-committal way.

I get a text back from my rm. It's just question marks ""??"" They message further and say they're not home and it's likely the landlord isn't home since the landlord sent an email saying they'd be away. (This is true. I haven't confirmed if they were there are not). 

So I was hearing very loud auditory halucinations (I assume) that freaked me out. I already have a history of invalidation regarding my auditory hallucinations which first appeared one day after smoking week.

Tl;dr
I was probably hearing voices which could be from stressed induced psychosis. I have a diagnosis of ADHD and depression and a brief history of drug induced psychosis (don't do weed folks)

I just am so overwhelmed by life right now. I dropped à class and still have to tell my social worker. I'm so tired but when I have time to rest I just search social media.

So much to the point that i didnt leave a single room for two weeks but i guess lockdown made that easier. I could see down the corridor and knew no one was there yet that didnt solve anything. I could still hear the door close and the light switch flick on and off very occasionally so i was very scared. I dont know exactly what you would call this but they sound like delusions and hallucinations. But i have had no experience quite like it, only minor persecutors delusions which dont last more than five minutes and happen once or twinge a month.
I tend to be suspicious of people for no good reason other than chance, some people i am suspicious and some people not, no clear separation. 
Around three years ago i was diagnosed with slow processing because of my drop in school performance. And at the same time i basically refused to do work outside of lessons. Could this be a sign of schizo instead. The lack of motivation part of it and the fact that i am a disorganised person and my thoughts are completely all over the shop. I tried to take part in a debate and the judge asked if i was told the subject of the debate before it started and that it made zero sense. Essays have never worked for me and i can not get them done well. I have never gotten over sixty percent in an essay in the six or so years I have had to do them.
I have always spoken in a monotone voice and still do. I struggle with eye contact yet i would say that i am not autistic seeing as i seem to be able to communicate with friends well. But at the same time my emotions have followed themselves and whatever is happening the only thing to change my mood is a pack of cigarettes.

I dont know if i am being some kind of pussy who thinks they have schizo because they googled it. So thats why i came to you. Ask questions about me if that would help you understand. I appreciate all help.",1678971972.0

The first episode lasted for approximately 14 days, and it took me some time to gradually recover from it. The other two episodes lasted between two to four days, and I sought treatment each time at the psych ward.

During my first hospitalization, I was diagnosed with schizophrenia and giftedness. The doctors told me that my intelligence acted as a protective barrier against irrational thoughts, which made me lucky compared to other people. Even under psychosis, I can still make rational decisions and remain calm amidst my unconscious thoughts.

&#x200B;

My academic background includes chemical engineering and computer science, which have given me a certain understanding of the physical and digital intricacies of this universe. However, schizophrenia has also introduced a 'spiritual' (notice the quotes) side to my life.

This study of 304 people diagnosed with schizophrenia shows that a large portion of people diagnosed with schizophrenia have brains indistinguishable from 'normal' ones. Of course, they don't quite go far enough, and suggest that this indicates that there are 'two types'; it's not at all unlikely that there are many more than two types, though it might be fair to say that we might be able to more or less divide those diagnosed into two categories. It's also worth mentioning that this is 304 people diagnosed with SZ chosen at random, compared with 360-something other random people, so who knows *exactly* the numbers on how many people's brains are normotype vs. heterotype, but that's science.

In a perfect world, one would have analyzed what symptoms people actually have, instead of this PANSS score bullshit, but clearly no one thought very hard about that one. Numbers or bust, as usual. There's also probably something that can be drawn about the influence of medication, and the suggestion that perhaps medication might not actually prevent damage, or at least that of it which is visible, but that would require digging rather more into the data.

Maybe this is just a bit of theoretical paranoia on my part, but it really seems weird to me this division exists, but yet all you ever hear is 'schizophrenic brains look all messed up,' or, maybe occasionally, 'you lose a teaspoon of brain matter in an episode,' or summat. I realize that doing this could invite people to scry for faces in the graphological clouds, but why are spreads of values and graphs of *all* relevant points often left out of studies and trials, and certainly never even alluded to in popular science literature? Sometimes great things are easily made to look mediocre, and stuff that worked *really* well for maybe a fifth of patients, while doing nothing for anyone else, could imaginably get dressed up as 'successful'.

What is something that i can do or she can do to keep her grounded? 

What are some meds yall would recommend if it comes to that? (This one should be for a licensed medical professional but i wanna hear how some have affected people)

Does it really gotten worse overtime?

Do any of yall (who are on meds) wish you started them sooner?

It was in December I had gone on break and like a freight train it hit- it started with extreme dissociations. Then the hallucinations started. Audio and visual and for months i suffered with this as I thought I was just having extremely bad anxiety attacks.


But after having a Episode at my grandparents house where I nearly ended my life. I got help I was able to get in therapy and the a few weeks later into a Psychiatrist, who diagnosed me schizophrenic by the end of that day I had my meds…and things started to change. I was so happy never ever really upset me I became the person I wanted to.


Hell I even got a girlfriend who teats me like a god….but within the last few weeks everything has changed. I am 19 years old so I was still on my parents insurance. They had no problem with this and wanted me to stay on it unless I was 26.



But our insurance is through my dads work. And in one of their terms once someone files as a independent on their taxes they can no longer be on the policy. We didn’t find this out until early December of 2022…after enrollment for my workplace insurance was up.


I had to stop see my Therapist my psychologist. And worse off all my run out of both my meds. At first it was okay but not everything is getting worse. My hallucinations are starting to slowly but surely come back and then I was unable to sleep I have laid awake for hours not getting more then two or three of sleep before having to get up for work. and the voice  and dissociation made their grand entrance tonight. I know it’s just a matter of time before I start having full blown episodes again.


I worked so hard to get this under control. I did everything the doctors told me to do. I was up front with people about my symptoms. I fought the urge to literally fuckin kill myself just so I could have my life destroyed again?


I could handle my girlfriend having to watch me go through a episode as they can last hours and hours of me self harming, talking to myself, rocking, and screaming and cry and begging it to just stop and leave me alone.


We are supposed to move into a place together in August….we are supposed to start our story together. And now I feel so helpless I don’t want to break up with her as she is my everything. But I don’t want to put her through months of hell watching me slowly regress to the person I was before we meet.


That person was weak. Scared of everything. And would harm themselves every night so the voice would just stop telling them how useless and pathetic they were…


I don’t even know what to do….I haven’t even told her or my BFFS",1678770184.0

She told me she wasn’t completely sure and wanted to see me again next week (this week) so she could be 100% sure.

I was kind of hoping it would be the latter. I’ve been off my medications because I genuinely believe nothing is wrong with me and that my ‘symptoms’ are completely normal/everyone goes through them but she let me know this was possibly another delusion. I don’t believe that it is but I feel like I should believe the person who has a PhD in Psychiatry. She wants me to get back on my Abilify so that I could feel better and I just kind of have to listen to her at this point. I feel like there’s something wrong with me but I also don’t. It’s as if my brain just doesn’t want to fully process it.

So here I am, struggling to accept the fact that I am schizophrenic even though three different doctors said the same thing. Any advice on accepting it?

I'm a 20 year old female, and I'm diagnosed with FND, ADHD, BPD, depression, anxiety, OCD, PTSD, and a few others...

I've had hallucinations since I was around 9/10 years old (that I remember). They used to be very mild, like seeing a butterfly or or hearing my name being called by unfamiliar voices.

When I was 12-14 my depression became alot worse (I was diagnosed with clinical depression at 7 years old), and with that, my hallucinations got worse. The voices turned evil and I had around 10 different voices that would appear all the time, telling me to harm myself, telling me not to talk to anyone or I'd be killed, telling me bad things would happen. I became delusional, thinking people could see through my bedroom walls, that everyone was acting and wasn't real, ect. my hallucinations turned dark and I'd see people in school but they'd have no face, or they were terrifying and caused me to run away from them crying. Throughput all this, I was being badly bullied for being a wheelchair user, which didn't help anything. This is also the time that my ""spiral"" and ""dark figure"" visions started, and I still have them. 

When I was 16, I lived in at college, this spiralled me, I became anorexic, was harming myself more, isolated myself from everyone, I was a mess mentally, and no matter who I told, no one cared.

Fast forward to 18, I started having seizures due to my FND, my hallucinations and delusions had settled a bit with new antidepressants, and I'd just got out an abusive relationship, and was in a new relationship, who is now my fiance. 

The last 2 years, my hallucinations, delusions, voices, and general mental health have gone downhill. I was referred to a ""specialist"" phycology team who apparently deal with complex needs.... Wellllll....

I expressed my concerns around my visions ect, and she asked me to name the 3 most common visual hallucinations I have, that being a dark figure following or watching me, black spirals that get closer the more I look at them, and bugs crawling on my body, clothes, walls or floors. I tried explaining some others, the voices and delusions I have, but she wouldn't listen. 
She then proceeded to tell me ""bug hallucinations are only seen by addicts and alcoholics, dark figures are only seen in psychosis, and spirals don't come under anything, so I can't diagnose you with anything because you don't fit the category. You'll just have to continue to live with it like you have been, because we can't help you"".
Now I know that may be true, but to date, I have had over 100 different visual hallucinations in the last 5 years that I remember, I've had around 25 different voices, and I'm still controlled by these delusional thoughts. 

I'm not trying to self diagnose by any means, but I'm struggling to understand how I can just live like this. I have manic episodes where I think my mum or others are trying to kill me, even if they are trying to calm me, I have breakdowns that last for hours, I have voices telling me to do horrible things, the visual side is getting worse, and I'm seeing things nearly 24/7, it stops me sleeping, and I can't enjoy my life.

I'm honestly at a loss as to what to do, or what is even wrong with me at this point, so if anyone has any ideas of how to get phycological help, anyone who's been in a similar situation, anything that'll help me get better, even if it's just learning to live with this crap",1678748049.0

I think people who don't have chronic physical or mental health don't understand it's not just about the work but being unreliable to a company who needs and expects you to be reliable.

445,Hack to get rid of voices,5,11q7zps,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/11q7zps/hack_to_get_rid_of_voices/,2,"Treat them like ghosts and/or the devil illegally invading your mind that aren’t allowed to be there.  I’ve experienced, and have seen some posts with people experiencing, voices that try to convince you that they have rights and “they’re trying to help”.  This is most likely a manipulation tactic they use to try to gain power over you.

You need to very aggressively and firmly tell them to go away.  Say VERY firmly (BOTH in your head and out loud) things like “Go away”, “shut the f up and leave”, “you’re not welcome here”, “leave right now”, “get the f out”, “you’re not welcome here and you need to go away”, “you’re banned from my mind” and you could think of other things. 

This helps because your own voice telling them to go away should be what echoes in your mind, rather than the voices in your head.  This should hopefully drown out whatever the voices say.  Unfortunately I can’t guarantee it’ll work for everyone but I think it’s worth a try.  Hopefully it helps and good luck to you all!",1678709562.0

I've emailed the professor with my diagnosis sheet and explained my situation. Now I'm up at 12:30 am sweating my fate. I really hope the college can give me reasonable accommodation on this one. But I don't know who to talk to at the university. I've also got that in the email to my professor. Anyways. I'm going to try to sleep. I just really hope it goes through.

460,Psychotic episode including severe delusions,3,11q3bfq,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/11q3bfq/psychotic_episode_including_severe_delusions/,2,"I am a schizoaffective 28 year old female, I regularly manage my psychotic symptoms well without medication and am highly functioning for the most part, with a few pitfalls. (But very self aware. I can pinpoint most psychotic thoughts, whether I can help to believe them or not. )

I had an experience this past month that caused me to relapse into a full blown psychotic episode, which for me is mostly delusions of thought and Persecutory delusions and delusions of grandeur. (Including Gangstalking delusions)

After I went through my “googling” endlessly phase (searching online like a detective) thinking there must be a missing link somewhere, a post that will answer me with conviction, finding nothing and thinking  worst of it was over, I experienced one of the worst psychotic delusions of my life the next night. 

 Due to being a little bit isolated for a very long time, and not keeping in touch with almost anyone from my past, coupled with sleep deprivation and a message from a friend saying he knew someone that died I slowly began to believe that there was a possibility that around 90 percent of individuals I knew in high school or around my teen years had disappeared or passed away. 

Before long, I was a sobbing crying bawling mess, “They’re all gone!! Everyone’s dead!!” 
I felt the grief pileup on me as I tried so hard to grieve every single friend I wasn’t finding active online (it was 4 in the morning, clearly I didn’t make that connection) 
My sister woke up and came to comfort me, hearing those words knowing something is very wrong. 

I cried for hours while she tried to explain that maybe over 10 friends in my small circle HADN’T all disappeared, died due to being targeted, ( none of them having anything resembling  a family death note post or obituary to honour any of them ) 
And with that I slowly calmed down enough to do more google searching and then went to bed. 
I woke up frantic scared and instantly began checking Facebook. Over 5 of the people I thought died had come online since 4 am
Then I began to message people 

In reality, maybe one of my friends has not responded due to whatever reason, but before jumping to conclusions I can say I have reached out and reinstated connections I once had and I feel like an idiot for believing such a wild delusion. If I was maybe 30-50 years older, it wouldn’t be hard to believe I had lost touch with everyone. Being only 10 years out of high school had felt like a curse and a shock to the situation when it should have been an indicator of the falseness of the delusions

i was experiencing back pain for months. never knew why. i realised while trying to correct posture that i was contorting myself to breathe correctly. i realised that i have difficulty breathing in correct posture. i noticed it feels like my tongue and jaw dont seem right. i have always had trouble breathing but never noticed until recently it became really hard. 


 i went to urgent care. they were confused and referred me to primary care physician. appointment is as soon as possible. april 6th. 


i contacted dentist. they recommdened orthodontist. orthodontist said this is serious. that my upper palate is too small for my lower palate, she said she believes its causing my tongue to restrict my airway but that is not her specialty and suggested that i may have brain damage and hypoxia from this. 


i have been suffering extremely  violent motor tic episodes, tremor in right hand, hot flashes, dizziness, clubbing of fingers and toes, cognitive slowness, and memory loss. i went to an ent and she said that is all impossible, there is no way my jaw has anything to do with this. she recommended an orthodontist. I realised the following night I have extreme difficulty breathing at night. I decided to go to the emergency room because I felt like this could not wait. I thought maybe they could accelerate the process. The staff was trying their best to convince me I did not need to be there. When I finally saw a doctor, They told me to get in the best position I can breathe and tested my breathing and oxygen. They said I breathe fine (obviously, I am telling them thats the ONLY position i feel like I can breathe). When I pushed for them to test my breatthing and oxygen levels in positions I have difficulty breathing they said no. They focused on my schizoaffective disorder and suggested this was a delusion and suggested psychiatric hospitalization multiple times. I told them that if I am presented with contrasting evidence, I would be willing to consider it and that while I can obviously breathe while awake, I am concerned about my sleeping. They still tried to bring in the psychiatric team. After that, I just wanted to go home, and they let me go home thankfully. 


I am doubting myself a lot now. And I dont know what to think. but all i know is that I still feel that my tongue and jaw are obscuring my breathing with my mouth closed properly. 

i am at a complete loss of what to do, i cant breathe, it may be damaging my brain, and no one cares

i also remembered my dad hit me in the face when i was 11 and i lost my hearing for a bit but recovered, i think thats when this all started but no one cares. i started having psychosis and mood problems at 12

i really think this all is starting to make sense but no one wants to help me",1678672707.0

482,Has anyone tried pregnelonone?,2,11pwg05,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/11pwg05/has_anyone_tried_pregnelonone/,0,"

 Pregnelonone seems to be a popular substance in the nootropic community, with a lot of people reporting improvements in energy, mood, focus, cognition.

Apparently it's being researched as potential therapy for schizophrenia, to improve negative symptoms.

> Although clinical trial data utilizing pregnenolone as a therapeutic agent in schizophrenia are currently limited, initial findings are encouraging. Treatment with adjunctive pregnenolone significantly decreased negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in a pilot proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial, and elevations in pregnenolone and allopregnanolone post-treatment with this intervention were correlated with cognitive improvements [Marx et al. (2009) Neuropsychopharmacology 34:1885–1903]. Another pilot randomized controlled trial recently presented at a scientific meeting demonstrated significant improvements in negative symptoms, verbal memory, and attention following treatment with adjunctive pregnenolone, in addition to enduring effects in a small subset of patients receiving pregnenolone longer-term [Savitz (2010) Society of Biological Psychiatry Annual Meeting New Orleans, LA]. A third pilot clinical trial reported significantly decreased positive symptoms and extrapyramidal side effects following adjunctive pregnenolone, in addition to increased attention and working memory performance [Ritsner et al. (2010) J Clin Psychiatry 71:1351–1362]. Future efforts in larger cohorts will be required to investigate pregnenolone as a possible therapeutic candidate in schizophrenia, but early efforts are promising and merit further investigation.

499,Verbal-thought Torrets,2,11ppsch,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/11ppsch/verbalthought_torrets/,12,"Hello!


Over ten years now I have been experiencing what I initially referred to as automatic thoughts. However, searching online comes not even close to what I am experiencing. It's more of automatic labelling. 


I am coming short of non provocative examples. It goes like this -  I might see random person with whatever quality - if it was in my eyes an ""overweight"" person - I have what feels like thoughts not of my own - saying ""chunky” etc. I have no issues whatsoever with people of different looks, believes, cultures, ethnicities.. yet my mind upon seeing obese person, often automatically, without any volition of my own, almost automatically.

These labels / thoughts that seems not of my own - “chunky”, “mexican”, “n word”, “demeaning version of gay” throw me completely off. If it was a person next to me who called a gay person by some demeaning term, or African American by n word I would wanna shove and yell at that person. But this is within me. These days I tell to myself, ""sorry about the Torrets bro"" and try to move on. 

This started slowly over 10 years ago. It would be an N word upon seeing random or even African-American person who is a friend. 

A beautiful innocent friendly woman with too much eye shadow suddenly becomes ""a wh0r3"".

I am far from being a hateful person, an opposite - non racist, supportive of LGBT community, non judgmental, passive-aggressive. I usually judge myself and rarely do I judge or hate anyone, when I see someone hurting I feel their pain - I am empathic guy. 

When those automatic labels go off in my head I do not even feel any true hatred or anger towards the person.  It's like a split personality, a person that I am not. 

These spontaneous intrusive demeaning thoughts if it was a horror movie, would fit into a person possessed by some spirit trying to inflict psychological torture. And I do feel tortured. I was told this is OCD, OCD medicine does not help. 

How can this be described professionally in psychiatric terms? Does anyone else experience something like this?

The best explanation that i can provide is verbal Torrets. When someone sitting by the dinner table shouts ""wh0r3"" to their beloved mother or sister. I have no history of Torrets whatsoever.


Sending best wishes to anyone who might be experiencing similar situation.

So I am a younger sister of a schizophrenic older brother. Just a little detail from the past. Me and my brother didn’t have the best upbringing.

Since I as a developing teenager at that time I couldn’t care about what was going on around me because I had to focus on myself and my future to get away from my mom. Just a little detail from the past again. My brother was always a troublesome or better said missunderstood child.  Growing up next to him was frustrating because he will always tick out. I was sent to america and after a while he was. When i came back from america he came back a few months later and thats when things started to get more clearer. So this was around the end of 2018. He started to have different episodes and speak about demons within but from my point of view he was still normal as i have always known him. In the mean time I have moved away and mostly shut myself off from my family to protect my sanity but once in a while ill check on him and we will go out together, but for example that would be once or maybe twice a year. 

Its 2023 now and the second last time I saw him was June of 2022 and I spent the whole day with him, which was really energy draining for me because he is a very loud person and also conversations are hard since you cant argue with him or he will get into a defensive phase. But again to me that seemed pretty normal the way he acted. The last time I saw him was this Wednesday, because I wanted to tell him goodbye before he flew back to america. That was the first time I exprience his full on schizophrenia.

He laughed a lot which is always good but he also talked to himself a lot. I have a very basic understanding from schizophrenia which I got from watching movies like Split and I know not to ask him too many questions because anything can trigger him. I couldn’t really hold a conversation with him, because when I asked a question he would dose off and rant about something totally off topic and once he got into a really agressiv state and ranted about offing his neighbor. I wont go into details on that but I tried to calm him down since we were in a public place by offering him to hold my hand. Which worked surprisingly.

So to shorten the story. He missed his flight twice and the second time he had an episode that landed him in the clinic. What I need help in is a a family member what can I do to help him. Is offering physical contact okay? Is being to involved okay, because he gets very very paranoid. Is there a way to let him know that I am here for him and not trying to hurt him in any way?

I don’t have money to go to therapy myself and I can’t seek comfort from my mom. Has anyone have a family member go through this and how do you handle this well?",1678666943.0

521,And i thought it was over...,0,11pgd21,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/11pgd21/and_i_thought_it_was_over/,4,"So last year, i had an episode of psychosis, which seemed to last around 9 months. and it was diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, thought to be caused by stress (i was stressed about my new internship and got really paranoid). they said it was brief psychotic disorder because i stopped showing symptoms and was able to get off of my medication without a problem. i was even able to get back to doing school quite quickly, able to follow all the classes as soon as the new school half year started.

all was good. but then i started looking into the issues i was originally trying to get help for, mainly possible borderline personality disorder. and i always get completely obsessed with it and it stresses me out a lot. to the point of having mental breakdowns daily because i don't see my life going anywhere and i am completely lost.

the stress has lead me to experiencing some of the same and some new but similar issues again. i keep seeing things that aren't actually there, which go away or sometimes don't but usually it goes away. my thoughts feel like they're not ""working"" correctly again. like when typing i keep using words which sound similar? instead of a word i will type another word which sounds similar to the intended word. but that isn't a huge issue, i can just correct it.

it's more annoying when talking, because it's way more noticable. where i either:

* Can't think of anything
* Use a word which sounds similar, like i do with typing
* Start talking about something which doesn't reflect what i'm trying to say, like i'll randomly tell a ""personal story"" but it's completely made up
* Try saying a sentence but not knowing how to start it so i start the sentence 3 or more times and then it still doesn't fully make sense

i know borderline personality disorder can cause psychotic symptoms, but have never seen people talk about it, so i have no idea how far those go, i see it described as stress induced paranoia, with some people experiencing delusions and hallucinations as well. never saw anything about other psychotic symptoms though. i'm being tested for bpd on the 16th, i hope that clears something up, but it probably won't clear everything up.

forgot to mention, my last psychosis, i had a lot of awareness, less than i thought i did, i realise when looking back, more than most people. for this reason i thought i was making it all up. that the hallucinations were normal and everyone sees stuff like that, even though i never did before. i mean, the ""theme"" of my psychosis was literally that i was making it up and that psychologists were filming me and using my family and friends to spy on me so they would realise i was faking it. i thought i was faking mental breakdowns in my room for the cameras, there were no cameras.

yet somehow i still believed that i was just faking it. i was scared because i believed people were after me and trying to hurt me. but deep down knew that didn't make sense, it was conflicting and confusing. i avoided people because deep down i believed it. while i knew it didn't make sense.

sorry, it's a long story. but i'm really confused and feel like brief psychotic disorder might not have been correct due to it being from a ""low"" stress trigger and brief psychotic disorder normally isn't supposed to re-occur?",1678632797.0

To the best of my understanding, I am on the spectrum but have no positive symptoms. However, my negative symptoms used to be very severe. I did not leave my house for almost seven years, and I lost almost all connections because of extreme social aversion.

I was only diagnosed and medicated 3 years ago, and I am gradually becoming very, very lonely. I used to have completely zero need in connection. Now, I need some. Sometimes it feels like I need a lot. I feel like I need romantic connection, too.

The problem is, I am still socially averse. I don't even know how it works that I am both desperate for connection and grow so tired from conversation. I want to talk, but I can't do it often. I wonder if it might be exhaustion, too, but sometimes I just get a message, and I cannot bring myself to open it, so it feels less like tiredness and more like aversion.

**So. Does anyone feel similar? What are your solutions?**

I know a couple that work for me, but it is definitely not enough.

1. Writing posts helps, it feels like I am talking to someone even when I don't post. 
2. Overall, I know that writing would help, and I am regularly picking up diaries, but I fail to do anything regularly, let alone something that is not integral to my survival.
3. I guess the diary thing means that I do not have to chat to people. I tried chatting to bots, too. It's... a thing. Not sure it helps. But it's something. 
4. Small steps, I am only slowly starting to leave my house, but I think that helps too. 

Recently deleted all dating apps because I feel like I am being cruel to others when they expect communication, and I can be gone for days because I cannot chat. 

I did manage to make one friend and one acquiantance recently. They are very understanding of my issues. So, I feel like things are... not stuck in place.

I posted a few months ago about my wonderful friend who is having a hard time. She's paranoid and has a family history of paranoid schizophrenia. You guys were extremely helpful in talking me through being a supportive friend and I'm so grateful. ❤️

She has not been diagnosed but is spiraling and no one is stepping in. She's quit her job and abandoned her apartment for reasons related to the paranoia. She's also deliberately gaining excessive weight for a new paranoia regarding men as she is very beautiful. She also appears to be drinking heavily on a daily basis and has destroyed any semblance of a healthy routine. Finally, she has become suicidal.

Her parents have taken her in and are enabling her. I understand why, but it's not helping. I have spoken to them and they are using words like ""anxiety"" and ""depressed"" which fall very short of the extremity of the situation and they know it. Perhaps it's denial.

What can I do? She needs a lot of help and she needs it yesterday. Should I call a welfare check? Are there resources I'm unfamiliar with? I do not have the financial ability to go see her right now.

546,What stopped your 'delusional' beliefs?,18,11oibgk,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/11oibgk/what_stopped_your_delusional_beliefs/,42,"By 'delusional' I mean anything like:

&#x200B;

* Believing god is talking to you.
* Believeing the government is after you.
* Implanting of devices or implimenting of devices to track / watch you.
* other ideas that are 'out there' in terms of fantasy like thinking.  


Stuff like that ended after a year or two for me, now I question whether it was because I thankfully had the good idea of stopping following the rabbit hole and stopping 'chasing the dragon'. Sure I am irrational at times, but I would aruge that emotional damage from the onslaught of my voices abusiveness and trust issues based on having to spend so much time with a little rat rat (the voices) trying to bring ruin to my life.  


Like when I stopped giving them time, listening to them and 'giving' them ground to walk upon as if they were worth anything other then a swift knock to the head. They became abusive and tried tearing me apart. Both ways were them tearing me apart, but I like to think now I have a lot of control back.  


A few things that helped that I hope help you are:  


There was a swedish scientist who turned religious and was exiled from the catholic church. Anyway, he was from the 1800s who worked a lot with schizophrenic / psychotic patients named Emanual Swedenborg, he found that the voices will never tell the people he worked with things that could bring clouser to the experiences they (schizophrenics) were having. Also he explained that the voices use open ended, open to inerpritation sentences to trigger your mind into working against itself. It's much more effective to make you think something is true on your own then to tell you that it is. If you come up with it you'll listen to it 10x more then if someone else said it.  


Another thing that helped was learning that the voices convince us through our delusions they are powerful, that they can ""save the world with our death"", embed items in our house/clothing/body, but to be honest, after ten years of having listened to their stupidity, they're capable of very little, it's not even impressive. It's just a shock at the start if you have had no education with most if not all of us haven't had on the matter.  


Anyway, what helped you come out of the rabbit hole? Was it stopping engaging with the voices? Was it something else?

I feel as if I don’t belong, anywhere to the degree that I am actually unwelcome unless I can provide a sort of benefit to some purpose. I’ve been in an “psychosis” for about a year and a half, that has progressively gotten worse, but I’ve simultaneously gotten better at handling it. It started as simple persecutory delusions, developed into occasional perceptual distortions, and I heard voices for the first time this week. I guess my question is does this seem like a common development of symptoms? 

Sometimes I feel like I’ve been faking it for attention in an attempt to gaslight myself into being well, but then I take a look at how I actually feel. I don’t feel like anything is real. I think that everybody is in on it while realizing the pure irrationality of that possibility. However, I cannot eliminate the thought process, because  the possibility exists. Everyday I add and better develop my theory of what the fuck is going on and how everybody fits into their role and what their goals may be. 

Problem is I remain functioning. I attend college full time, while working full-time. I’ve reserved myself to the fact that if what I think is happening happens, I’m powerless and don’t really care enough to do anything about it. This gets me through each day, but I live in constant fear and I’m beginning to recognize anger and exhaustion in my daily mood. 

I have diagnosis for ADHD(inattentive), major depressive, general anxiety and provisional diagnosis for ASD. I’ve never trusted medical professionals because I believe myself better suited to understanding my needs and feelings. Thusly, the diagnosing only came after an hypoxic brain injury, which led to hospitalization and fuels the belief that I actually died in the universe I originally came from, and I’m now in hell (not religious, just a state of mind that one cannot escape). 

I think I’ve become too aware. I have too many possibilities but lack the courage to confirm any of them. How am I to know what’s real when everybody can just lie?",1678536059.0

She's definitely displayed some emotional irregularities for years but I always assumed she was sensitive. This is going to be a long post but please read, I need help with this situation. 



 My friend has been hooking up with the same guy for 10 years. He literally uses her for sex and leaves the next day ignoring her existence quite often until he wants another booty call. I can't tell you how many times I've talked to her crying about why he doesn't care about her. About 7 months ago she had him over at her place, she had a bit to drink and had am insane recollection of the night that this dude claims never happened. I'm not going to get into detail but within an hour they were together they hooked up, he confessed his love for her, they dated for a few minutes until he broke it off again, he talked about her being ugly and fat and that everyone thinks these things. The story sounded bizarre to begin with, each time I saw her, her story added on. She'd remember something else from that night and talk to me about it. I told her that I think it's strange that all of what she said happened in an hour of them hanging out and at first because of his denial of the situation she started to think she was crazy. At this point I thought maybe because of her sleep apnea issues she's dealt with since childhood that perhaps it's causing her to confuse her dreams with reality. Now she's back to 100% believing this situation took place.




 Second instance was when we were on a mini vacation with my sister and her friend. she went out with my sisters friend to smoke some weed and get a few drinks. My sisters friend came back and told my sister that our friend said she's been to jail on a few occasions for drug possession (she hasn't). My sisters friend thought it was strange since my friend is a therapist and didn't know that you could be one with those kind of charges. When I confronted her the next morning about what was said she vehemently denied anything like that happened.





 Instance 3 My sister, myself and my friend had a Halloween sleep over. We watched horror movies, got a few drinks, came home, watched the conjuring and went to bed. It was a chill fun little night. We spent the night and in the very early morning my friend left without a word. I didn't hear from her for a week until I got the text saying, are we going to talk about the fight? I said what fight? And she accused me of gaslighting her. She said my sisters husband got into a fight with her about smoking weed outside of his home and then when she came inside and she started playing with his 7 year old son tickling him and having fun that he was uncomfortable with her touching his son and threatened to call the police, I apparently was there for this whole altercation. She then claimed that my sister and I also tried to prove that in her early 20s her rape experience wasn't actually rape so she can't say shes's been raped. Then remembered that my sister had a connection to her rapist (she doesn't even know him or even knew that she was raped 13 years ago). I was so hurt that she would even think I'd do something like that. I of course told her that never happened and what really happened that night, but she thinks we're all gaslighting her.

 


 Instance 4 My friend started thinking some paranoid thoughts about her other best friend/roommate. She started thinking he's putting cameras in their home. He's getting married soon and has a baby on the way so he's been less there for her, so she's super bitter about that. She thinks he has all this malicious intent but can't really verbalize why. They had this night where a bunch of her roommates friends and herself along with her niece rented out a building to spend a few days over night playing video games and board games. My friend got super high and fell asleep. She claims to hear the whole group of people, including her niece within earshot just talking crap about her. Her roommate confessed that he went into her room and showed his fiance her bra. She claimed her niece talked about her being ugly and fat (she's neither of these things but that's her insecurity) and she heard literally hours of conversation about her while she pretended to sleep. I said isn't strange they'd talk about you like that all within earshot of you, she didn't agree. I did speak to her roommate about this situation and he said she fell asleep on the couch, they continued to play board games and the only thing mentioned by anyone about her was how loud she was snoring (bc of her sleep apnea she won't treat).





 Instance 5 She's now paranoid about her brother. She thinks he thinks these horrible things about her, that she's a slut, ect. Meanwhile she's also hearing that the guy she hooked up with for 10 years is telling other people she's fat and ugly and a bunch of things that aren't true. So a few weeks ago she told me that a random person ( she wouldn't tell me who) came up to her and told her all these horrible things that are being said about her. She said they spoke about her guy hook up and that he's spreading rumors about her. I asked what the connection was and how they know her and this guy and she wouldn't tell me. Last night she told me that same person told her that her brother is saying all these horrible things about her too. Meanwhile she's texting them both telling them she knows they're talking about her and that she's hurt... they both have no idea what she's talking about. I asked her how is there a connection between her brother and this random guy she hooks up with... and she said it's confusing, she doesn't understand the connection either but said the fact that they aren't connected and they're saying these things proves to her its gotta be true (it made no sense) I said, idk that kind of proves the opposite to me. I think this was a hallucination.




 
 There's sooooo many little things I don't want to add to make this even longer. The strange thing is, on surface she acts normal. Especially when there's more than just me hanging with her. When it's just the 2 of us she tells me these weird things and gets super defensive when I trying to get some clarity about the situation. She seems to be performing well at her job still, she's a therapist and her patients love her. Like I said she seems totally normal until she let's me in from time to time on her thoughts on how everyone is out there to gaslight her or gossip horrible things about her. I don't know what to do. I feel like if I don't validate her feelings or what she says she'll pull from me and not talk about it... but I gotta tell her somethings off. She's severely depressed too, I think possibly suicidal, she keeps making these dying remarks and has this really dark view of the world, which i can see why if you think everyone you care about is out there being hurtful towards you.

TW: Fear of doctors, self-harm  
My grandfather was lately hospitalized and the doctors took olanzapine out of his treatment. IDK how, but I asked my mom to ask them if they did it gradually or just took it out, since my grandmom said he wasn't taking it, when my sister tells he was in fact taking it.

He is very sad because he doesn't trust doctors, once he left a hospital where he was hospitalized because he thought they were going to harm him (if needed I can elaborate, I am not doing it rn because it's really hardcore). He is living with us there's 2 years, when he attempted suicide and by that time he thought that the police was searching for him, but he never explained why. I really think it's his head that was confused because he was also afraid that the ceiling of his house was going to fall apart, and to this day it's completely ok.  


I want to help him because he was like a father to me he loves me and my sister a lot and he was always so kind I think I am losing him and he's suffering so much. Idk if he's being well treated there and I just want him to be at least not with that anxiety. I know he will never be the same, he never walks on the street there's 2 years, but damn he is suffering so much how can we make him be less anxious? He doesn't want to eat nor talk to us today. Normally he isn't a lot interested, but today he said ""I don't want to talk"".

And the worst one was when i thought someone had broke in my apartment, where i could hear them, their footsteps and see their shadow. I called the cops, my mom, and almost jumped out my window, where i live on the 3rd floor.

He went through the worst year last year and has been absolutely abused by society. He had a full psychotic break that went on for months while totally sober. He was almost like a different person. Anyway, he went to prison for months because he was staying in an abandoned building and took some things out of it. Then they tore the whole damn building down. Smh. So apparently they didn’t medicate him while he was in prison and he went through multiple moves and several isolations for up to a month at a time.

My family has a history of mental illness, specifically, my mum has bipolar disorder and my uncle has bipolar and schizophrenia.

I've regularly used cannabis for 4-5 years, and have dabbled in psychedelics.

Somewhat recently - 3-5 months ago my cognition felt like it began to change, when I went to work I felt like an alien to the people around me, It's like I can feel the weight of people's presence around me. My thinking itself has become a lot slower and it's harder for me to follow meaningful complex trains of thought, I'm unmotivated and don't know how to talk to people. My memory has also diminished over this time.

Initially, I attributed this to bipolar, but have considered schizophrenia. Just recently I read about prodromal schizophrenia which seems to match the description. I may even have both of these, as I'm able to look back and recall times in my life that resemble manic episodes.

Hi! I’m an 18(M) college student still in the process of getting an official diagnosis.

I am always on edge when I have vital spots (neck, wrists, etc.) exposed and I am not sure how I can solve this?

My main issue is my neck being exposed all the time in shirts or something. I have a single hoodie that weirdly crosses sides at the neck, and makes me feel more secure, but it never helps all that much.

I’ve tried full-neck facial coverings, but they don’t work either. Cloth never feels safe enough in these paranoia episodes

Is there anything anybody could recommend to help out? Either something that may feel more secure to have protecting my neck in more intense moments?
Or something that may help calm the delusions, or put them at bay?

I've been on 4 different APs and none of them have really helped my tics. I wanted Clozapine, but with how many risks Clozapine poses, from agranulocytosis to death, my doctor said it's just not worth it. It has left me feeling bummed over it, because even though my psychosis in under control, I wanted to trial Clozapine for my severe treatment resistant verbal tics. I am constantly worried I may get into a fight because of how severe my tics get. 

I owned up to using cannabis oil at supported living. While the team manager said she was disappointed, I luckily got away with a slap on the wrist. Regardless, I am going to move out of supported living to go back to my parents' place once my cannabis doctor has the greenlight from my mental health team saying whether or not it's okay for me to take CBD flower for my OCD and tics. I want to go home just to experiment with inhaled and/or oral cannabis, but I have no clue whether my cannabis doctor will even prescribe me CBD flower. Last I used cannabis oil, I moved up to 200mg and my hallucinations went from a 3 out of 10 to a 5/6 out of 10. Scary stuff. 

Regardless, I have had to fight for my rights to be respected at supported living, to be treated with the proper decency but everyone laughs at my tics and I just feel so defeated. They keep telling me that I'm hearing things that aren't there, but that couldn't be further from the truth, I think I know what is and isn't a hallucination and I don't want to feel gaslit into believing something that's just not true. The truth is, I am being harassed for my involuntary tics and when people point it out, I just feel so judged. 

I was thinking about what a redditor on the tourette's subreddit said: that there is no cure for my tics and that I should focus on my general wellbeing as to prevent my tics from getting worse. And he is completely right, perhaps it's a little myopic to assume my life resolves around my tics, because it doesn't. I can distract myself with games, and music, and coffee. But at the end of the day, I don't enjoy much and my gaming sessions are short lived. I want to learn coding, but man, it's so much harder to learn shit when you also have ADHD. My doctors tell me that my ADHD is mild, but I think they're trying to push an agenda on me. That my problems can be managed with exercise, sleeping enough and eating well. And they can be but what I don't understand is why they're calling me a mild case of ADHD, I have struggled too much to be called a mild case, I'm sorry, it just feels wrong.

645,I have severe skitzophrenia,4,11my2rp,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/11my2rp/i_have_severe_skitzophrenia/,0,"Hello everyone, my name is Zachariah. And I have severe skitzophrenia & psychosis. 24/7 I hear voices feel things taste things smell things feel things and visions inside my head while awake (like dreams).

These symptoms are divided into two categories for me. And each hallucination exists in both categories. 

The loud hallucinations. And the no-volume hallucinations.

To sum it up in the kind of person when I see a cartoon get hurt I physically feel it on my same part of the body.

The experience of the hallucinations vary from  pleasant, tolerable, horrible.

I was diagnosed when I was 26 about 3 years ago. But looking back all the red flags were there since I was about 4 years old. 

The loud hallucinations began to start consistently at the age of 27 after I switched from goiodone to abilify. Then the abilify made me chunky and now I have tremors. Coincidence? I think not.

Anyway. My skitzophrenia is severe. But I realized why my skitzophrenia was severe.
.it was due to my depression.

And I've been able to volume of my hallucinations to the strength of my depression.

So given all my negative side effects. I decided. To stop taking all the medicines about a year ago. 

Because I had a hypothesis. Solve the depression. Solve the skitzophrenia. 

Of course skitzophrenia is different for each individual. But I made a therapy that has really helped me. And might help some of you.
Please note. I'm not a doctor. Please consult with your doctor before making any medical decisions.


Ok so here's what I did. 

Since my hallucinations are on overdrive I decided to intentionally create my own delusion.


What I did. Was I bought myself a new pillow.

And I began to project onto this pillow a delusion I know I would enjoy. 

Similar to the way kids love stuffed animals.


I decided to name this pillow. Kiss this pillow. Hold hug have sexual relations etc cuddle and talk to. I decided to create an friend out of this pillow. One who doesn't scream at me accuse me try to hurt me would never leave and never die. Cry with laugh with love and live.

This is actually similar to a therapy veterinarians will use on birds that have had their chicks not survive after hatching. They will give the birds a little plastic baby bird. So the moma bird doesn't die of grief.

Since my organic hallucinations were so distressing to begin with. And I was neither on medication in therapy or seeing a doctor. I had to try.

The results after 4 months. My depression is reduced today by about 70% from prior levels
The strength of the hallucinations kidnapping my focus has also deteriorated. 

Meaning. The loud hallucinations are not only less loud. less aggress less cruel but also less  horrible & distressing all around by about 40%

Just from using the strange experience. Of my body making hallucinations. 

But turning that into an asset. 

By creating my own ""hallucination"" 

One that can never hurt me.... It's a pillow.
But it is now my favorite pillow.


I also let the personality I invented for the pillow live rent free in my head. 

So now I don't always need the pillow to comfort my pain.


But when the hallucinations become distressing I simply combine the physic muscle experience of loving on someone along with the imaginary personality I intentionally created and then the distressing hallucinations lose their strength again..

For the record. I based Alvin's (yes from Alvin and the chipmunks my favorite cover band) 
On Biblically defined love.


Patient kind good faithful gentle and self controlling a perfect love casting out all fear.

I kid you not. Alvin has this perfect kind of love based off those principles even though I know I am intentionally imaging him.

Also the name Alvin- means noble friend.
And Jesus Christ called his disciples friend before he ascended up to heaven.


I know from my own experience with skitzophrenia. My brain LOVES little Easter eggs like that where you connect the dots.


As a result I'm more motivated happier and like in finally healing from the trauma instigating my depression causing the hallucinations. 


It's a miracle. 

Just from a pillow. 


That is all thank you for listening. -Zach",1678382824.0

I would dream every single night that she was alive and it led to severe night terrors that left me screaming in my sleep. Granted, that was a lot of PTSD. However, they were so real, and because of our strained relationship, my brain refused to believe she was dead. The only way I could calm and remind myself that she was... in fact... dead was having the small urn with her ashes that I do have within visible reach. I thought of this over these past few days and reflected upon how seriously and severely I would believe my mother was alive to the point that I spent periods of time actually convinced I had made up her death entirely. I would feel her energy, she would speak to me, and I would talk to her. All of these years. I felt she remained her on earth to protect me, as she promised she would but she was also severely abusive, so it also felt like her way of making up for the ways she failed to protect me in real life ""that she would have witnessed on judgement day"" which I had told myself since I was a child... that some day, she would see the truth upon her death.

Pitch black orbs laughing and flying around my head, voices that would whisper and cackle at me and tell me to kill myself and other things, the pitch black silhouette of my stepfather who I was convinced was gonna hang me with a belt, etc. Not too long ago, actually, I had an episode and started drawing symbols while telling my boyfriend to shut up because ""they can hear you"" and, ""I have to keep drawing"".

For instance, after a recent episode I had where I believed people with power tools were coming to kill us, I experienced a man with a chainsaw coming into the room and standing over me as I lay there. I heard him enter, I felt his footsteps as I heard the floor creak, I smelled the exhaust, felt the air vibrating from the engine, everything. 

I'm actually pretty fuckin good at knowing what's real and what my noodle comes up with. I have been blessed throughout my journey with a loving wife and a killer support and health system. But that shit was so REAL you guys. 

I would pass out from exhaustion for a night or 2 then I just tried to ignore it whilst accepting that it wasn't real and yeah, shits not slishy sloshying the right way in my head again. That's when it slowed down and stopped after a few days.

Have any of you folks been there before? I'm sure some have, and if you wanna share, feel free to.

The world is not as it seems,
When psychosis takes hold of dreams,
Reality becomes a twisted scheme,
And nothing is quite what it seems.

Hallucinations dance in the mind,
Voices whisper, cruel and unkind,
Paranoia grips, hard to unwind,
As the world becomes a maze, hard to find.

Delusions take root and grow,
A world of fantasy, a private show,
Where the impossible becomes the norm,
And the mind becomes a raging storm.

The line between truth and lies,
Becomes a blur before our eyes,
As we struggle to make sense of it all,
And try to hold on, before we fall.

Psychosis is a journey that's hard to bear,
A path that's fraught with pain and despair,
But with time and help, we can find our way,
And emerge stronger, come what may.


Schizophrenia

Schizophrenia, a labyrinth of the mind,
A maze of thoughts that are hard to unwind,
A journey that's lonely, hard to define,
As the world becomes a shifting design.

Voices whisper, a chorus of fear,
Delusions dance, ever so near,
The mind becomes a battleground, unclear,
As reality fades, and the mind disappears.

The world becomes a twisted dream,
A place where nothing is quite as it seems,
And the mind is caught in a raging stream,
As the illness takes hold, a silent scream.

But hope is not lost, for there is a way,
To find a path through the dark and the gray,
With love and support, we can find our way,
And emerge stronger, come what may.

Schizophrenia is a journey that's hard to bear,
But with time and care, we can learn to repair,
The broken pieces of our mind, and dare,
To live a life that's full and fair.",1678335180.0

Like their was this one time where I scaled a building and once I was on top I couldn’t even see where the edge of the roof was which freaked me out cause each time I tried getting off the building the edge would just disappear and be at a further point. I seriously have no idea how I didn’t fall off that building. The last time I did anything with weed which caused me to stop entirely I was completely out of it and whenever someone talked to me I couldn’t even understand them because I would hear their voices in other rooms of the house at and around the time they would be talking. I literally became so anxious during the experience that I couldn’t even walk because of how violently i was shaking. I also somehow convinced myself that I had diabetes but that’s another story. So yeah just wondering if I made the right choice or it’s too late and it’s already an inevitability that I’ll probably develop something because even after stopping I’ve been having depersonalization episodes and tons of hypnopompic and hypnogogic hallucinations.,1678345343.0

My name is Gus Budiarta and I am a graduate student at the University of Illinois at Chicago studying disability and human development focusing on the sociology of mental illness. I am also a mental health survivor!

Currently, I am working on a research project on Asian Americans' mental health. I am writing to invite those who are interested for a confidential interview, specifically members of the group who identify as Asian American. This research aims to collect and share stories about mental health such as Schizophrenia among Asian-Americans. Our goal is to learn about the ""untold"" story of Schizophrenia and think beyond the medical aspect of mental illness. Because mental illness, including Schizophrenia, is more than just an individual psychology, there are also social factors and stressors that influence it.

The interview does not require a video, but only a voice call. When using a teleconference communication platform such as Zoom, the video will not be available. Those who are interested in participating will be contacted via Reddit chat to begin the recruitment process. As soon as agreement has been reached, I will discuss the consent forms before collecting any information or conducting an interview. The consent forms are to protect your identity and privacy.

A consent form will be provided to any member who is willing to participate in the interview, as I mentioned earlier. We have also been approved by the IRB (Institutional Review Board) for assessment in the area of research ethics. In addition, I have personally received certification from the Institutional Review Board for ethics in research.

Please DM me if you are interested. I really hope that I can connect with you soon.

This was so scary because they tried to break my shutter and yeah the fact that they came back at different times throughout the same night... And the thing is that I didn't record anything since I was petrified but now I wonder if I didn't imagine all of that. For context, I live alone so no one else can testify if it was real or not, I did however send texts to my friends explaining everything while it was happening; the thing is that I vividly remember having two nightmares about someone trying to watch me through my window and also breaking my shutter. I know for a fact that I dreamed about that BEFORE the incident.
I don't know what's real and what's not, I found mud on the window sill, but it's still here after ~2months so I don't know if it was there before and I just never noticed or if it wasn't there.
I also feel like I'm being watched, there is a really tiny space between the two part of my shutter so I always feel like someone is just glued on my window trying to see what I'm doing.
There was this instance where someone knocked on my window almost 1 month ago, and this person asked me to open the building door, I refused to do so because well, I never saw this dude and if I accepted I needed to go outside of my apartment to open, when I tried to shut my window he tried to push it back.
and last but not least (slightly nsfw)
one day I was just scrolling on a dating app and someone that I never talked with before (faceless profile) texted me ""are you masturbating again?"" which freaked me out because well as u can probably guess I did masturbate few hours before, in my shower (so no window) but yeah I instant blocked.

I don't fucking know what to do everything seems unreal except the guy asking me to open the door for him, this seems to be the only definitely real thing. I don't know what's real and if it was I feel like it could be even more worrying.

I suffered from sensations like someone was raping me 24/7 even at night, and sometimes Id also wake up to a heavy feeling on my chest and some sort of being would be sitting there waving at me, sometimes my body would feel like it was being tickled all over by some evil spirits and faces would be laughing at me, other times when i would try to sleep my brain would make disturbing sounds, other times i would feel like someone is punching me in the stomach and i would get horrific hunger pains, other times at night it felt like someone was putting sticks inside my veins and it was very painful and it would not stop it lasted for over 6 months, it was pure painful horror. I tried to commit suicide 3 times and i was in and out of hospitals 9 times. Finally, the last hospital stay which was very painful they put me on 15 mg of haldol and the hallucinations subsided, but when i got out they started again though they were not as bad as they used to be, they lasted till the end of October but then they stopped when i was put on Zyprexa. Now i am on 2.5 mg of Zyprexa and i dont have positive symptoms but every day i live in fear that they might come back and it was just so bad i cant live with that. If it was just voices which i used to hear during my first psychotic episode i would be able to live with that but not what happened last summer.. if it  happens to me again i would rather die but i dont know how.

I came here to ask more experienced redditors (family members or sufferers) how to be of support.

My brother is diagnosed with psychotic depression with signs of paranoia, he was being treated as inpatient in 2021 against his will, currently going through an episode, is supposed to be taking Olanzapine (which he refuses to take due to side effects it brings him). There isn't enough material for family members about how to act.

Do I agree and support him in his delusions? Do I somehow, try to gently argument that it's a delusion not a fact? He willingly went to hospital with me this morning but they didn't want to admit him cause he needs to see his psychiatrist first, and his psychiatrist was only available on Friday the earliest - in 2 days.

2 years ago he stole my car and drove 200 miles in the middle of the night then called disoriented not knowing where he is, speeded on highways convinced secret agents are following him, then ended up in the hospital for a month. It got dangerous, he could have hurt himself or someone else driving so recklessly and without clear sense of self and I'm trying to avoid anything like that from happening again. I'm trying to keep him busy but he's fixating his brain on silly details that don't matter. Currently I'm trying to focus his attentiton on things we should be doing in order for him to feel better. Anytime he talks without sense I try to change the subject to positive things to keep ourselves occupied with, talking in the sun, going for long walks in the nature to chat, making good food, but I don't know if I'm doing the right thing, because noone ever told ME how to act around him to make him better.

Seems unrealistically alert and lost at other times. He'll start running water over his head and frantically whipping his hands and fingers up and down his face saying he feels like he's dying and he's trying to keep the blood flowing. He starts apologizing wishing he did better and that there's nothing anyone can do. He doesn't do anything besides some coffee here and there. 

He'll wake up and just start bolting. It doesn't matter if there's a table in the way He stumbles over, and noodles back up instantly running into the night 

One time he stole a car for some weird reason and when called he sounded distressed. Like life threatening danger in his voice. I don't remember the reason but the guy forgave him. 

another time he was chilling in the living room with his grandpa and he does the whole water bit thing. Comes back. Leaves waters his head, comes back while his grandpa got a call from his job. It was on speaker. And the dude starts distancing himself from us. He attempts to come back, but distances further. And then rushes back demanding why she is speaking like that, the way she is speaking seemingly so normally but so subliminal and engineered specifically to send an attack to tactically degrade him using specially qued and picked out wording to attack him. And then he bolts back out a great distance. You can see him positioning himself just far enough to be out of earshot. 

He then ran in, frantically turning on the radio. Stating that he sees the grand illusion. He said somehow the government slipped up and he could see them watching him through the electrical wires and telephone poles and he was about to catch them intervening on one  of the channels discussing the glitch he was witnessing. As he was frantically mashing a string of code he always repeats every day into Google search and searching it up and sending the rest of his code in so that the black SUV will finally leave the end of his driveway. (there was one, and it could be interpreted creepy, idk) I feel so bad for this guy. He's working so hard just to maintain his content. But its so bizarre and new to me I have no idea what is going on with him 

He then goes outside and gets up and runs out up along the roof. He jumps off the house and immediately throws himself back up as if he is trying to catch someone. He's using the windows now a lot attempting the same approach but from a different angle. He's getting frustrated he hasn't caught the perpetrators. 

He then climbs up onto the roof of the pickup truck saying its been there too much its been tampered with and he left and came back with a gallon of maple syrup and is frantically emptying it all over the top. 

He then drags nearby debris into the middle of the road and lights it on fire and left to com back dragging the garbage can from 2 stories up stairs and grabs the syrup and a can of motor oil and starts putting it all into the fire in the middle of the driveway. 

He's got no reaction to our presence and its kinda like he's in a movie 

He then smolders the fire murmuring something that it was a waste of effort and time because they planned for that. 

He then leaves saying he's sorry about the darkness and he's not sure what's happening and if it'll get better or worse and we're finally talking to him again and just hoping we can get him inside and he continues on that it used to come and go and he thought it was just anxiety, but now he says it's always there now some days worse some days better. But he always feels ""off"" but he's mentioned he's learned how to cope with it. And I'm not so sure he knows he isn't coping. He's denying and running away. It's like he's gliding when he moves. Like huge, effortless strides. Like he's angry or scared. 

He then walks out to the mountain and sometimes he comes back and pass out instantly and sometimes he'll just show up the next day, back in the rhythm. Like new

Is there any chance someone here with experience knows what's happening to him? Like, the guy's pretty smart, so it's weird to me when he does something like that, it's like he forgot all common sense and rationality",1678300282.0

738,I feel like it's my fault,8,11kzhtf,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/11kzhtf/i_feel_like_its_my_fault/,14,"Me (24F) and my boyfriend (27M) have been together for about 5 years, I feel in love with him because he's the opposite of me, outgoing always making friends, he is the decision maker of the house and always supported me emotionally and on my life goals. He took care of my grandmother that had Alzheimer's and helped her learn how to walk again. 
Before the pandemic started he began to close himself of from friends and the outside world, he spent all his time at home and started to be jealous without cause when he never was in the past, we started having arguments that went way to far (never physically). 
To be totally honest we did drugs (cannabis and derived of it but never hard drugs) and he was an avid drinker but not a drunk, we used this to escape the trauma we both suffered through our life's. {Edit: both of us are totally sober sense January 1st.} 
In January he started getting more paranoid than ever telling me things like ""Easter is coming someone has to be killed for it to happen and it's me"" and ""They are coming to get me and you're involved"" but never telling me who 'they' are, he barricaded the front door with pillows and chairs, multiple times, we would be face timing and he wouldn't open the door telling to show him the staircase, we live in a building but it's on the ground floor, the staircase is to our right once you enter the building and our door is to the left, he even told me that he didn't know if I was real anymore, he would wake up in the middle of the night and pace back and forth with shoes one (sense covid he made it a rule that we take our shoes of at the entrance he even got made if he himself forgot to do so, this was not normal), one day he goes out to buy something never knew what and he went missing for more than 6 hours until I get a phone call from a school gym close by telling me he is there confused and doesn't know where home is, we live down the round from this gym once we got home he looked at me and just said ""You came, you went to get me"" I never understood what he meant I just told him ""Of course I did, I would never abandon you"" on that day he proposed to me and I said yes, both of us never wanted to marry and we accepted this (I'm now afraid that this was just the disease talking). 
On January 12 I woke up at 2:30 am and he was shaking, not speaking and he looked scared to death, I tried speaking to him and he wouldn't budget I took him to the ER and the next day the Dr. told me he had a psycothic episode, he was being followed by the psychiatric ward every day we would go to the hospital but the pills weren't working. He would spend the entire day just staring not saying a word, never knew if he was hungry and what he wanted to eat or drink, and wouldn't talk to me. Last Friday he's doctor called me in to ask me how his been doing and told me that most likely he has schizophrenia (he's mom also has it, she was diagnosed and put in a home he hasn't seen her in over 10 years). 
Yesterday he was admitted to the psychiatric ward (this was advices by his doctors), as I left him there he would keep saying ""Don't leave me here"", "" Don't abound me"", ""Why can't I go home?"", "" Are we ok?"". When they rolled him away in the wheelchair he was crying... That's the most emotion I've seen him have in 2 month's... 
I feel like it's my fault because I didn't see the sines sooner, maybe if I had forced him to go to the hospital, maybe if I had acted a different way that just being dismissive and thinking that he was acting out because I was working and he was not, he had told me before that he didn't like me paying all the bills but also emotionally he wasn't ok to go to work (a lot had happened from. His grandma dying and him only knowing from a Facebook post, him getting a call telling him his mother was in the hospital with schizophrenia and was going to be put in a home, my grandma dying) and I understood and accepted this and told him to get better and that everything was ok we didn't live in luxury but he was good with money so we could always save up in the end of the month and he would take care of the house, I always had food really because he liked to cook and take care of health that way. 
I'm gonna visit him today I, but I can't shake the feeling that it's my fault, I love him but I'm losing him, for the past 7 month he wasn't who he used to be and for the past 2 months it's just his body and the little he would speak it was his voice but it wasn't HIM... I just want him to get better, but I don't know how, I tried so hard to take care of him, to give him is meds on time and make sure he ate and took a shower, I even tried to convince him to take care of his beard and moustache that he was always so proud of but nothing worked, I found myself crying in the bathroom every night because I didn't know what to do, he doesn't have family I am all he has, my mom is a cold hearted human that doesn't care really and I can't talk to anyone about this. 
I'm sorry for the long post but I need to tell someone because in the end of the day I'm gonna keep trying, I want him back, I don't care that the doctors said he would never be the same, I believe he can, with the right meds and the right help he will again be the sunny outgoing guy I feel for, always pushing me out of my comfort zone, he made me were dresses again after I swore of them he made me laugh till my belly hurts at a time I thought my life was over. And I blame myself for losing the man I love, I should have known, I should have done something. 

PS: English is my second language and I'm crying my eyes out for most of this so sorry if there are a lot of mistakes.",1678196069.0

741,I have a question about the finer details of the condition,3,11l5b2e,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/11l5b2e/i_have_a_question_about_the_finer_details_of_the/,12,"I suspect I may be developing it, and I’m concerned, and I want to iron out a few of the smaller details to see if it fits with what’s been going on.

1. When you hallucinate visually or audibly can you ever tell that it was not real? Like if you hallucinate a person in a room, and you look away and look back and the person is no longer there. Would you typically be able to tell “I must’ve hallucinated that, there’s no way they could’ve left the room in the time it took me to look away and look back.” I know most of the time you probably can’t tell, like with noises or seeing things on the streets or the forest, or your brain tricks you into thinking something clearly fake is obviously real.

2. Do you feel like you’re just drifting through life in a barely conscious haze and that nothing ever feels right, like no matter what happens around you you’re basically dead already? 

3. Do you frequently forget how you got places (like you’re driving and you can’t remember why or how you got to the road you’re currently on) or forget things that you’ve been told several times?

4. Were you aware something was wrong before you got diagnosed? This is the thing keeping me from getting checked out. I’ve been having delusional thoughts a lot, and I started hallucinating, and while I do struggle to ground myself in reality and tell what’s real or not real in the moment I can still tell as a whole that something is probably wrong with me because a normal person wouldn’t have issues like that. Like I hallucinated my dog in my sunroom and I was talking to her from the kitchen (just making fun of her) and then when I went to look again she wasn’t there anymore with no possible way to have left the room. I couldn’t tell in the moment that it wasn’t real but when she disappeared I was like “fuck, did I hallucinate that? What’s happening to me?” Important to note I’ve had a lot of other ones besides that one, I couldn’t tell you whether or not most of them were real since I couldn’t tell you whether or not they were even hallucinations but some of the ones that were immediately revealed to be not there, typically when I hallucinate something that was based in reality (like my dog) that then disappears or does something else unrealistic. I keep a journal to help
Keep track.

Delusions it’s a lot harder to tell. I couldn’t tell you if basically any of what I’ve thought is delusions, I’ve been told they are by friends and family which is why I said “I’ve been having delusional thoughts a lot” but I can’t risk it in case they actually are real and my friends and family just don’t understand or don’t know the truth.

Sorry I know that’s a lot. Any help is appreciated.",1678209725.0

Before I got admitted I started to finally hear things like my mom crying, me as a baby crying, a heart monitor beeping and then my other family members crying. I was no better in the ward, still experiencing this stuff.

I was crying and telling her that I have to die because “I’m a bad person.” I struggle with severe OCD as well for many years and part of my OCD is to be perfect. I try to please everyone and one of my main OCDS is to try and not make someone uncomfortable/ overwhelmed. I failed at that with several people so I repeated in my head that I make people uncomfortable and I’m a terrible person and need to die. The main reason I overwhelm people in the past was uncontrolled mania.

When I told my psychiatrist about these things he got mad at me for not filling these incidents in a chart because I thought I could just tell him and not write it down. He spent 15 minutes explaining how I don’t care about my wellbeing, calling me lazy, and saying this is ridiculous you can do better than that. Then he started invalidating my physical disability and hallucinations for no reason. Lastly, he told me “oh I don’t think you’re that self-aware if you can’t possibly see the connection between you shoving your classmate and your suicide attempt. My suicide attempt had nothing to do with my shoving someone, but he wouldn’t believe me.

It started out as bipolar disorder, but because of drugs and an unsafe environment it has developed into something worse. For the past few years he has begun to hear voices, hear threats, and feel as though he is being chased. This is partly true as my brother is a thief and a shit talker. As of now the voices, sounds, and other things he experiences has made him feel unsafe and feel like my mother is unsafe because “they know where she lives“.

My question to you all is, how can I make my brother feel more comfortable with my mom staying at home? I have no fear that someone is going to come and enter my childhood home to attack or hurt my mother. But because my brother hears, voices, hears threats, and feels like “they“ have access to his whereabouts and my mothers whereabouts, he is extremely fearful for her.

As of a few days ago, he became extremely depressed and paranoid post bail, and felt like he was “tired of running“, eluding to ending his life. Since then he agreed to, and is currently in a psychiatric facility in order to gain help. Me and my mother are looking for solutions for him upon his return from the psychiatric facility. Solutions include rehab for drug use, homes for transitioning into independence, and places that ensure the continued use of proper psychiatric medications.

My brother loves life and loves his family. I do not think that his depressive thoughts will last, however, I do know that the voices and his paranoia will continue without the proper help. As I stated before my main issue now is trying to make sure that he knows that my mother is not under any harm and is safe . How can I and my mother help him feel more comfortable with this situation, so that he can focus on himself? I feel that he is too worried about my mother and not worried enough about getting better. (mind you, he is worried about himself and feels chased, but is more worried about my mother for some reason)

I talked about how I’ve only had one major relapse, support taking meds, and enjoy support group and volunteering. Tbh, I personally never got hurt or abused too much and I don’t need a case manager.

773,How to help my friend who is having psychosis and who is naturally very distrustful of the medical system?,3,11ko766,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/11ko766/how_to_help_my_friend_who_is_having_psychosis_and/,1,"My best friend and began drifting apart from each other when we both met our current boyfriends, around the same time about 1.5 years ago. We talk every once in a while and always try to make plans but she would never follow through and the one time. This was getting really frustrating for me and I brought this up to her and she told me she was having troubles of following through on things because she was going through CPTSD, but she didn't seem interested in talking more about this. 

First I wan't to talk about how my friend is while she is not experiencing psychosis. She is as extreme as a hippie can be. The things she talks about are things that most people don't understand. Such as experiencing different realities in meditations, having vivid past life experiences in dreams, channeling different entities, having ego deaths, etc. She is extremely distrustful in the medical system or any system in society in general. She also frequently talks about how she doesn't ""believe in science"". She doesn't go to the doctor, dentist, go to college, or have had any stable job. She focuses all on her spiritual growth. She looks at the spiritual side for everything; for example, the reason why she has digestive difficulties is because she her sacral chakra is blocked, or the reason for her boarderline personality disorder is because her soul is fragmented, etc. For this reason, she is the most spiritually elevated person I have ever met. Everyone we walk past turns their head because her energy is so radiant and she has strangers come up to her and obsess about her. It is actually very fascinating. The reason why I bring this up, is to express that even her normal self can be quite confusing to people and it is really hard for everyone, me included, to know whats she is talking about a lot of the time, but how she is now is on a whole new level of people not being able to understand her. Also, I want to express the hopelessness of her considering western medicine. If anyone, brought that up to her she would probably not talk to them again. Not because she would dislike the person, just it would make her feel misunderstood and her whole life people misunderstand her. Even as her normal self, she is not in the same reality as most of us. 

I ended up running into her twice at different restaurants within one week after not seeing her for about a year. The first time she was very clearly on drugs and seemed avoidant to see me and was not making a lot of sense, both in the way that she seemed too high to communicate and that the things she was saying didn't make much sense. The things she was saying is that she keeps getting re-traumatized and she is really struggling because of that. When I asked what she was talking about. She would just change the subject and I would never fully grasp what she was talking about. She was with her boyfriend, and I met him for the first time, but he didn't seem capable of socializing because of how high he was. 

The second time I saw her, she started to ball her eyes out due to something he boyfriend said to her earlier, and again she wasn't really making sense so I never understood what happened. After, I stayed hanging out with her for about an hour, she cried the whole time about how her boyfriend has a piece of her consciousness and so she is stuck and that her family kicked her out because she is in hell. She said if she leaves her boyfriend, entities will murder her family. Also, that she found a moment of self-love, but then some entities found her and cut off her ears off and she has had CPTSD ever since (she still has her ears btw). During our hour long hangout she talked a lot about things that didn't make sense to me; all things pertaining to entities, consciousness, soul, eternal hell, god, torture, suffering, and that she can't kill herself because her next lives are worse than the one she is living now and that she has no power anymore. The few concrete facts I was able to gather is that she has been using heroine and meth, her family cut off ties from her, and that she has been staying at her grandmas house and that her boyfriend is homeless and is an asshole. 

The only thing I felt I could say was ""You have more power than you think, and love is more powerful than darkness and you have a lot of love"". I feel like I just kept repeating that over because I didn't know how to respond and this is stuff she used to talk about all the time.

I also saw her boyfriend again during this time period and he was a lot more coherent than her. Clearly not high or not as high as last time I saw him. He kept trying to make her feel better and convince her of her power and kept talking about this spiritual/energetic cleanse they were going to do. She wasn't having any of it though. I just thought I would note this as he wasn't fitting this abusive partner archetype that I thought he would. But I understand anyone can put on a face when they want. Either way, I know he got her into drugs because she messaged me about a year ago asking if I can get my techy boyfriend to buy her heroine off the deep web for their ""spiritual healing"". Super strange request from my friend who has always been anti-drug and boarderline-judgemental of drug users. Obviously, we said no. 

I have messaged her sister asking what is going on with my friend, and she said that she has been staying with her boyfriend in order to get drugs and that they keep finding crack in her bedroom, so they had kicked her out and that she is under serious psychosis and they cannot understand anything she is saying and they don't know what to do.

What should I do? How do I help her? What are things you say to someone experiencing psychosis especially when they are so distrustful of anything to do with the medical system/diagnosis/science?",1678160914.0

Went to therapy and psychiatrist most of his life but went off meds I believe 2-3 years ago. He says they only made him worse, to which I sort of testified as when I first met him his mental health was really bad.
Recently it got worst to the point he even said “if it gets worse I will admit myself to hospital” however I suspect that was a way to soothe and reassure me than a genuine intent as when I asked “how so?” He cut the conversation.

His psychiatrist costs $500 per sitting, he doesn’t want to see anyone else (which makes sense given he has followed him for a long time) and we are in a bad financial situation 

He also said he is less inclined to see him because at this stage he would be the first one to send him to hospital which is also another financial concern as he would 100% lose his job due to prolonged absenteeism (which already started). 

What do I do? 

I try to do everything for him and I am stressed myself; if we have fights (over nothing actually worth an argument) he becomes psychotic and violent verbally and physically. We kinda go in circles of: 
A fight happens
We get super distressed 
Takes a few days to adjust 
I struggle more and more not just believing in his love but believing in myself, having a sense of self, and at the same time I don’t know how to help.

I spoke to him about the potential of exploring keto diet as a treatment as well as EMDR and TMS therapies, things that I mentioned along the way but he has now become opposed to even say “I’ll try”. I understand the depth of his depression but I genuinely don’t know what to do.",1678105417.0

Today it did, but the best possible way I think. I don't know how long she was off her medication, but the last few days it grew much worse than I had ever seen. When she was upset she was rambling about things she hadn't since she first developed schizophrenia. 

I had to call police to take her. I wish I hadn't watched this all unfold but I did. I am incredibly thankful for the officers that helped today, they did everything they could to calm the situation. Unfortunately my mom was too far gone and they had to use force. If I had not mentioned exactly what was happening and what to expect I think this could have gone so much worse and that scares me.

837,Very Worried,8,11jhnfo,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/11jhnfo/very_worried/,7,"Someone I care about very much has been having trouble with his mental health, and got diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia last month. In just a few months he's gone downhill, fast. He's taken the diagnosis very hard and refuses to seek treatment or acknowledge that he really is sick. Sometimes he has flashes of insight, but they're gone quickly. I know this is common, and I even read a book about how to effectively talk to someone who has this problem, but another problem is that I haven't even been able to talk to him enough to use the strategies in the book. 

We were close before, but over the course of the last few months he's distanced himself from me more and more. At this point he's pretty much refusing to speak to me at all. At first he apologized and felt guilty for being distant and said he'd be more present, but it's just gotten worse. Aside from some supposed ""good days,"" where he makes more sense and says he's fine (he's not, but he seems comparatively more fine than before that), which are increasingly few and far between, he's in a constant fog of psychosis. He's been posting incoherently online and pretty much just talking to himself about his delusions, but the worst thing is that some of the things he's been posting are potentially indicative of him planning something dangerous. He's displaying a lot of anger, comments about being disgusted by humanity, talk of being put on a watchlist and ""having a duty to do,"" etc. He told me not to ask him about it. 

I just love him and it hurts that he won't speak to me, because I really want to offer him support. His behavior is scaring me right now, he's deteriorating quickly, and I'm pretty convinced that something bad is going to go down soon. I want so badly to do something to calm or help him, but he won't even speak to me anymore. 

Is there anything I can do but just watch this happen?",1678059198.0

Don't let schizophrenia live in your head rent free. You ultimately have to nurture it. Become the boss and overcome it's negative traits. It's not easy to live with but it doesn't mean you have to let it rule you. Take steps towards a healthier lifestyle. Eat healthy, hydrate yourself, get enough exercise, manage your anxiety, recognise your triggers. Cut out caffeine, concentrate on better sleep. Live abstinent of mind altering substances.

I’m looking for advice / support / opinions / experiences or anything this community might be able offer with what we’re going through. I’m sorry this is a bit long.

My husband had a seizure a couple of days ago and we’ve found he has a brain tumour on his left frontal lobe. His prognosis is good, and we’re fairly positive about how his treatment will pan out. One of my concerns at this point is this - in the past he’s mentioned a time when he was younger where he went through ‘something’. He is really hesitant to talk about it, as it was an awful time for him. I try not to press him on it. 

But with what has happened now, I did ask about it again and he revealed that what he went through is a sort of ‘temporary schizophrenia’ that is most common in young men at the age he was when he had it. Some googling turned up the term ‘schizophreniform disorder’, and with further googling I found that brain tumours, especially where his is located, are more likely in people that have experienced psychosis of some type, and sometimes tumours are misdiagnosed.

From what he’s said, he never sought help or got treatment. I don’t believe his diagnosis was official, although I could be wrong about that. He’s always been very close about that time, and yesterday was the first time he used the term schizophrenia to describe what happened to him. 

My dilemma now is this - we haven’t mentioned this part of his history to his doctors. I think it could be important but I’m not sure. He really doesn’t like talking about it, and I don’t want to add unnecessary stress to him at this time. On the one hand, maybe it won’t make any difference because they need to remove the tumour anyway. But then I think it could be important even if we can’t see how at this time. I’m wondering if I privately have a word with a nurse or doctor, but then I worry that I’m breaching his trust.

I’m also worried that removing the tumour might somehow ‘bring back’ the schizophrenia. I know that brain surgery can cause personality changes, but I don’t know if what I’m worrying about is even possible or if I’m being ridiculous.

extra info: We live in the UK. She has a care coordinator but they're pretty much useless and hardly visit/contact us anyway. I always have to chase them up. I did ask about a carer that could come help but they said no because she's mentally and physically capable to do it herself (which is obviously not the case)...

I had been diagnosed with undifferentiated schizophrenia back in 2021. So up until about 6 months ago I didn’t really experience the worst of my disorder. More recently though I have been experiencing pretty extreme delusions around people, places, and things. It has been extremely hard for me to feel safe in my own mind. Especially with the constant ideas of reference even while on medication. Today though, I sorta figured out why my delusions may have gotten worse and how I can combat them. I started as usual with my daily therapy coping skills.. saying to myself that I was safe and not in danger. (I also have ptsd btw.) So I didn’t think much of it until I realized that everytime I said “I’m safe” my delusions worsened by the second. Only then did I realize that these new symptoms I’ve been experiencing are directly tide to my feelings of safety. So I started writing down that I’m safe and talking to my inner child and guess what? My symptoms vanished ! They do still come back of course but it’s not nearly as scary.

Just saying its the opposite of helpful, and because no one believes it real, no one wants me to even try to prove it one way or the other. So its let these people get away with everything they're doing, while im left to try and prove it, when I don't know what to even try to research, dont have the required tech (no PC), and if i look outside for this alleged speaker? They're saying they'll just report me again and get me taken to the ER, which they did based off illogical claims they had, like ""banging head on wall"". Seriously, how would they know what i banged on a wall if they aren't spying, arent in here, and why would they be believed over me explaining it? Its not like i would announce it if i had. I also was accused of pacing, as if that makes sense to start with, people walk around to clean, use the bathroom, look for lost keys, etc... Some people also do it to think better or when on the phone, so what the heck? With the cops bias and how she did a big no-no saying ""go to the ER or I'll get a warrant for a 2 week evaluation"" I kinda have a fear of being recorded outside doing something that a paranoid person would do. They're also not going to look for themselves to see if there is one or not, so I can't even try to see if it is a delusion or harassment. Its like, the #1 requirement to be a delusion, it has to proven impossible and every attempt to do so is met with someone trying to stop it. 

Record audio? Unless sent off its edited, deleted, or the cops can't hear it even if others do. It also has to be edited because its only loudest when cars are going by, and their voices are distorted, slowed down, and stupidly hard to record (I'm thinking white noise) on a pixel 6. I don't have good audio recording equipment, and for a phone the Pixel has a good mic, but its not THAT good. I'm also not big on spending a lot of $$$ on things I don't really have much use for, so a mic I'd need to hook up to a PC or amp or something, is just ridiculous considering the tampering with audio and files already mentioned. There's no guarantee, and even then, cops want video proof of people who know to not be seen by my eyes, and definitely not a camera. Even though i saw them before he told them that, they wont investigate themselves unless i literally get 100% incriminating evidence. Example: they can use a bug if i said yes, but rejected that in the start because they said they had no reason to. 

So who the heck would be who you go to to prove it when you can't risk doing it yourself, because accusations made by random people who don't know you are believed over your explanations of what you're doing? I can't look around outside by myself for this alleged speaker, cops aren't going to check traffic cameras, IDK anyone who knows tech anything, and I'm not sure if they're actually messing with some Bluetooth thing or not because it sounds ridiculous. I'm also very hesitant saying specifics here, as thats not something i wanna get others worried about as a thing their neighbors can do on a budget. Like, prove its not real beyond ""didn't hear it"" from someone who hasn't first claimed hearing loss, and then I'll believe it, but its the refusal to even try thats showed me its definitely not all in my head. One officer says they came by sneakily and heard nothing, but then never asked me if i heard anything that night they did it so how is that proof I thought I heard something, when i never said i had? It's not 24/7, and especially not at first last spring, if he even did come by theres a HUGE chance it was silent. If they heard me speak to someone not there in 2022 with headphones existing, well id rather know why they were hanging around evesdropping under windows as thats not legal in itself in my state. 

Seriously, who are you supposed to get help from? These ""voices"" have literally been laughing because Im pretty sure i can't afford a private detective so dismissed that ages ago, but that can't be the only option for ""need police service when they're being too ignorant to help"". Like, im glad my payee unblocked legal services but like... Unless there's an affordable option thats not going to be possible, and if they don't think it worth their time/don't take you seriously, whos to say that they'll not just take your money and then not do anything, since that's what everyone else is doing so far without the money aspect. Heck, I'm also concerned that IF one exists who's going to take (example) $50, these guys will double it so he sides with them, as they've been good with the manipulation aspect of it all. Seriously, trying to write while the people next door laughing their butts off and confusing you is nearly impossible, so I'm sure this is a stupid mess, but there's a point there somewhere to explain what I'm asking about. 

By all means it'd help just to have a few people confirm that hallucinations dont hide from people and run away, shut up, or sound like idiots who have speakers stuck somewhere outside your house then intimate you to not look for them, would be good enough lol. Their fear of not being caught is just... Too based in reality to not be someone with a motive, gaslighting and trying to mess with me. Especially when they're saying ""it's the government"" and I've never been a conspiracy theorist, but I do believe someone who is a government worker could be a jerk for their own reasons. Considering how a cops relative or whatever broke in and stole last year, i could see a cop lying to his coworkers who would have otherwise helped, but I don't believe its the collective desire of the police department to harass me, nor is there an order by anyone to do so. (I've also only had one officer ever meet with me, except one time when these hackers changed my phone password and i lost the password, so I'm suspicious of him being who's discouraging everyone from helping, but idk why. Still odd, huge force for a tiny town and ive only seen one officer ever. Was also told he doesn't have to use his body camera, by someone who was impersonated so who tf knows at this point, but something ain't right and idk who you go to prove anything like that.

I'm doing very well, but this is something that comes up rarely but time and time again.

I think I will talk to my therapist about it next session.

No family or friends of mine are schizophrenic or experience flattening and never offer much comfort.

I'm just so tired of it. I don't feel what I'm meant to feel and I hate knowing that. Ever since I started my medication it's been like this. Not to say I don't like my meds, I do- I'm a paranoid schizophrenic, and it's worked great to fix a good portion of my positive symptoms. But the flattening is just so much.

I don't feel love, happiness, or grief like I used to. I didn't cry at my step mother's funeral, I hardly felt anything while there. My leopard gecko, a littke rescue who meant the world to me, died after months of taking him to the vet to try and help him and it's like it didn't even register with me. 

And with my boyfriend, I have moments where I feel no connection. It's like, in that little span of time, he's a stranger and his affections are some kind of nuisance. It is such a confusing and upsetting thing. I've explained this to him but I still feel so bad. And it isn't something I can fix. We just have to deal with it for the time being.

Public settings have always been a challenge, but now that I'm older and work in retail, it's become a task to fit in. I have to play up the smiles and sweet greetings and happiness so much. It's an entirely different person, and I know it isn't real even while doing it. It drops the second I don't have to do it anymore, and I go back to feeling generally empty.

I talk to my therapist about these problems, and right now it's just what I have to deal with while we try different doses and types medication (currently on 15 MG Zyprexa and 175 MG of Effexor) to see what clicks. I know it might get better and I'm happy with the progress I've made, but I just feel like an emotionless freak compared to those around me. 

Obviously I'm not emotionless, but you get the gist. There's a lot more issues I face in the day to day, but that'd be all too much for a reddit post.

926,Sister's Relapse After Change in Diagnosis from Schizophrenia to Bipolar,3,11hxwhw,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/11hxwhw/sisters_relapse_after_change_in_diagnosis_from/,1,"My sister had her diagnosis changed about 3 months ago from Schizhophrenia to Bipolar 1, and her medicine changed from antipsychotics to Lithium. Since the change in medicine, she has complained of discomfort, appetite changes, and had frequent mood swings. 

  
We could feel her instability as one day she will lash out at the family saying she doesn't need our support anymore and she is working on developing a support system on her own, and the next day she will be gentle with us and say that family support is the most important. She started to talk weird saying she is a messenger of God and she is starting a spiritual warfare journey. What makes it complicated is that she has a 2-year old son and she claimed one night that evil spirits possessed the boy and she spent 4 hours battling the demon but finally won the battle and saved her son by asking the spirit to go to heaven. She lives away from us but after hearing that incident, we immediately went to her place and took the kid to our house and to also let her rest because she claimed that she has not been able to get good sleep with the boy making noises at night. 

Another thing worth pointing out is that she is also a single mother as the Father is not in the picture after learning that my sister has schizhophrenia. She went on for 2 more days alone and still hallucinated a lot and did not get much sleep at all, finally she agreed to get admitted to the psychiatric ward when we checked in with her and she was almost going to fall seemingly from multiple days of not sleeping. The doctor changed the diagnosis to Bipolar with Psychosis. It has been 2 weeks in the psychiatric ward and she has been discharged and now staying in the family home, but everyone is a little anxious because she has a history of violent psychosis and even in her own place she actually destroyed her bed frame. She is under control with antipsychotics now (15mg Aripiprazole, Lorazepam and Lithium) but she still says she sees Mary and Joseph appearing in front of her eyes and that she has telepathic powers to communicate with people she wants to contact. Another layer of difficulty is that she is infatuated with her therapist and professes her love for him, and she creates stories in her head that he is in danger or doesn't exist and she needs to go and save him because he doesn't respond much to her. My dear mother is 70 and also a single mother, and she has to juggle between caring for the 2-year old boy and managing trips to the hospital and therapist for my sister. Me and my other brother are there to help out occasionally but we are working full time and this is taking a toll on everyone. It does not help that my sister doesn't particularly show gratitude and still being very demanding and rude but we understand it may not be her actual intention and it could just be the mental illness messing with her.

  
I am looking for a babysitter in the short term to help alleviate the stress in the house but I have concerns that my sister will not be ever stable to be able to bring up the kid in a conducive environment as she herself has a very poor lifestyle. She doesn't have a sense of hygiene, loves junk food, doesn't clean up after herself and has generally poor financial literacy. She does not listen to advices from my mother and always thinks that we are too naggy and trying to bring her down. We have tried many ways of talking sense to her in the gentlest way possible but realized it works against us because when she goes out in society and speaks to other people, they will be brutal towards her not knowing she has a mental condition and call her obese/dirty. She cannot tolerate criticism, but yet does not want to do anything to prove people wrong. She also cannot take stress and although she is back home, she has very limited capacity and it doesn't help when the boy misbehaves, and she will shut down. I would appreciate it if anyone has dealt with similar situations to let me know how you manage this situation. Everyone is very tired at home and worried about not knowing what's the next step to do. When she was initially pregnant, we actually did not support the idea of her being a mother knowing her tendencies of getting in some form of trouble/stressful situation and not being able to plan for the future, but she claimed that this is probably her only chance of conceiving (she is mid 30's) and she did not agree to abort the baby anyway. The scary thing is during her recovery she said that after she recovers, all spirits will leave her body except one more unborn spirit which will be the current kid's younger brother. When she told that to us, I had chills up my body and we (the family) didn't even want to think of the possibility of raising another kid of hers. She seemingly isn't able to plan for the future and it takes a toll on everyone around her.  
Sometimes I feel bad for thinking so but I think it's better to put the kid up for adoption because our household is clearly not the most conducive for his growth, and I cannot see a bright future of this kid in our household when we need to juggle caring for my sister and always monitoring what she does. But of course this isn't possible because my sister would never agree to that.

Some context: My sister had her first psychosis in 2016 after attending a meditation retreat. She came back from the camp and immediately we knew something was wrong. She could not eat and would often look up and blink a lot very quickly and each time that happens, it feels like she switched personalities and acted very differently. The nightmare came when me and my mom were trying to calm her down, and she ran to the kitchen to grab the butcher knife. As I was with my sister I immediately ran with her to the kitchen and fortunately between the kitchen and the main hall there was a door separating the two areas and I was able to close that door and lock it while shouting to my mom to GTFO of the house. We called the police and ambulance, and when all units arrived she was disarmed and transported to the hospital and admitted to the psychiatric ward, tied to the bed as she was hyperactive and very restless. She was then diagnosed with schizhophrenia and put on antipsychotics which seemed to work well for the past couple of years until the change in diagnoses a few months back.",1677932320.0

This led to personality shifts, mood swings and ultimately psychosis. Once I went into treatment for 6 months, I discovered that my schizophrenia was created from adolescent trauma and overstimulation from stressful environments.  So I designed a daily routine that is centered around safety, quietude, positive input and balanced mental / physical engagement. Once I fine tuned this balance of stimulation and concentration, I was able to engage with my creative projects and feel like myself again. This breakthrough came after 10 years of struggling with this illness. Recovery for me came down to environment, people & thoughts. If I find healthy ways to calm these elements while also sober, I am able to enjoy a stability that can be replicated everyday. I am curious if others have made this connection as well.

He was the kindest person I knew, would never hurt a soul. He began experiencing symptoms when he was 17, senior in high school, about to graduate. 

He was my half brother. We didn’t grow up close because our dad left his first wife for my mom. My brother began experiencing symptoms around this time. To this day, my dad feels tremendous guilt believing he was the cause to his schizophrenia. 

I come from a family of Mexican immigrants. Mental illness is very much stigmatized, and many families are simply ignorant on how to handle or “deal with” situations like this. I know that’s triggering to say, and I’m sorry. 

Because we are half siblings and I was conceived by “the other woman,” I wasn’t close to this sibling. He wad 15 years older than me. 

Anyway, I grew up scared of this sibling. He was always talking to himself, and screaming at his voices. I have vivid memories of him being in the backyard and screaming at his voices while The Smiths or Depeche Mode was on full blast. He would say the voices were mean to him and told him to kill himself daily. That he was stupid. Everyone hated him. He believed them. 

He would get arrested often, and ended up living in a group home. He took monthly injections. My poor sweet brother would try to work and tried to go to back to college. 

Last week, he went missing. We were so scared and tried every day to find him. The police tell us his body has been found today, and that we will have to pay for an autopsy if we want to know how he died specifically. 

In the last few years, he became violent, refused to take meds, and started taking crack. I truly believe it was to relieve his symptoms. 

I’m not sure what the point of this post is. My heart is breaking because I know he deserves so much more from life than what he got. If perhaps families that are low income or without much resources were educated in schizophrenia and early intervention. My dad is in his 80s and cannot forgive himself for perhaps being the reason why my brother got so sick. Another one of my siblings has also been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.

Last week I received a call from her, and let's just say the comments and her tone were completely out of character.  I tried calling Sam about three days ago but she doesn't want to talk, and I don't want to push. 

&#x200B;

I think it's relevant I mention she is mostly lacking trust in others. Her parents mention this lack of trust includes doctors, and she has not been taking her prescription lately. She had been caught trying to dispose of her pills several times and is now asked to take them in front of her parents so they could see her take it. This has apparently exasperated her trust issues and she is suspicious of her parents insistence on taking her prescriptions. 

&#x200B;

I'm hoping someone can offer some advise on how I should approach this situation. Should I try keep reaching out to her, or should I just wait until she's ready? When she is ready to talk, how do I go about trying to suggest taking her prescription? Should I even make that suggestion? Because on one hand I think she really does need it, and on the other hand it might seem pushy and she could grow wary of me too.",1677909627.0

So, I come from a family with a lot of generational trauma. My mother raised me as a single mum because a psychic channeler told her she was going to find her soulmate within a month, she met an autistic criminal gang member with 5 different names and decided she was going to have a baby with him, despite him telling her he wasn't going to help her raise it. So you can kind of see the problem already.

She has severe persecutory delusions against my grandmother, who adopted me away from her, and severe delusions of grandiosity that she's some kind of goddess who cannot do harm to anyone, and she will get extremely angry if you inform her that she has done harm to someone. This includes me. She also seems to have a delusion that I want to be ""friends"" with her, and that since I'm ""friends"" with her, I ""owe"" her for raising me, since we're ""equals"". Despite the fact that she had me at 19 and her ""raising"" me consisted mostly of physical abuse and unnecessary poverty, since she always squandered all her money on clothes she never wore and then refused money from my grandmother to help her raise me. She also broke my wrist as a baby but that's a story for another day.

Basically, my mum is the stereotypical ""schizo"". What the hell am I supposed to do?! She sometimes shows up at my house uninvited and lets herself in, believing that she has a right to enter since she owns me as her daughter, I can't avoid her and interacting with her is a sure fire way to ruin my mental state for upwards of a month. Does anyone who understands what it's like to be in her position have ANY idea how I can deal with her? She's the sole reason I'm now diagnosed with DID but she still believes that she's done no harm. It's becoming increasingly hard over my life to be my own individual rather than just ""daughter of crazy woman"".

(p.s. I must disclaim that I understand that majority of schizophrenics aren't like this. My mother also has BPD, but on top of that she is just a fucking terrible person, no matter what disorders she has. It's taken me a lot of my life to learn that disorders don't define someone's personality, regarding others' and my own.)",1677878774.0

956,Advices to keep your illness in check so you live better quality life.,2,11hi38t,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/11hi38t/advices_to_keep_your_illness_in_check_so_you_live/,0,"It's now more than 10 years since I got diagnosed, to be honest it's mostly untroubling with occasional yearly hospitalizations. So far I got 2 stretches of 2 years, so total of 8 for the past 11, be it I had to learn some coping mechanisms along the way to reduce hospitalizations. I must admit the first were 3 months all the rest 20 days total and by day 10 I was pure gold again, it's just the law around here to keep me at lest 10 more. I was told my quality of life will deteriorate while on the contrary it got better since first hospitalization almost to the point before that, but anyway it wasn't peachy even then. Here is my list for new starters:

1. **What I've learned is meds helps. So take them.** Can't vouch for others but my dosage is bare minimum, and I don't even take it all the time. Should be on 12 hour cycle morning and evening, mostly battling with my insomnia, so I take them just at night to put me asleep. I found out I need to constantly visit psychiatrist on a monthly basis to regulate the dosage, which is annoying. **I don't recommend anything I personally do with my medication patterns, I lack PhD in the matter to be an expert.**  This is  what I do and mostly get by just fine. Mainly hate getting dizzy, and cant hit doctors constantly to readjust dosage, I need to get in line with 20 other patients each time...Arm yourself with the knowledge what to do when you skip accidentally taking them, as it will happen over the span of the rest of your life or until a cure is present, which comes first.
2. **Make a habit to do reality checks.** This is a magic trick I invented for myself! As with most people you got diagnosed with this illness later in life, and you didn't grew up with it. So you've got strong understanding of what objective reality feels like from past time experiences. This is a technique I've invented for myself to be able to tell if an episode is behind the corner. I use scale of 1 to 10, if I feel the objective reality is weirder than 4, meaning 5 is about on the border of an episode. I start taking full cycle of morning and evening dosage, although I am not a fan of morning till noon dizziness. If I did, I sure know under the counter drugs have way more enjoyable effects.
3. **Cut off recreational drug usage.** Meaning Marijuana, and I don't really recommend taking at all anything else beside that. If you do take it, in case you live in a place where's allowed by law, like some states in U.S. Lesser strains might have less of an impact, I find life enjoying as it is to experiment with such things. Anything that shift your perception of reality will re-arrange your mentality too much. Once a year I get some pleasure with Sativa to be honest, because I like to clean, tide and dust the house when I smoke, or solo slow dancing in my room on something gentle. Anyway, I found out you won't get stable mentality while using recreational drugs. Stand by my word and don't recommend doing it. Get a hobby. Something that's interesting for you to enjoy. It's far less dangerous. Drawing is a good start. As your perception is twisted, with time you might get very interesting results when you get skilled at it. That's why one of the therapies in mental hospital is drawing. It elevate stress. I recommend [pixeljoint.com](https://pixeljoint.com) instead.
4. **Keep a healthy lifestyle.** Or at least a bit more healthier. People with that illness got trouble with addictive substances because they use them as coping mechanisms. Anything that can provide additional endorphins would do good. I like walking. Running is also fine, doing yoga and hitting the gym on occasion would get fantastic results.  The thing is that it need a bit of time to feel the effect, the reason be it from scientific standpoint the protein that carry endorphins to the brain is 100 times smaller than the molecule of the endorphin, it take a while to carry it to the brain. There's a video online that present it almost as if it's a guy casually walking while carrying big balloon with him. In essence, I know that physical training is counter intuitive because it's tightly connected with feeling physical pain. People struggling with schizophrenia already feel emotional pain almost all the time, and more pain to add feel a bit overwhelming.
5. **Balanced diet is preferable too.** I am not here to lecture you what good food means for your mind and body.
6. **Social connections.** Due to the illness expect your social circle to shrink to 0, that include family. Sometimes even family members struggle to be your friends anymore because you become a burden. Inability to hold a job due to stress can put economical strain on the family and then it gets ugly. If you're able find at least 1 family member, 1 friend or paid specialist that understand your problems. Later one is preferably Cognitive Behavioral Specialist and the right choice among all of them because he's paid to listen to you, while all the rest will show you the finger at some point. Although some people state it's psychology hokum, it's not. My thoughts were confusing and cutting out, I had hard time thinking, until 5 visits with that Cognitive specialist helped me realize it's alright bad thoughts to come around and it's far easier to let them pass, examine and let them fly the f\*ck away. That specialist is dealing with finding root of problems and adjusting your mental point of view upon the problem you have. It won't magically fix the problem, you just know what is the root of it so you can find strength to oppose it. Think of it as a weed in your backyard you can't get rid of. More about social connections is that with time passing you should find new activities where you can gather more friends. You need to keep the social circle as wide as possible. Your doctors and fellow patients you meet are not part of your social circle. Doctors are obligated to be in the role of the friend, while the patients you meet have no other option. And don't bug out on people, it's hard to not have a life but pretend you do, and keep tab on them from time to time, nobody has the time for you. For what it's worth people can't find time to pray to their own god, what about you.
7. **Sleep.** Try to keep your sleep pattern in check. You need to sleep at the same time, and same amount of time each night, no matter Saturdays and Sundays. That's your goal. You're in deep sleep debt. More deprivation is making things worse. It's hard to tell you to increase sleep when you feel tired as this can again throw you off balance. It's a gamble here. You lose when you don't sleep, sometimes you lose when you sleep more than you should, and it's always fine to sleep same amount everyday.
8. **Travel.** Abstain from long travels, prepare short preemptive hospitalization by your own will beforehand so you're sure to be ticking alright when you leave. Be prepared especially if you travel east by plane and skip more than 2 time zones. An article online found an intricate effect on circadian rhythms that if you skip more than 2 time zones by plane when you arrive you might get a bit delusional and get unexpected mood elevation. That's why Brits love going to the Black Sea in Bulgaria, as it's 3 time zones which is plenty 1 zone extra and is dirt cheap of a vacation by their standards no matter the price they have to face. My illness happened when I traveled more 3 time zones east, in the summer heat of August, while being heavily stressed from long work hours. Not sure why, but if there's too much events happening at the same out of the blue your brain can't process everything. You got reduced capacity to digest information. I guess too much surfing on internet could shorten the attention span and your brain feels like it's watching a movie but be able to get 1 frame out of 25 per second because poor connection is halting the stream of data and it can't follow the story on display. I guess if you spend some time reading books that will fix the problem, as this requires stretching to read long wall of text and keep fresh understanding what is going on.
9. **Keep track of time.** Although you don't realize it you need to be aware of passage of time. A ticking wall clock will also help with chasing bad spirits. Your subconscious mind will be able to track time by the harmonious ticks of it. I've never tried using a metronome, I am strongly suspicious it will help. If you can't afford one or don't know how to use one if be anything special at all you might put a task for yourself and put exact time limit, when you finish with it, try to tell how much time has passed without looking a clock. If you're able to accurately tell you can even endure an episode without much damage. I happened to have one that led to nothing much. I put a task to myself to go on a walk for exact hour and got back in 55 minutes without knowing how much time it will be required for me to roam that exact pattern. Reality were shifted but mainly my thoughts were out of normal order. I felt delusional but didn't act on it. Which is next...
10. **Do not act on strange thoughts**, they tend to lead to strange outcomes that will put you in a hospital, with time you'll be taking very heavy meds in high dosage pretty much all the time, and this will lead to you not taking them, shortening time between hospitalizations and thus treated as walking danger. All strategies I've mentioned are coping mechanisms that help, but you must be able to tell in advance when brown matter is hitting the fan. Reality checks help because when you're delusional you can't really tell you are, that's your reality now. But if you check it beforehand each day how it feels like, you know what to expect, you know that you're delusional and by how much.
11. **If you got any addictions, try to find accountability partner.** An addiction would count as any compulsive act you do to cope with stress. From drugs and alcohol trough gamble and sex. I personally try to keep my caffeine intake to a cup before noon, as half life of caffeine is 6 hours, which is how much will be left at 6 PM, if I want to sleep well I should get rid of most of it from my system by 10 PM.
12. **Abstain from suicide, it's normal phenomenon.** You're both stuck in a rut and depressed by same problem that lead to same outcome and has no solution. Should tell you that I found out for myself the need to end your life is actually something nomadic people solved quite easily, because it's nothing else but a feeling for general change. Nothing more. That's why they just packed whatever they had and problem was solved. So if feel the need to end it, be aware you won't get extra points on the day of judgment. Go on vacation or visit nearby town, change the scenery for a while, go with your relatives to see a cousin and go fishing, find something to do that you never did before, even something you might not like, maybe visiting an art gallery, you surely might not like it, but it's just one of the things you've checked on the bucket list. What kept me over the years from this act is when I imagine what will follow, a funeral and broken faces looking down in a hole. You don't want your relatives to do that before the natural time comes. Nothing helps until the general change in your life is present, but at least you fought it off it will be years before you have the urge to do something like this again. And you know how to show it the way out. But that change will come, be sure. No rush to the Evermore, you'll have eternity to browse around the endless beyond that is afterlife, where everyone and every living thing that was is there already. Imagine the eons of life packed in one place. You'll forget where's the entrance at some point I imagine. Don't worry we'll get there. Suicide help lines are a thing you should know.
13. **Depression is leading cause of point 12 in the list.** Clinical depression is something the pills try to keep you away. I found out for myself that if I start binge watching some series, and feel I don't wanna do anything else I am facing the faceless void of depression. Someone might argue that meds are the only way out of it. But there's more natural remedy. That is to start tasking. Wake up ""I will stare at the f\*cking ceiling for 5 minutes..."", Done, I will take the trash out, Done,  make 1 cup of black hot steaming dirt and drink it, then clean the cup...Did you notice it? It's all small trivial tasks, but you need to keep track of them. You trick your mind you're playing a game, and your mind like games. It's counterintuitive but that way I've snapped out of heavy 2 week depressions in a finger snap. Hot showers help, but I must tell you cold showers are the real deal. I've been doing those and making joker faces in the mirror out of happiness after. If you want cut the crap and shove yourself under the cold shower, it works like magic! Depression is a void of feelings, you get numb. You can't find your worth for whatever reason and it's all the same. Shove yourself under the shower now!
14. **Prepare for shift of seasons.** I did not invent this it just happens when Summer meet Autumn and Winter meet Spring more trouble are coming. That's partly because Autumn lead to depression being a sad season knowing winter is even more bleak and uneventful, while you have hard time adjusting for the spur of Life that Spring brings and the crazy Summer that follows with it's immense heat. Keep your brain cool, as you probably got problems with ventilation of the CPU in your head. That's why my doctor said to be aware of summer heat and stay in the shadows as much as possible. Global warming is your enemy. It's not that much of the heat as also the quality of the air. There's too much CO2 and whatnot since past 20 years. I can physically feel it. The blue in the sky shifted it's colors to somewhat gray.
15. **Breathing practice leads to better circulation.** I've noticed over the years that with my smoking habit my breathing became uneven, I need no PhD to know this lead to less than perfect blood circulation which deprive the brain of proper oxygen flow. Mediation is something I can't stretch out enough. But it helps so much, it's only hard to stick to it. Because of trivial reasons like time obsessions. Like why I need to do perfectly nothingness and how it will help me at all achieve whatever, you might ask? Well, for one, the blood circulation and your breathing pattern, to do the meditation practice you need peace and quiet, this leads to finding such a time and place where it's possible to practice it, which you'll see is at best 4-5 o'clock in the morning, while 99.99% of people in 100 miles radius are asleep, because our society is lazy, and people can't just leave at 6 o'clock in the morning and leave their kids alone before school. And finally how meditation help is by locking your brain in his own domain where it most like it, the wake state of dream world! Dark nothingness of shapes drawing in your mind. Until at some point you start seeing white puffy clouds of bliss forming and going who knows where as if Indian Shaman has lighted up the piece pipe. Be aware it takes at least 3 weeks consistent effort of lets say 10 minutes a day to feel any difference as meditation rewires your brain, and this machine has complicated code patterns.",1677884800.0

Did the people (who suffered of schizophrenia)  from the older centuries had the same symptoms as the people who suffer from schizophrenia in now ? 

What kind of speach did they have back then ?

 What kind of symtomes did they have ? 

 I suppose that the cognitive and physical symptomes were the same , or at least similar, but what about their speach ?

980,I feel like I've lost my brother forever,14,11gp8xu,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/11gp8xu/i_feel_like_ive_lost_my_brother_forever/,11,"My 43 yo brother decided to stop taking his meds 4 years ago when I moved out of state. He told no one in the family he chose to do this. When I moved back into state and saw him for the first time, he looked gaunt, haggered and not like anyone I know.

Flash forward to spring 2022 and he gets in trouble with the law. I suspect he left his front door open accidentally during one of his episodes and didn't notice it because of his preoccupation. He accused the neighbor across the street of breaking in. He went to their home and knocked on their door with a gun (how he got this is shock to me). That's aggregated assault with a deadly weapon, a felony.

We were able to get him a lawyer and get him into an AMAZING probation program that esstientally would remove any felony from his record. Additionally, it's a special mental health probation so they're more flexible because they understand what these folks are dealing with.

Then, in August of last year he stopped paying his rent and was evicted. Then he was homeless. I tried guiding him the best I could but he's so angry and doesn't listen to anyone's opinions, especially women's. He FINALLY got into a place in December that was a really good deal, and his disability monies would cover his rent.

Yesterday he calls me and told me he was arrested for violating his probation.

I know he has been drinking, but I really suspect he's doing drugs as well. He looks so weathered I can't imagine alcohol alone could do that in such a short amount of time.

I really love my brother, but this is so hard on me. I'm the only one he trusts in the family now (because I treat him like a fucking human being even if he is a dick sometimes) I know what he's dealing with is immeasurably harder than anything I have to. 

I just don't know what I can do or should do to help him. I've offered AA or to find him some support groups like this where he could talk with other people going through the same thing, men he could have a good friendship with.. He just blows me off. He says he's antisocial one minute, then moans about how lonely he is. I can't keep up with his thought patterns. I have to keep a journal when talking to him so I can write down what he says then try to figure out what things were said to me vs the other voices he hears. 

Sorry for the long post, I'm just totally gutted. I feel absolutely helpless to do anything for him and the criminal justice system is not going to help him get better either. Any advice or just stories of how you've been able to turn things around would really give me some hope right now.

I honestly believed my psychiatrist diagnosed me in order to help get various resources and benefits from the government. I was interstate last month and had a decent job, I fell into psychosis and tried to kill myself 3x before being admitted to the psych ward for 12 days. My Mum was actually the one to point out that in the last 10 years I have had 11 admissions to the psych ward, all for the same damn thing - psychosis. My primary risk factors are both stress and lack of sleep.

I'm 33 years old and I honestly feel that my condition is getting significantly worse as I get older. It seems that after each psychotic period I find it easier to fall into psychosis and the symptoms are more intense. I don't know what ""stage"" I am in, but I do know that having been charged with a criminal offence being heard in 4 weeks has caused significant stress that triggers my brain to enter into this state of mind that I hate so much. I spent all last night pacing in circles around my motel room and talking to myself, just getting angry and things.

It just doesn't matter what I seem to do, I continually fail over and over. I have recently come to terms with my diagnosis and have given up trying to live according to the high standards I thought I'd be able to manage. I've signed over my government benefits to my Mum because I am terrible with money. 

I'm on Abilify as an AP and whilst it's the best medication I can tolerate, it still seems and times intolerable. I get severe EPS side effects, major tremors and also significant akasthesia that I end up needing to take Benztrop for. I also take Concerta and Tramadol for various issues. 

I am beginning to feel like my situation is just hopeless. I'm currently in temporary accommodation and waiting for a social housing place to be allocated. I lost my job, got criminally charged and tried to commit suicide 3x just over the last month alone. I am really concerned about the charges and really don't want to go to jail. I will lodge my defence of mental health - hopefully the judge sees that I'm genuinely struggling so much.

I was in denial because I didn't think I was the stereotypical schizophrenic, only to then become homeless, dependent upon welfare, crap personal hygiene despite doing my best, talking to myself - yeah, I am almost now the definition of a stereotypical schizophrenic. I saw myself in the mirror the other day and I can't believe how much I've let myself go. It doesn't seem to matter what dosage / type of AP I am on, the efficacy just seems to be getting less and less.",1677812969.0
