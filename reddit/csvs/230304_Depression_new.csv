Being saturday, there are no activities in the psychiatric hospital I (m, 36) am staying in. But what hurts me most is that I had bought my mother a DVD boxset (I know, old fashioned) for christmas and we often times watched episodes in the evening when I came for a visit.

Understandibly, this is not happening at the moment and she does not watch it alone although I encouraged her to.

Now I feel like I made her an empty gift. I feel so bad for being here. I just want to watch an episode with her an forget the world around me.

Fuck psychotherapy and medications,5,11hwhf2,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11hwhf2/fuck_psychotherapy_and_medications/,0,"First of all, I'm not attempting to discourage anybody from these things, do what you want, I'm just voicing my experience and opinion here.

&#x200B;

With that out of the way, I want to say that if you can't help or fix yourself by yourself, you're done. Nobody else will be able or want to. After a year of therapy and medications, I'm in the exact same place, but just 1000$ poorer (a lot of money where I live). I would have been better off spending that money on a nice trip, or buying all the things I need. 

&#x200B;

Psychotherapy is just a racket, even if the therapist genuinely tries to help. I've had 2 different therapists, one of which was young and inexperienced, and the other old and experienced, so I've seen enough of psychotherapy to form an opinion, and that opinion is that it doesn't do shit. It just gives you false hope. Nobody wants to take any responsibility.

&#x200B;

I took zoloft (50mg at first then 75mg later). It did literally nothing. Not exagerating, I genuinely felt zero difference. Then since that didn't work, I was prescribed Aripriprazole, which other than drugging me, also didn't do anything. I even took larger doses than I was prescribed, just to see for myself if increasing the dosage would make a difference. Didn't do anything. So I told the psychiatrist that I want to stop taking medications, and of course she said ""nooo, its too early to stop"". Obviously I didn't listen to her and I quit the drugs cold turkey. And guess what. Apart from the withdrawal symptoms that went away after a week, I felt ZERO difference. So for a year I poisoned myself with that shit for no reason. Medicine is just given to you to zombify you so that you can tolerate all the bullshit around you without thinking. They hear you have suicidal thoughts, so they don't want to be bothered or take any responsibility so they just give you drugs so they can sleep at night. But that's not the solution. And who knows what the long term consequences are. I might have gotten irreversible brain damage, or permanently messed up my body chemistry because of those drugs. And for what. 

&#x200B;

Now you might say ""therapy and medications worked for me"", in which case, congratulations, glad it helped you, but don't give them credit, because it was probably 90% your effort or character

TLDR: I've given up.

It has been a long few months. Ever since I got out of my last job, I've been trying to find a new one. Every rejection or no replies just adds more on top of the burdens I should honestly not be carrying if I made better life decisions. Not a second goes by where I think about unaliving myself. But I know I can't do it. The guilt of leaving everyone I love is too much for me to even try. It hurts me so much to know that in all my years, the time where every single support system I have is at its peak, my mental just gets worse. Nothing motivates me anymore and I've basically given up trying to find a new job but I keep trying. Why do I keep trying? I have no idea. It isn't motivation that's for sure.

Wanna hear a funny joke?,2,11hvu7k,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11hvu7k/wanna_hear_a_funny_joke/,0,"I grew up in an abusive household only to grow up and enter an abusive relationship. What a twisted, ugly joke. Two years later and I still can’t fucking leave. I have tried so hard ever since I was a child to survive the constant mental and emotional anguish that others put me through but it has taken a staggering toll on me. Now I’m the one putting myself through hell and I don’t know how to stop it. 

My ex who I am stuck living with would verbally abuse and manipulate me until I shut down or had a breakdown. Then she would get mad and use my response as an excuse to hit me. The verbal stuff still happens. So does the manipulation. I can’t say this to her face but I’m scared of her and how she treats me sometimes. 

I have nowhere to go. I am estranged from my own family and I have little to no friends. I go to work with crowds of people I’m terrified of and then come home to a place I am also terrified of. There’s nowhere on this Earth for me that feels safe. Are you laughing yet?

I saw a psychiatrist and she said that I was suffering from psychosis. I started taking some meds to help with the symptoms. I’m so broken that no one would ever want anything to do with me if they really knew me. I’m a fucking mess as a result of my life. I don’t know how I’m ever gonna be able to pick up the pieces.

About 4 years ago I was dating a boy I loved with all my heart, nothing was better than being with and around him. However about a year into our relationship I got majorly depressed because of my history with sexual assault, and everything became incredibly hard and difficult. I got recommended to go to a doctor and I did, and I got prescribed Mirtazapine. About 2 months in I started to notice that I wasn't really there, and that my depressive flashbacks got worse and worse to the points where I would be gasping for air on the floor while SH'ing   
For some reason I didn't tell my doctor about this as my entire world turned more and more grey and I  just autopiloted my way through life.   
Then about a month later, a random guy met came up to me and essentially hit on me really aggressively. I don't know why but I flirted back, and later that day I would do a singular oral act on him. That's when it all hit me, how disgusting it felt, the pure grossness of it all. It felt as though I snapped back to reality and had just been SA'd (which I haven't.) . I immediately went home and SH'd to an outrageous point to where I was getting lightheaded from how much blood I lost. I broke up with him the day after. To this day I still am disgusted by it to the pit of my core and I am just genuinely scarred by it even though I feel like I have no right to be.

Feel like I’m losing a friend,5,11hte24,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11hte24/feel_like_im_losing_a_friend/,6,"Lately I feel like one of my best friend has gotten so depressed that he is no longer a functioning human being, and it’s hurting me cuz It feels like I can’t do anything for him. 

So I’m very close friend with this guy for the past decade, met through a common hobby and extended into like a family friend. My kids know him and his wife and played with their dog frequently, we met frequently even during COVID, they had their wedding during COVID and we were one of the only two families invited. Point is we are very good friend and on good terms. 

Around three years ago, he started distancing himself from the hobby that we all once liked and the circle of friends that we had, since we were still hanging out we didn’t think much. Less than two years ago he started to hermit at home and do nothing but play games, would still come out for dinner but very rarely can I get him to come out for something else. He also started liquidating some of the expensive hobbies that he had. We knew he was having depression because I had other family members exhibited similar issues early stage, but because he was still hanging out, I thought I could at least be there to help. 

Around mid last year, he really lost touch with everyone, constantly refusing to even come out for food, refuses to come out for social events. It became hurtful to talk to him because he would refuse the invitations in a emotionless way, answering in single word like “no” or just single meme stickers that says “no”. He started having this vivid fantasy of living in japan thinking japan would solve all his problem when I know it wouldn’t. I know that’s his fantasy to escape from reality but it’s gotten to the point that he can’t enjoy real things happening around him. His wife says social life is becoming too tiring for him even the smallest interaction would be a lot for him to handle. He wasn’t just hiding from me. I’m sad because this is a friend that once I could share so much with, but now he lives merely a 10mins drive away but I can’t even get him to answer me. 

This sounds like definitely a depression right? What can I do? Obviously I can’t force myself into his life, but seeing a friendship just getting thanos-snapped and unable to do something for him just eats me up.",1677916193.0

I miss that feeling of giving unconditional love of being able to give that love. Because I don't know if I'll ever be able to give that again. I sure as shit never received it.

To put into perspective, I am 24M, diagnosed with treatment resistant depression and anxiety, always been on a rather plain and bad diet (constant fast food, burgers, fried chicken, French fries etc) and never really taken vitamins until recently. I’m not overweight or super fit and don’t workout or get exercise like I should or did growing up. Past few years have been hell for me. Can’t hold a job, push people away and stress family out with my life issues with depression. 

I’ve been having really bad and almost completely constant days where I feel groggy, sleep too much and almost feels like what I imagine someone senile to feel like when getting older. I can’t put words together or make sense of things around me and I find it hard to focus and it’s getting scary.  

I’ve finally decided to stop feeling sorry for myself and try to take care of the root of the problem which I believe to be my diet and exercise.

I don’t have any point of living for myself, I only live because my family wants me to. But what about what I want ? Everyone seems to know better than me how I feel and what I should do, even when they’ve never experienced the pain I’m going through. As long as I’m still breathing everyone’s happy except me. I feel like my life doesn’t belong to me. But since I’m still here because of them, they call it “hope”. I’m hopeless, but it doesn’t matter to them. My soul is gone but my body’s still here, so what’s the problem ? I arrived at a point of my life where I don’t even want to get better, I just want it to stop. To be honest, if I had a “you’re immediately feeling better” button, I would still push it. But that’s not how things work, right ? You need strength, courage, and efforts to get better. I tried with all my heart and it failed. I don’t have any energy left to start over and potentially fail again. Life is just not for me, it’s too tough, I’m too weak (and that’s okay!). I just feel like nobody understand my point of view, nobody sees how hard it is to wake up every morning and immediately think about ending my life. Because I’m still breathing, so everything is alright 👍🏻

____________________
I’ve displayed symptoms of a serious disease, and I’m scheduled for a bunch of testing next week as doctors are concerned. I’m diagnosed with chronic depression, but not anxiety. I have struggled with low, depressed mood my whole life. I cannot really recall any point in my life where I felt happy for more than a few days at a time, and it makes me think that life isn’t for everyone. I also have ADHD and suspected autism, so socializing is very difficult on me. I find it annoying and draining, so I obviously don’t have friends. I’m alone 95% of the time, surrounded by my two dogs.

So, now that I may have a serious and life threatening disease.. why am I hoping to get diagnosed with it? I think I lack the feeling of being important to someone (other than pets), feeling wanted, wanting attention. Scared of dying without anyone caring. I have a very distant and cold family and we rarely talk. I was emotionally neglected throughout my childhood so I get no support from them. I generally just feel like a ghost. My autistic traits combined with my ADHD struggles makes finding friends very difficult. I’m just not naturally on the same wavelength with anyone, and when you have to constantly adjust yourself to others I’d rather not socialize. I’ve tried for 25 years and I have never had a best friend or a stable friend group. I’ve been tossed around depending on who needs me at a current moment. When I’m not needed for anything, I’m forgotten. My life is a tragedy. I feel like an alien and I simply don’t belong. I usually hate attention. It’s my worst enemy.. so why am I craving it now that I could be sick? I feel disgusting for admitting it. Maybe I’m looking for an excuse for life to end naturally. I’m trying to not over-analyze it, but my systematic brain cannot help it.",1677904076.0

That is me. I can hardly brush my teeth, for example. Brushing my teeth is super difficult. I brush them maybe once or twice a month. Yeah, horrible, I know. It’s been this way for like 5 years straight. You might be in the same situation. However, I still eat and drink of course. I eat sugary foods like chocolate and gummy bears. Sweets and overeating has been a coping mechanism for a while. So, I was thinking oh god I’m destroying my teeth and have cavities for sure... Yet, I still couldn’t find motivation to brush my teeth. 

I finally went to the the dentist recently expecting the worst and they said my teeth had zero problems. They’re completely fine. The dentist even said “you’ve got nice strong teeth” 

Excuse me?? What the HECK!? HOW. 

I started researching why this could be and I figured out the most likely savior here. I drink tea every single day. Black tea, green tea, oolong, etc. “Studies show tea may help prevent cavities by reducing the bacteria and decay-causing acid produced in your mouth. Both green and black tea also contain fluoride that can help ward off tooth decay.” 

I noticed this long before I knew! “Might help” no no, it definitely does. My breath didn’t smell bad anymore after drinking tea, despite not brushing that day. My mouth felt “icky” but once I drank some strong black tea, it was gone. If you’re struggling with hygiene but don’t mind incorporating tea into your diet, I can’t recommend it enough. Especially with the black tea I noticed the biggest difference.

To my knowledge, depression is an illness. But is it really ill to appear ""depressed"" most of the time and cry yourself to sleep sometimes when your past is full of majorly bad events, current life genuinely sucks and future doesn't seem bright? I mean an ""illness"" has to be curable or at least treatable according to my perspective. But in my situation I don't see how pills or talking to a psychiatrist would help. On the other hand, some money would fix almost all of my problems and I don't think I'd cry myself to bed anymore. So I'm not sure if I'm really sick and can claim to be depressed.

I don't mean to imply that you can only beconsidered depressed if you're sad even when your circumstances are optimal - I know that it can even be a default side effect of some other sickness (such as a chronic illness which I have.).

I don't even know what to say here. I've been on what feels like a self destructive downfall over the past 4 years. I don't feel like I am comfortable telling others the extent of what I feel, let alone going to anyone I know for support.

I haven't done anything or gone out with anyone in general in months. I have some serious trust issues, and it's led me to close up my emotions, push away my friends and family, and it's created this inner bitterness towards others. I hate myself for it. I hate that I'm not strong enough to make a change for good in my life, like actually fucking quitting nicotine, like I've tried to do 8 times maybe. I use cannabis daily, and rotate alcohol in and out depending on how quickly I go through a bottle. Alcoholism runs in my family so I'm afraid of going too far, but it's getting harder and harder to live my day to day life.

I had a really bad spell a couple years ago where I cut regularly, starved myself for days at a time for a few weeks or so. I've had urges here and there since, but I've since switched that to the rubber band technique since in my line of work open scars on my hands kinda suck (I'm a mechanic).

Basically, the thing that made me want to make this post is that I just popped a blood vessel in my wrist. I got what I was asking for, I got pain. Not quite what I was expecting, usually the red marks go away after a half hour to an hour. This massive lump on my wrist  just made me stop and think, how long am I going to keep this up.

I cried for the first time in a while a bit ago in the shower. I don't cry like I used to anymore, now it's a short burst and right back to normal. My lack of inner emotion makes me feel like something is wrong with me.

In 2019, I landed a great job, I was travelling the world and started dating a really nice girl. But then, 2 weeks after we got together, her mom died in a freak accident, we broke up soon after, and then covid put an end to my work and travel. So I ended up moving back home with my parents.

In 2020, I found a new job and started making enough money to move out of my parents house and was feeling good about life again, then my dog died suddenly and I was fired for taking time off to grieve. So I ended up losing my job, dog, and apartment in the space of a few weeks and was suddenly back to square one (again) 

In 2021, after the knockbacks of the previous 2 years,  I found a new, very high paying job that I enjoyed and started talking to an awesome woman who worked there, we really hit it off and after a while became romantically involved but then she died suddenly from an undiagnosed heart condition just a few months after meeting. It was around this time I got hit really hard with depression and ended up giving up on life, love, work, just everything.   

I spent the first half of 2022 still in a deep depression and then an old friend died in a motorbike accident, so I made a spontanious decision to go travelling in hopes it would shift me out of this negative mindset, and it did. I spent a few months backpacking, meeting new people, and letting go of all the stress and sadness of the previous years. I came home from my trip feeling like a new man, I found a new job, and me and one of my close friends of over 10 years admitted that we both actually loved each other in December.

I could not exist and people’s lives may even improve. My mind won’t stop making me feel this way. I just want it to stop. The hardest part is knowing the logic outside of my depression. Feelings of loss will pass, you will find your place, you will get over this hill. I’ve heard it so many times I almost refuse to believe it out of spite. I hope something happens soon that helps convince me that life is worth living. Right now, I don’t have enough big reasons except that I don’t want to crush my family and I’m so incredibly young. I’d hate the thought of my sister or mom hearing any news about me, or that in maybe even a year I’ll have a will to keep going. Right now, I feel too tired that these reasons are starting to slip away.",1677886775.0

My girlfriend has gone dark,3,11hhorb,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11hhorb/my_girlfriend_has_gone_dark/,1,"Hey everyone, here today seeking advice for someone I love very dearly. Currently I am in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend. My girlfriend has suffered from depression most of her life and it honestly breaks my heart, I wish there was something I could do to help. But to explain my situation more, my girlfriend and me are in a healthy and fulfilling long distance relationship. Then last week everything kinda goes dark. I didn’t hear from her in days after she went out with some friends for the night, me being long distance and all, I got concerned and tried reaching out to her multiple times to no avail. Eventually I reached out to her mother to see if she had heard from her, which she did. Like most people, I got a little upset and asked if there was a reason for the degradation of communication. Eventually she reached out to me and was very apologetic and also told me she wasn’t doing great emotionally. This was her way of telling me she has entered a depressive state and my clue to enter a support role for her. But she did something unexpected the following days, she opened up the conversation saying sorry she has been distant recently, but she needs some time alone for the next week, she stated she needed to think about things because she has been struggling. She asked if I was okay with it, and I told her I support it. She then said she was going to start going back to her therapist and then began to be apologetic for everything. I told her everything would be fine and tried to make it lighthearted by saying I was going to miss her while she was away joking about us being long distance. She replied “I miss you all the time”, and I haven’t heard from her since. I’m worried about her and I wish there was more I could do. Anything said can be helpful. Thank you all",1677883859.0
I know it will all be gone tomorrow…,3,11hhj0p,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11hhj0p/i_know_it_will_all_be_gone_tomorrow/,0,"This evening went shockingly well. I sang my solo in front of the church, after a comedy of error that would have been funny, had I not been at the verge of a nervous breakdown. Everyone loved it. A lady from a choir in the next big city, who was there to visit a friend, tried to convince me to join their roster. Afterwards there was delicious tea and food, followed by karaoke. I sang, I chatted with people - I can’t remember the last time I got this many compliments. It was awesome. I felt *alive* for the first time in weeks, after wishing for nothing but instant death. 

This feeling of being alive, seriously makes it worthwhile. It makes me understand how people want to keep going and not kill themselves constantly. I was accepted, even appreciated, could engage with a beloved hobby without constant criticism, hard work paid off, things worked out. Hell, I was *awake*, which might sound weird, but I usually have to live off caffeine to sort off function and my brain is essentially a constant, half-asleep, ball of wool on the average day. Being just awake and having energy - being focused - it is so awesome!

The problem? I’m now lying in bed and I know this feeling, the awakeness, the focus, the *life* will be gone by tomorrow. I’ve danced this dance before and it does not survive the night. Like a spurned lover it will have snuck out before breakfast. When the sun is back up, I’ll return to barely functioning, the feelings of now, nothing but a weird memory my body won’t be able to conjure back, soon to be lost in time completely. 

I already know what my morning diary entry will read: “Fuck, I didn’t die in my sleep again.” I don’t want to go to sleep, clinging on to what I have, but I know that won’t work for any real time and just mean, I’ll feel even worse tomorrow. 

So, now I feel both awesome and shitty. A whiff of what could be, hell, what *should* be, makes the reality infinitely worse. It is the most painful reminder, that that’s not me - not my world. Is it better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all? Right now, I’m really not sure.",1677883484.0

long story short, i dropped out of school last year because i was at such a low point in my life. i’ve never felt as terrible as i did last year. now i’m back at home with my parents. it was fine for the first couple months, in the sense that i needed a place where i could do literally nothing else but sit in my depression and anxiety, and it was perfect for that. i didn’t leave the house for at least 3 months. i didn’t talk to anyone who wasn’t my mom, dad, or sister. all i did was sleep, watch tv, and eat so much that i gained around 30 pounds. i started to get better after a while. i got a job, which meant i started seeing more people during the week which definitely helped. but it wasn’t enough, obviously. i was still here in the same place i was before. it’s always been a goal of mine to leave my hometown and go somewhere else. this place literally feels like a black hole. including my house. i constantly feel like i’m drowning. i go through periods of time where i feel like i’m getting better just to get knocked down immediately by the smallest things which make me immediately fall into bad habits. this isn’t something new, i’ve dealt with it my whole life. but every year that passes it makes me feel like i’m losing my mind more and more. depression has taken so much away from me. i don’t know who i am anymore. i lost my spark. i have no motivation, no friends, no one to talk to. my days consist of waking up, watching a show, scrolling on social media, going to work, and repeat. my parents don’t think there’s anything wrong with it because they’re the same way as well. everyone around me has these terrible habits that only further encourage me to continue down this path. not that i’m blaming them. i know im the only one who can help myself but i’m so tired. i’m so tired and i haven’t even done anything with my life. i literally have nothing going for me. 

i wish i could better put into words the way i feel, because this doesn’t even begin to scratch the surface of my mind and thoughts, but years of constantly putting my emotions on the back burner have literally left me paralyzed to the point where i don’t even know what it is i’m feeling.  i don’t know anything about myself. i feel like a shell of a person who lost all ability to communicate with other people normally.

i’m just so extremely sick of feeling like shit all the time. i go through the days waiting for it to be over just to do it all again tomorrow. an endless cycle of waiting and waiting for nothing to happen. i know i need to break myself out of this chain and try to better myself but that shit is fucking hard. when i was in school i was extremely depressed but at least i did stuff throughout the day. and at least i saw and talked to people. at least i had some friends. at least i was away from this shithole of a place. i know that moving isn’t going to heal me from my trauma and my depression. but at least i’ll have the space to do it in a new place. with new people. away from the toxicity of my parents and the bad habits this house makes me fall into. i constantly feel like i’m on the verge of breaking.

Then I remember: You can afford this. But it feels like I need to. I feel guilty. I wish I could give him more. He is such a wonderful person, so kind, and so clearly wants the best for me. For us.

I always feel like my life is out of place and unorganised and I believe my ocd is placing these thoughts into my brain, like obsessing over my work not being good enough. I have so much going on in my life rn, my boyfriend and best friend of 5 years has been cheating on for almost a year, I’m in a difficult healing process and processing a lot of trauma from this and the relationship itself. So I’d love to throw myself into some college work. I would sit there doing it for hours if my mind wasn’t so critical about what I was producing and how it is always incorrect. I gave myself a month after finding out about my partner’s infidelity, to recover and to live guilt free about doing nothing. Well it’s been over a month, and I’m so sick and tired of waking up and laying in bed, sitting around the house glued to my phone and WANTING to be productive, but I just can’t! Does anyone have any tips? I’m currently taking therapy, but would prefer to stay away from medication because if past experiences.

Thank you 😊",1677877922.0

But it seems like I can never really manage to keep the few near and dear friendships I have. Even my longest friendships eventually fade away and become less than what they used to be. There's a lot of reasons why that is. I try to be a nice person when I can be, but I still find most people irritating to some degree and push them away or ignore them, even when they've proven to be truly loving and affectionate. Other times, I completely misunderstand a situation and sabotage my friendships in a fucked-up attempt to display remorse, and still others, I smother them despite knowing, deep down, what I'm doing is wrong, but refuse to stop myself. And in some rare cases, I'm just a straight up nasty and spiteful person but come to regret my actions sooner or later. For the most part, though, we just drift apart and go our separate ways.

"I want to want friends, but I just don't",2,11h52e0,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11h52e0/i_want_to_want_friends_but_i_just_dont/,1,"I'm a non-functioning adult and total recluse, and for as long as I can remember, I always wanted to be. I avoid forming relationships if I can help it, and I recognise I do have social anxiety, but I'm unfortunately also very strongly an introvert.

I think a lot of people are able to get out of social-anxiety based depression because they want to talk to people, but they just struggle to do so. I genuinely have no desire. I simply don't get lonely. Also, romantic desire for me is just too weak at this point to serve as additional motivation. I can have fun with friends but mostly I just feel uncomfortable and always wish I was just back at home by myself. There aren't any group activities, like playing co-op videogames/boardgames or discussing interests like films that I have any personal interest in. I prefer it by myself/single player.

I'm scared this is a fundamental aspect of my personality, and I wish I could just \*want\* to have the desire talk to people, and I have tried time and time again, but my own deep desire to just not bother has gotten in my way every time. I just end up ghosting everybody eventually.

btw it's not that I can't just talk to people as a one-off thing - I'm fine with that. It's just that I strongly dislike forming relationships for some reason, or just talking to or seeing anyone more than once.

Thinking about it, maybe what I don't like is people getting to know me. Maybe there's something , or maybe something missing, that I don't want them to see. I think maybe whenever people got to know me in the past it felt like things would usually get worse for me in some way, like people would gradually view me with less and less respect and take me less and less seriously as they realised generally what little value I have to them. I end up feeling like as people get to know me, I'm viewed as less and less of a person. Maybe it's because I am just not a proper person, and they're seeing me for what I actually am. It makes sense. I don't really have value to people to be honest. I feel like I exhaust anything interesting I have to say pretty quickly, and then I just feel out of place thereafter, especially if anyone else is there. I know a lot of random shit but have no depth.

If I was just born rich I would just travel the world for my life, never staying at the same place twice . That sounds heavenly.

My whole life growing up my parents also made me feel that way. They would say the typical you wont amount to much type things all while constantly being negative about what I wanted from life. When I was a kid it never really phased me because lets be honest. When youre a teen do you really put any merrit into what youre parents say. Ive been married for ten years and things were great up until about the last 3 years or so. My wife slowly evolved into what my parents were. She never wanted anything to do with me. And I dont just mean sexually, I mean anything. There have been times where Ive all but had to beg her just to go have dinner with me on a friday night. It hurts so much that ive got tears in my eyes just trying to write this. Im not perfect, not by a.long shot. But I try really hard and I work really hard. Weve had our share of struggles over the years but now we do pretty well financially so thats no longer a stress for us yet things havent changed. I have told her my feelings 100 times with no changes. Ive been away working with minimal home time for about a month now and things between us seemed to be pretty decent. We had nice conversations and everything was good. Last night was my first week night home in a minth and she wanted to go out with a friend to a sporting event and asked me to stay home with the kids to which I was more than happy to do. Me and the kids hung out and played and read books, it was awesome. When she came home she immediately began to scold me for the kids still being up(it was 7:30) and told me how I cant do anything right and if she doesnt do it for me it wont get done and how she camt even go out for a couple hours because I cant be trusted. And know this, she is an awesome mother to our children. Shes awesome to everyone in her life but me. She didnt say another word to.me until bed time to when i basically as usual had to ask for an apology. It wasnt voluntary. About a year and a half ago I met a woman going through the same things I was at home. We became very close and were there for each other. She was the only person in the world I felt like I could talk to that understood and genuinely cared. She has recently gotten a boyfriend and now constantly leaves me on read and has zero interest in a conversation of any kind. What is wrong with me? Am I so horrible?

I’m diagnosed with persistent depression and social anxiety disorder, as well as celiac disease and PCOS. I feel like I’ve never really enjoyed life, even since childhood. I’ve always been incredibly anxious and socially awkward. My friends are all convinced I’m on the spectrum, but therapists I’ve talked to say it’s just really bad anxiety.

I’m becoming more and more apathetic every day. I’m unable to meet others expectations. I have no sense of urgency to get out of bed. I feel forced to do things such as work or school just to stay alive and be a valuable person. Not only that, but I don’t WANT to work. I don’t want to have to do things I don’t want to do when I’m getting barely any enjoyment out of it. I’ve been at my job for a while, but it’s not getting any easier.

I moved here during the lockdown in 2020 and I was with my ex at the time. I started experiencing generalised anxiety and had 6/7 panic attacks in 2020. Then in 2021 I stopped having panic attacks, but instead just experienced really severe general anxiety all the time.

My relationship with my ex was not great and I think that is part of why I was so anxious. We moved in together at the end of 2020 and pretty much started arguing all the time a few months later. I knew I didn't want to be with him for so long but didn't admit it.

I left him at the end of 2021 and then lived with 2 horrible girls who treated me so bad and made me live on eggshells for months and months.

Thankfully I then ended up meeting my now boyfriend at the beginning of 2022 and I'm really in love with him and we have a great relationship. But despite that, I have still had pretty bad mental health the past year more along the depression lines.

I started university in 2021 and then got kicked out at the end of 2022, which was a truly awful experience. Now I'm working at a job that pays really bad and is semi-okay but I work from home and my home environment isn't very nice.

My boyfriend and I are moving to a new city this summer and I can't WAIT and have been so eager for so long. But now the past month I have started to feel sad about it. I want to do it, but I feel like I'm almost mourning the time I have had here.

So much has happened and I have gone through so much. When I arrived here I was 21 working at a bar in my first relationship and I had no concept of my future at all. Now I'm a 24 year old university drop-out with a shitty paying job and a new boyfriend and I'm anxious about the future. And everything that has happened has been so significant and traumatising.

I am a failure,2,11h25b8,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11h25b8/i_am_a_failure/,2,"I apologize for the length of this post. It's also not written especially well -- more stream of consciousness. I don't really expect anyone to read it all. I'm hoping that if I write this out, and post it somewhere where someone \*might\* read it, then it might quiet my mind some. My mind is always coming up with reasons why I should commit suicide.

&#x200B;

With respect to my depression, the earliest thing that comes to mind is that I've never been good enough for my mother. My mom wanted me to grow up to be wildly successful and rich.  And, my parents believe that they are infallible -- therefore, my opinions were always inconsequential. By the time I was 17, I was suicidal, lived in perpetual shame and self-doubt, hated myself and the world. I am always rejected.

&#x200B;

At 9, I taught myself to program computers and have been fairly obsessed with them ever since. Since college, I have been a software engineer. Everything I do goes wrong, or else unrecognized. Almost everyone I've ever worked with wants nothing to do with me. Even someone who I considered a good friend would never work with me again because I'm too ""unstable"". I try to work hard and do excellent work, but I overthink, over-engineer, try to be too smart -- and then every afternoon I get so tired that I can barely keep my eyes open.

&#x200B;

In 2019, I thought I was being told by the universe to follow my dreams and make something amazing. Despite my best efforts, three years later, I've accomplished nothing but to burn through a bunch of my savings. Now, I'm unemployed and looking for a job and failing. I've been a software engineer for twenty years. I've applied to hundreds of jobs over the past few months and am getting nowhere. I feel like I've been suicidally depressed all of my adult life because I knew one day I would die in poverty and shame. And now here I am.

&#x200B;

I have a family -- a wife and two elementary-school-age sons. They make me crazy, but they're great and I love them and they love me. I feel so bad for letting them down and that I won't be able to support them. I am a failure. I have always been a failure. I wish I were never born. I want to die. I want to die. I want to die.

&#x200B;

Thank you

EDIT:  I've been on a variety of antidepressants and occasionally in therapy since 2013.

EDIT2: I've also been on Focalin since 2016. I need to get off it though, because it doesn't help me. It just replaces depression with euphoria for a little while, then leaves me crashing down afterwards.

It feels like life itself discourages you to live,38,11h1oiy,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11h1oiy/it_feels_like_life_itself_discourages_you_to_live/,3,"I can't remember the last time I didn't have some sort of ""heaviness' in my head, weighing me down, making me feel low. It's like sadness itself was sitting on top of my brain, crushing it, not letting it rebuild itself.

Almost 3 years have passed since I started struggling with my mental health and though I have to say I've improved significantly, and most importantly, changed and learnt a lot of things about myself and the world, it still feels like something in me has never been right ever since. Like I'm scarred, like some part of me was brutally cut off, leaving me forever limping. 

I've tried to live my life, there's nothing I've wished for more. I've allowed change to happen and for new things to come into my life, things I had never let in before. I've tried to build my own life, on my own, around the things I like. But none of that has brought me more joy than it has brought me pain, piling it up on top of an ever-growing mountain of suffering. The struggles seem never-ending, there's always something making it harder for me, leaving me feeling like I have no escape.

I've tried to be loving and lovable, but I always seem to come across the wrong people. I trust in them, I open my heart to them and they just hurt me, like it's nothing, never having to face any real consequence, while I'm left forever damaged, because I had never let myself be vulnerable, and now that makes it all painfully difficult.

I don't want to lose my faith in the world, I don't want hatred and spite to grow within me, but life keeps discouraging me, and I lose more and more reasons to believe in anything or in anyone, as time goes on.

I feel disconnected from everything, with no capability whatsoever to feel, and it's scary to think that I don't really know why I choose to live, every day. I spend my days, I try to make use of the time that I have, but it escapes me, and every day keeps being insipid, gray, unworthy of memory. 

I want to be happy, I want to feel good. I'm tired to be haunted by both the past and the future, with endless pain, leaving an almost nonexistent present, so constrained, it's barely livable.

I just wanted to share my situation, I know many of you here might relate and I find solace in knowing I'm not alone. Thank you.",1677852515.0

First I told her ""I always felt like a liar, like there was a me [inside of] me that was going to undermine the real me.""  I was trying explain how I didn't want to disappoint the people I care about. How I didn't want to disappoint her. That's when my subconscious hit me with some cosmic truth.

I called my mom to see what was going on and she told me that her friend’s husband had  just attempted suicide by overdosing. When my brother heard my parents talking about it in passing, he assumed they were talking about me and immediately panicked. Even worse, I live a bit far from my family and we had made plans for me to pick him up from school today and spend the afternoon together. My mom said he’s been really excited since we don’t get to hangout as often as we’d like to. I can’t even imagine how much it hurt him thinking that I didn’t even want to see him one last time.

When I was 16 I was stuck in a depression. Every day seemed the same. I had absolutely no purpose besides stuffing my face with food and sit at home. A couple months after that things didn’t improve and that’s when I started trying alcohol. It got to a point where I was getting drunk every other day. This went on for 4 or 5 months. I would walk at night the streets of my city just drinking. At the time it looked like the right thing or maybe I just didn’t care. I didn’t care until one day something changed. I started to realize if I don’t stop soon everyone will stop trying to help me. My whole family was tired of me and they tried helping me as much as they could. I realize at one point if I wanted to get out of this hole I had dug I had to do something. At this point in my life I wasn’t even living with my parents I was staying at my homies place. One morning I got up and looked for a job in a Mexican restaurant near his place. I walked and got hired. They started me the very next day. After that I started seeing life differently. I am now 18 and own my own car and I’m in a much better place mentally. I learned that only YOU can control YOUR emotions not others. You choose how you react to things. We all go through tough things in life but we have to find ways to go through them in a healthy way. I am thankful for my parents who really helped me go through this. I now go to church and work weekends while studying during weekdays. For anyone stuck in a depression or hit rock bottom just know YOU choose how you react to it. It’s in your hands.

I spent half the week in bed either crying, on my phone relating to other stories of depression and suicidal thoughts, asleep, or a combination of the first two. I seriously try to look at anything else to avoid seeing my reflection in the mirror. Sometimes I try to read or illustrate but I just find myself staring into the void either contemplating life or death or imagining a hypothetically better life that has less of a chance at happening as the days go by. I'm trying to focus on getting an art career but my current state of mind is getting in the way. 

Sometimes I intentionally sleep in just to avoid reality. There are days where I like to stay inside as much as possible to avoid society and making eye contact with anyone. Basic things like showering, brushing my teeth, doing laundry, or even talking feel highly draining to me. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom when I'm about to cry and/or have another mental breakdown on instinct because life is tiring and society is inherently awful. I don't bother talking to people unless I absolutely have to because I feel like no one gives a damn about anything I say. I avoid/cut off relatives a lot because half of them give me shit and mock my struggle and I'm not going to be their goddamn punching bag. I don't even remember the last time I had a relatively okay week. I have some good days but then things always take a turn for the worst. 

Also, a part of me hates being in shitty America, especially now with the increase in mass shootings, politicians oppressing LGBTQ+, and trying to take control of women's reproductive rights and forcing them into motherhood so there can be a next generation of wage slaves, racists, sexists, rapists, corrupt politicians, and even more depressed people. Also, as a POC I feel like I'm probably going to die at the hands of police any day now. I know there are a lot worse places in the world to live in, but shit is still shit.

I refuse to tell my doctor that my depression has gotten worse because I feel like they'll just put me on a ton of useless medications and/or throw me in some bullshit institution. I might be a lost cause. There's too much pain and I don't know how much longer I can hold on. I just need another place to vent because I ran out of pages in my journal. I'm tired of all of this.

"I'm tired, I think",1,11gwu04,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11gwu04/im_tired_i_think/,1,"Here's some stuff about me: I'm 23, and I'm in the final year of my degree, and I made the very stupid decision to get into the honors program. Everyone told me I wouldn't go anywhere with the general degree.

Time skip to today and I feel very drained on the inside. I don't know where exactly I'm going wrong or if there's something wrong with me, but studying is difficult. And gearing myself up to write a thesis (in three months) feels impossible, and with exams on the way in early March, I really feel like there's no way of going up from here?

I've been working since I graduated high school and I'm from a middle-class family, and it's on days like today that I really wish I could die? I don't think I'll ever try, because I'm an only child and I know my parents would be the ones hurt the most. But living is really hard sometimes.

Maybe it's because I've always stressed on the importance of my grades, but I feel like a dip in my grades would actually make me very harmful to myself. As it is, my only response when I feel this... down is to think of how I could punish myself in some weird penance-seeking way. And I feel like it's gotten worse because I can't even enjoy the things I love anymore without feeling some soul-crushing kind of despair afterwards. 

And I think it's hard on the people around me too. I know my parents are stressed out because they know but they also don't know what's wrong with me. The kind online friends I have keep checking up on me. And I'm grateful. I really, really am.

But I can't really see an end to this. Sure, a couple of months shouldn't be so difficult to get through, but it's killing me slowly, I think. It feels like I'm living because I can't die?

I tried therapy and I saw some therapists, but I feel like nothing they say works long-term. I'm sick of hearing that it gets better, because it really doesn't. I got through highschool thinking it would, and it didn't. And with uni taking up a chunk of my time, I had to stop going for therapy altogether. The only thing that keeps me going is my responsibility to my family and waiting for updates for the stories I like. 

Which in itself is odd. If I didn't have these stories to latch onto, I think I definitely would've died by now? Even so, I'm slowly reaching my limit, and I don't know if there'll be light at the end of this tunnel.

Most of all, I wish I could just be open about it without worrying that it'd hurt the people around me. Sometimes, I just want to be direct with them and say that I'm tired and I want to die. I'm sick of being alive. I want it to end. And I want time to just freeze so I can let myself feel without being guilty that I'm doing something that isn't work/uni. Even now, as I type this out, it feels like I'm wasting everyone's time including mine. 

It would be nice if things got better, but I've been disappointed a lot in the past. And I'd rather have no hopes than hope of better days only for none to come. 

I just regret not getting good enough grades to study in another country. I regret taking up this degree (not because I hate the content, but because I can't watch over the moods of the people in my faculty and I can't walk on eggshells around them anymore. It feels unfair to be at their mercy because I have to deal with their emotional states when they aren't willing to deal with mine). I regret so much, but I try to push it to the back of my mind. Because if I wallow in this regret, I feel like it'll make things worse.

So yeah, thank you for reading this lengthy post. I'm sorry for the wordiness of it all. I appreciate you for taking the time to stop by. Thank you for listening.",1677837341.0

I'm about to be going in for a job interview tomorrow, and then I'll be working two jobs to pay for one car and a phone bill. This fall I will be expected to go to college and succeed at that all at the same time (because my dad went to college AND did a military job, and ""if he could do both so could anyone"" ). 

I don't... want to.

I don't know if this is the kind of thing I can get off my chest here, but I've been struggling since middle school (that's about 10 years now). I've been ideating suicide since I was seven or eight years old—mostly back then it was composing a suicide note (why I knew what that was, I couldn't tell you) or ""lol I just wanna Kill Myself to get out of (insert academic thing here)"". Escapism via video game, book, or writing has always been my coping mechanism.

In high school was when it started getting real bad. I always just blamed it on the ADHD, or being lazy, but I can't blame being unable to do a task because I can't surmount the cost of the energy it'd take on executive dysfunction. I can't blame skipping school to sleep, constant negative thought processes, and genuine desire to self - terminate on it either. I've been numb for as long as I can remember—I've even taken shitty online sociopathy tests because I was so concerned about my muted reactions to tragedy that I assumed something was wrong. 

And now here I am. I don't have health insurance, because my shitty current 10 hour a week job won't cover it and I got kicked off my parents' for some reason. My (admittedly kind of rad) car and insurance are too expensive. Gas is expensive (politically-minded dni). Food (another form of temporary comfort) is expensive. No girlfriend / boyfriend / partner to speak of. I had a food service job that gave me alright hours but it was so fucking awful that it exacerbated every symptom of everything wrong with me to such an unhealthy degree that I eventually just walked out when the straw broke the camel's back.

I don't know what I want to do. I'm skinnyfat (and very male presenting, love a good dysphoria) and out of shape and an inside person but I figure, for some fucking reason, that I want to work for the national parks (me and a billion other fucking gen zs, right?), but that requires a degree and I'm not sure I have the stones to go and get one. I want to work in conservation or natural resources or a zoo or some bullshit to at least try and help stave off the impending end of everything, but those seem like nobler goals for a nobler person, with more prospects and less mental weight dragging them down. My initial goal was to go into psychology or vet school (see what I mean about not knowing what I want to do?) I don't even know if I want to be around in ten years, and I'm fairly certain that if I don't have the drive to do my fucking laundry when I should or sack up and get a job with some chest hair I can't do my homework (which I failed to do even in high school, graduating with a 1.8 GPA like a fucking idiot, thank GOD for my teachers not wanting to create a super senior). 


I don't know. My parents are Republicans and live in denial that we the newest generation are inheriting the gunpoint of a fucking awful housing market. They expect me to move out sometime relatively soon and balance my fucking too - expensive car payments (seriously, who helps a minimum wage worker secure a 2021 vehicle? not to sound like an ingrate bastard but I was hoping we could buy local until I had the money for a car, not get thrown into the deep end), my best friends live half the country away, and I'm too ridden with anxiety and ADHD and depression and stubborn pride to sack up and flip burgers (which I know there's nothing wrong with, I'm just a coward) or get a ""real job.""

(nice 4 ands, I know, I have a real talent for run on sentences)

I don't want to be here. And I love you, all of you, every last one, and I love this world, but I hate living in it. I hate seeing what we do to it every day. I hate knowing it's just going to get worse, and I hate that there's nobody in my life I can talk to about it, because all of them are conservative and live in a different fucking objective reality than the rest of us, or are too Christian to take mental health seriously. I want to violently end things some days and I want to live and work others. I don't want to think about my future because I don't want there to be a future. I wish sometimes, many times, I hadn't been born—my mother's life would certainly be a lot better, I feel, had I not been around to begin with.

I don't have a proper ending to this. I hope, if you're in a similar situation, or a bad situation in general (which you probably are, given the subreddit) that things get better. 

I love you. Love and peace.",1677827210.0

Will there ever be a cease-fire for the punching bags of the world?,1,11gsxrd,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11gsxrd/will_there_ever_be_a_ceasefire_for_the_punching/,0,"I'm sorry for how long this is, you're wild if you even take the time to read this all.

Everyday seems like I'm waking up to just absorb everyone's frustration and self-criticism and aggression that they cannot inflict on others or deal with themselves. I cannot go on like this, and have told multiple people that I am struggling with even keeping myself from harm. But every single day still starts and ends the same, where I am the problem in everyone's lives, and nothing I do, say, think, or feel is right or makes a fucking difference at all.

 I (27M) live with my partner (31F) and have for almost the length of our relationship, 4 years this month. But almost every morning, she wakes up hours before me and is down two flights into our living room watching tiktoks or reading, etc. But by the time I am up, my existence/having to work full time (if not more most of the year, which I will agree is a problem, but we need the money) is usually a cause for an argument that usually leads to me being an asshole for working too much/not making enough money/holding them back/not doing enough around the house/not doing enough for myself, on top of everything else. Which usually includes doing the majority of the cleaning, cooking, taking care of our pets, and paying the bigger share of the bills/feeding us. Neither of us have our own cars, with her not even trying to fix a car that broke down pretty early in our relationship. I had an operating car at that point, but then it became too much to fix vs how much it was worth. I had purchased a newer car on my own and made the payments on my own. Until the car broke down on our way back from a vacation with her friends, and the warranty decided to not cover it. After a legal battle and issues with mechanics, we are still dealing with having no car and not being able to save money to put to a down payment on a new car. But, no matter how much I do, provide for, clean up, feed, and just generally throw myself at, I will always be the fucking heel of the loaf.

I have an incredibly strained relationship with every single person in my immediate and extended family. I am the second child of teenage parents, my mother having had me at 18, my father being 23 at the time. My mother comes from a family of alcoholics, who are very verbally and physically abusive to each other. My father is a registered sex offender and narco user, and the son of immigrants. My older brother is a recovering addict, and my younger half-sister is working her way into the same life, as far as I can tell. I do my best to keep my distance from them, and haven't spoken to most of my family in months, if not years for some. But still will get bombarded with the issues between all, and get brought into arguments I have nothing to do with (more often than not without my knowledge until later), usually using me as an anchor for the exemplary abandoning POS family member who couldn't care about anyone else, or as the mediator for family members fighting over whatever. But that still usually comes back to me being an absentee in everyone's lives, therefore a POS who couldn't care so fuck me. There is much more to my family life, but this paragraph and post are already long enough.

Work isn't much different. I am constantly given work outside of my job title or duties, that sometimes makes commission for other people, or causes me to work an unexpected double shift. Even if what I end up doing is better than expected (or even recorded as a possibility until I did it), I am still being told I must've done something wrong, my boss doesn't trust that I did ny job right, or must be lying. How am I supposed to feel good about doing my job/accomplishing a new ""high score"" if I am being told I must've fucked up somehow? Why should I even bother doing the job at all if my success will be met with hostility? Bringing up my issues with my boss usually leads to no discipline on anyone who isn't meeting their requirements, or just adjusting to make my accomplishments seem more normal.

I guess what I'm trying to say is, why should I even fucking bother? The only constant I've known over the last 10+ years is that I'm a problem to be around and I shouldn't be around anyone ever again. I shouldn't even take my next breath, it could benefit someone else more than my pitiful existence. I hate myself, I feel like everyone else hates me, and I can feel that most of the people I see regularly would be better off if I just wasn't around anymore.

I don't know what to do anymore. I've tried killing myself by hanging a few times now, but I can't even do that right. So everyday I get to wake up, get beat up, beat myself up, get beat up, beat myself up, and get beat up again until I snap I guess. I just don't know how I can bring myself to end everyone's fucking misery, or somehow elude myself into thinking that everything will be okay and I should keep trying everyday, even if it means I'm just going to get beat up. I just really want it all to be over already. I can't fucking do this anymore. I really fucking cannot. I'm hanging by a fucking thread already, and it's getting thinner everyday.

I remember writing suicides notes as a kid. By middle school I thought no way I will make it pass high school. During high school my depression got worse and diagnosed with BPD. First suicide attempt I got caught, caught the other ones nobody knows about. I didn’t think I would make it pass high school. If i knew what I would face in the future during college I would have overdosed like I wanted to in high school. I would have jumped off that bridge. I would have tried cutting deeper. I would have taken more pills. I don’t think I ever experienced happiness. Trauma, and more and more. It’s been 6 months since the rape, and im only now admitting to myself what happened. Every day I think how violent it was. The amount of blood I saw, not being able to breathe because his grip around my neck was so tight, almost passing out, my facial piercings being covered in blood from how much he was hitting me. Days after i bled from my vagina, use the bathroom and my pee was bright red. In so much pain. 
I wish he would have killed me that day. My body can heal. But I am mentally trapped in that room everyday. I wish I could sleep at night. But any dark room transports me right back. I can’t escape, I can’t escape. I just want this feeling to end. I don’t want to exist anymore. I wrote a suicide note.

But I’m also really mentally ill is the problem and I feel like I’m going to crack.

Our house is a mess. Such a mess. We have bugs. It’s disgusting, but I feel so overwhelmed that I can’t do anything to fix it. I dread coming home. I spend my entire 30 minute commute gradually going deeper and deeper into despair about what awaits me when I get there. I’m tired from being on my feet all day.

My own meds aren’t working any more, I’m barely hanging on. I don’t know how I’m doing it any more.

I don’t know maybe it’s not obvious but it feels like it should be right? I don’t know sometimes I think that the only real thing that’s keeping me going is that my dog would be sad if I died.

Hi,

This is my first Reddit post ever. I am looking for advice on how to cope with grief. 

I know my loss might seem insignificant to a lot of you. I have lost very close friends and family in the past to both suicide and other causes. My baby girl helped me cope with all of that, and now that she’s gone, I am really struggling.

My boxer dog, Indy, suddenly collapsed yesterday and died of heart failure. She was only seven years old. She helped me through some really tough times and made me feel loved in a way that no one else ever has. I am absolutely broken, and do not know how to deal with this.

Does anyone have advice on how to deal with a situation like this? I feel like my entire world has ended, and the pain I am feeling right now feels like it will never end. I am broken, and I need advice as to how I might ever be able to put the pieces back together. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",1677820422.0
I've never felt this down before,1,11gs3h8,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11gs3h8/ive_never_felt_this_down_before/,0,"Hey yall. I'm sorry if I'm posting this in the wrong place. I just don't know where else to go.

I'm going to summarize as best as I can. I recently got an offer for a job trial--the job runs on seasons from September-June (it's a performance-based arts job). I got the call mid-season, so I took a leave of absence from school ASAP (I'm a grad student), and moved from the east coast to the west coast about 8 weeks ago. I'm pretty much the youngest person at my job (by far) and in addition to that pressure, I love the location I'm trialing in and want to succeed and stay here. It's made me really happy living here.

But lately, I've been struggling. Since I'm new, they put me to work for more hours than average (even though we all get paid the same salary) so I've been pretty tired and burned out. Additionally, somebody close to me has terminal cancer, and they've really been doing badly the last couple of weeks and it's been weighing on me. But I didn't think it was obvious to the outside. I've been trying so hard to keep it all together and to keep my insecurity in check. All of this boiled over when one of my ""bosses"" asked to talk to me. To summarize, they basically told me my performance isn't where it needs to be and that they received comments about me lately. This was the straw that broke the camel's back. I am devastated. I've been working really hard, and I'm still not good enough. I hate myself and I feel like I don't deserve anything now. I don't know what to do. I'm embarrassed and so ashamed and disappointed with myself. The person who gave me this information was luckily pretty kind and seemed to be sensitive when I told her what's been going on. But still. This job is how I keep food on my table and pay my rent. And I've blown it. I feel like I can't do anything right.

Psychotic breakdown/suicidal ideation,1,11grgnv,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11grgnv/psychotic_breakdownsuicidal_ideation/,3,"
So I’m dating a guy, or was and things went absolutely haywire.

M(38) F (32)

January 5th bf has a complete mental breakdown. That day we were to go to a basketball game. Evening comes, and I go to his place because we were going to go with his friend. That didn’t happen. His friend gets into a crazy fight with her boyfriend. 

So we did our own thing and had dinner at a restaurant. His entire mood was off and he just seemed really annoyed. He did mention to me that he had a few drinks but I was like OK what’s the big deal?

Fast forward, we get back to his place and things just took a turn for the worse. He seemed really bothered as to what would happen to his friend because like I said she got into a really bad fight with her boyfriend he threw a bottle at her face and they were in front of the police station. I said do you want to go find her? But he seemed out of the loop as if that was a triggering event for him.

All I know is I thought things were normal and we were laying down in bed and it’s about 10 PM. This is the day he “laid it all out on the line”. Told me how he really likes me and wants to progress the relationship forward. We had been dating for 6 months. Said how he felt the relationship was lopsided, how I had met all his family and friends and that he didn’t meet mine. I was dumbfounded because I didn’t know he felt this way on top of that I just wasn’t ready but I said I would be willing for him to meet my friends they just don’t live nearby. Then he started talking about his mom. Pretty much this was the night he did all of his confessing. Then he said he has something to tell me and I was like what is it? Because I don’t like surprises. He was really nervous and didn’t want to tell me because he thought I would leave him (his words) and then he told me his “secret”. To me it wasn’t a secret and not a big deal so I just want to bed.

He was in bed for a moment but I had no idea he had gotten up. Long story short he had a psychotic break down and attempted suicide. I was scared as hell. I didn’t want to call the cops or an ambulance because he had a gun and I didn’t want it to turn out badly. So I called his stepdad thinking he would talk some sense into him.

I’m not a therapist, but I feel like that event with his friend and her boyfriend that entire fight was a triggering event for him because he did tell me he grew up in a tumultuous environment as a child. And his dad was abusive towards his mom and his dad was killed in an alley and his dad did drugs and alcohol.

Moving forward from that day and his psychotic break down his demeanor and personality absolutely changed. It was literally an absolute 360. I remember three days later we were walking and he said he has a million thoughts running through his mind he feels  numb. And I was so confused because I’m thinking how does one feel numb?

Fast forward to that evening we were to go out to an event but he said he didn’t want to go anymore instead he suggested going to the gun range. He was really cruel towards me at the gun range and then apologized.

That evening he absolutely lost his mind and unleashed on me like a psycho.

It was late and I was asking him a question because I wanted to know why would he involve himself in drama when he’s clearly not in the best state of mind. He UNLOADED on me! He went off on a tirade saying I am breaking up with you! His reasons were “I didn’t buy him any Christmas presents, he didn’t meet my family and friends the fact that that I don’t have friends”. And then he said we are fundamentally different”.

I was so surprised because three days earlier he was just saying how he really likes me & wants to progress the relationship forward. Now it’s if I’m his worse enemy. 

I told him I never knew you felt like that how come you’re just telling me, he said verbatim “Well now you know”. 

I am just at a loss for words

There’s no way I can know how you’re feeling and what upsets you if you never told me. And I didn’t buy you Christmas gifts because you were going through financial struggles. You told me you were $30,000 in Credit card debt. On top of that you kept saying let’s get each other small gifts. I actually bought him a couple of high-end cigars a few days before Christmas so he wouldn’t feel obligated to get me a gift since you’re struggling financially. I gave him the gift and he said what is this for? People don’t typically give out gifts unless they want some thing his words.

Tdlr
*Bf had a psychotic breakdown with suicidal ideation
*Kept mentioning how he’s lethargic and melancholy
*Ended relationship due to not getting Christmas gifts and meeting friends and family
*His feelings were never expressed to me so I was absolutely in the dark
*absolutely refuses to talk about anything/acts like there is no problem 
* has thrown himself into work, been isolating, and not answering phone calls or texts

So my question is do people really end relationships for not getting a Christmas gift especially when they kept talking about how much debt they’re in before hand?",1677818470.0

I don't know why, but I've recently just felt unmotivated to do literally anything. Whether it be homework to talking to others. Nothing interests me anymore. I don't even feel like playing video games or watching movies, which are things I used to really enjoy. I feel like my life is so much harder than everyone else's; as if I was dealt a bad hand. It sounds shallow, but it feels true. I'm barely scraping by with high grades in my classes. I know I should be ""happy"" because I'm graduating soon, but I'll just go straight into college anyways, so it doesn't really matter. I honestly don't want to be here anymore. I don't want to die or anything, I just feel like running away, which sounds stupid.

In all honesty, I just want someone to actually care about me. I haven't hugged anyone in years, it's been longer since anyone has paid me a genuine compliment or took an interest in me. I feel like a background character.

I have a few ""friends"" at school, but they don't feel *real*. We never hang out outside of school, and we never talk about our interests, or what we like to do when we go home, we just talk about schoolwork and events. These aren't people I can confess or confide in. And Therapists don't work on me because I don't see them as genuine. They aren't my friends, because friends shouldn't be paid to listen to you when you're struggling. I'd talk to my parents, but I know how they are, they wouldn't understand one bit, because they haven't in the past. I genuinely don't have anyone I can practically turn to for help, I feel so boxed in.

I am 33 married 10 years, I have 2 kids and 2 step kids. I have suffered from depression my whole life. When I was 19 I tried to commit suicide and finally received the help I needed, I’ve honestly been okay since then. I have a pretty good job although the pay can be better and i have a side business doing what i love. When I was younger I always said I will be something big one day. I would say the past year my mood has declined, I have been questioning my self more and more and feel that I should be in a better place than what I am, that I should be making more money and doing more for my family. This has caused me to do terrible at work to the point my bosses can see it, thankfully today they gave me a talk asking me to turn it around and they are here to help me through my depression. I feel I have let my self and everyone down, I feel I am not good enough for anything good. About 4 months ago I started therapy which helps and I am now on Wellbutrin. It all helps but I am just feeling tired all day from being so damn sad. I feel I am ruining my life and destroying everything that has been going so well. In October my grandmother who I was very close to died and in December my step daughters fiancé passed as well who I was also very close with and I have been trying to be the rock in my family and keep our heads up and ensure she is okay. 


I am begging for some tips from those who have been in my situation… what can I do to create good habits how can o change? I feel if I change my mental state I can do better. Honestly I am desperate and feel so so guilty for being depressed and having a pretty good life. I am behind on bills and feel everything is falling apart.

I don’t really post on Reddit and am just letting my fingers fly across the keyboard, so I don’t edit or filter much. A lot of things feel impossible - waking up is nigh impossible and I’m often late for work because I just can’t get up; I feel like I’ve sucked the joy and social skills out of my own life…my own worse enemy; and I feel like I prevent myself from connecting to people that I care about. 

Work isn’t bad, not at all, I have coworkers that I don’t mind and they don’t care all that much about when I get there. With them and the field I’m in it’s better to at least have someone show up. I work nights and don’t have a consistent sleep routine. My mind races more than I’d like. I tried really hard to sleep and make it into work, but that just won’t happen. It feels like every time I get the chance to sleep it’s always too late or even if I’ve struck gold with 6-8 hours of sleep my body just finds the whole concept of getting up sorta surreal. Everything feels like a dream and lead pulls me deeper into my sheets. 

Btw I haven’t written much of anything in the longest time, so grammar and the way I’d like to express things are gonna be like dog shit that just landed in your favorite bowl of cereal.

My depressive episodes swing from life dampening to suicidal ideation with no real way for me to know how I’ll feel on any given night. I’ve ruined a lot of my own life by being how I am. I used to try to do a couple of things (hobbies like writing, gaming, and all that jazz), but my main hobbies are trying (eh) to sleep and I don’t really have the energy for much else. Would be awesome to not get swallowed up whole, but I’ve been like this for too long. I’ve been trying to change with the occasional page turn or line of code. I just can’t find it in me most times. On occasion I’m lucky enough to have a small burst of energy - it’s just rare.

I have people that I care about. The thing that just punches me in the mouth is that I suppress a lot of what I’d like to say. I get stupidly self conscious. It’s difficult trying to be interesting when all I have the energy for is sleep. I’m trying to change. I had other things to say about that, but in short I want people to know that I care and I’m interested when they speak. I’m really trying.

TW: Eating Disorder

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm not really sure where to start.

&#x200B;

This person means everything to me.

&#x200B;

I've always known that she struggles with depression. I do as well. However, I can't pretend to actually understand how she feels or what it's like to struggle the way that she does.

I have been trying to do as much research on anorexia as I can. She's actively trying to recover (sort of), she has been for a long time. I understand that it's incomprehensibly difficult to overcome. I know that I would never have the strength to continue on in her shoes, and I've told her as much. I don't know if that was a poor thing to say.

I know that she's on-and-off about wanting to get help. I know that her family is trying to help. I avoid any conversations that might be triggering, I've never and never will comment on her body, I'm trying to learn to cook so that if I'm ever over maybe I could figure out something that she'd like.

She has expressed to me that she has BPD. Our friendship is weird, and it's always been hinting at something more, I just never pushed it that direction because I don't think she's in the place for that right now. I also don't want to rush into that and lose her, I'd rather stay friends so I can know her until forever. I worry that she thinks that's why I talk to her, and that maybe that's changed her openness with me. I'm not going to let it go any further, at least for now, because neither of us are stable enough for that to be good for anyone. Not the point or my focus just wanted to note it.

Recently she explained to me that she wasn't getting better, and that she felt very, very, very depressed. I don't know if she's felt this hopeless the whole time, and she just opened up about it finally, or if she has truly hit a wall. Either way, I know that she's at a point where everything is difficult.

She's said to me before that when she gets ""extra"" depressed, she tends to push everyone away. I'm watching it happen now. To my knowledge, she has barely been communicating with anyone, this includes me. I know that I cannot fix anything. I probably can't even make it that much easier. But I really want to try.

I've expressed to her numerous times that I won't pester her endlessly if she truly doesn't feel like she has the energy to talk to anyone. But, I've also expressed my worry that if she doesn't try to overcome that lack of energy, that she's going to feel worse.

**Here is one of MY biggest issues:** I am the most insecure person. I'm insecure about every facet of my life. This includes our friendship. I am trying my best to not take everything so personally, but when she goes completely silent for ages, I freak out. I tend to not say anything about it because I don't want to feel worse. However, I've unfortunately expressed it a few times and I worry that doing that has caused her guilt and that now she's going to push me away more.

I know this is something I need to work through personally. Sometimes I end up withdrawing because I feel like I'm just bothering her and making everything worse. Sometimes she'll speak up and I'll feel reassured, but it's always momentary and then I feel like shit again. I know it's not fair to complain, but I'm coming from a place of not wanting to make her feel worse.

I really wish I knew how to help her. I know I just need to offer up that I'm there when she feels ready to talk. I've tried to get her to call or hangout or go on walks, sometimes she'll say she wants to and then go silent when the time comes. Sometimes she'll even ask for those things and then go silent.

I've told her that we don't have to talk about the serious stuff if it's making her feel worse. I've got a whole list of things to talk about that I know would make her laugh.

I've told her that we can talk about the serious stuff too. I'll listen and I won't even say anything if she doesn't want me to.

I've told her she's not going to hurt my feelings or burden me if she is distant. I've said that I won't let her push me away (unless she actually wants to obviously). But then I get all insecure and prove the exact opposite to her.

I've bought a bunch of gifts for when I see her.

I've talked to my therapist about it.

I guess this isn't very coherent and I'm doing the bare minimum as a friend here.

The main points are just that I want to help her however she needs or wants me to help.

I'm trying not to be take it personally when she's distant.

I know that I don't understand her conditions but I'm trying to learn as much as I can.

I know that I can't push her to recover from her ED in any way. I just want to be there along the way so she has someone if she needs anything. I want to know what I can do to help or not make things worse.

I know that she's going to push me and others away. I might not know her exact reasons why. I want to understand how I can gently try to get her to talk without being overbearing and making her feel worse.

She's already getting help from professionals and doctors. However, I want to know how to get her to accept that help a little more, she seems so indecisive about wanting to get better (which I know is the ED talking) and I just want to help her feel like getting better is the right path.

I don't want her to feel hopeless. I know that her struggles govern such a large amount of her life. I'm curious if you think I should try to be a sense of normalcy and talk about everything but those problems, or if I should try to find the balance between normalcy and being there for the serious talks.

I know that I need to take care of myself while helping her. I'm trying to branch out a little more socially because I was definitely a bit dependent. I have hobbies and a therapist. I'm going to be fine.

I'm sorry if this makes no sense. I'm very tired and I just don't know what to do.",1677811940.0

I hated her at first, she didn't seem very pleasant at all when I first met her and I sort of wrote her off as being just kind of snobby. But something changed, I don't know when it happened, but at some point I started looking at her differently. She seemed so smart and thoughtful while strangely oblivious at the same time. She was someone who was so nice and sweet at times but at others pushed people away. She was the only girl who I've ever really talked to about books and different writing ideas like themes and symbols which is something I'm really interested in. It was like she was constantly doing 180s with her personality. It was so interesting to me. At a certain point I just felt myself wanting to be with her, I couldn't stand it.

Anyone with bipolar 1 or 2 the first to bring it up with your doctor?,1,11goixa,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11goixa/anyone_with_bipolar_1_or_2_the_first_to_bring_it/,0,"I wrote a long post in the BPD sub but I guess I can’t do that since I am undiagnosed. 

Has anyone with bipolar 1 or 2 actually brought it up to a doctor before it’s ever mentioned to them as a patient? I have long suspected I’ve had periods of hypomania, and with good reason. I seemed to initially fluctuate back to a more normal state but over time it seems that I am bouncing back and forth between severe depression and more brief periods of something like my first episode of hypomania just not as intense. 

I am in a rough situation with my mental health and already have a visit scheduled to bring up trying something other than Wellbutrin which seems to be no longer working at all for me and I think it might be time for me to actually mention this to a doctor. When it was just the period of hypomania 10 years ago I was just loving life, and since I didn’t plummet into depression I just thought it was curious but nothing else. As things have deteriorated, and as I have gotten to be more unpredictable and depressed I feel like I should no longer keep this to myself. 

I guess I just feel weird bringing it up so directly, but I could either do that or sit there and drop the breadcrumbs for the doctor which feels even weirder. I think I am also just very scared to admit that I’ve got more going on than just depression.",1677810190.0

How lost are you to depression when thinking vividly of suicide comforts you?,51,11gn8vl,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11gn8vl/how_lost_are_you_to_depression_when_thinking/,20,"Rather than just wanting to die, I tend to wish I never existed to begin with. Suicide crosses my mind now & then, but the thought leaves relatively quickly, when I consider the innate violence and discomfort it would take. It normally just isn’t an option for me. Which is why I’m concerned about my recent ideations.

Lately I’ve had vivid thoughts of suicide, by hanging, cutting, overdose, etc. 

I like to think I’m safe from myself but there is this malicious voice at the back of my head popping up more and more often which tells me, “if you only knew where to get heroin, you wouldn’t be here to feel this pain right now”. Or, “you’re one rope and your staircase away from finally feeling nothing, like you want”.

Worse still, when these voices and vivid imagery come up, I can’t help but physically smile or even laugh (sometimes while crying as well). Like, uncontrollably. It momentarily feels like I lose control over my body and my senses, my emotions, etc.

This has never happened to me before. I’m scared and confused. Used to being apathetic, not actively hostile against myself. More than anything, I don’t want my boyfriend or my mother to come home to a dead body one day.

This has all been happening for a few weeks now. 

How lost is someone at this stage? Is it urgent to seek help? What are the implications of these thoughts?

My Imaginary Friend,1,11gm2oy,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11gm2oy/my_imaginary_friend/,0,"Ever since I was 6 I've had an imaginary friend named Darryl,  I don't really remember how I got him, I just remember one day while my dad was at work playing with some paper gingerbread dolls I made myself with my cardboard doll house and deciding, ''Since I have no friends, how about talk to myself, besides it's just like having friends but expect their not real.''

So I created my perfect imaginary friend named Darryl, I'm not sure what I actually named him, but he told me if I remember his name he'll let me go.

He has fluffy blond hair, sometimes wears glasses and I think he has  green or yellow eyes, in my head I often see him with a gray hoodie and black or gray pants with a pair of sneakers. Funny thing is he's sixteen a little older than me.

I talk to him all day everyday, I remember being 12 and talking to him 24/7 no friends and going to school being deppresed, no one understood a 12 year old back then, they all just thought I was weird. Not only that I had a really shitty condition called Sherman's disease which caused a horrible hunchback in me, I pretty much felt like shit, while my classmates laughed at me all day.

After being rejected by my crush in 5th grade, you know how that felt for a depressed 11 year old kid.

Now I'm older, nothing changed much, I talk to Darryl everyday, he honestly feels like the only one who get's me, we laugh joke and talk, sometimes he makes me do things I don't want too, but I'm fine with it.

Whenever I don't obey him he says something bad will happen to me if I don't, so I listen to him and he grants me a reward, whether something as simple as my dad not calling me for the 6th time that day.

I love hanging out with Darryl, I might even have a little crush on him, I know.I'm crazy, but i honestly don't care anymore.

Even if he's not real, at least he's better than my real friends who just ignore me all day, and laugh at me for saying something.

Darryl protects me, and I love him, he feels like someone real. I wish everyday he was real. One day my perfect Darryl.I'll join you in imaginary land :)",1677803726.0

I can't see the future for myself anymore,5,11ghlq1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11ghlq1/i_cant_see_the_future_for_myself_anymore/,2,"I turned 25 years old in January. Seemingly I have everything: I am successful, I have girl friends, enough money, I wouldn't consider myself ugly. Despite this, I feel terribly empty. Nothing gives me pleasure, I do everything out of a sense of duty, I throw myself into work and study to feel and think as little as possible, which makes me slowly burn out. Sometimes I have suicidal thoughts, but I know that I would never try to kill myself, because my father would suffer terribly and I love him dearly. I've never had a boyfriend, I've never been loved. I guess that's what hurts me the most, because I feel I'm broken, like there is something wrog with me. The overwhelming feeling of emptiness and loneliness is killing me. My friends are getting married, are in the relationships, and among our group I already have the nickname ""forever single"". I laugh but at the inside I suffer. I hear people telling me not to worry, that someone will show up eventually, but I can't listen to it anymore. I tried Tinder, I go to parties from time to time, and I try to talk to men there. I've been so desperate that I've been going to psychics just to provide even a shadow of hope for myself. I also seem to have an eating disorder, I've been dieting for 14 years (I graduated from ballet school) and I can't look at my body. I went to therapy, but the therapist and I reached a dead end, so I stopped meetings. With each passing year it gets worse and worse. I can't imagine being 30 years old and going back to an empty apartment with no one waiting for me and going to more weddings alone.

Hitting a new Low,2,11ftswv,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11ftswv/hitting_a_new_low/,0,"Recently, I have made what may be the worst mistake of my life and taken an ssri thinking I solve my OCD, gad, and social anxiety but, ultimately I believe that I have ruined everything that left that I had to live for. My concentration is destroyed to the point where it is a struggle to do well in any of my classes. My emotions feel extremely bluneted and numbed resulting in me gaining little to no pleasure out life any more what so ever.The only ""emotion"" ive been feeling is extreme irritability, anger, and dread at what I may have potentially done to myself and the rest of my life for here on out and the years of horror i will be forced to live out. 

&#x200B;

And thats not even including what its done to my downstairs, sensation/sensitivity are extremely reduced,0 libido I feel aches/pains on my testicles and other odd sensatations that are difficult to describe, it feels cold, clammy and rubbery to the touch. In addition to leakage of ""fluids"" from the penis overnight while i am sleepingor in small amounts throughout the day which makes me feel weak and disgusting. and an occasional ""tingling"" or sharp pain at the tip.

&#x200B;

What really gets, me is that I was perfectly aware of what could happen and the risks the pssd and all of that and I had decided to just 

go ahead and take the plunge anyways what could possibly go wrong? Millions of people take it, why feel anxiety, sadness, stress at my

shittly life situation when I could just feel nothing instead. It wont turn your penis into a sad shriveled up husk, you will still be

able to love life. All that silly stuff about permenent neurological damage and sexual disfunction is all just a bunch stinky internet 

nonsense. Why the fuck not right

&#x200B;

Although, it has only been a few days I believe that I am dealing with permanent pssd and the only real option left anymore is get a fucking shot gun

and give the wall a new fucking painjob with with my stupid fucking face. Either that or give the pavement a similar treatment by hurling my useless sack of

shit off the sixth floor.

&#x200B;

There is no where left to go at this point Ive had it, not only am I weak, incompetent a general nuissance to others. On top of that Im incredibly socially 

inept and too dumb for most of my ""hobbies"" which I can no longer enjoy anymore and on top of being trash at them. And now ive gone and destroyed all my feelings, emotions, all enjoyment out of life and killed my downstairs on top of all that. By trying to improve myself to be less anxious and more confident

socailly and such I made everything 10X worse and getting nothing in return as the medication did little to nothing to improve these problems other than hide them under the surface. As much as an anxious wreck I could be sometimes prior to the meds it was nothing compared to this, at this point its only a matter of

time I hate this fucking world and I don't even care anymore if it will get better. If it does it will be years and years and then even more of my youth will

be burned away. Even if it werer to get better soon I don't care because, everything in this world is a lie nobody is who they say they are you can trust nobody. Everything we do in this world is fake, everyone just uses each other for there own gain and pushes down those who don't add value because that is 

how our society works and we act like it does'nt we all lie to ourselves. So why would I want to keep playing this stupid fucking game when I no longer 

have anything to gain from it? I could ""gain a new perspective on life"" but in my eyes thats just a clever way of saying to pretend like i don't really

what this world is really all about. Everyone is fake, they are nice to your face and maybe you feel they are comperable to you but, they would shoot

you down(figuratively) in an instant if it benefited them enought to make it worth it. I hate pretending, especially when the theatrics are cheesy the 

plot is predictable, and unenjoyable and I could care less to see how it ends.

&#x200B;

Maybe this is all in my head, and im just another shitty negative nihilistic person who will probabally kill themselves one causing immense pain

and emotional suffering to those surrounding them but, ultimately the world is better off. Im just some edgy little shit head but, I do not really

care anymore nothing matters to me anymore the only thing keeping me here is the immense fear of death at what is on the other end of the stick. I am

at the point where I loathe those whom care about me because, it means that it will be harder to off myself without feeling like even more of a shitty 

person and the thought of the pain I will leave on those who cared about me. And knowing that ive decieved them their whole life and they never even knew, \\

what a terrible person i am beneathe the surface they were just to innocent to see me for what I really am. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Maybe I should I work to fix myself and make myself a better person? But, I lack the energy and simply do not care anymore despite my efforts even If

I pulled myself up by my bootstraps and bite the bull on its ass and I climb out of this pit of despair and transfor into the pereson I want to be but,

Nothing is ever sustainable even if I pull myself out of this I will only fall back in because, it is in my weak nature. People try to help me but, 

it does'nt matter because ultimately I can't help myself every peice of advice helps me breifly before I realize all the reasons it will never work. Ive tried everything to improve myself at this point, the gym, supplements, cold showers, self help, meditation, therapy, medications, the list goes on.

&#x200B;

I think im at the lowest ive ever felt, I don't know if I want to continue from this despite any possibility of feeling better. When think about it I've been

at this same point so many times over varying things but, I stuck it out thinking of that smidgen of a chance that there was a better world waiting for me and 

I could fix whatever it is that it was. But, each of those time sure, things may have improved moderately but, never where I wanted them to be and I always

thrown right back here time and time again continuing the constant cycle. I think im done I do not care for whatever it is I hate this life for all that it is

and I no longer wish for a better world for anyone.",1677733986.0

I'm in the army national guard, I'm deployed overseas rn and I've been accepted to college. I'm making decent money and things look like I should be the happiest I've ever been.  Ik its hard to believe that I can be deployed and diagnosed but I just never turned in any of my civilian medical stuff. I was hoping I could force myself to not have to think and usually when I'm in uniform it helps me not be me.  But I have a lot of free time and I can't be on my meds here.  I don't want to be sent home so I just have to save face.  I feel so alone.  I felt alone at home but I had my dog.  I don't have any real connections with anyone here and even tho I have roommates it's lonely.  I can't let anyone know how I feel because I don't want to be put on watch. I've seen how the army deals with mental health and its a joke. 
I ended things with my longterm boyfriend a year ago and still think about him daily. I ended things with him because i knew i was bad for him. I was 100% the toxic one but no matter what I did he forgave me. I cheated on him while he was away at bootcamp and I came clean. I tried ending things but he said we could work through it.  After that I doubted myself,  I was always trying to prove myself,  the guilt was eating me alive.  Aside from that we were so different on every level.  He was a republican, me a democrat; he was religious,  I'm atheist; he wanted kids,  and I can't even have them ( and I don't want them) and so much more.  Every belief I had,  he was the opposite, and yet he stayed.  He kept trying to make our relationship work and I wanted to stay with him but I could see I was tearing him down.  I was watching his mental health slowly decline.  After I cheated I tried to kms, I never told him,  I didn't want him to stay just bc of that.  When he got home I told him I was on meds.  My meds killed my sex drive and sex was a big thing for him.  I hated it. There was so much more,  I was so bad for him. And yet he stayed.  So I broke up with him.  I love him so much,  even now.  I wish we could be together but I know we can't. He was my best friend and I miss him more than anything. But I can't talk to him. He blocked me on everything, he said he it would be too painful to see me and he would be too tempted to try and get back together. We had agreed I was bad for him and his mental health and it was the best thing for him. So I let him go. But I love him deeply.
Ik this probably sounds like another sob story from a young girl that got her heart broken and couldn't handle it. But I don't think it is. I feel like I can't breathe. I've tried everything to move on and no matter what I do, I still feel empty and alone. I don't know what to do. I just want him to hold me tight and tell me everything will be ok. But it wouldn't be right. This is the only place I've ever said this. I probably won't repeat it ever, but it did feel kind of good to put it out there. 

Also, I am in no way using my mental health as a shield for my actions. What I did was wrong and unforgivable and I will never forgive myself for hurting him in such a horrible way. I do not excuse myself for it. I have never told him nor will I ever tell him I tried to kms bc of it. I just hope he can/has moved on better than me. He will make someone very happy one day.",1677793794.0

I get a good grade in something and instead of patting myself on the back and feeling happy I couldn't care less, it's just something I should get because it's standard. If I do poorly though I put myself through immense suffering by giving into negative thoughts that range from small things like ""you're an idiot"" to much bigger things like ""you should just kill yourself because you contribute nothing to this world"". In tandem with this just lost motivation for things and it is not good for my degree to be just not giving a shit anymore.

Then in terms of hobbies or going out with friends that hasn't felt fun in years. I had a person ask for me to wait up for them so they could walk home with me and instead of feeling overjoyed at this which I feel past me may have felt I just didn't care. The small things in life don't bring me joy and neither do the big things really either. 

I feel like I've also lost connections with people. People talk to me and I talk back but I don't seem to actually care for the conversations I'm having and that makes me feel like an asshole which in turn makes me give into more negative thoughts.

There hasn't been a day that's home by that I haven't thought of suicide and how I'd do it but I know I could never bring myself to do it out of simple obligation to my friends and family to stick around for their wellbeing. I don't think the thought process of what happens after scares me because if it's anything like sleep just eternal peace that I'm not even aware of sounds blissful.

Speaking of sleep I wouldn't say I enjoy it but thinking about a few hours a day when I'm unconscious does give me a feeling of being at ease and tends to be one of if not the only thing I look forward to in a day.

Anyway I don't think I'm getting better, working out hasn't done much other than make me either become unhealthy in over obessing about losing weight and doing harm to myself by not eating properly or the opposite eating too much in hopes that maybe food could cheer me up. Have done CBT and currently in therapy but not finding it helpful in the same way that just talking to people doesn't help me either. Have yet to try antidepressants but should be going to my doctor soon to get myself prescribed them and sure maybe that will fix everything, I really hope so because currently I'm trapped between a rock and a hard place with how I just want to either sleep away my life or end it but know I'm not allowed to.

If you got here thank you for reading my rant.

TL;DR: Don't enjoy life. Good grades, socialising or hobbies don't bring me joy. Constant thoughts of suicide but can't upset folk who care about me. Sleep is blissful as it's basically death being shy. Have tried losing weight, CBT and therapy and socialising to no avail in curing these negative feelings. Will be on antidepressants soon and will see if that fixes anything.",1677719599.0

On the day of her birthday i walked up to the building she was celebrating at, with my gift under my arm a set of headphones cos she didn’t have a pair. It was at her aunt’s apartment and i was kinda surprised cos there was like police tape and ambulances and stuff everywhere and all I remember seeing was her dead body bleeding out on the floor before my brain shut down and i ran back home in tears. The next few days were pretty much a blur but i kinda just remember acting like nothing happened. A few days later i found a suicide note packed in my bag and i knew it was hers cos i knew her handwriting……she blamed me for killing herself. She never specified why exactly, just that i was the reason. I have trust issues since then, not really holding on to many friends.

However my naive ass in the next year or so decides to trust people who seem genuine anyway and gets thrown aside like garbage. Because I’m worth nothing to them. To them I’m just another dispensable worthless piece of garbage. Maybe thats what was made for. They all tell me how I’m such a good friend to rely on for advice, how I’m such a good listener but when it comes to me i just don’t matter anymore and they ghost me. I resorted to cutting myself on my back, so deeply that i ended up needing stitches, and the scares are probably not going to fade. 

To add to all this bullshit last year in January i was diagnosed with cancer. I did beat it yeah but at the cost of the little bit of sanity i was holding on to. I don’t have anyone or anything left anymore. Everyone has left me. I literally have nothing to lose. What the fuck is the point of me living bow anyways? No one would bat an eyelid. My own parents hate my guts, my mother broke my finger once by throwing a plate at me. My father talks to me barely once a month and even then its for like five minutes. 

This doesn’t even cover all of it. When i was 14 i realized that my babysitter used to inappropriately touch me in exchange for candy, i never knew what she was doing was wrong because i was never taught  to make out the difference. 
Yesterday morning, my grandfather died to pancreatic cancer. December last ear my sister killed herself because of exam stress and bullying. I feel lonely among the supposed friends that i have right now. Im always in a way third wheeling all the conversations. Im ver truly a part of anything.

      Hi everyone, I (F20) have been having an extremely difficult time this winter. I live in New England so the winters are pretty brutal with little to no sunlight and really cold temps. I usually struggle with seasonal depression but this year has been unusually worse.
      There have been weeks where I literally could not find any motivation to get out of bed. I would just be going about my day and start crying right in the middle of it. I felt that the people in my life were always annoyed of me and I feel like I’ve shut myself out from so many people in my life. The only people I actually want to talk to are my 2 closest friends, my boyfriend and SOMETIMES my family. 
       However, there will also be weeks where I am completely fine. (I wouldn’t say happy- but just fine) and I could switch to being depressed again in the blink of an eye. The tiniest things will trigger a mental breakdown and I will literally be fighting for my life inside of my head.
       This past weekend I was actually in a really good mood, drinking with some friends, and my best friend kind of said something embarrassing about me in front of a small group and it immediately made me feel awful. So awful that the whole rest of the weekend I shut myself out from everyone and would find myself crying every few hours. (I realize that i was being super super sensitive, but that is also part of my problem). I wasn’t even mad at her, I was just so embarrassed with what she said about me and was convinced that the people in that room think so differently about me now. After the weekend though, I was fine again.

I guess I just don’t know if these extreme mood swings are a sign of anything. It’s been a rough/weird past few months and at this point I’m willing to look into how I’ve been feeling and see if there is anything I can find out that will help me become better. I would appreciate any help/suggestions or if you think you know what may cause this/what’s wrong with me lol. :)",1677788910.0

I first tried to attempt suicide when I was 12, so none of this is new to me. I’m not sure if my parents know about this, they know about my depression at that age but at the time they didn’t really believe in/understand depression. Well here I am now in college and after a few years of temporary happiness from moving away from home, I’m back to where I’ve always been. I have an extremely difficult major that assigns an inhumane amount of homework that I have to get through on top of having 2 jobs and caring for myself (including chores, cooking, etc), as well as starting a job search since I’m about to graduate. Basically, I hate my life and waking up every day literally pains me. It’s so hard for me to get out of bed and do everything everyday, I rely on excessive amounts of caffeine to do everything and every second / minute of the day I’m thinking about how much I want to kill myself and how much better things would be if I was dead. Honestly I’m barely hanging on and this is a crucial time in my life where I need to get my shit together. I made an appointment to talk to my doctor about what options I have regarding stress/depression since, to put it bluntly, my suicidal ideations are getting out of hand. It’s at the point where it’s cathartic for me to think about killing myself. I told my mom that I’ve been struggling mentally and that I want to look at my options. She responded with a rant about how bad antidepressants are, and how she would be extremely disappointed in me if I got “drugged up.” She then compared me to my good friend who went to rehab for drug addiction, completely out of left field and I’ve never dealt with addiction to any drug. This made me pretty upset, and I didn’t say this but in my head I was thinking, “I’m sure you’d  be even more disappointed if you got a call that I blew my fucking brains out.” anyway, this really sucks because I don’t have their support in getting help, but I’m really at wits end on what to do. not to mention the medication would be under their insurance, so they would know if I started taking it.

I got all three eternal modes unlocked in Katamari Reroll, a favorite comfort game of mine. I restarted Pokémon Ultra Sun last week and got pretty far. Last night I had a client on as a guest while I worked on his Vtuber model. 

Problem is, I think I’ve been spoiled by autosaves. I forgot you have to manually save Katamari, thought it would be okay to leave my 3DS in sleep mode, and forgot to save the CSP file on my client’s model. Today I realized that I’d lost progress since before completing the last couple Katamari levels and no eternal modes were unlocked. The game card had been dislodged from my 3DS while in sleep mode and I had only saved before catching my first wild Pokémon. And I had saved the client file as a PNG, but not as a CSP canvas, so I lost a significant amount of work that I will now have to somehow fix.

So my brain said to me, “what’s the point of accomplishing anything? It’s like you spent those hours doing nothing at all and you have nothing to show for it.” 

I haven’t been able to move or do anything for the last two hours. Every time I pick something up, I get bored and decide it’s pointless, so I stopped doing anything.

i know i do this. i know i do. but it just makes me feel even more like i'm the problem. if something hasnt been working, how am i supposed to convince myself that it actually should work, and i'm just being too stubborn for it to work?

but it's not comfortable. i hate being depressed. i hate feeling this way, like i'm stuck and i have to fight so hard every day to be better and not just sleep or binge. but for some reason whenever someone says ""why don't you try waking up early/meal prepping/showering more/being more social/exercising"" it just feels judgemental. it already takes so much effort to TRY and do those things. when i inevitably slide back into my depression, i'll just be right back where i started.

I put ""friend"" in quotes because it was more that we had three semesters in a row together so we knew each other well and hung out a few times outside of class. I only went to this college for four semesters anyways since I was a transfer student, and the fourth semester where I was without them was when Covid struck, so any promises of keeping in touch went out the window and I haven't heard from any of them since early 2020. So we weren't really friends, but they were fun to talk to although they did frequently try and cheat off me and relied on me too much. It was one other girl and two guys. 

The girl is now about to complete her Master's and become a therapist, she also runs a small business on the side that looks to be doing well. The guy I was less close to is now an English teacher at a high school, which kind of scares me considering how anti-intellectual he was and also how much he cheated and bragged about it. The other guy, who I'd say I was almost genuinely friends with because I had him in other classes as well, has already completed a Master's degree and is also an English teacher.

They've done all this since I graduated in May 2020. And what have I done? Nothing. I have not gotten a job. I have no ambition, no prospects. I have a useless degree that I only chose because the major I was transferring from wasn't an option at this college so I just picked the major most of the credits would apply to.

I've just been existing as a shell since 2020. I would like to say it's autistic burnout after being in college since 2010 (I dropped out of high school and persued community college at 16) but it's been almost three years now and I haven't moved on.

I’ve been struggling with bulimia for 5 years. There have been better and worse moments but it still takes up a huge space in my life. I’ve never had a boyfriend, I have no real friends and I am mostly either ignored or mocked. I don’t think I an ugly and I don’t know what is the reason for that. I feel no joy from anything anymore, even things that I used to love in the past. Even things I was passionate about have no impact on me anymore. My social anxiety is skyrocketing to the point it’s a struggle to leave ny house sometimes. I’m just so deprived of emotions, sometimes just sadness, stress or anger if anything. 
I have problems falling asleep and even if I do, I wake up too early and can fall asleep again. I end up feeling fatigued most of the day, but still can’t fall asleep. Too much overthinking.
The faculty I chose at a university turned out to be completely different from what I thought. There is a lot of material to learn and horrible schedule when we sometimes have to be there from 8am to 8pm (with some breaks after almost every class). Also there were quite a few racist people in my group and since I’m biracial, I felt it hard. Whats more, I live in a pretty mono ethnic country, where black people are still rarity. I’ve struggled with discrimination and rejection my whole life. I know it’s just bitching about school and everyone has it hard, but I can’t help they way I feel. I extremely envy my roommate, who’s sociable, has a nice schedule and a lot of time to hang out with friends and at least one loving parents. I know I shouldn’t be but I am jealous. 
My “father” didn’t even come to see me and doesn’t give an f about me.
My “uncle” took naked pictures of me as a 17-year old when I was drunk and probably still keeps them on his phone. When I brought that up, he and my aunt shut me down completely and stopped talking to me. It’s been over half a year since then. We have no contact.
I barely make ends meet, I’m at uni and I tutor on the weekends to earn money for it, but it’s still little. 
My mother and stepfather berate me all the time. They call me lazy, good for nothing and, what hurts the most, that I have no interests other than social media etc. it’s not true. At least I keep telling myself so. It’s just that I can’t engage in those things. I used to be bright and good at school, now I can hardly concentrate on anything and studying is a struggle. 
I know what I have to do. To overcome bulimia, to succeed at uni, to find better friends. But I just can’t keep faking and pretending that I’m okay. No one understands and probably no one will understand here. I don’t expect you to. I probably have no right to feel the way I feel. But I don’t think I can hold on any longer. I just want to vanish.

hoping someone can relate,3,11gb49z,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11gb49z/hoping_someone_can_relate/,0,"I feel so alone. I've never experienced love in my life, not from one member of my family, not in romantic relationships, never. I don't think I even know what it feels like. I'm just tired of life (not gonna end my life so don't worry). What's the point? Of being miserable? Of never once being happy? How I wish I just had one person that loved me. Just one. For some context, here's a little background on my life. 

My mom grew up in an abusive home and so did my dad. My mom has some obvious mental illnesses, that she's refused to ever get help for. My parents split when I was very young. My dad saw me on the weekends and we had a decent relationship in my younger years. 

My very first memory as a child was when I was probably about 3. My mom and I were in the mall and for whatever reason she hit me so hard in the middle of the mall, that blood began squirting out of my face. I remember it hurting so bad and crying. She saw the blood and ran out with me and we hurried off. When we got home she beat me even more til I couldn't move because I wouldn't stop crying from the pain. 

The abuse got worse and worse as I got older. She would never take me to the hospital either and would just pull me out of school if the injuries got too obvious. Though the school already knew, and never did anything. She was abusive in more ways than one too. I remember when I was probably 7 I was playing with my cat as it would run in and out of the hooded litter box and try to hide and run out and 'attack' me some more and then run back in etc. She found this out and put pieces of his poop on a plate and made me eat it. Then she put the kitten in a pillowcase and took it to some farm somewhere and beat the pillowcase on the ground in front of me until he was dead. 

She once locked me in a closet in the winter when we didn't have heat and I got so sick I nearly died from pneumonia. Only then did she finally take me to the hospital and made me lie about how I got sick. She would do crazy things like this. She had an unbelievable temper and even the slightest thing I did wrong even as a toddler would result in endless beatings. And my dad knew and never did anything which made me feel I couldn't trust anyone. I was beaten on a near daily basis for my entire life. That is, up until I was about 16.

At 16, the attack was pretty bad. She stabbed me multiple times, broke both of my ribcages, and put a loaded gun to my head. Luckily I was able to crawl to the phone and called police. She only ended up getting charged with domestic violence. She again, got away with her behavior.  There are so many instances I could name. 

After that incident, I moved in with my dad who didn't really want me to live with him but felt he had no choice. He became a raging alcoholic and abused drugs and in turn began abusing me too, but not physically, just screaming and calling me names, to the point I couldn't have friends even come over. As soon as I was able to I got out of there once I was of age. He got worse and worse, and I would still come to check on him on the weekends because I was so worried. Well one weekend he called me, drunk, to apologize for being a bad dad. I was worried so I rushed home, only to find him dead from what was believed to be a suicide. So now I lived through all that trauma with my mom, only to find a dead body of my father. 

I was always told my whole life I was too nice to go through what I went through. I never fought my mom back or my dad. I was always nice to every stranger I met, overly nice. I even forgave my mom and knew she had no one so I had to stay in her life to not leave her alone in life as I know how that feels. 

Obviously, my life went downhill. I started using drugs and hanging with the wrong crowd. A few years ago, I lost everything and had no where to go. I had to move in with my mom. While the physical abuse has stopped, the emotional abuse hasn't, and it's even worse than before. There's been times shes told me she wants to beat my head in until I no longer move. Shortly after I moved in with her, I got diagnosed with MS. I have two small dogs that I will not give up so moving out isnt an option. I would rather die. I have been fighting for disability for a long time and even if I got it, it's barely a survivable income. I'm scared if I lose motor functions once the MS progresses, I'll be stuck here forever. I celebrate 6 years sober this year, even in living in the abuse I'm living in I've remained straight. 

Even now, I could never abandon her completely. I would feel too bad. I have panic attacks so bad that I'm on medication if I even treat a stranger wrong in my everyday life. I always pride myself to be nice to everyone because I truly believe in the afterlife you're rewarded for it. Or at least I'm hoping my poor soul will get to experience happiness in some realm of existence. I have no friends, no family. I feel so alone. 

I'm wondering if anyone can relate, and can offer some words of wisdom or could just be a friend. My thoughts have been getting pretty bad in the last year, meds aren't helping and I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm only on this planet to make other people happy and smile, while I'm constantly in pain, and that makes me even more depressed because I'm literally not caring about my own self and instead only care about everyone else.",1677784430.0

How to express support for someone who is doing poorly?,1,11gaijp,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11gaijp/how_to_express_support_for_someone_who_is_doing/,2,"Last year I dated a guy that I fell in love with. The timing wasn't right for us to get into a proper relationship - he was dealing with some life setbacks that negatively affected his mental health. After dating for \~6 months, he broke up with me at the end of the year, saying that his mental health made him unable to be a romantic partner, but expressing the desire to reconnect in the future when he was better.

I reached out after not having contact for over a month, just because I wanted to see how he was doing, and offered to grab a coffee and catch up - as friends. As much as I care for him and see him as someone I would want to be in a relationship with, my intention was just to let him know I was there for him, and to reach out in a friendly way. I think he misinterpreted that because although he said he was doing well, taking care of himself, and spending a lot of time with friends and family, he declined my offer to catch up and basically brought up the same previous points that he's still not mentally able to handle a romantic relationship, even though I very clearly expressed I was reaching out first and foremost as a friend.

I haven't spoken to him since, but the meantime, I found out that he isn't doing as well as he let on. I recently ran into his best friend, and he told me he hasn't seen him in a couple months either, and that the rest of their tight-knit friend group has only seen him once since the start of the year, and he's barely spoken to any of them. I also have been periodically checking his Twitter account (we don't follow each other on there, but after the break-up I got scared that he could be a s\*\*\*\*de risk and so I'd check his profile for activity as that was the only way for me to check for a sign of life and give myself some peace of mind). And I noticed he's extremely active on there. Retweeting and replying to tweets by the dozen, favoriting hundreds of tweets every day. Basically, it just looks like he's glued to the his timeline all day, every day, during work (if he's even working still), after work, etc. He also does have ADHD so the nature of the platform also feeds into that I think.

So this leads me to believe that he is still very much struggling to take good care of himself, and that he's pushed a lot of people in his life away, and perhaps Twitter is just a form to escape reality. That hurts my heart. I really care for this man and it pains me that he is having this difficult time. I've read a lot of blog posts and articles written by people who have struggled with depression, and they say that they've lost close friendships and relationships which they deeply regret. I myself went through a very dark depressive period several years ago during which I had similarly become withdrawn and lost a lot of close friendships in that time. I remember feeling like a lot of people had ""given up on me"" and I didn't blame them for doing so because I felt like I was nothing but a burden to them anyways. But I also believe that had there been someone back then who had caught on to how badly I was doing, and who refused to ""give up"" on me, I think I would have appreciated it and wanted that. 

So now I don't know what to do. Do you think I should reach out once more and communicate that I'm here for him, and that it's because I want to be here for him and I want to be supportive? Or would that make it worse? I do want him in my life, of course, but I don't want my presence to somehow make things worse for him. 

TL;DR - ex broke up due to severe depression and anxiety, says he's doing better but appears to be doing worse. Don't know how to express my support and where I should or not.",1677783017.0
What I have found about my depression,5,11gadef,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11gadef/what_i_have_found_about_my_depression/,0,"I have realized that what has really impacted my depression has been people. I have been shown throughout my ENTIRE life that I can depends on others. When I try, or open up or form close bonds, people have shown me they aren't capable of respecting me as a human or having empathy. 
And those that have those things with me, have died. 
People, in general, are great. I like people. I like meeting new people and getting make friends. But often those bonds are soured. Sometimes I am just not what they want as a friend, which is fine. But when that happens, more often than not, they attempt to make me feel guilty about not changing or bending backwards for them. Other times I set boundaries and they can't handle that. Or they get jealous of something I have or do. 
I have maybe 3 to 4 friends that are truly my friends. I expect that to change, as that is life. I know friends come and go, but what has been the issue is the complete lack if empathy that many have. Maybe I just expect too much or maybe I'm too much to handle. But I expect my friends to be decent people who treat others with kindness and care. I expect my friends to do their best and continue to grow in some ways. Stagnation is not something I want I'm a friend or a lover. 

But at the end of it all, I have found that I am happier and handle my depression WAYY better and have less intrusive thoughts when I spend more time alone. 

I used to worry that if I was alone I would be harmful to myself. Only to find out through being alone that I am the best friend to myself. I am honest with myself but kind to myself. I know what I should and shouldn't do, but give myself a break when I need to as I am only human. I encourage myself to grow and be better when I can. 

I am just happier with out most people in my life. I function better, I get things done, I enjoy my hobbies more and find my day more rewarding when I focus on work and school rather than those that I would have previously called a friend. 

Does anyone else find this to be the case with their depression too? I know many don't, infact that support groups and systems are imperative for most with depression. Just wondering how others have faired with friends.",1677782678.0

~

My life has always been a struggle since I was 9 years old and my parents split and slowly tore the family apart. It took me a long time to rationalize and cope with both the obvious and subtle damage that had been done to me.

Even though I floundered, making mistake after mistake and never truly managed to break away from the shackles of my broken family and become independent. I at least always tried to be a thoughtful, good person. So after years of being stuck in inaction and ignoring my problems so as to not have to deal with my self-loathing, I slowly started digging myself out and creating a life that was my own. It might not have been the greatest but it was mine and more importantly, it had the potential to be something I could be proud of, even happy.

But like most covid put a bit of a roadblock on this. Although for me it wasn't too bad and actually lead to even better opportunities working from home. For a time I couldn't remember when I was more proud of myself, more hopeful for my future. I was working and making pretty decent money, living by myself, being recognized for my hard work and personality at work. I was even in a better place with my mom and she was helping me with actually looking to buy myself a house rather than rent.

Even though I wasn't looking at the time I met a girl through work who expressed interest in me first and to my surprise, I found I liked her too. And even though we got along and expressed intense sexual desire for one another, what I would only learn too late was that she was bipolar and suffered from sexual abuse and trauma from her last boyfriend. So when we finally met up in person in the middle of the night after another very long phone call after work. Things escalated and I drove out to her place at her request. Only once things started she freaked out and ask me to leave. Of course I did but obviously I was both shocked and upset. Even more so when after only a brief exchange and explanation she stopped talking to me even though we worked together. Feeling distraught and worried about her and what happened I made the mistake of reaching out through work channels as I wasn't getting a response through personal communications.

Little did I know that she was claiming serious actions to HR despite things being mutual, her giving me her address and asking me to come, nothing overtly sexual happening other than kissing and me choking her given what we've talked about when sexting, as well as leaving once she felt uncomfortable in the moment. 

Slowly I was moved off the current work project I was on without knowing why and a week later got a phone call from human resources. Not getting a chance to defend myself as the company I was with was going through very public employee litigations. Many around female workers. So I was told if I didn't wanna get caught up in that it would be in my best interest to willing quit immediately or face repercussions as they would have to side with the female given the current climate.

That was a bit over a year ago now but it still affects my psyche and my life has fallen apart since. All my plans for a future gone. Unable to find a replacement job therefore unable to pay for a house let alone my apartment. Credit score destroyed after backing out of a down payment of a house being built and having to break my lease early. Losing everything I held dear to me that was mine. Having to rely on my family once again only for that to create more strife. Having nowhere else to go living with my mother once again. Lost my car due to my mother trusting her criminal of a brother. Began to start hating myself again and stopped taking care of myself. Tried to run away only to get a heat stroke and picked up by the police on the side of the road. Seriously tired to kill myself twice over the last year even though I couldn't end up doing it.

However to my surprise, in my self-loathing and isolation being trapped in a single bedroom for months I was able to find a light in my darkness. Something that made me hopeful, actually giving me purpose again and even briefly feeling loved again. An online friend I met by chance doing ERP to deal with my loneliness. It was just a random connection exploring a newfound raceplay kink and like most roleplay fizzled out and she never continued. Only for like two months to go by and she responded again. Reaching out I suppose because I left an impression on her and even though I'm not entirely sure how, but we ended up talking nearly every day for close to 9 months. Finding comfort and companionship, it was just easy. Even as my life continued to fall apart around me she was becoming more important to me. What had started as an outlet for desires had developed into genuine care and together we moved on to being more personal. Although we were both broken in our own ways I found myself relying on her attention as she was someone special to me. She became an aspect of hope for me and I wanted nothing more than to make her happy and return some of that hope she represented to me. I even began attempting to pull myself back together as I wanted to be someone she could be proud of if we ever meet.

And there was a point in time when I thought we would meet and about the same time I also truly thought maybe all the suffering I had gone through, as well as what she's been through, was meant to lead us to one another. I truly loved her for who she was and what she represented to me. With how incredibly low and depressed I'd been, even though trying to kill myself twice, there was a brief moment with her when she got some good news regarding her own health that I was more happy than I can remember being in a long fucking time. I was so motivated, so elated that for the first time I dared to dream about the future. About a future I could have and one I could possibly share with her. This misbegotten girl who I had met by chance and bonded with over fetishizing each other race. Who turned out to be an amazing young lady that had been neglected and dealt an even more horrible hand in life.

But of course, it would not last. In part due to me being overzealous as always and demanding more than she could give. While also being unable to accept a certain aspect about her interests that was at odds with my own. And although I tried to be reasonable and accommodating I couldn't let it go as it felt like a betrayal. While for her part she could never fully open up to me and struggled to praise or worship me or my deeds. Only to later reveal that moment shared between us that I viewed as such a high point was a lie. A lie told in a twisted warped way to give me hope. Which would only further be warped into reasoning to hurt me further. To drive me away in an attempt to save me. Worse yet continuing to reach out. Not wanting to fix things like I'd want but rather feign interest while reminding me what I've lost.

So now I'm here again just over a year later. At the end of my rope once more and finding the dark thoughts filling my mind again. Contemplating plans and preparations to go through with killing myself this time as the pain and irreparable damage done to not only my life but also my confidences and self-worth has left me in some ways even worse off than I was a year ago. Which is something I didn't think possible. I've tried to distract myself with hobbies and stuff that I used to enjoy. Holding out for the next contrivance to give me false hope only to hurt me more than I already am with how unlovable I feel. But after the culmination of everything and losing that which was my unexpected salvation I have no will to live.",1677781893.0

with all that being said i have a really bad habit to denying myself the ability to feel, and because of that waking up has been worse and worse. i wake up dissociating so awfully that i’m in a state of non existence and that takes a toll on my being 24/7. now i might be crazy and this might be the placebo affect, but this is the first time i’ve ever read anything on this disorder and even sobering up right now i’m kinda of loosing grips of things.",1677777815.0

I can't feel much happiness when I achieve something or something good happens to me.

It's kinda sad because I really haven't got much that gives me joy.

Presenting my case, my arguments, they made theirs and then. Finally after 6 whole months. I got the award.

Monday I get all my missed back pay, court ordered. Then every 9th of the month I get what I'm entitled too, with another PIP payment every 4 weeks exactly from the 14th. 

For the first time in a very long time I'm stable. 

Sure I'll struggle till Monday, I won't be able to eat till then most likely, but after that there's finally a light at the end of all this.

I'll be able to pay to have my power and gas supply restored with the back pay, go and buy some food, eat a warm meal for the first time in a very long time.

Das sanfte Wogen der Wellen streifte tröstend an seinem Gesicht entlang. Um sich herum nur das leicht
kühlende Wasser, auf dem er schwebte. Er hörte, wie die See melodisch in sein Ohr sang, und nichts anderes drang mehr an sein Bewusstsein als seine direkten Sinneswahrnehmungen. Über ihm zogen die Wolken entlang. Langsam, geräuschlos, friedlich und gar majestätisch kontrastierten sie auf dem unendlich tief blauen Himmel. In ihnen brach sich das Licht in einer Art, dass es ihn fast in einen Trancezustand versetzte. Es gab nur noch der schwerelose Zustand seines Körpers, die sanften rhythmischen Klänge in seinen Ohren, leicht salziger
Geschmack auf seinen Lippen, und in seiner Nase roch er die frische Seeluft.
Allmählich merkte er, dass er nicht mehr auf, sondern vielmehr im Meer lag. Außer seinem Gesicht lag sein ganzer Körper unter der Ozeanoberfläche. Nur noch seine Atemwege lagen frei, aber atmete er überhaupt noch?
Er merkte, wie das Salzwasser schmerzlos in seine Nase floss. seinen Mund füllte, und dann sein gesamtes Gesicht umhillte. Die Wolken über ihm waren nicht mehr klar zu erkennen. alles. was er noch sah. waren Lichtreflexe, die durch die vibrierende Oberfläche schimmerten. Ungefähr eine Armlänge von der Außenwelt entfernt, gab er sich dem Sinken komplett hin und versuchte erst gar nicht, sich dagegen zu wehren.
Es wurde leicht kälter, und das Licht um ihn herum wurde beim Abtauchen bläulich und gedämpft. An seinen Seiten und auf seinem Rücken spürte er winzige Luftblasen, die ihn leicht kitzelten und an ihm entlang an die Oberfläche hasteten. Sie führten einen Tanz aus geräuschloser Form und Farbe vor seinen Augen auf. Wie Ketten aus winzigen, lebendigen Perlen schlängelten sich die Blasen, umhüllten ihn, streichelten an seinen Haarspitzen und über seine Haut und liefen seine Muskeln gänzlich entspannen. Weder in seinen Gliedern, noch in seinem Geist spürte er Kampfwillen. er ergab sich der Situation. in der er sich befand, fraglos.
Er lag nicht mehr auf dem Meer, sondern ist selbst zum Teil des Meeres geworden. Ohne sich dafür zu entscheiden. hatte sich seine Korverposition geandert. Aufrecht starrte er nicht mehr gen Himmel. sondern geradeaus in das unergründliche Blau. Er richtete seinen Blick leicht dem Licht entgegen und merkte, dass zwischen seiner altbekannten Welt oberhalb, und wo er sich jetzt befand, nicht mehr nur eine Armlänge lag, sondern mehrere Meter.
Es wurde kälter und dunkler. Er erblickte die Sonne, die noch hellblau über ihm erkennbar war. Ihr Licht lies
keine Warme an ihn ran. Kein Gerausch war vernehmbar. er war alleine mit der scheinbaren Unend ichkeit. Ein
schweres Gefuh breitete sich in seinem Herzen aus. er merkte. dass er ganz alleine war. Das Ungreitbare der See, das Abstrakte des Meeres, der Ozean, der wirklich nur gefühlt und nicht gesehen werden kann, offenbarte sich ihm. Nichts anderes konnte er mit diesem Wasser machen, als sich ihm gänzlich hinzugeben und der Schwere darin in seiner Seele Raum zu machen
Langsam kam auch kein Licht mehr an ihn ran. Er sah keine Luftblasen oder die blaue Sonne. Wenn er noch am Leben gewesen wäre, hätte er die Kälte an seinem Körper gespürt. Seine leblose Hülle wurde zusammen mit ihm immer tiefer in den Abgrund gezogen, und nichts anderes als seine hilflosen Gefühle blieben ihm noch. Er sah nichts, er spürte seinen Körper nicht, keine Entspannung mehr in der er schwebte, keine sanften Klänge, Gerüche, Geräusche oder Geschmacker. An ihrer Stelle Dunkelheit, Schwere und Einsamkeit.
Er fühlte sich zu einer Entscheidung gedrängt, obwohl es nichts mehr um ihn gab außer der Schwärze.
Instinktiv wollte er weiter aufgeben, sich tiefer und tiefer in den Ozean sinken lassen. Es schien, als würde die Dunkelheit der Tiefsee nicht nur ihn komplett einschließen, sondern auch in sein Inneres dringen und wie das Wasser, das vorhin in seine Nase eindrang, von ihm Besitz ergreifen. Vorhin hatte die See für ihn gesungen und ihn gewiegt, jetzt ist es die Dunkelheit, die wie eine Flüssigkeit in ihn einsickerte. Die Dunkelheit korrumpierte sein Wesen und ließ ihn die Gedankenlosigkeit der Oberfläche vergessen.
Sein Geist stellte ihm jedoch die Frage, ob er hier verweilen will. Trotz der Trostlosigkeit, der Hoffnungslosigkeit, die sich so plötzlich um ihn scheinbar unendlich ausbreitete, fühlte er sich nicht, als ob er von hier weg musse. Diese Tiefe zu verlassen erschien absurd, nichts hatte er getan um hier runter zu sinken. ES musste einen Grund geben, wieso er hier unten war.
Also blieb er in der tiefen Dunkelheit des Ozeans, umgeben von nichts aulser den Stromungen, mit denen er fortgetragen wird.",1677770994.0

Just what is wrong with me?,3,11g2jfb,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11g2jfb/just_what_is_wrong_with_me/,0,"
Hello, I do not know where to start, but I will try to keep this short and clear. I do not understand why I feel that everyone else is better than me. Ever since I was a child, I was always absolutely convinced that I am inferior to everyone. I have always been looking up to others while looking down on myself as if I am unworthy of being alive. I am not sure where these feelings come from, but I think I hate myself for having a medical condition that I have no control over. I have a strabismus, and it makes me feel ugly and worthless. Of course, my parents tried their best to fix it, but it wasn't enough. I am not saying it's their fault because I know that, at that time, my country's medical system was too underdeveloped to handle cases like me. We managed to fix what we could fix, but the result is not ""perfect"" because the eye turn is still visible to others, which makes me feel uncomfortable. This reminds me of something: my guilt complex. I feel so guilty about the effort my parents put into treating my condition that I feel that my existence is a nuisance to others. Indeed, I always stay away from people because I am convinced that I am a pain in their necks. I just feel so ashamed of having them travel from an isolated Algerian city near the borders of Libya to the capital Algiers multiple times a year to see a doctor. Now I am 25, and because of these feelings, I am stuck. I can neither get a job nor a girlfriend. I have no friends because people think I am weird or arrogant, but I  reality, I am broken from the inside. I haven't even been taking care of my hygiene a lot, and I lost interest in all of my hobbies. I can't make any decisions because I just keep questioning myself all the time. The more I try to silence my brain, the louder it gets, and it just doesn't stop. I feel like giving up on life now.",1677763009.0

Bothersome that I have fucked up social anxiety and I still put myself through shit because I'm so in awe and curious about people.

I don't go out of my way to hold them back, when they leave. Anyone and everyone is free to come stay with me for a while, of course. I deeply appreciate everyone and love their company. But I feel like, and I've seen firsthand - with how fast I change as a person, or grow bored of people - nobody would want to keep me around. I'm too much of a gloomy person.

It's exhausting to keep people around me too. Just as exhausting as being alone. And the only compromise I can manage is always welcoming new people into my life while holding the immovable belief that they will leave soon (they always do),, and it isn't worth it to be THAT emotionally attached to anyone especially after they've already left. For this reason, I have not once made a single friend after highschool that is emotionally significant to me. In an effort to cope, every person I meet - no matter how well we get along - is as dispensible as I am in their life.

I do have close friends, but they're making new friend groups in college and I am on leave, alone, getting left behind. Still, good for them. 

If everyone thought the same way as me, it'd be shittier world out there. At the same time though, it'd have been way easier for me to just unalive myself, wouldn't it? Attachments to people aren't meaningless, but things wouldve been so much easier for me if they were. Still, that'd be a selfish thing to wish for, I know.",1677762932.0

So I have no one to talk to over the past 3 weeks about what’s happened, she stopped talking to me because she thought I would leave her like the other guys but I wouldn’t so she did it herself before she got hurt. It was like this for 2 months but we started talking again and we became each others valentines and that day my friend told me why aren’t you dating her because we both like each other but I’m scared if I get to attached that I’d most likely lose hope when she leaves because she’s going to a different high school than me and that scares me because I don’t want to stop talking to her, I’ve told her so much stuff about me. She made me feel loved again. Today my other friend say’d how do yk if you are good enough for her and that got to my head because I don’t think I am but she told me today this “my irl name , your one of the sweetest boys Ever. You’ve given me so much happiness. I love our calls at night and the laughs we have together. Don’t ever think your not enough cause you are”. I may be digging to deep but she says you are one of the sweetest boys instead of saying that I’m the sweetest boy she’s met. That probably means there was someone better than me so why is she sticking to me, I’m a fucking an asshole who treats people like shit I shouldn’t deserve something like this I should be back to rotting in my room talking to no one. I like it that way because I don’t have to worry about anyone else. I feel like shit that she has to be with someone like me she could easily find someone better than me  I’ve always been easy to replace. I’ve tried my hardest not to think like this but I don’t think that I’m correct person for her. I love her too much to leave her she’s my everything but if I don’t leave well I never get back up from her leaving my life. I’m too scared to test out any of those options. When she does leave I’m probably going to break I don’t think I’ll get back up from losing her. I hate the words true love but that’s what I think it’s I hope she leaves me before she actually tells me she loves me. I’m sorry I’ve tried my hardest but I think I’m close to losing hope.",1677735067.0

PMDD vs MDD,2,11ftke4,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11ftke4/pmdd_vs_mdd/,0,"Im 23, and have had issues with depression since puberty. When I was on a continuous birth control pill and never had periods, I had little to no depression symptoms. Taking the depression inventory, i scored as having very mild to no depression. I stopped taking them in September because i was sterilized. I am into bodybuilding, and wanted to see if getting off the pill helped me gain more muscle. 

Now, my life has changed drastically. Getting off the pill caused me to lose attraction to my now ex boyfriend, and i broke up with him. I now live on my own, which I never have done before. I am seeing someone else, and things are still new and stressful for me. I notice a return of the depression symptoms. However, they are not normal, ""stable"" depression symptoms. They are severe the few days leading up to my monthly time, last a day or two into it, and then they just...disappear. i woke up today after 4 or 5 days of misery and felt fine. Went about my work fine, laughed more, didnt feel suicidal anymore. 

It seems to me that i may have PMDD (premenstrual dysphoric disorder). I dont have severe cramps or bodily issues. Just the depression, and more irritability (though the irritability is normal for pms). But it is nearly unbearable every month. Im debating going back on the pill because of it, even though they have side effects i wish to avoid. Antidepressants do not work on me (ive tried 5, along with various other types of psych drugs). I know this is a somewhat common condition, but I am wondering if any others have a similar issue. I have never been diagnosed with PMDD, only MDD, anxiety, autism, and misdiagnoses of bipolar disorder and 2 personality disorders (avoidant and schizoid). Would it be worth seeking treatment for this (some type of therapy, no psych medication), or because it is hormonal, would that be useless? 

For those who have PMDD, have you found anything that helps your symptoms? I couldn't even lift weights during this last phase of symptoms because i was so miserable. I couldn't do much of anything but sit and bask in my misery",1677733289.0

Time doesn’t heal,7,11ft85y,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11ft85y/time_doesnt_heal/,4,"I hope you can understand this poem I wrote from my perspective. I am not a poet, and I am not a professional. This just came from my heart. Enjoy! 

Time doesn’t heal. 

In the beginning of it all, was a broken shell of me. 
I had to drink away the feeling of being so lonely. 
Lost on my own in my own mind, stuck in a mental prison,
Nothing felt real, nothing was kind, and no one to listen. 
The heart cried out but my tears dries out before the next beat. 
Heartbreak was the movie but the theatre had only one seat. 
Written was my name, for there I would sit. Soaking in sorrows with one door but no ex-it.
As time went on I found my own way out. Through a small hole that no one knew about. 
For I was even skeptical of this escape route. 
So as time went on I kept looking back, only to see myself sitting there in that chair through that little crack.
The same one that I emerged from or so as I thought I did. 
But that’s not me in that seat, that’s me but me when I was a kid. 
Crying out for help but no one could hear. 
Confused and broken, the kid in me was In fear.
I’ve let me down, no, not me now but me then. 
Life was much easier when I could just pretend. 
But this is real so for that I can no longer run, 
It’s time to face you, so face what you have done. 
You broke me, you broke the kid I once was too. 
You don’t care, you left me, you still have no clue. 
I may have been wrong more times than one
But for that, you still have no sense of what you’ve done. 
As time goes on the tic-toc will tick
it will not heal my heart as you’ve left it sick.",1677732311.0
I don't know what to do...,2,11ft43e,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11ft43e/i_dont_know_what_to_do/,2,"Just having a bit of a crisis tonight. I'm 25, graduated from college 3 years ago, and I don't know what to do with myself. I don't know what I want to do in life. I say that I do, but I really don't, and I'm beating myself over it everyday. In the last 3 years, I've had 2 jobs, got fired from both, and I'm currently working part-time as a substitute teacher. Currently living with my grandmother. Got off a shift from an elementary school today (never again), and it made me consider my life. It made me think about the people I know. I occasionally see my former peers in real life and social media. I'm happy for them and I wish them luck, but, unfortunately (and I hate this about myself) it has an adverse effect on me. only makes me look at myself and want to punch me in the face. Under worse scenarios, it makes me want to die. My entire life, I've been the hardest on myself, probably as an unhealthy mechanism to keep me down to earth.

Right now, the only thing I know how to do is write. Books, scripts, things like that. It's the only thing I know. It's the only thing I want do to. I always tell my therapist that I have a set goal in mind: to become a renowned writer, but I'm starting to realize that I've been lying to myself. The more I say it, the more I feel I'm trying to convince myself that I know what I'm doing. The truth is, I don't, and I hate myself for it. I don't even think I'm particularly good at it. I don't even know what I want to write.

It's one of those thoughts that you unconsciously lock away to keep from thinking about it and feeling bad over it, but every now and then, something triggers that thought and you just feel down for however long. I remember, in a passing moment in therapy, she brought up the idea of a life coach. I've never really considered that but I don't even know if it's a good idea to put all this weight and nonsense on another person. Would that even be a good idea?

God, this is all just so pathetic... I feel worthless. Like I don't deserve to have a good life. Like my life is insignificant.",1677731973.0

I used to date this girl for about 8 months, which was a large portion of my life because I am only turning 17 this month, and she was my first ever girlfriend. I had a lot of firsts with her like my first kiss and first date to a school dance, and we called every night for a solid 3 or 4 month streak. I had never felt the way I had when I was with her, and was so lovestruck that I looked past all the problems in our relationship. I pushed away many of my friends and made very foolish decisions to make her happy, but didn’t know that she was still seeing her ex and still loved him. I ended up staying with her through her abortion from his child, and we relied on each other emotionally for a lot, as it seemed we were each others best friend. It has been a little over 7 months since we broke up, and since then I’ve been working hard to try to restore my ability to trust and catch feelings for any girl other than her. I’ve dated and talked to a few girls since then, but it feels like I’m just leading them on; even though they are so much better for me than she was I still cant find myself loving or liking anyone other than her. I often see her and her new boyfriend in the halls of my highschool and it strikes so much fear inside me, honestly I don’t really know why but I tend to just freeze up and my train of thought completely shuts down. I’m sorry for the long backstory but my problem is that I haven’t felt the same spark as when I was with her for any other girl, and it’s as if she haunts my mind. I realize that she’s bad for me and did horrible things to me like the lying and gaslighting, but even though my brain understands that my heart can’t. Also, since she was my only ever experience sexually (luckily she didn’t take my v card) every time I masturbate images of her and her laugh and her smile come into my mind as I finish and my post nut clarity is just a spiral of loneliness and regret. I’m just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and if I’m not alone in this kinda thing.",1677731783.0

For weeks I’ve been heavily suicidal for the last 3 weeks. Now I was told I have to get off all my medication and continue my electroconvulsive therapy and I am scared it will make me have a miscarriage.


Since mid February I was living somewhere since the age of 5-then moving upstairs of said location at 20. Now I am 29. The furnace caught fire 2 weeks into my college classes and we were not expecting this. And then when informing our landlord we would not pay another month on the 1st in full-She then said be out by the 1st. So I have had a lot of distractions at school. I had to move into a dorm so I wouldn’t be homeless but now I have to drop out because I can’t pay the 5G on my account. And you can’t continue with that type of hold on your account. So in 2 weeks my entire life has lite fire and it keeps getting bigger. 

I have a 9 year old going to be 10 in April. She can not live with me right now not just because it’s a dorm so after being together for 9 years…POOF! GONE but I’ve really considered hanging my self on the bed. I’m tired of this shit. Yes I love this baby I am pregnant with but I really believe I am meant for death because that’s the direction I keep getting pointed in. She lives with her fathers mother (her grandmother/Geandfather on her dads side) and I love those people so much. I am glad they are keeping her safe from the streets. 



Anyways as times go on I am not sure if any one really cares. No one has ever really wanted me as a friend. I thankfully have 1 good friend but if I KMS she will be my kiddos step mom. (My best friend is with my ex. Yes I know. But idc). She is a really great person who hasn’t been able to have her own kids and now I can just let my daughter be loved by her. 

No one really cares. I am not reaching out to one of those fucking crisis numbers they called CPS for no damn good reason. I might be ficked but my kid will and never has been. I told my fiancé that I needed help that I was not OK by myself around like two today and I did something stupid and I didn’t wake up till seven and he didn’t even question it.

kind of tired that my best is never good enough,8,11fq01q,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11fq01q/kind_of_tired_that_my_best_is_never_good_enough/,1,"i know it's just a feeling and it'll pass, but i'm getting back to just feeling an anxious-type of depressed. like that i'll never ""snap out of it"", or finish school and move out. i guess it hurt extra when i took a day off to clean up my room, car, and i felt pretty good until i was at the laundromat and one of my neighbors asked me if i was on vacation or if i was going to stay there(the apt) forever. I'd been at that apartment since I was a kid, and she's an elderly lady who's known me since then. I awkwardly laughed and she asked me if i finished school and i said no. and then i left and i just broke down immediately when i walked back into my apt. 

i pay rent and pay my mom's health insurance. i have a full-time job. i attempted going to school part-time but ended it last week as i just gave up. i'm working out and i eat healthy. but that part about still not having left this cramped apartment. and not having a degree or being able to finish one semester eats away at me all the time. it just gets worse each year, as neighbors always ask me. but i know they don't care the reason why i'm still in school, i always feel judged when i tell them, or they cut to talking about how their kids are graduating.

i keep trying to go back to school all the time, but i can never focus, it always feels overwhelming to go to work and do everything else and take classes. i have major social anxiety which i'm trying to brush off, i always feel awkward in class settings - i've had people make comments about how presenters need to be more confident every time i present. it hurts, because sometimes i feel like i did pretty good only to be met with that type of conclusion. but again, i brush it off. 

i tried counseling and cbt was fine, but it only helped me keep trying. i can't get good results no matter how much i've been practicing my skills on being compassionate with my shortcomings, living in the present, understanding growth takes time. i feel like i'm not fast enough. i'm so scared i'm going to keep taking years to finish school, every piece of homework feels like a monument. i keep having to read a paragraph over and over until i understand it, or sometimes i write the entire page of a textbook as part of my notes- to put it into perspective. it's not very efficient when i have to take at least 4 engineering classes each semester to graduate ""on time""

i ended things with a really great guy that has his life together and is finishing college and got promoted to an engineering position - he's also an engineer major.

he's smart and really well-rounded. and i was surprised when he took interest in me. but despite how sweet he is, i know he still doesn't see all my flaws clearly. and i haven't told him i self-harm here and there. and him being great just makes me worry i'll drag him down, so i ended it, but it really hurts. he was a really good part of my life, he made me happy a little bit, as much as an external thing could make me happy. but i couldn't care about life more despite his presence, i just simply cared about him - not enough to change my ""motivation"" towards fixing myself up. 

i'm kind of lost on what to do. i want to try a counselor again, but i know what it's gonna be. just try cb  therapy again.",1677723646.0

I was broken up with for my depression,6,11fozm1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11fozm1/i_was_broken_up_with_for_my_depression/,10,"I was recently broken up with. My ex told me she was having a hard time with my depression, and she couldn't deal with it any more. I was heartbroken. I know dating someone with depression can be hard. Their mood can affect you, and if they aren't seeking help or somehow trying to better themselves, it's just a recipe for disaster. This wasn't the case.

I had been in a solid path of recovery for a year. I was doing far better than I ever thought I would achieve, and I was only getting better. I can point to various specific things I was doing for my recovery, and even steps I was taking that were outside my comfort zone. I was working on myself, and goddamit I was doing a good job. I did have struggles. It was a tough year, but I was doing my best and the depression had was in the back of my mind. It didn't rule my life anymore, but 2 or 3 times a month I'd have a panic attack or cry a lot at a dumb movie. I thought I was doing quite well tbh, but apparently my ex felt otherwise.

This hurts me so much for two reasons. The first is that she didn't even bring it up. If there was something I was doing that bothered her, I could have worked on it. Communication is important. But she only brought it up during the breakup. She told me she had been trying to ""fix"" me by suggesting different things, but I was not receptive. The thing is, I was taking steps. I guess they simply weren't the steps she wanted me to take. She wanted me to go to therapy instead of using workbooks, she wanted me to go on walks instead of indoor biking, etc. I was taking care of my mental health, but since it wasn't in the exact way she did hers, she was just didn't acknowledge the work I was putting in.

The second reason this hurts so much is that she had plenty of issues as well. Honestly, most of the support was from me to her throughout the relationship. I thought someone with a history of mental health issues would be more understanding, but I feel like it was the exact opposite. The truth all came out during the breakup: whenever I told her I was sad and needed a hug, she catalogued that against me. It is so hurtful to know that her support was not free of judgement. I did not do the same to her. I listened and supported her. When she told me she had a history of bulimia and cutting, I didn't run away. I was scared, but I thought the right thing to do was be supportive.

It hurts so much that I didn't receive the same support back. It hurts so much to know that my depression, even when handled, can be used against me. My recovery is a wreck right now. I am worse than I was before I started recovering, and I'm having some really dark thoughts. The depression was so hard to deal with and get out of, but it seems that just having that in my history is enough to screw me over. Will I never escape this? I was told to share with people, to talk about my issues... but I was just punished for doing so. I get that dating someone who is depressed can be difficult, but I also think someone who is taking steps and is mostly out of the depression deserves a chance. I think she projected a lot of stuff onto me. 

I keep thinking of this one time where she told me I should buy new underwear cause mine were full of holes. I remember going though all of my underwear and only finding one pair that had a hole, which are my workout underwear. I feel like the whole relationship can be described by that memory. She had a mental image of someone who was depressed and a mess because I shared with her my history. She didn't judge me for what my actions or words, but for my past. I thought I had a future with this woman. The week she broke up with me, she asked to meet my parents. She always talked about how grateful she was for having me in her life and the support I gave her.",1677721121.0

I've been feeling empty most of my life. You know, like not having interests, personality, or a drive towards people. Every decision I made for my life happened because of social pressure.

Recently though, I've been having more courage and will to pursue things i want. But it turns out fucked up. I have low social skills, and because of much drama, I'm drifting away from my friends. I also broke up with my partner.

Each day, I lose more time, more people, more money. All I still get is shame and remorse; and the fear that's caused by these.

I just want to know there's anyone who relates to what I feel, like I'm not the only person struggling with the basic concepts of life like socializing or identity. But each time I am misunderstood or judged. And that's the best case scenario.

i am enrolled in an online school since september 2021

i have been taking the same 3 courses since then (all 10th grade first semester courses)

my peers are taking junior 2nd semester courses

i am not stupid, i'm actually smart school wise (not trying to brag) i got good grades all through middle school and freshman year of highschool

i started the online school due to really bad social anxiety developing and isolation once covid-19 started

in 9th grade i went to my regular school district high school however the school was all online due to covid, but after 9th grade over the summer i found out the district will start back to in-person at the new school year, so i convinced my parents to let me do online school

so here is my day to day:

i live with my mother and my 20yo brother who is going to trade school in May

every day i wake up at around 12-1pm

i watch tiktok on my phone for like 30 minutes to an hour in bed

i get up and sit at the computer for another 30 minutes watching videos or tv

i wash my face

then eat breakfast (a yogurt)

i sit at my computer some more

my mom makes me lunch (a bagel)

i sit at my computer some more

i eat dinner (takeout food which is semi-healthy, like chicken thighs and rice)

i shower at 1am

i get into bed at 2am

i fall asleep at 3-4, sometimes 5 bc i watch videos on my phone, without videos playing in the background i cant sleep

&#x200B;

it's like this everyday

i have no friends at all, 0

i used to have a really good friend group and was a well liked kid at school

i almost never leave the house, i go to kickboxing class twice a week at night and it goes really late (ends at like 11:30, which doesn't help my sleep situation)

the other people at the class are all older, the youngest one there is like 25

last week i went outside to bike to a park, but i haven't gone since

i have very low energy and a bad appetite, i think i majorly stunted my growth as well because i haven't grown much if at all since september 2021 which makes me really depressed

everything i do/don't do makes me feel like shit it's like i'm caught in a negative feedback loop, it's like it all compounds

i have gone to an online therapist since october 2021 when i told my mom i was depressed and she was worried about that + my social inhibition

last week he told me he was moving to a different agency, he wasn't very helpful anyways i just ranted to him about ""the news reel"" and things that were going on in my family i rarely ever actually talked about my anxiety and if i did we wouldnt talk about it for very long

every day i tell myself ""tomorrow im gonna get my life in check"" and then do the same thing when i wake up

i honestly don't know how to stop and have been heavily considering just klling myself, i dont know if its even possible to bounce back and i can't believe this is my life

i don't want to kms because it would upset my family though, but i would honestly prefer to stop being conscious (i dont believe in god or an afterlife)

i dont really know what else to write but im just thinking now and its so hard to believe that i was once a happy regular kid with a bright future ahead of him and i've turned into this, i don't want to believe it but it's true and i have no idea what i can do now",1677716177.0

Im really worried because he has implied several times that he wants to end it and that he might do it before his birthday because he wants to ""to save us the trouble of buying him presents"". We dont know how serious he is about it though or if it was just one moment. 

My parents really try to help him with everything but he barely responds to it and gets irritated that they even try. He wont take advice. He has basically given up and always uses his diagnoses as an excuse to not try anything (though I also understand that they do make it really hard for him to do things) 
He technically has a few friends but he never reaches out to them to see them.

How do they survive and manage to stave off the conclusion until another day?

For years I have recognized that I have depression, which saps away my will or my capacity to enjoy even the most basic things. I found coping mechanisms, friends, therapy, other things, and they have all helped for a time, but everything gradually loses its ameliorative effect. I'm usually good at masking it until it builds up too much and I have a panic episode, and those have been becoming more frequent. I have had the advantage of having family nearby to help with food and housing, so I only have to work part-time to support myself in my studies, but due to family situations that is about to change.

I don't have much of a support system. My parents continuously tell me i'm perfectly fine, just lazy. Despite the fact I work full time, pay for all my rent/bills, car and do everything on my own as a single woman, etc I am still considered lazy. Despite the fact that half the reason i'm like this is because of how I was raised. My friends don't have time for me, most of them are busy raising families or married and doing stuff with their spouses. 

I feel so alone. I don't want to reach out because the times I have it's been brushed aside, further validating that what I feel means nothing. I know everyone has problems, but i just want to be fucking heard. But I can't keep beating my fists against the wall hoping someone will finally listen because it will drive away the few people close to me. No one wants to deal with the friend whose always sad.

He’s 15 and he was born in my house, and he’s always been my sidekick. Always there to keep me company when I’m withdrawn from life. Anyway the vet told me that we could keep treating it, but that he’s got to be in pain and it won’t heal and it’s getting worse every time. I of course couldn’t let my best friend continue on in pain so I made the hard decision to say goodbye. I spent nearly an hour sobbing and hugging him before the vet did it. 

So I come home devastated to my second cat Izzy. I’ve had her since she was a kitten and she’s a year older than ducky. When ducky was born Izzy would constantly steal ducky from the mother and take him to her bed, so naturally we had to keep him. She knew right away that something was up when I came home without ducky. They were best friends. Izzy has been having a lot of issues but she seemed to be doing well, until last night. She started breathing extremely heavy and threw up. I immediately left with her for the emergency vet but she passed on the way. I’m 100% sure she died of a broken heart. 

Now I’m sitting here alone with my own broken heart. I’m absolutely devastated. I called into work and my boss is awesome and gave me the rest of the week off but I kinda feel like I need the distraction. Sorry if this was long and rambling.

It really depends on which side of the fence you sit on. Back a long long time ago we had greeks who defined the lines in social status, placing most on the bottom while raising a few to the top who took power. Next came the Romans who added onto this with harsh and severe competition and social acceptance was only extended to those who won. A society so harsh they decided the weak should be dead, not an altogether different idea than Hitler had. Flush the weak and damaged out to produce a perfect and undefeatable society. The US and so very many other nations adopted this as a model for society. Much less harsh, society in the US is still using this model. Money is status, and you only get money through being competitive. Anyone who “loses” or simply refuses to play gets the shaft. Women still view men based on physical prowess as if a lion is going to suddenly pop up and he might have to chuck a few speers for your survival. Men still brag about their physical conquests both in sex and physical fights. We like to pretend we are oh so evolved but are we? But wait, there’s more. Everything good we were ever taught, every moral and principle that was given to us in a positive light is in complete opposition with living. We lie constantly, we lie at the beginning of relationships and in jobs. We lie to ourselves probably at least once an hour. If we just look over there and ignore the bad then the bad doesn’t exist. How many times a day do you hear “living the dream”? How many interviews have you had to lie in because you know the other 923 applicants also lied and it's the only way you’re going to get a job? You absolutely cannot be a good moral, principal-having person in this society. As such, anyone who is anywhere across the line or even close to the line of being a good person is going to struggle heavily in this society. What's completely laughable is that social acceptance fuels 90% of people's decisions. When to obtain social acceptance you have to be apathetic, opportunistic, and greedy…. in other words, we’re seeking the acceptance of people who will never accept us anyway. I mean who tf wants to become a monster just to befriend monsters? Pretty sure that's not why anyone wanted social acceptance. We want this so we’re not alone, we want this so we feel included and loved. But to get there we have to become someone who can barely love themselves let alone others? When the truth of the world is revealed and you stop lying to yourself about how many horrors are out there it becomes a really dark fkn place. You can take this to the bank, do NOT have hope that anyone will do anything about any of it. FAR too many people bought into the generational conditioning and are now brainwashed into thinking this is ok… this is all as it should be… ofc those people are usually the ones who have decided to trade in their dignity to belong to a society that would just as soon crush you like a bug than give up a raise or promotion to you.

I felt normal and did not think anything of it. I felt the same as everyone else until I became 17 years old. Something changed most likely my attraction to females, and I started covering up more, and I would just tell myself I can take it off but I just want to ""blend in."" I got to the habit of covering up more and more to the point where summer I would always where long sleeves hoodies and cardigans, and worst of all for a few years I would always put my hands in my hoodie pockets as it would cover my hand scars. 

I was fed up of having to cover up and wearing only long sleeves hoodies that I for some reason when it came to enrolling for 2nd year of college I just ignored it and did not continue. After that I became depressed and felt like an outcast as all my friends enrolled into college or university so I basically ghosted and binged watched anime and slept most of my days.

 I ended up being passionate about music production and started selling beats online which meant I was able to not leave my house, and it was amazing, though it wasn't reliable and would earn sometimes minimum wage but most of the times half of that and after paying rent, I was left with enough to live, but not save. 

Recently turned 25 and  only had 1 job which was Amazon Warehouse for a year, and I was really comfortable with the job as I was able to wear hoodies everyday, and cover up with gloves (though I envy people with retail or office jobs) , but I ended up leaving.

 I now consider myself not depressed or not to the state I was a few years ago, I'm constantly working on myself and working out, however 2 things keep coming in the way, and that is being un-employed and having no friends or relationships ever. As for work its constantly daunting having to look and find a job with the right uniform, and I don't really have much experience for someone my age. 

Considering all my circumstances I feel like the best move is joining the Army for many reasons, and It's something I really want to do. I've submitted my form, but I have to call the recruiters and have been stalling it out as all I can think about is me being exposed in a short sleeve t shirt which essentially is like being naked at this point. I have no one to turn to so I wrote this out if you got this far thanks",1677701856.0

A life full of pain and disappointments : Nothing more painful than being alive,1,11ffwim,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11ffwim/a_life_full_of_pain_and_disappointments_nothing/,1,"Its really surprising to see how life can be always be  cruel only to some people . Right from my child hood my life was very different than others , My mother was in a very bad state mentally and was abusing me . I was put up in a physically abusive school . Was bullied like shit due to my appearance . Took it all to develop depression and ocd fr my entire life . Officially diagnosed on 2015 . 

The most cruelest part is , my family cannot understand my mental health issues . Despite all I worked hard got good grades both in school and college, only to face the darkest days of my life . During the end of my college , was diagnosed with IBS , a lot of medications made me tired ..didnt attend placements due to obvious reasons . Graduated in 2020 ..corona happened , I fell fr a massive depression and ocd attack , had to take medications for 10 months continously which made me sleepy af.  

Then came the second half of 2021 . Made my dear grandpa ill . He went through 2-3 surgeries ...it was traumatic , he died on may 2022 . Depression hit again . Couldn't join jobs since the offers that I got were offering peanuts and expected hit load of work . Studied courses related to digital marketing and spent a chunk on it during all this time.  Guess what since I have career gap , good companies rejected me . In this mean time applied for distance education p.g completed that and gave competitive exams , sadly my country follows caste based reservation , though I scored good marks I was not selected . I am literally demotivated to give competitive exams again after seeing what happened to me last time . I hv not had any relationships , hv always felt that I should not disturb others life with all my shit . This is just like 10% of wats happening . The lonliness , the pain , the so called "" misfortune"" in my life has doomed me . 

I cry almost everday , it pains , I want to die . Leave all this , put my soul in peace . Close my eyes once and for all . As a child I thought my hardwork ,patience and honesty will just take me away from all sorrows ..but no . I did not have the ""luck"" from the beginning . I see photos of my ypunger self , wen I was like 2/3 , my smile was so vibeant n truly happy . Little did that girl know that she will grow up to be the saddest being .",1677700912.0
why is being productive so hard? i want to fill my day with more activities to keep me active,3,11ffrrd,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11ffrrd/why_is_being_productive_so_hard_i_want_to_fill_my/,7,"For the past 10+ years (i’m 22F) i’ve been totally inactive with physical activity, the people around me fill their day with hobbies/gym/errands. All i do everyday is go to work & back home into my bed. I know laying down all day is bad for me, it makes me feel lazy and disgusting.
 The past year i started cleaning around the house more, which use to be a total struggle, i’d literally cry. I’ve had friends offer to help me clean around the house but i can’t accept their help because i need to learn to do it myself and i don’t want to rely on anyone to clean my filth. 

I struggle with depression and anxiety, and it’s hard for me to even get up and shower sometimes. I’ve tried the gym a few times but i get so overwhelmed there, scared people are staring at me, i don’t know how to start, i just feel lost at the gym. I tried yoga (absolutely love it) but there isn’t any yoga studios around me which is a disappointment. We do have a pilates studio here which i tried a  few times, also love it but the pricing is insane. i just bought my membership again ($100 for 4 classes a month) so this month i’ll go once a week and see if i’ll get in the habit of doing each week.

Struggling in graduate school and depressed,1,11fexom,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11fexom/struggling_in_graduate_school_and_depressed/,6,"CW: suicide

I’m going to talk about suicidal feelings and one of the main reasons why I am depressed .I'm depressed and suicidal because I'm stressed about school, work and managing credit card debt. I currently work 29 hours a week. I am trying to go back to school after a long break of five years and it is causing me a lot of stress.I have fallen so behind in my school work and it causes me to have suicidal thoughts. I have been trying to get a masters degree for eight years. And because I don't have any motivation it has been harder. My lack of motivation might be due to my depression. I also have a rough time balancing school with work. I am also worried about my mother. She seems to be developing knee problems. She works as a nurse at night and I am worried something bad might happen to her since she is always entering other people's homes. I am also worried about having a very dreadful conversation with her because she thinks that I am going to immediately start my student teaching after I pass my Mtels. But I can’t student teach because I have fallen behind on my class readings for graduate school and I still have a lot of notes to study because I couldn’t focus enough on my studying the first time I took my classes. I have always been horrible at studying. So now, I’m in a situation where I am behind in all of my classes even though I have already taken them and got As. I am behind in my classes because I never took the time to really memorize my class notes. I only read through them once. So it doesn’t feel like I actually learned anything in my classes, which is what is causing me depression. I am making a plan to kill myself if my family doesn’t give me more time to finish my masters degree and study my class notes after I pass my mtels. Mtels are exams people have to take to become teachers.I might as well be dead anyways because I won’t be able to afford living on my own. And I won’t be able to pass my student teaching if I don’t have extra time to study all my class notes.. I am dreading telling my mother that I have even more work to do after I pass my mtels. Especially since she has been waiting for me to pass this test for five years. I have to go back and study the class notes from all of my classes that I have taken during graduate school, Which is about 8 classes. Since I have been out of school for so long (ie: five years) I need to refresh my memory.. I'm worried that my mom might kick me out when she finds out that it is going to take me longer to graduate. I don't blame her. I've been trying to get a masters degree for eight years! I started this journey in 2014. She is getting tired of me. I should have studied harder. And my credit card debt is stressing me out. And my sister is getting mad at me because of all the reasons my mother is. She's tired of me living off of my mom and not talking responsibility for my life. She’s even suggesting that I cut my hours at work to study for my mtels, which is not something I can afford to do since I have so many bills. I just wanted to talk about why I am depressed. I’m tired of being alive. It feels like there is nothing to look forward too. I will be making plans to kill myself within a year if things don’t get better.
I think I struggle with adult add. My family is Haitian so it doesn’t really believe in mental illness. I just hate myself because it feels like I have wasted my life because I have never had any motivation to manage it or balance it. That is why I am considering suicide. I am tired of feeling like such a failure especially when if comes to school. I have no idea how to talk to my family about what is really going on in school. I am worried that they are going to kick me out once they find out I will be taking longer to graduate.",1677699791.0

I should just sit and listen and try to blend in to the crowd because my problems aren't worth anyone's time. I should just disappear from the earth. I know it wouldn't have made any difference. I am just a cry baby who can't take criticism from anyone. So my conclusion is that it doesn't matter if it doesn't have a meaning in this world. I could just disappear and no one would care because I'm just in the way of others. I know I will just end up even more useless than I already am. I have no real talent. I'm not good at anything. But if I would end it all, some would cry and I don't want to be a burden on somenos mind. So just let me be and stop caring so I can end it.

Have you ever felt really sad but there are no tears? You don't know why but the tears aren't coming. Because I have not once not twice too many times to count. I especially get it when I see someone happy in a relationship because I know I will never get that closure to someone. But that is just life in general you almost never get what you want. It is the hard truth and you just  gotta accept it.

But you should never give up hope because then it will only get worse, promise you I know all about that. Never give up that flame that someday someone will love me for who i am. I just hope for your sake and my own that the person doesn't take too long. Before it's too late. Cuss you never know one day you'll just give everything up and end it all. but remember there will be someone in the future who will love you but as for me. Well I'll do my best to keep on living. 

People think nothing Hurts. So sometimes I snap and they Wonder why. Try to think with the little brain capacity you have. At Least try to understand People have feelings. Even if we don't show them they are there. So try to understand when I snap at you and you Wonder why. You are the stupidest person alive. Because you can't Even realize what you've done in The past affects the future. 

Loneliness is the worst pain in life. It's a weird feeling but you always get through it somehow. It's even worse when People only speak to you to get you to do things for them or you are in The way. Because then you aren't even a living creature for them anymore. You have become the pinnacle   of disappointment. 

Some people just do things to annoy you. It's their purpose. The same People are the ones who get all the attention and are the ""cool"" ones. They also always go too far. That's what I call disgusting. 

Here I am once again complaining about my life and how hard it is. Even though I have it easy. I live with an understanding family who almost always supports me even though I do nothing in return. I also know I'll never be able to return the favor. I won't even be able to help my family out. Because if i keep looking to the future i have now i'll probably work at mcdonalds or i'll be homeless and useless. I don't think I can take care of my family when they get older. because I am of no use to them.

I have no skills, like no skills at all. I am really no good at anything. That's the difference between me and everybody else. Almost everybody has something they can brag about. Not me. Some are good at studying, some are good at sports. I'm no good at all. There we had it again, I really have no purpose in this life. Sometimes I wonder if life for others would have been better if I never existed in the first place. Because the only thing I do is complain and I say mean things to get someone to notice me to get someone's recognition.

Because the only way for me to get enjoyment is by hurting someone else. I know this but still I keep doing it. I see it on their faces that they get hurt by the things I say but will I ever ask for forgiveness no. I'll keep doing this until the day I die. At the same time I also wonder if I would die right here at this moment would anyone really cry or even care. Like I mean I have really never accomplished anything or helped someone out. I'm just that friend who is in the corner by himself and is in the way for the fun things.

I'm the friend no one really cares about. I'm the one no one even really knew existed because I sit in my corner. i dont disturb or interrupt. Because then I would be the really annoying one who always seeks attention even though I really don't fit in. but i am with a friend group because. The people in that friend group are the only ones I kind of can be myself with and almost none of them would laugh at me and take my problems later and use them as an argument later to hurt me. 

That's probably one reason I don't have any friends on the female side because they really don't understand “boy” problems. They only make everything about themselves and really don't care what you think or what you say. In their minds you'll  just be another background character. Just as I said earlier I have had no impact on anyone's life. I'm just there in the way and existing. Because no one really cares. 

Like if i was a character in a movie i would be the guy who is just sitting on a bench staring into nothingness and thinking about what i've done wrong to deserve this life. Is it that  I teased girls when I was young or is it that I never really tried to make friends either way it's my own fault. 

That's the thing I'm good at. Blaming myself and putting on a weight on my own shoulders that don't even exist. To reveal these burdens I think I take this problem so no one else has to. But I know that's a lie because everyone has those weights at their shoulders, some heavier, some lighter than others but everyone has their own problems. So you should never think you're worth more than anyone. 

You are just one in a million with almost the exact same day and problems. They always say you are special. That's the biggest lie I've ever heard. you aren't special. you're wired and a burden to everyone around you. I don't know why I keep writing all this.

No one will ever read it neither will i. If I do, I'm probably only reminding myself that I have no purpose and thet it's too late to save me from myself. I'm just being away from someone all the time. So for your own sake leave me alone. I promise you it's for your own good. 

It's always my own fault for not doing something id like i can't blame someone else. My decision is my responsibility. I can't blame others for what I've done to myself. It's my own fault for choosing to be alone at home. With none to hold. It has always been like this because I know I would also just be the party pooper that's boring and stands alone in the corner while everyone else has fun playing games or making jokes.

I'm really bad at both. As I said in my latest text, when I make a joke it always hurts someone else. At a party that would just bring the mood down and it would all be my fault. 

That's why I don't go to the parties or even get invited because I would just disturb the order and be the odd one out. Because different is wrong. I have learned that by now. I'm different in so many ways I can't count. A Lot of people say I should have more confidence.",1677691582.0

I’m getting very tired of explaining my condition to my parents,1,11f7j50,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11f7j50/im_getting_very_tired_of_explaining_my_condition/,0,"So I (M21) and in the midst of a very bad depressive episode. I have moderate-severe depression that’s recently gotten out of hand since I’m currently neither taking medication or attending therapy anymore. Long story short, my parents forced me to withdraw from school so we can file for a retroactive withdrawal and vacate my past semester results because of how bad they were, largely due to another depressive episode triggered by my parents refusing to listen to how my mental health affects my schooling and physical health.

It’s been very clear that I have gained a lot of weight over the last few years largely due to the depression, and admittedly due to not making the best dietary and exercise choices I could have made but that’s a whole other ball park of a discussion, however, my anti-depressants have significantly reduced my weight gain and made it easier to consistently exercise and engage in social activities. But, the main issue I have no is that my psychological and psychiatric care was from my school, and not a primary care provider who primarily focuses on mental health, so when I left school, I couldn’t get my prescriptions refilled which hasn’t been the biggest help.

Fast forward to today, and my mom was expressing concern about my weight, something I have told her that repeated nagging me about only makes me feel Möre uncomfortable and worse, and said I wasn’t doing anything to combat it, despite serious cutting down my fast food consumption, and increasing the amount of healthy meals I eat and resuming daily exercise. She blamed it again on my taking my antidepressants, something I have been taking for the last year, and accused it of making me sleepy despite knowing I have untreated sleep apnea which has been draining my energy throughout the day.

I’ve repeatedly told her and my dad, both medical officials, that they keep making inappropriate and incorrect conjectures about my health and the medication I take but they don’t seem keen on listening. I don’t need advice, I just wanted to vent because this is very heavy stuff to talk about and I don’t want my close friends to worry about me more than I already do. If anyone can relate I would love to chat about this!

I exercise almost everyday on a strict schedule (mostly weightlifting and some cardio), I cook and eat healthy meals (I track all of my macros), and I meditate each morning after waking up and once more before bed.

Still, after all of this, I feel nothing. I feel ashamed of who I was and who I am. I have constant violent thoughts about myself and others. I no longer enjoy my old hobbies and creative outlets. I have zero interest in making new friends and have zero energy for going out to meet people of the opposite sex (never been on any dates or had any sort of intimacy). I don’t understand what I’m doing wrong, because I have a very supportive family and a few good friends to lean on. Despite all of this, I can’t seem to fix myself and my mindset.

My mom after finding out offered my sister to go see a psychologist, she was very supportive, we both told her that she can speak to us when she want, but that we understand it’s a difficult matter so maybe it’s better for her speaking to a psychologist. She of course firstly was embarrassed when we found out , but when she calmed down my sister say she now don’t need a psychologist, but that she’s gonna sure go if she feel stressed or depressed when school starts again. She promised she will never sh again.
Months have passed and she never expressed her need for a psychologist and we didn’t speak about it or neither we did not ask her questions about her sh , my mom is convinced she stopped.
But I had the feeling that it can’t really be that easy . 
So yesterday I was cleaning her room and I was lifting this little statue she have in her desk. I heard a “tingling” noise from the inside of it. Turns out that I open it and I find 4 blades and a pencil sharpener without the blade.

Depression and weight gain,1,11f4bw6,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11f4bw6/depression_and_weight_gain/,0,"Hello all, my first post here. Luckily I’m in a small period of time where I care a bit about my well-being. For once.

I’m chronically depressed have been since childhood due to multiple traumas. And my mental health seems to cause really bad eating habits, when I was younger I used to deliberately under eat (was actually anorexic ages 14-16 and almost anorexic at 19 with obsessive eating habits and panic attacks over not eating the “right thing”).

As I’ve gotten older I just eat too much, I have some period of time where I’m in a better place mentally and can loose weight. I lost almost 10kg in 2 months one one time counting calories, I managed micros and was actually eating super healthy. But then I got depressed again and ate it all back on. 

My whole world becomes grey, my mind hazy and I can’t focus or find joy in anything. I sleep, eat, sleep, eat, maybe self harm a bit then sleep again, till either the episode lifts or it goes from primarily depression to anxiety. When this happens I can just about function, it’s debilitating. The bit where I am mostly anxious is usually so unbearable I up my medication and have to take time off work. I get suicidal and self harm, often unable to stay still and cry randomly. Shaking a lot, heartbeat increased often, sleep less than 5 hours every day - I usually have lots of intrusive memories and flashbacks during this and the smallest thing takes me back to my traumatic childhood.

Been through therapy multiple times and while I may have complex PTSD the NHS is shit and just labels you depressed and let’s you rot. No deeper investigation, no proper diagnosis.

CBT has told me that my ex r-wording me was my fault because I stopped saying no and went silent “some boys don’t realise” apparently 3 no I don’t want tos isn’t enough….. Also I should worry about my violent fathers mental health over my own, they where indifferent to me telling them he threw knives at me and stabbed my baby pictures and that I saved my mums life multiple times. As a child. I’m essentially told “just stop being depressed/remembering your past”, they are totally out of touch! So fuck that. 

Eventually after this full blown breakdown I’ll come out again with milder depression. Until I spiral out of control again, and in all of this, weight management just isn’t a priority to me. Sometimes the only pleasure I feel is eating. Until my depression is mild or even rare occasions it lifts entirely and I actually feel motivated. And I enjoy other things, like have a art project I look forward to or even a video game, that stops me seeking food as a unhealthy coping mechanism.

Has anyone here had this same battle?Anyone else successfully get to a healthy weight WITHOUT obsessive eating and/or developing anorexia or bulimia? Any tips to help, when you’re mid weight loss journey, and a depressive episode hits you hard? Any websites or subreddits specifically to support people with chronic depression trying to be more physically healthy? I don’t think there will be a miracle cure, I think I just want people who are experiencing the same thing that I can talk to when I’m trying to improve my health but depression makes it hard.

TLDR: any support groups to help people with chronic depression trying to loose weight?",1677678806.0

"I just really wanna Die but, I also want my parents to think i just died of natural causes and that I didn't do suicide.",2,11f3vz9,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11f3vz9/i_just_really_wanna_die_but_i_also_want_my/,0,"Before people judge me and talk about getting ""help"" or talk about some therapy BS, then please just don't. The thing is there are 4 of us siblings and I'm the youngest,meanest,bít¢h,brat,and the black sheep of the family the one who always get compared to my older siblings.

But before you judge my parents, even though they always do favoritism (so does my siblings), they've always been great parents and I never lacked anything growing up except for my parents and siblings attention,and I truly Love Them dearly and I'm happy that they raised me and that I'm apart of their family.

But I'm tired with the ""you're so lazy, and your older sister is so busy helping out""(even though I, I clean up and actually do much more, and it's just that they never noticed and only see me when I lie down or sitting.) And many more. I also suffered Emotional bullying at school, I have ADHD so I'm usually out of it and can't concentrate, I'm also diabetic which people usually make fun of me for it.

 And when I tell my parents what's happening at school they're either to tired to listen or cut me off and if they do listen, it's always my mother telling me the saying that ""if people hit you with a rock, the hit them with a bread"" which basically means that ""I shouldn't fight back, be nice and let them be"" or just tell the teacher and in which the teacher doesn't do anything which makes me look like a pushover and makes people pick on me more. And when i ask my father he always tells me to fight back or tells me to ""stab them with a pencil"" and in which I did, but also the one who ended getting in touble instead because the principal gave me a last warning that if I ever get in trouble one more time, then I'll be expelled so when I got home my mom lashed at me.

 And before you say that I'm commiting suicide over something so small, well it's actually not just that. My 3rd sister has a habit of acting trying to be nice only cleaning up, doing chores, and joking around with mom or dad, well she only does that when our parents and older siblings are around. So she naturally bonds with them easily. (she's and extrovert and I'm an introvert).

While me on the other hand is always the one at fault,the brat ,the bít¢h and the lazy one and to be honest there's more problem than just that and I just really wanna die and  I tried multiple times even tried to open up to my parents, but all I got was ""you're being hormonal cause your a teenager"", ""stop over reacting"", ""what are you even depressed about"", ""other people have it worse and you're living a good life and you're depressed?"" Or the ""you don't need therapy, because the reason your like that cus you don't go out, you never listen,etc.

Can't tell if it's the meds or depression making me worse,1,11f1ex8,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11f1ex8/cant_tell_if_its_the_meds_or_depression_making_me/,0,"Obviously no one can answer this for me, but I'm just curious if anyone's had similar experiences.

Started having issues around 2020. To this day I don't really know the cause. In the beginning it was very up and down. I'd have depressive episodes that would last a few weeks, then feel mostly normal.

I started mirtazapine (remeron) around Christmas time when I was having an especially bad episode. With some ups and downs, mirtazapine mostly did its job and I didn't really have a bad episode for all of 2021. Consistency wise, my best year since having issues.

However, I gradually came to the realisation I wasn't what I'd used to be. It's hard to describe but I lost touch with part of myself. Lack of motivation was another thing. 

Starting 2022, I went through a lengthy progress of trying to quit mirtazapine. The withdrawals were like a bad episode each time I tried. I finally got off around mid 2022 and started lexapro (escitalopram). I was hopeful. It started with a dip, which I heard was normal. Except for the first time, that dip never ended. Mirtazapine gave me some indication, but I started to truly experience anhedonia for the months I was on lexapro. Can't remember wanting or doing really anything. 

Figured lexapro wasn't for me and started prozac (fluoxetine) in September. Things were actually looking somewhat hopeful approaching Christmas. I did notice when I didn't have a distraction the emptiness was lurking. Pretty much bang on Christmas another episode started, and once again hasn't ended since then. Just like the lexapro but worse.

I'm on a trend to be in a constant bad dip. I noticed this trend lined up with the meds, especially SSRIs, which makes me somewhat hopeful, so I've quit the prozac. I'm gonna try having nothing in my system. 

I understand prozac takes a while to leave your system but I can't help worrying if its the prozac or the depression will remain. Thing is I had depression before the meds, so is there a chance this downwards trend isnt caused by them? The episodes will become my constant reality?

With all of this, I've started cutting myself. I haven't done that for 10 years. I was told I was silly because ""adults don't cut themselves, don't act like a teenager"". Well, that didn't make me feel better. Thanks for that.

I strongly dislike my family, they have caused me a PTSD/depression/anxiety/OCD diagnosis from years of neglect and other forms of ab*se. I do not have a single safe person in my life. The person who I thought was my “safe person” completely lost their mind near the end and made me see them for who they truly are - manipulative and narcissistic in an emotionally unsafe way. The dysfunctional part of my brain that is overly sensitive and anxiously attached wants to reconnect with them, but the rational part is terrified. Can I truly be alone? I have no one. 

I live with the other part of my family, but they’re all a huge wreck. There is constant yelling and name calling, over stepping of boundaries, emotional and physical neglect, and unsanitary living conditions. Nobody ever takes any action to get things done. We desperately need therapy. I’m in such a huge mental overdrive right now that I cannot progress in life. I’m trying to keep my head above water but I feel like I’m drowning. Why can’t I have a happy fking family? I deserve that. I deserve at least one person who gets me and really sees me! Why must I suffer like this? I’m really in hell. 

I never feel emotionally safe or embraced. I just want connection. There are constant sirens going off in my house and in my brain. I would love to move out and completely ditch my family all together, but have no means to do so atm - I’m low income and cannot function in a job setting right now, nor do I have the credentials for a proper job to pay rent in this expensive city. I have been in the shadows my whole life and have lost my entire 20s to depression. I’m absolutely terrified that I will wake up one day and regret not enjoying my life and body and youth while I still had it!!!!!!! And it’s all thanks to my family… because if they had nurtured me as a child I would have had the means to become successful, and not a fawning mess like I am today. They also blame me for who I have become, when it was not my fault….. it’s my job to fix it now tho, and I have no drive to do so….only immense FEAR of NOT fixing it.

On top of typical depression symptoms, I’m also somewhat agoraphobic and struggle to leave my room. I’m afraid of dy*ng or getting hurt when I leave the house, and don’t have the drive to walk my dog for more than 25 mins- which makes me feel so unworthy of this beautiful good boy! I just want to feel free and able to move and enjoy life and build relationships. I want to feel like a “normal”, motivated, curious and adventurous 25 year old woman!!!!!

There were a couple good years there where I actually maintained a healthy body, and routine… I have also destroyed that for myself. I just eat all day, have gained 100 lbs, and am ruining my eyesight in front of the computer. 

Sorry, I’m not sure what I expected to get out of this post other than to hope that at least one person hears me, so that I don’t feel alone. I recognize that I need therapy or serious help of some kind. I just don’t have the energy to do that. Maybe I will muster up the courage to make an appointment soon.",1677664208.0

One of the main things that has stuck with me since finishing it, is when it brought up existential crisis. I don't know why the thought has clinged to me since, but it's the first time I've ever been stuck thinking about it.

It feels humiliating in a way, because it seems like a question other people (in general) have dealt with before and moved on from, but because it's fucking with me a lot for the first time, I feel like my depression and anxiety is invalidated. I mean this in the least pretentious way, but I don't understand how people can act and feel like there's not a void sucking them in every minute. I don't fucking get how anyone could even consider that having kids is a good idea, in an existence with no purpose, no goal, no reason to exist in the first place. Legacy, history, everything we've ever been taught doesn't matter at all because it's all temporary and going to disappear. There's no way at all to become permanent in existence, for all of time. Everything felt and made will be gone, and I think it terrifies me.

I've tried talking to friends or looking at a few videos on youtube about it, but almost all of them tell me to ignore thinking about it, or that things being temporary makes it more meaningful (ok? that doesn't fucking help me at all lol). 

In a way, it's ruined my motivation to continue making music. Since I know that whatever project I'm working on will just be eventually erased forever anyways. It has changed my perspective in a somewhat positive light, where I would like to make music that other people and myself would enjoy, basically just to make life a little easier before dying.

I'm just gonna word vomit and use this as a place to vent. If anyone is going through anything similar, please feel free to offer advice.

22F, lived with my grandma (I call her mom, bio mom wasn't around til age 14) my entire life. I was a savant as a child, getting straight A's without trying. Success, academically, came easily through elementary school.

Grew up on welfare, grateful that my mom was caring enough to be able to budget, never went to school in dirty clothing, but missed out on a lot of experiences my peers had. No taking family trips, getting to join dance or band. 

Age 8, I start having pain in my ears when I sleep on my side. Get checked for infections, nothing comes of it, get put on 3800mg of gabapentin for suspected nerve pain at age 10. 

Age 10, gain 80 pounds within a year in middle school. I had one friend (love her to death, but it was lonely as a child). Still on gabapentin, traveling to doctors because the pain has worsened and is now constant. I cried every night.

My mom and I grow even closer because of how long and how tirelessly she's cared for me, she shares with me that her stepfather molested her from age 4 to 11, that her mom knew, and that nobody helped her.

Age 12ish, traveling to many hospitals, trying every pain medication under the sun, nothing helps. I think I was still on gabapentin. Probably around 170 pounds standing at 5'3"". No confidence. Don't go to school anymore. I'll never go to college, or work in the medical field like I'd always dreamt. I'm not straight, and don't know if my mom will accept me or beat me over it. She's a conservative, which I don't mind, but she's said terrible things.

Age 14, diagnosed with **trigeminal neuralgia** while staying at the Ronald McDonald House and being seen at the Cleveland Clinic. **It's something very, very rarely seen on MRIs, so the diagnosis is usually made through asking the patient about their symptoms.** Finding a neurosurgeon and planning a move to California to see him.

Age 15, everything has been a blur. I don't remember much from 10 til now. I have to have two separate surgeries because my pain is on both sides. Going in for surgery. I don't remember anything about the consent process other than sitting in an office while Dr. L spoke at me. I nodded along, whatever will make the pain leave.

First one is done, pain is reduced but I now have terrible, debilitating headaches and blood pressure problems. I remember vomiting from the morphine and it felt like my head was splitting open. Why couldn't I just not get the surgeries? Why am I doing this again next year? Why did this have to happen to me?

Age 16, second surgery is done. I don't really remember it. It didn't help much. Why did I do this again? 

Age 17, living with mom in California, I start smoking weed and it helps with the pain a good bit. Mom and I have been fighting a lot, differing opinions on stuff. 

Age 18, meet my boyfriend, it's love at first sight, as corny as it sounds. Get into fight with mom, move in with him, miss my mom, repair our relationship, find out she has Borderline Personality Disorder, suddenly understand our fights and how to communicate MUCH better. 

As a teenager and young adult she drank heavily, had anorexia, took speed, got into many physically abusive relationships. All because of the trauma.

She tells me about the time her stepfather took her along with her 7 siblings out to the woods in the car one night, took her out and walked with her, pulled a gun, hesitated, walked her back to the car and drove back home. She was 5 if I remember correctly.

Once I leave home and the pandemic hits, she starts drinking again after 24 years sober. I've never seen her this way. It's heart-rending, having her call me, slurring her words, crying and begging me to be with her so she isn't alone. I cry every night because I'm not with her. I'm currently visiting her and as I sit here and type this, I'm crying about it.

**Dr. L did surgery on non-verbal autistic children.** Trigeminal neuralgia is diagnosed through discussion with the patient. It's caused by nerves being compressed by blood vessels, and the sheath protecting the nerve not being strong enough. It cannot be definitively diagnosed through scans. He comes under ethics investigation by the board of neurology at the hospital he's at. This man was in my head.

This man was in my head. He rooted around, couldn't even tell me the quantity of Teflon pads he shoved into my open cranium. I do not know what I have going on in my head. What if I die at age 30 from a migrated Teflon pad? What if I never get to make my mom happy, give her a single day to not live in fear? What if I never had the surgeries? Why am I so stupid? Why am I so fucking stupid? Why? I want my mom to be sober but I can't even blame her for drinking. I wouldn't want to be conscious if I went through what she did. I don't want to be alive anymore. What's gonna happen when she dies? I'm so scared",1677660950.0

This has made me a pretty suspicious person and I trust very few people. To be honest, I feel like the only way to not be seen as incompetent is just to avoid speaking to people as much I can.

Only, when I'm experiencing my worst periods of depression, I tend to get paranoid to extreme degree and after these episodes end I can clearly see that I was blowing things way out of proportion. Like I've suspected people I know were doing everything out of spite for me personally, to make me suffer as much as possible. (Including my therapist and my own family, for ex. I once suspected my brother was somehow tracking everything I did online to spy on me) Sometimes it makes me wonder if I can ever trust my own judgement of other people again, which I think makes me even more avoidant than I otherwise would be.

I'm in my 30's now and have so many things I'm proud of. For a while, it felt like I had reduced my depression and minimized my hypomanic episodes to what I can describe as a cold. Just felt a bit slower but it passed quick and I took a lot of pride in that. I worked hard towards my job but took more pride in weightlifting, played guitar for 12 years, read, worked on my motorcycle, drew. I ate well, walked 10k steps a day and worked so hard on my social anxiety that people now think I'm extroverted and I can talk to anyone. It's easy for me to make friends now and I'm blessed to say I have so many people I love and who love me and a family I'm close with who support me all the way.

It's been a slow creep, but it feels like I'm in this unending cycle of trying and failing. I don't find pleasure in any of that anymore. I live the same day every day. I've been work from home since 2020 and all of the parts I loved have been removed since announcing our layoffs taking place in 2024. No career advancement, no leadership no projects accepted nothing. I play video games or hop on tiktok most of my shift. I started on my master's, I wanted to get into tech because I wanted a hard skill and have been trying to get into my dream career of data analysis to escape this place.. I've applied to over 50 positions and have been coding since last year and only 1 got back to me for a follow up. (over 35 didn't even let me know I wasn't accepted). I was offered a temp position that would have started my career; my job told me I would decline it or they would decline it for me. After 5 years, the 1 job that even got offered I was forced to turn down. I keep putting off class because I don't know how this will even get me through an HR bot without having any prior experience (even for ""entry level' saying 2+ years). 

After a manic breakdown, I'm 10k in debt from gambling on crypto, GME (lol), buying parts for my motorcycle working for 12+ hours a day because ""something was wrong with it"", but it really wasn't. I was just hyperfocused and obsessed with every small detail.

I finally got back on tinder after 2 years since a breakup because everyone I met I was interested in gave the same ""you're one of the best people I know, you'll find someone eventually!"" After I finally matched with someone after two months I liked and she liked me, it was only a month before I got the exact same thing. Now, nothing. 

I have no motivation or interest in anything, just numb playing the same video games all day. I know at 30 knowing what I know most people just give the ""there's no point to wallow in pity, just do X"" but what do you do when you've done everything right? When you believe you're actually a great person, hardworking and passionate, but what actually happens is the complete opposite? I continued to push for so long and take steps to better my life but I live groundhog day every day now for 3 years. I feel like an idiot, doing what I know will better my life with nothing changing because I get the same cold response with each application, each attempt at dating, each song I write with no one joining the band.

The only time I'm really happy is hanging out with friends, but more and more I seem to be withdrawing. I've talked to them all and they're very supportive, but even though they keep me in check, the thought grows louder and louder that there's something wrong with me. I know it's not true, but every night it's harder and harder to convince myself of that. I'm still medicated and that's probably why I haven't fully spiraled down, but we've tried readjusting and the bottom line is that it seems like with all of these steps all of these years this day just keeps repeating. Eventually, it's hard to live on hope when the same thing happens despite you doing everything right.

I don't want this to discourage anyone from trying; for many years every little step I took minimized my depression for so long and still my life is vastly superior from the experience of the scared 20 year old in the psych ward. But this isn't going away, and it's better to vent now, do little things that make my life better and just try to crawl out. Just feels like quicksand, the further I claw the further I sink with life seemingly disagreeing with what I believed for so long in myself.",1677609889.0

new struggle,1,11exb23,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11exb23/new_struggle/,0,"So I recently got diagnosed with depression and its taking a toll on my life. I knew i was depressed before I was diagnosed but hearing a medical professional tell me I'm, feels weird. 

Something that has happened recently which is the new struggle is that I'm finally able to keep up with school work but now I'm drifting away from my friends. Atleast, I feel lost and disassociated from them. When I hamg out with them, I don't have fun. I also think I don't get the same attention from them that I used to before. Now I think this is a part of me that is struggling. 

For example,

1. I feel like they don't think I'm as funny. I used to think I was hilarious but recently they don't laugh at my jokes. 
2. Our friendship is the type where we pull each other's leg or make fun of each other but when I do it, they all just stare at me. 

There are many other incidents like these that I'm not sure about. 

Somethings that they do,

1. Bought me icecream cuz I asked them to
2. Called me over for coffee

I prefer to stay in my room with closed down blinds. I do not know but it calms me down. When I feel sad in the middle of the day, I want to do nothing, be with no one, be no one. I do not recognise myself anymore or my family. Day in-day out everything is like repeating tape - the screen is black, the joy has been sucked out.

I try to meditate, get sufficient amount of air and sun (taking daily walks) and reading about psychology or self help books. Tho reading in itself causes me problems because I can't really concentrate for long. At home I feel kind of useless. We have a farm at home and psychical work in particular exhausts me and makes me feel useless. I feel jealous of my family when I see them laughing or making jokes. I feel like a failure when I see that my brother has normal friendships, can keep a job and works out everyday without problem (I find it hard to workout every single day because I always feel exhausted for no reason). I watch movies or my favorite TV shows but it feels its more for killing time than personal enjoyment. I find it hard to connect with anymore and it feels like there's a glass wall between and the person I'm trying to reach. I sleep enough (8-9h), yet im constantly tired.

(35 Male) So after over 5 years of not working due to anxiety and panic attacks I finally was forced more or less to get back out there and start working. I chose Housekeeping at a local Casino, a place filled with loud noises and lots of people, the exact environment I typically have issues with. I got on 3rd shift from midnight till 8 am and it had many perks that I personally enjoyed and feel the need to point out: they did not drug test for marijuana, something I am a daily user of. I also am on an antidepressant and was on a prescribed controlled narcotic at the time of hiring, we'll get to that in a minute.

2 weeks into doing the simple job of emptying ashtrays, cleaning up bathrooms and wiping down slot machines, I walked into my supervisors office and handed in my badge, saying I couldn't do it, the noise was to much, the people too many; an excuse I had convinced myself to be more true than it really was. Hours later I'm at my parents house and I'm just so ashamed of what I've done, given up so easily. My phone rings, its my job! Its my big boss, and they want to know what happened and if I'd be willing to come back. Absolutely I would I'm so stupid for quitting I'll be there tomorrow. A discussion was made of transferring me to a day shift schedule where the patrons where older and less drunk, and less busy overall.

A month goes by. I keep asking about the transfer to 1st shift. I keep getting vague answers. I hand in my badge on my lunch break and go home. Again, my big boss, calls me and says wtf, you are going to day shift in 2 weeks! Again in the 3-4 hours since I quit, I was relieved to be given yet another chance to redeem myself. I gutted out the 2 weeks, I got transferred to day shift, and...it was great! I actually did much better in the day environment. But I also wanted to escape from Housekeeping, as the high school drama was what led to me accumulating 6 absence points (12 allowed) in a 3 month period. Around this time I was informed my Doctor was no longer prescribing any narcotics and I had to go cold turkey off my Chlonazepam.

I put in for transfer to Count Room Attendant, dealing with millions of dollars on the daily. And because I had the reputation of being a damn good worker by anyone you asked, I was allowed to transfer despite my very rocky start with the company. The fact I still had a job at this point and only 6 discipline points out of 12 after quitting 2 times is astounding and not lost on me. My first day of doing count room I am extremely nervous, but everyone says I learned quick, I was a star in the making, and I was gonna do great. I left that 1st day feeling on cloud nine. Oh and I only worked 4 hours but got paid for 8. Dream job material.

My 2nd day...I called in. Actually I didn't call in I no called. Why? I convinced myself I was going to screw things up in my new position, everyone hyped it up as a super stressful job and I fed into it even though I actually was rather stress free dealing with the money. I enjoyed being locked in a room away from the noise and patrons. My new boss called me, asking what happened. I had such a great first day and such great feedback, did I just forget that I was scheduled? And I told her what happened. And for a THIRD time now in a 4 month period, this place let me come back after basically quitting and continue my job the next day. I was now at 10.5 points out of 12. My points will not fall off until early December at the earliest. At this rate, I'm not going to last. This is what I convince myself.

I work the job for 6-7 days. I love every minute of it, I found my dream job but I have this nagging anxiety of being 1 point away from termination. Friday I woke up with a headache, fever, vomiting, and I texted my boss that I was sick and not going to be in. This was the first day out of my 10.5 points that I was calling because I was truly sick. And this set me to 11.5 points because I didn't call in 2 hours before my shift, even though I went to bed feeling fine and didn't know I was sick until my alarm 1 hour before work (my fault, not placing blame). I spent all day Friday sleeping and taking medication. I was supposed to inform my boss if I would be in the next day even though I had talked to her on the phone that day and told her I felt a flu coming on. I overslept and by the time I had awoken I had a voicemail and text informing me of my termination.

Now, Tuesday Morning, I sit here and obviously I look at the chances I was given, multiple, and how I still let it all slip away. I keep trying to find ways to blame the job, that they didn't cater to this need or they didn't understand this aspect of my mental health. I'm trying to focus on the positive things that I accomplished like, no matter the ups and downs during the journey, I held a job for over 4 months for the first time in 5 years.

My next job will not be as forgiving of my issues. My next job will not be ok with me smoking pot. I genuinely loved the Casino job, but the over-analyst in me feels how could I have truly loved it so much if I was willing to continuously throw it away and sabotage it.

 Now I'm stuck in this rut where I have to get another job, and I don't know how to stop self-sabotaging myself when I do. I know a lot of people call off because they hate their job but I had myself convinced I loved mine, yet it lasted 4 months by my own habits.",1677568130.0

Yes, I'm bad academically and I can't seem to sit down and work. I procrastinate and I love to sleep. 
I got diagnosed yesterday.. 
A close family member has forbidded me from taking the meds. He is someone who I really respect and someone who I know has my best interest in mind. 
He told me that there's nothing wrong with me. I'm anxious about my future so according to him I just gotta keep working hard consistently. When the results start to show, the anxiety and depression will go away.

Idk,1,11evyku,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11evyku/idk/,0,"I’ve been struggling, like everyone else, I know. But journaling it over and over again only does so much, and so I figured, why not write it here too? 
I grew up between my divorced parents, one sane and one insane, and being a young young kid I was manipulated by my dad into staying with him, since he was all alone and I felt bad for him. Im now 24, and I still live with him. Yikes! He raised me to live in constant fear, to see every risk as impossibly dangerous, and more then anything taught me that I was an inconvienance to him, that I’m never doing enough, and that I’m not by any means to be trusted. I know that’s not right. But the scars remain, y’know? My mom was far away, busy with work and her other kids, and not wanting anyone to inconvenience anyone I often lied about how I feel. I still do that, it’s like this impulse that I just can’t shake, though I will say that I have been able to actually talk about how I feel now, I mean, look at this post! I would’ve never done this a year or two ago. Anyways, my strategy for survival changed as I grew up. First I fought back, I kicked and screamed, called my dad a monster, and got punished for it. Then I realized that if I acted like it didn’t bother me, maybe he wouldn’t pick on me so much? That mindset quickly slid into disassociation, and so my childhood and adolescence just passed me right by. I felt like I learned nothing. I wasn’t taught any life skills, my dad never took the slightest interest in me and my mom, while supportive, was distant, and I didn’t want to be vulnerable really anyways, as I was so insecure that I was afraid that someone would deliver me a blow while my guard was down that I couldn’t recover from. So I remained that way, distant from everyone, until I met a girl, through a friend, at 19. We were in a relationship for three years. I found her really physically attractive, she was funny and she laughed at my jokes, and she was down to just cuddle and eat and play video games. It was the affection i was craving, the hugs I was denied as a kid, though like most things it wasn’t perfect. On an emotional level we clashed, often. It was a classic avoidant-anxious combo. I was distant, didn’t really  know how to be that romantic and didn’t really know how to start, and that stressed her out. I don’t blame her! Though when I tried to explain how I felt she never understood and instead berated me, accused me even of being unfaithful, and so we fought. Eventually I couldn’t take the conflict anymore and I broke it off, then she begged for me to give her time so that we could go to couples therapy and sort things out, which I agreed to. What I didn’t know however was her sleeping with a guy and sexting another guy 7 days after we initially broke up.(while we were still working on things!) I also found out that during our relationship she was on numerous occasions texting other guys, and also told me that she slept with him several times and that his dick was bigger than mine. Three years down the drain… it’s hard to think about how much time I wasted, and of course my already shaky confidence was shattered. I really thought maybe I was worth something. 
Now I’m alone again, which makes me feel like I’m going crazy, as the comfort of being around people that I feel love and support me is gone.
Now I’m getting out of college. Everyone seems so different and strange, it feels impossible to make new friends. What’s worse, I thought, when I was little, that I would be a writer, and now I’m facing the criticisms of my professors and realizing that maybe I’m not so good at writing, and that this maybe won’t be a romanticized coming of age story after all. I’m just so tired of trying and getting hurt. I hope at some point, I can find some kind of peace.",1677650543.0

Can't Get My Husband to Understand Depression,4,11evee0,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11evee0/cant_get_my_husband_to_understand_depression/,1,"I've been trying to deal with my depression for years but have only recently taken it very seriously. I always thought it was something I would get over or would go away on its own...I never thought that I could ever be a person with depression, it always seemed like something that other people had and seemed awful and scary but I never related it to myself. But in recent years after talking to doctors and therapists and just really being honest with myself I realize now I've probably had moderate depression for most of my 20s up until now, if not even longer. 

The thing that is making everything feel even harder than it already is, is the fact that my boyfriend is the type of Uber logical minded person who can't fathom how depression works/ is even a thing. He thinks it's just weakness, weak mind, laziness, etc. I don't even mean this in a bad way, I genuinely don't believe he has the capacity to believe otherwise. I don't feel like he is TRYING to put me or depression down, it's just how his brain is wired. The way that I can't make sense how people can just do everyday things with little to no struggle is the same way he can't make sense of the opposite.

I literally cannot find the words to convey to him how depression has made me extremely forgetful lately. I constantly forget small things, like putting the keys back in their tray, or closing cupboard doors, and these happen so frequently that they build up and really frustrate him. And I keep telling him I'm not doing these things purposefully or to annoy him and I kick myself every time he has to remind me, yet again, that I've forgotten to do this or to to do that. I try to explain that I'm very forgetful lately with how heavy my depression has felt. But he thinks these are just basic things that I SHOULD be doing every day automatically, there should be no TRY.

I HATE that word...should. I GET that I'm an adult and SHOULD be able to do the basic everyday bullshit but the WHOLE point is that I can't. It feels like such an uphill battle to build a habit as simple as putting the keys away. I don't WANT to keep forgetting things or making him frustrated.

How do you explain depression to someone who has no concept of it? He thinks therapy is woo woo crap and just genuinely does not understand this even a little. And it's not that I feel he doesn't care about me, I feel that he's just that ignorant about it and I do not know how to convey depression to him in a way that makes sense to him. He's so logical that I guess this is so abstract he can't process it and put it into a tidy box that makes sense.

Dad - Duke university and UCLA business school, division 1 soccer, 

Sister - film major working in Hollywood 

Cousins - northwestern, Tulane, University of Chicago, Emory, 4.0 gpa’s varsity athletes, student honor awards, making 80k a year at 21 years old at the biggest bank in Chicago. 

Family friends - All UC’s no exceptions, varsity sports and division 1 athletes already working at some of the best law firms and music industries in the world

Me - 2.8 gpa failing 3 classes at one of the easiest community colleges in California, 21 years old and not even close to graduating, 100 pounds overweight, still living with parents, hyper adhd and attention deficit, never had a girlfriend, plays video games during their free time, binge eats to numb the pain, waitlisted at some of the easiest schools to get into, 5’6 male.

This makes me so depressed. I don’t know what to do. I have done absolutely nothing with my life and even though my parents don’t say it I know they are disappointed in me. I binge eat constantly every day to numb the pain which only helps temporarily but also makes things worse since I keep gaining weight. 

My life is nothing but an embarrassment. My parents spent so much money to get me help with my binge eating which I have been struggling with since age 11. Whenever I had negative emotions I would sneak as much food as humanely possible, and eat as much as humanly possible. My mom thinks it’s because I like to be a sneak no matter what. My parents are getting a divorce and I’m pretty sure I’m the reason. My sister hates my guts and wants nothing to do with me. Most of my friends do not want to associate with me anymore.

It’s so humiliating. My cousins make fun of me because my parents give me all of this fake praise and I laugh with them. My friends don’t invite me to anything anymore because they think I am a waste of space, I don’t have any other friends. 

I have been to 5 different high schools (no joke!) and the only way I was able to get peoples approval was to act dumb. I remember one day where I got stuck in a chair and everyone was laughing and recording me cause I was fat and couldn’t get out of the chair. I embraced this and became the class clown, and I stopped trying in high school. I’m convinced that my parents had to bribe someone so I could graduate. This is how my whole family and friends view me now. They all think I’m a complete retard.  It’s the only way I can get people to like me. Now I’m paying the price.

I was sent to a treatment facility for my binge eating  when I was 15-17. People there were raped and assaulted, molested their siblings, arrested, beat cops, did heroin, and I was sent their for binge eating. 

I have (and this is true), no actual achievements from any sport, academics, etc. All I did was waste my life binge eating and blocking out everyone as humanly possible.

I know I need to grow up and get a life, but I long for the days when I was happy with my friends family and cousins, not a worry in the world, we were just happy you know? Those days are gone and will never come back. Now I live in spite and hatred over all of the people I loved. I hate my cousins, I hate my sister, I hate my friends. 

There is a part of me that really wants to change my entire life and prove to everyone I’m not the dumbass they think I am. The other part of me wants to give up entirely and binge eat until I die. 

I don’t want to face the people I love anymore. I cannot stand the fact that I have brought shame to my family.

I have hit a really low point in my life at the minute, I am 18 years old and have no ambition or drive to do anything anymore. 

I am currently unemployed, had a job with my dad but he’s really toxic. Used to live with him but long story short I now live at my mums.

My life has become one huge mess, I am stuck between laying in bed or day or playing on my pc.

I feel useless and hopeless, I’ve started to use drugs more often such as Tramadol and Pregabalin.

I’m not feeling suicidal yet, I have thought about ODing acouple of times but I don’t think I could bring myself to do it as I’ve seen my mum do it twice. Luckily I was there so she survived but the memories still stay with me.

I don’t know what to do anymore and I’m starting to think my life doesn’t have any purpose anymore. 

My relationships are starting to take a toll to, even my closest friends are starting to become distant with me because of how I am at the moment.

I (40F) have clinical depression and anxiety stemming from some sexual abuse/assults I experienced as a child and teen. My kids (10F, 12M) know I have anxiety and depression. I obviously haven't told them the reasons behind my mental health struggles. But I have always made it a point to talk to them about my stuggles in an open and age appropriate manner. 

My daughter is very mature for her age (mentally and physically). Lately, she's been picking up on my fears and anxieties and mimicking them. She's beginning to allow fear to hinder and hold her back. I have already begun looking for a therapist for her to see. I intend to tell her the reason I worry the way I do is because some bad things happened to me when I was younger. How much I go into explaining those bad things will be determined by a plan I put together with her therapist. At this point, I'm just waiting until she has someone to help her process the information I give her. 

I'm worried that telling her about my experiences and struggles will cause her to be even more scared. I also have a history of self-harm. My kids have no idea about this, but once I tell them, they will most certainly connect the dots and realize that's what my scars are from. I dread this part especially because I don't want them to be mad at me or scared for me.

Any stories, advice, or information from people who've been here (either in my shoes or my daughter's) would be greatly appreciated.

Confused about mental health questionnaire questions they always ask for meds or before therapy appointment,1,11esbj1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11esbj1/confused_about_mental_health_questionnaire/,0,"I’m never sure how to answer the question about having thoughts of being better off dead or feeling like people would be better without you. 

I usually answer pretty low (1-2 on the on a scale of 1-5 or whatever questions)

I know that that is not true. I know that I would not be better off dead and I know that my family would be devastated. I also have no intention of killing myself  I truly don’t believe I could even if I wanted to. 

Despite knowing these thing and truly believe these thing and with certainty that I’m not gonna kill myself I still wish something would happen that would just kill me. I’m not gonna kill myself, I know people would be hurt and it would not be better for me  but I still want to die.

All I knew it was pure hell and my relatives' reaction often made things worse (ridicule, dismissal etc.)

I'm from a poor country and healthcare here sucks, especially mental health which automatically equals ""schizophrenic"", that's if you can't afford a private clinic, then it's kind of okay, still, there is no cure to life.

This traumatic event plus being abused physically by parents at an early age obviously did not lead to great outcomes, I didn't do well in school, which again made my life worse and my prospects for the future terrible. It's difficult to explain what it's like and I'm sure others have been through worse but it's just impossible to convey to others what it's like. I'm no longer a teenager and I don't think I'm angsty neither do I hold a grudge against anyone. I used to believe in God but witnessing the cruelty, indifference and prayers not being heard made me lost a lot of it. I don't know where I want to say really, it's rare for others to be able to actually empathize with you because if you're not going through something your brain just can't imagine what it's like, all of us included, and empathy costs energy.

I just want to get better, I'm sick of struggling and being permanently scared of the future and trying to block the past from memory, not being food/finance-secure and of all the hoops that society puts you through in order to just have a normal life. It all just says ""you're not welcome and we don't give a f*** whether you're dead or alive"", it's the 21st century and human life is really worthless, like your needs essential needs are adhoc, despite being as a species extremely advanced and having achieved great milestones.

What do I do? I just need a little break from it all, I'm sick of putting on a happy face and taking the bullshit, I can't find a job despite having a degree, which means I can't look after myself and I can't get better but who cares? My existence is objectively irrelevant.

If I have the means I would help as many people as I can who have been in that dark hopeless place and prove that life isn't meaningless suffering, but I can't, so tough luck.

I had to stop her from killing herself in front of me since I was 3 years old. I had to hide the knives we had to keep her from slitting her wrists. Never had a father. 

At around 16, my aunt took me in and provided me with everything I never had. This positive influence catapulted me into great things: at 19 I moved to the USA to work as a camp counselor, worked for two years. Traveling the US, I ended up meeting a really good friend who invited to move in with him. He happened to work at American Airlines and listed me as his beneficiary, so I got to fly for free with AA. I got to see 10 countries, 30+ states. As a huge music fan, I’ve seen every single band I ever loved in concert and met them in person, multiple times. I had unbelievable concert experiences and extreme luck, living things that were never a remote possibility for my younger self, even becoming friends with band members that I once had posters of hanging on my wall back home.

But I was very lonely in the US and that took a toll on me. I stopped leaving the house. Since I worked from home, I never had to. I would go 10 days without breathing fresh air. I stopped wanting to travel. I realized this was not going to end well and moved back to Brazil, since all my friends and family were there.

As I moved back, I started getting severely depressed, I had seen everything I wanted to see. I had done everything I never even thought I would be able to do one day. How would life move forward? I had nothing else to look forward to. My aunt realized I was doing bad and suggested I go to a doctor. I was put on antidepressants for a whole year. Maybe more.  I got MUCH better and was released from the treatment. During the pandemic, I started a relationship, which although troubled in the beginning (and middle) (and now), still stands. We have jealousy and insecurity problems from her end, which have limited much of what I’m “allowed” to do, but after many arguments, she has been better and more allowing of me doing stuff on my own. I truly love her and believe we can work this out, although I do feel like I’m “missing out on being single” but also can’t be with her. 

Throughout the pandemic, my career took a turn. I started making MUCH more money all of a sudden. Like, A LOT. I have my own company and work for another part-time. I can now pay for everything I want, do anything I want. I have a lot of money invested and great perspectives to keep earning more and more. But I still work from home. I still don’t leave the house much. Most days I can’t even walk my dog, whom I love with all my life. My aunt and grandma, the only real family I have, have moved to the countryside and we don’t get to see each other often anymore. I pretty much only interact with my girlfriend when she comes over on the weekends and we go to the best restaurants and chill at home. Funnily enough, she also works for AA and I get to fly for free under her benefits. We have taken great trips together and have many more lined up. 

All of this being said, I truly feel ungrateful and a horrible person for having all this incredible stuff going on for me and still feeling pretty miserable. I’ve been in therapy for as long as I can remember but recently stopped because I felt like I had nothing else to talk about. Tried two other therapists recently but it didn’t feel right, so I stopped again. I tried to start working out and stopped soon after. I’ve gained weight and have cholesterol problems now.
I eat terribly, can’t get around to do any house chores, I just pay people to do it for me. I barely leave the house or interact with other human beings. There’s so much I could detail here but it all comes down to: so many people would KILL to have the life I have, and I still can’t fully appreciate it and have been miserable. I struggle with aging and feeling that the best is past me. That I’ll never be able to be young and reckless again. That now it’s downhill from now on. 
I just wanted to have more energy to do more, to go out more, to interact more. 

To anyone who read this, thank you so much and I really appreciate any input.

I didn’t think too much about it and thought I probably pulled a muscle at the gym. The pain got worse and worse overtime and started interfering with sleep. I was getting 3 hours of sleep due to the excruciating pain. So decided to go to the doctor.

He ordered several bloods tests and the results shook him and me. He told me he suspects blood cancer. That news put me in severe depression. As a 24 year old, I lost all the motivation I had for my dreams and aspirations overnight. was all alone during lockdown and decided not to give the news to my family just to avoid them from worrying about it. I thought let me first confirm if the diagnosis is accurate.

Over 4 months, the results came back normal and the possibility of blood cancer was dismissed. However by now, I developed chronic sleep problems. I could never sleep for longer than 3 hours. I spent my day with extreme headache, foggy brain and occasional fever. My cognitive levels went down to that of a 5 year old and my work at grad school was getting compromised. 

I decided to extend my graduation since I couldn’t handle it anymore. For the next 2 years, I tried several antidepressants, gabapentin, Hydroxyzine and nothing worked. By this time, my memory was nothing but mush, my motivation had died, and I could see all my friends getting jobs, getting married and having children. At the same time, I have lost my own self respect because I lost my scholarship and am once again dependent on my dad financially at 26. 

Even though he has never stopped supporting me, I can sense the worry he has for me. I hate making him feel this way. Deep down I know it’s really bothering him and given that he already has hypertension I really want to take the load away from him. I’m so glad my mother is there to take care of him. 

Anyway, I was finally prescribed clonazepam yesterday. I took 1 mg and oh god what can I say. I feel like a baby again. No more headaches or anxiety. My brain fog is still there but hopefully the exercises and meditation will solve that completely.

I am aware of all the risks benzos possess. However, I only wish some doctors weren’t this strict about it for the fear of destroying a person’s life. Well guess what, not prescribing sooner destroyed 3 years of my life. I hope more people understand the benefits of benzos and not suspect every patient to be someone who’s only  seeking drugs to abuse them.

Anyway, I only hope the worst is behind me and I can now focus on making up for my lost time.

when therapy fails,1,11epmpf,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11epmpf/when_therapy_fails/,1,"i've been struggling with a recurring bout of depression for a while, and finally after five months of my partner convincing me, i've started seeing a therapist. i think we've met four times now, virtually. i'm the type that's gone through about 9 therapists in my life, and i've only really connected with one therapist, ever. 

getting therapy & starting medication was supposed to be it: the thing that made things just a little better. & yet i only ever come to this subreddit at my absolute lowest & hello here i am. 

i don't like my therapist, but not in the way that i hate him. i feel like sessions are unproductive. he checked in on how i felt sessions were going this week, and i kind of told him how i felt, but i'm not sure he got the message, which is another problem. i feel judged by him at times, too. my session with this therapist triggered my depression today––i felt fine, even great beforehand, but when the session ended i was still crying, and didn't get the resolution therapists usually give in that situation. 

i also saw another therapist recently, and i couldn't stand him. i carefully picked the therapist i'm seeing now because i'm so picky with therapists. now that it's not working out i feel hopeless. 

additionally, i'm in college, i'm theater major with no friends. how is a theater major incapable of making friends? my diagnosis affects my relationship so bad that i'm often asking if i even love my partner, and sometimes i don't feel love for him and all i want is for him to leave me alone. 

i also recently learned that avoidance is a symptom of ptsd, and survivors of trauma will avoid therapy––which has been how i operate for a while now. realizing this, i feel helpless in trying to find a trauma therapist because i dont want to talk about my trauma, and i certainly dont want to talk about it alone in my apartment in a virtual setting. 

i feel like after this long journey to starting therapy, going through 2 therapists & 2 medications in a month, my life isn't worth the effort to maintain.",1677632282.0

I saw the whole movie and was prepared to cry for the scene where the psychologist says ""its not your fault"". When the scene came, I tried to cry. But I forgot I took my 100mg Sertraline 😁👍🏻

I just want off this medication and be better. But I really cant, I want to feel something on my own instead of anxiously high and low moments to my day to day life. Instead, I sit in a room pretending to be Will Hunting and some psychologist and me have that breakthrough that I'm lonely and I have tall walls around me and I don't really feel anything in life. 

I have a very bad memory, so some days i forget to take my daily supplement of zoloft. And of those days its the most I feel alive and anxious at the same time, but I actually feel something from a song or a person or even on my own, I just want that. I know how, I know how to get to the point of not being depressed and so anxious. But most of the time I sit or stand being anxious and do nothing, its the harsh truth about the healing process as i call it. I even gained maybe 1.5 pounds or maybe 3kg to just be comfortable with my weight and myself. I do everything to make myself comfortable throughout the day, and even so, i feel anxious and sad. I wish there was a robot i could hire to just hug me and say nice things to me when im anxious. I have these fantasies sometimes in my class that either the teacher or a student will say something like ""are you okay"" or ""do you need help"" and I just start crying in the fantasy of course lol.",1677632271.0

I’ve asked to be apart of their day group and peer support programs, but was told that they are not available. Asked for a change in medication, they’ve neglected to help me with that. I’m pretty much at a standstill. I’m losing hope everyday. I am extremely lonely and I don’t have any friends, no relationship. Never had one. I feel like nobody cares. Can’t even go outside because everywhere I go, I see happy couples and groups of people laughing, and having a good ole time. It’s just a reminder that I’m completely alone. And before you say, “Go out and meet new people.” I’ve been there and done that countless of times, even went as far as exchanging phone numbers, and after the initial meet-up and conversations, I get completely ghosted, no response from texts, nothing. So, I’ve completely given up on trying. I just stay home and avoid people all together, as I feel like that’s what everyone wants. The only way I feel like I’ll ever escape from this pain, is to end my life, and quite frankly, I’d be doing the world a huge favor as I offer nothing to this world.

I can’t stand for long while doing something, even as simple as showering or doing the dishes. I feel faint. Ofc everyone just says it’s because im fat. So I stopped complaining. 

The break up was super easy for me. Probably because I constantly dissociate and could barely even remember him while we were dating. I mean we only saw eachother one every one or two weeks. Those were the only times I remembered why I was dating this specific guy in the first place.

My meds stopped working. I tried so many different ones all over again. Now I’m 26 with no insurance because I’m too much of a disaster to leave the house.

I wasn't super energetic before - I'm depressed, have insomnia, and some physical issues that have existed for a while, but this is just different. For a little while I was able to consider things as likely being short term which, in a lot of ways, made shit easier to deal with. 

It's like I am suddenly hyper aware of this idea that the things I need to do every day, especially in terms of work, are things that I'll be doing over and over for 25 more years (as in work...not that I think I'll be dead in 25 years). It's almost like I am somehow experiencing those 25 years of work in a day if that makes any sense. When I am preparing to see a patient, it feels like I cannot stop about how this is something that I will do over, and over, and over again. It makes me want to just lay down on the spot and not move. It's a tiredness that feels like it drills down to the core..

I also realize that part of it is just the fact I keep having panic attacks and have been fixating on the damage I've caused by not managing my mental health. That can be exhausting on its own, but I cannot ever say that I have felt tired like this before in my life. I guess it's good that I am not walking around feeling like I won't have to do certain things for much longer, so I really shouldn't complain about it; it's just such a strange feeling.

Stuff that I should do that mentally I know only takes a few minutes and is not that hard to do mentally feels like it takes hours and is some of the most laborous work I could do.

I'm afraid my mental health may be permanently destroyed after what i went through.,1,11elywy,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11elywy/im_afraid_my_mental_health_may_be_permanently/,0,"I, 26, Male with Aspeger Syndrome, suffering from depression and anxiety disorders, currently after a breakup with 4th boyfriend and finding my mental health unrepairable.

Aside from being bullied in school, I was raised in a toxic, sometimes violent household and some of the bad, violent situations were carved in my memory so deep i still remember some of them in perfect clarity. For example, my mom pulling my hair and then yelling at me because of the open window as I screamed in pain, or my father waking me up at 3 a.m. for small reason like trash and I yelled at him for that. Soon they crossed the line by beating each other up in front of my ill with alzheimer granny as mom caused the drama over the neighbor. I couldn't stand it, so I ran away to my first ex (29 yrs old) to another city for 2 weeks.

They were acting normal for a month after I returned, but started acting up again, so I moved out to my ex where I started over, got myself studies, which I failed mainly because of toxic group leader and not so nice professors, so I got myself another studies. For a year everything was relatively alright, aside from my ex's mother accusing me of being fake and taking a financial advantage of him. When I was about to start 2nd year of my studies, I had to move out from my ex's apartment into the dormitory over his mother's fury and my ex dumping me for someone else.

I spent a week at my family home, crying and organizing things I took from his house, where I found out, who my ex dumped me for - an 11-year-old from the Internet, so I took the screenshots from the computer i once borrowed him and reported him to the police. Also, I had to deal with him to get our mobile contract off my chest and this is when I got a contact to this kid's mother. I threatened my ex to contact her if he didn't sign it off me, because I wanted nothing to do with him. After he signed it off me and we split up, I called that woman anyway and told her everything and she was shocked. I was interrogated by criminal police for 3 times and yelled at by them for 2 hours straight by the last time, I ended up crying when I left the police station with one of the friends I met in dormitory.

After moving into the dorm, I was crying myself to sleep for first month or two, struggling to adapt to the new situation. By the end of that academic year, I met my 2nd ex, who was my first normal ex. He was autistic like me, but it lasted for 4-5 months and I broke up with him over pretending to be someone he wasn't at all. I tried to have a friendship with him, but he was hoping for me to return to him, so I ghosted him to stop his suffering. Not gonna lie, I miss him a little bit.

Months later I met my 3rd ex, who lived in a city 5 hours away from my dorm, so it was me going to his place because of pandemic restrictions. My Discord buddy, who seemed to know him, alarmed me about this guy, then my friends, mother and psychologist, but I refused to listen and now I regret it. First, he told me he's going to invite his friend (who turned out to be his friend with benefits, who loved him herself) for a New Year's Eve, I made it clear to him that I don't approve that, knowing that he didn't tell her about me at all.

Then month later he confessed that he cheated on me with her that night. I don't know how did I ever forgive him. That was stupid and naive as hell. He just kept hurting me, mostly after drinking. He was stonewalling and gaslighting me for 5 months straight and I let it happen until once I took a break from him. This has let me realize, that I like it more without him, so we talked and I almost forgave him, when he stonewalled me for the last time. I told him, that I don't want to see him ever again and ghosted him entirely, but he kept appearing online in the places where I was and posted his femboy photos in there, not letting me forget about him for long. I left many places at that time, but once I grew sick and tired of it, I texted the admin about the situation and he was banned out of there. I have a bachelor degree from my studies, so i think i came out victorious out of this one.

I recently was in my 4th relationship with someone normal, living with him, but struggling with all the traumas my exes left me with as well as lack of honest communication has ruined everything. I treated the subject of my boyfriend's exes like my enemies, having trust issues and memory issues, my somatics skyrocketing every time we had a conflict or he made some sudden changes to our plans. I loved him, I trusted him the best i could. I think that timing wasn't right, because i didn't expect things to develop so fast and didn't make it to get over previous ex completely. Recently, we had an arguement, i left, then came back to see him packing up. I convinced him to stay, but next day, when away from home, he texted me almost everything, that was a problem for him. He admited not being happy with me from some time, even forcing himself to have sex with me, which was explaining his self-harm behaviors. After he returned, i begged him to stay, crying and kneeling before him. He resisted the best he could. He admited, that i'm not enough for him and he doesn't want to fix it. When we hugged for the last time, we both cried, then he took his important things and left. I had to quit the job i just found and where my boss liked me. My mother got me out of there the same night and i texted him, that i left. He replied, that he wasn't telling me many things, because he didn't want to hurt me and had no idea, why he couldn't afford being honest with me. My friends texted me that it is not my fault, but his. I guess they might be right, but still i feel bad about myself with not trying my best, being so absorbed by my traumas. I also feel bad about him giving up that easily and not giving me time to fix things. He was harming himself because of me and slapping himself in the face to stop himself from crying, like he wasn't allowing himself to have feelings, needs and moments of weakness, pretending to be strong for his ill mother. He even suggested me to stay at his place until i find something else and be friends with me, but i didn't fall for it, because i didn't want to make myself any hopes for reunion.

Until today i can't deal with the mess my room looks like after taking all my stuff. I guess my depression is now deeper than it was ever before. My emotions are mixed - one moment i am angry and holding grudges, the next one i miss my ex and crying, screaming my despair out, the next moment i feel nothingness. In my eyes everyone is a monster. I doubt, that i will ever be able to set my life up with someone else, especially now, when i am stuck in my family home, away from the city and even more far away from my friends. I'm starting to think, that i may never recover from my losses and move on fully. My soul is crushed, heart shattered and i barely have any local friends here to hang out with. I feel like a wreck of a human after all that happened. I'm suffering very much, but at least my psychologist and friends are reaching out to me online. Eventually i will recover, but i know i will not be the same person anymore.",1677623109.0

How to be a good support system.,1,11elttu,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11elttu/how_to_be_a_good_support_system/,0,"hello to whoever is reading this,

I would like to start by saying that I do not mean to sound condescending at all, and that I only aim to learn more about the condition in hopes of being a better friend.
I discovered this subreddit yesterday and couldn't help but read endless posts from so many of you and your lived experiences.

Some posts that stood out come from the top posts of all time, many of which cite being a productive depressed person. I happen to know individuals that fit many of the descriptions, many of those people are very close to me and I care about them a lot. However, I feel like I am not usually the best when it comes to those friends reaching out to me. I feel like I always say the wrong things like ""it will be better, look at how you were 1 month ago and it was going so well"" or ""but you've been doing so well at work/school"" but after reading your posts I see that is probably not too helpful at all. I've even had friends tell me that ""sometimes it's okay to say that everything is shitty or not going well."" 

I think I just have a difficult time conceptualizing how it feels to be a functioning depressed person, and as I said earlier, I want to know how I can be of the best/effective support to my friends. 

Any and all insight is welcomed, thank you for reading.",1677622768.0

The cost of living goes up but the pay stays the same yet I'm expected to just roll with the punches. It hurts when I think that I'm giving up most of my time, getting virtually no time of my own and I'm *encouraged* to just shackle myself and get to work. I feel like I'm being *encouraged* to give up on my dreams because they aren't profitable or realistic but then at the same time I'm *supposed* to follow up on them. 

It's like I'm being told not to give up dreaming but also don't follow through with it. As if the act of the chase is the important thing to make sure the work horse doesn't kill itself. So the cog doesn't pop out of it's socket.

Every day it gets worse and I feel like I should've started sooner, I'm 24 and I feel like I wasn't proactive enough and I didn't try hard enough and now all I've succeeded in doing is backing myself into a corner and it's over.

It's become a common thought for me that I won't make it past 30 and for awhile I thought how overly dramatic it all was.

I have no motivation to move forward or do anything further with my life anymore,8,11ektli,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11ektli/i_have_no_motivation_to_move_forward_or_do/,3,"This is obviously a throwaway.  I don’t have anything good in my life anymore.  My parents pay for my expenses, which are no more than food and insurance.  I literally own nothing to my name.  My entire life is a complete joke.  I don’t know how to break this cycle.  I don’t even know how it started.  I just wish I could do something more.

When I was in high school I had a lot of ambition to do something good with my life.  I used to think about being an actor, or screenwriter.  I remember joining a video club in high school, but the problem was, I knew nothing about video.  That’s why I joined this club.  The people in this club were already good at video production, sound editing, all that jazz.  No worries, if anything I thought this was good.  That means I could learn.  Turns out I’m a slow learner.  I tried to operate some equipment one day and accidentally deleted something important to another student.  This student was obviously livid and asked the teacher to kick me out of the club.  The club advisor agreed and I was no longer welcome.  I also learned he was the only teacher in my school doing video production classes.  Knowing this, I couldn’t join anything in school anymore.  I was always the type to get unmotivated when I fail.  And this didn’t help.  I had nobody to talk to about this because my parents never supported this idea in the first place.  I stopped trying.  

I went to college for computer science and failed miserably since I hated it and every aspect of it.  I tried business administration and also failed horribly.  After 2 years of wasting money I just gave up.  I mean why spend another dollar in college if I can’t earn a single credit?  After this I started working at UPS as a package sorter.  I kept at this job and kept looking for other opportunities.  I got a job as a PA for a movie but the only reason is because I was friends w the director.  He now knows that I am pretty much good for nothing in the workplace and hasn’t offered me any other positions for any other work since.  I wanted to get good at something.  I can’t learn.  And now all I do is sit at home and waste my time playing video games.  And the saddest damn thing about it is the fact that I’m not even good at that.  I’m miserable at everything I do.  I can’t even relax right. 

Now I might just be stupid but I was never good at anything.  I have no impressive cognitive skills, and lack the comprehension to get better at virtually anything.  I can barely put a cohesive sentence together without thinking I sound stupid.  I can’t even explain how little I think of myself.  I’m 5’7, so I’m a tiny ass man, I don’t even have looks going for me.  I’m unfit, I can’t run a kilometer without panting.  Im a college dropout.  I have no job.  I have no money. I’m addicted to vape pens and weed.  I eat barely a meal a day.  I don’t do any exercise anymore.  I’ve stopped every single even SLIGHTLY productive activity that I have ever done.  I genuinely think I’m the only loser on the planet that is truly this pathetic.  Hell, I almost closed this app cuz I felt too lazy to finish this post.  I don’t even have motivation to clean myself, take care of myself in any way shape or form, and my family is super nice to me, I don’t deserve it.  I’ve made my father miserable.  I’ve made my mother depressed.  Their apple of their eye and golden child is my younger sister now.  She will do amazing things I can guarantee it.  But me?  I’ll rot in my room and die slow and painfully at a very young age.  I can see the light.  I just want it all to end.  There’s nothing I want more than to end everything.  I hate the thoughts I think.  I hate my views on life.  I hate that I can’t manage the smallest fucking task without completely burning out my willpower.  I hate that everything I do just makes things worse.  I hate that I have no help.  I hate everything.  I hate absolutely everything about my life.  I want to end it all.  That’s it.  I don’t know how much longer I can take it.  Every breath I take feels like a chore.  Every movement I make feels like grueling torture.  I can’t pick my nose without getting tired afterwards.  There’s nothing I can do about my life, except bitch and moan.  I have so many good things and yet I can’t make myself appreciate anything.  I want it to end.  I want it all to end.

I have a very privileged life with everything I ever dreamed of and am still mostly unhappy,1,11ekdrn,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11ekdrn/i_have_a_very_privileged_life_with_everything_i/,1,"I (M25) grew up in Brazil and had a nightmare childhood with the worst mother someone could have. I had to stop her from killing herself in front of me since I was 3 years old. I had to hide the knives we had to keep her from slitting her wrists. Never had a father. 

At around 16, my aunt took me in and provided me with everything I never had. This positive influence catapulted me into great things: at 19 I moved to the USA to work as a camp counselor, worked for two years. Traveling the US, I ended up meeting a really good friend who invited to move in with him. He happened to work at American Airlines and listed me as his beneficiary, so I got to fly for free with AA. I got to see 10 countries, 30+ states. As a huge music fan, I’ve seen every single band I ever loved in concert and met them in person, multiple times. I had unbelievable concert experiences and extreme luck, living things that were never a remote possibility for my younger self, even becoming friends with band members that I once had posters of hanging on my wall back home.

But I was very lonely in the US and that took a toll on me. I stopped leaving the house. Since I worked from home, I never had to. I would go 10 days without breathing fresh air. I stopped wanting to travel. I realized this was not going to end well and moved back to Brazil, since all my friends and family were there.

As I moved back, I started getting severely depressed, I had seen everything I wanted to see. I had done everything I never even thought I would be able to do one day. How would life move forward? I had nothing else to look forward to. My aunt realized I was doing bad and suggested I go to a doctor. I was put on antidepressants for a whole year. Maybe more.  I got MUCH better and was released from the treatment. During the pandemic, I started a relationship, which although troubled in the beginning (and middle) (and now), still stands. We have jealousy and insecurity problems from her end, which have limited much of what I’m “allowed” to do, but after many arguments, she has been better and more allowing of me doing stuff on my own. I truly love her and believe we can work this out, although I do feel like I’m “missing out on being single” but also can’t be with her. 

Throughout the pandemic, my career took a turn. I started making MUCH more money all of a sudden. Like, A LOT. I have my own company and work for another part-time. I can now pay for everything I want, do anything I want. I have a lot of money invested and great perspectives to keep earning more and more. But I still work from home. I still don’t leave the house much. Most days I can’t even walk my dog, whom I love with all my life. My aunt and grandma, the only real family I have, have moved to the countryside and we don’t get to see each other often anymore. I pretty much only interact with my girlfriend when she comes over on the weekends and we go to the best restaurants and chill at home. Funnily enough, she also works for AA and I get to fly for free under her benefits. We have taken great trips together and have many more lined up. 

All of this being said, I truly feel ungrateful and a horrible person for having all this incredible stuff going on for me and still feeling pretty miserable. I’ve been in therapy for as long as I can remember but recently stopped because I felt like I had nothing else to talk about. Tried two other therapists recently but it didn’t feel right, so I stopped again. I tried to start working out and stopped soon after. I’ve gained weight and have cholesterol problems now.
I eat terribly, can’t get around to do any house chores, I just pay people to do it for me. I barely leave the house or interact with other human beings. There’s so much I could detail here but it all comes down to: so many people would KILL to have the life I have, and I still can’t fully appreciate it and have been miserable. I struggle with aging and feeling that the best is past me. That I’ll never be able to be young and reckless again. That now it’s downhill from now on.

Anyone got any insight on depressive episodes?,1,11ek8by,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11ek8by/anyone_got_any_insight_on_depressive_episodes/,0,"My friend just started isolating herself. She leaves me and her other close friend on read and gives dry replies. I can only talk to her through messages, if I asked her to hang out she'd probably decline. I already told her I'm here for her and won't leave her at her lowest. I'm really worried. 

She asked me why I'm still here, then proceeded to try to make me leave through any means necessary. I told her I'm not going to do that and that I'll check up on her tomorrow (today). I did not give in to her insults or aggressiveness. I believe I did the right thing, but she never, so far, opened up about her issues. 

I want her to know I'm here. At every step of the way. I would genuinely start sending her updates or corny stuff to raise her self esteem even if she doesn't reply to me. I fear I might truly be annoying, even though it's probably just something she says so I leave her alone. 

I also feel like, in a discussion, nothing I ever say is going to be right. As understanding as I try to be she might just get the message wrong. Sometimes it's not about clear communication as it is perception

It's kinda been hitting all at once how people in my life just don't care about me or want to know anything about what I'm up to. I've noticed this with family and friends where I end up in one sided conversations of me asking a lot of questions and showing effort, and I don't even get a ""how's your day?"" ""How's life?"" or anyone just wanting to know anything about what I'm up to. Typically, when I run out of things to ask or run out of thoughts, it's just an awkward silence because people just aren't engaged. I just don't get it because I'm a fun and outgoing person that values connecting with others.   


When I'm with my wife, I notice this even more. They will ask her about her life, work, what she's been up to. I'll engage and comment from what people say, ask questions, but nothing towards me. It seems just most family and friends genuinely aren't interested, I can't force people to care or make an effort if they just don't want to. It just makes it worse when I'm in a group. Like if you walked up to any of them, they couldn't even tell you what I'm up to with my work, what I've done lately, or anything fun I plan to do in the future. This has probably happened with at least 8-9 people to give you an idea. So it's not just one friend or situation.   


I moved a few years ago, and it's been hard to make new friends in my area. My wife and I have been making a lot of friends as a couple, and its just sucks when they find her fun and cool and they just don't care about me because I'm a dude.

However, almost all of my life experience has been on the negative one way or another. Essentially everything has been bad, either in the moment or in hindsight eventually.

It doesn't help to talk about it. I can go in circles blaming myself or something else about specific things I keep me down, but there's no way to resolve any it with semantics, ande even then I'd still have everything else to feel bad about.

I can't fix anything. There's too much else wrong in my life to make anything better. I'd need for everything to go right for me all at once to overcome everything that has gone wrong.

But from my experiences, good things don't happen on their own the way bad things do. Bad things are bound to continue happening until inevitable death. I factor these expected/unexpected future circumstances into how I feel about myself.

The things I feel worse about aren't those that were the most objectively bad, but what I had most control over. My depression isn't a measure of how much I've suffered in life, but how it made me feel about myself. So thinking about what I'm most depressed about usually fails to address my biggest problems.

So yeah, this sucks for me. I'm endlessly depressed and going nowhere, knowing my life is guaranteed to become worse in the near and distant future.

It's so dumb though, I have such an extensive understanding of myself and what went wrong with me and why I can't seem to get a grip on my life, yet I still can't make any better of it.",1677608529.0

I should be thriving. And maybe on the outside, I look perfectly fine and successful and confident. On the inside, I feel like a failure, I feel ugly, I feel like I never lived up to my privilege or took advantage of something that most people would die to have.

I am depressed, get more depressed because I know I am squandering what I have, can't stop squandering, and then get more depressed. The cycle in my head won't stop.

I may not have a choice in whether I keep the job or not. I'm not doing everything fully to their expectations, so I may get fired.

I’ve been struggling more recently now with feeling either bipolar or just depressed and it’s never been this bad.

As I am a (19) female everyone’s first reaction is to blame it on birth control.

It’s getting out of hand. I can’t get anyone to support me trying to find a psychiatrist because it’s “probably just hormones” or “most likely just the pill.” But it’s so much more than that. I’m miserable.

Why is it so difficult for me to find support to see if I need to be on any medication. I’ve been to therapy, I’ve been trying to do relaxing things. Nothing is working anymore.

I already know stress is a big cause behind it.

I just need suggestions and then would like to know what worked and maybe didn’t for you. Please share your feedback.

I’m gay, female 31 years old and though I’m still young I feel totally worn and don’t make any effort dating anymore. Which lately has attracted confused, hurtful people that I settle for in place of nothing at all..

I’ve always wanted a relationship since I was in high school and I’m not sure if anyone I’ve been with has actually loved me. I don’t know why I place such a high priority on it. But I really am so tired of being alone. Biologically I’m not designed to be alone. My brain always wants to talk to someone every day and share my experiences..

It’s harder as I get older and friends get married and have kids. I’m the loneliest I’ve been in my life it feels , and i can’t know if it will get better.
Even if I do find someone there’s no guarantee it will last until the end of my life, likely it won’t. But I can’t convince myself I’m ok alone. I think about not being on the planet anymore.
I’ve lost interest in hobbies and passions I used to do. Work wise I used to follow my interests but got taken advantage of many times so I feel like I’ve given up in that area of life too..

Now I’m nocturnal for no reason and my current freelance employer tolerates it but it makes it worse. I wake up and no one is around at night, no shops are open, and it’s just me here alone in my little place..

Any words of encouragement are welcome.. maybe if I could fix my sleep again I would feel better, but my health insurance is medi-cal and it makes it hard to see specialists just to get prescribed stronger drugs, I could use sleeping pills to get back on track..",1677603059.0

He's the kindest, most wonderful person I've ever met. He's my ray of sunshine and my everything. He's always supported me through the ups and downs of my mental health and never fails to make everyday so much better.

He was recently a victim of a small attack at his workplace. His report of the incident caused him to lose his job. He is the sole breadwinner of his family, due to certain circumstances at home. He told me he was feeling depressed, but he still smiled and told me that he was happy to be free from the responsibilities of work for the time being, as he searches for a new job. He was smiling as he told me about being hopeful in his plans to file a case against his employer and the attacker. He told me he was feeling optimistic about the results. He continued to smile as we spent the entire day together yesterday. I knew he was hurting, but didn't want to push him to talk about it if it made him uncomfortable. 

He went home, but gave no update. He messaged me in the middle of the night that he was at his best friend's house. He also told me not to worry about him. I took that as a sign that he wanted to be left alone and needed some space. I continued to message him throughout the next day, but he didn't respond. His best friend messaged me in the afternoon to update me that they were still together so I wouldn't worry too much. He told me that my boyfriend had a breakdown, he hasn't been able to sleep for the past few weeks. They had a couple drinks last night and my boyfriend drunkenly made a voice recording that if he were to pass away in his best friend's home, that his best friend wasn't responsible for his death, only himself. It was the first I had ever heard about my boyfriend having suicidal thoughts. I was heartbroken. He's told his best friend that he's been avoiding me because he doesn't want me to see the state that he's in. His best friend requested that I don't tell my boyfriend what he told me, as it wasn't his place to say but thought I should know.

I gave my boyfriend a call this evening and he sounded like his normal cheery self, nothing like the voice recording. He kept telling me how much he loved me and how much I mean to him. I couldn't help but burst out into tears, knowing that he'd been having suicidal thoughts. He asked me what was wrong, but I couldn't say that I knew how he really felt.

Advice re: supporting a friend,2,11ecjbw,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11ecjbw/advice_re_supporting_a_friend/,0,"Hi everyone, this is going to be a bit of a long post. Long story short, I have a friend who I've been friends with since we were 12 (I'm now a year out of college). For as long as I remember, we've relied heavily on each other for support, and there isn't a single thing about me that she doesn't know, and vice versa. Our relationship is the type where we ""trauma dump"" on each other multiple times a week with no filter and we basically are each other's therapists. I've done my best to listen, tell her that I'll always be here for her, not impose on issues that I don't personally relate to, but make sure that she knows that she's got me. But honestly, I'm worried that's not enough sometimes. Recently, I've hit a wall with how much support and help I feel I can offer her because there are issues that she brings up that I don't think I have the expertise to provide her solid advice on. I tend to take on others' issues as if they're my own, and I also feel myself building an emotional barrier, which I hate because I want to be there for her to my fullest capacity. We've always had pretty weak boundaries because we've assumed that the other can take on what we're about to tell them, but especially now, I don't think I have the expertise and capacity to help her in the way that a professional can.

We've been friends since we were kids and I can tell that her mental health has been severely declining, especially over the course of college and post-grad, and I don't know what to do. I'm worried because I also know that I'm the only one she talks to about these things. I don't want to lose a friend just because I didn't have the necessary skills to support her. I can tell that she's resistant to seeking professional help. I completely understand that finding a therapist and speaking with a doctor is a decision that's very personal, so I don't want to force it. I've had a therapist myself, and I was lucky to have had a good experience with it, so I know how much it could potentially help.

I was supposed to die,26,11e6kaa,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11e6kaa/i_was_supposed_to_die/,6,"I was born with the umbilical cord around my neck and blue in my face. I’m not sure why I was saved, I shouldn’t have been. 

My mother gave up her youth and her future to bring me into the world, and I am a disappointment. The only way I can possibly function is when I’m high on weed because I hurt everywhere consistently, and my brain is far too loud. I’m broke after only 6 years of being on my own, no career path, unreliable, no friends…. 

When I was 13 I tried to hang myself. The rope I picked was too weak to hold my obese self. 

When I was 16 I tried to take 15 naproxen, I should have died then. But I didn’t. It just destroyed my guts. 

When I was 17 I tried to take 30 Tylenol and a handful of sleeping pills. I almost died, but the ambulance came. Now I have ruined my guts and liver. 

When I was 19 I tried to drown, what a failure that was. I panicked and came up for air as soon as I felt a bit of water go up my nose when I laid down in the tub. 

Two months ago I tried to eat something I’ve been allegedly deathly allergic to my entire life, only to get horrible stomach cramps and an itchy mouth. 

I should be dead. If there is a God, why would he be cruel enough to abandon me here to suffer and hurt the people I care about? I pray to him every night, begging not to wake up, but I always do. 

The only peace I get is in my sleep. When I wake up, all I can do is feel the tears running down my face because I know I’ll have to fill up another day, trying to keep my head quiet and busy. It takes me hours to stop myself from staring at the ceiling and get out of bed.

All I can think of when I’m at home alone is if I should hang myself from my favourite tree or just start the car in the garage and stick a hose through the window. And when I’m not alone, all I think about is how big of an embarrassment I am to my family.

Please, I don’t want to exist anymore. I simply want to fade away into the nothingness I was always supposed to be.",1677592350.0

I went unnoticed because I was needed,1,11e4xsi,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11e4xsi/i_went_unnoticed_because_i_was_needed/,0,"Growing up I always looked at my family and figured I was the most stable. My father and brother had adhd pretty bad, my mother and brother apparently were both bi polar and my mom also had severe depression that made her attempt suicide and live in a mental hospital for a month.

Don’t know if I just never showed or if they were too busy to notice but I always appeared normal. Because of this I was leaned on a lot. I was put in charge of my brother cuz he constantly got into trouble, I was constantly the adult/ voice of reason for my mom and even my father confided in me alot. This made me mature and grow up fast to the point that even physically apparently I looked and acted older. All the while looking back I hid how messed up I was and how it got worse. 

I don’t blame my parents or anyone. They had so much on their plates and they often told me how much I helped. Even now as an adult when things get bad in my head I try to find distractions or people to help because it helps me ignore the problem. If I were to ever get diagnosed I’m sure they would find a host of issues.

Heck sometimes I get bored and take online diagnostic quizzes thinking “I’m sure this will prove I’m just fine and I escaped getting all the things that run in the family.” But everytime they claim I have the same and more so I just say “well what do online tests know? Dang things are probably programmed to say everyone has issues.”",1677587587.0

Need advice on self improvement,2,11e26h5,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11e26h5/need_advice_on_self_improvement/,1,"TLDR: actual list at the end of the post, this is just context!
I would like some practical advices, mental or physical, to keep myself grounded, safe, sane and level-headed. Any tips help, at this point I have been battling for so long and I feel like I am losing now. I will talk about myself a bit for context and then at the end of the post I’d list some specific problems that I need help with.

So to set things clear, I _probably_ have borderline pd, many doctors have told me but I havent gotten any papers on it yet as I am struggling with consistent therapy. Few years ago I got a diagnosis for social anxiety and mild depression, nothing new to me. Also one doctor told me I might be on the autism spectrum, which mostly affects my social interactions, it is not confirmed, my elder brother however is definitely on the spectrum socially but he is very happy with his lifestyle and we have a good relationship so we look out for eachother.

A little bit about my (probably) dpd: All my life has been about love and romantic interests. I love hard, deeply, I fall fast and act crazy. I am extremely co-dependent and my everyday life depends on the person I am currently romantically involved with (even if its one sided). I often have daily mood swings, the smallest things throw me off into a spiral and I cannot get up. I am hyper sensitive (especially when it comes to my partner) and I get hurt really easily by words. I try not to leave the house as much as possible, I go to work, I dont have money problems, I am a fairly succesfull tiktoker (no income or paid ads, its just a hobby/distraction.) My relationship is probably trauma bond and extremely not healthy, the past two years have set my mental progress back significantly and I KNOW I am being gaslit and verbally abused and often fear for my safety. Right now I have no choice but stay, I cannot tell why because it would reveal my identity. I can safely get out of the relationship in a few months and start working on processing trauma. 
My life is settled, I am getting my degree soon, I have other qualifications and and amazing job with great pay and ability to climb the ladder. I wish in the future to launch my own stylist/fashion services. I have a supportive family but I cannot reach out to them as I have caused my parents to much trauma and they blame themselves for my serious problems (never tried to end my life and dont want to). I do not want to worry them and for now I have been keeping up a “stable” apperiance and they are not suspecting that I am on the verge of relapsing with my BPD and I have trouble holding back my impulses (drinking, rivotril  - that is pescribed by doctos for my fucked up epilepsy like sleep patterns, urge to self harm (never cut myself and dont want to)), 
I have been relatively stable for the past 2 years but my relationship has drained me and I reached a point today where I am close to losing it. My partner accused me of lying about a stupid thing (I didnt remember or forgot to pay attention when he asked to set the alam for 30mins earlier and he attacked me with a very disgusting tone and accused me of lying that I did it on purpose, I said sorry I mustve not paid attention (wouldnt be the first time, working on it) but it really sent me down a spiral and I was so offended and hurt that he would think I would keep “lying to his face” and he wouldnt believe it was a honest mistake which for I apologized straightaway.
I have been crying for hours but I CANNOT let myself fall back to old patterns when I have come so far.
I want to be balanced and I know I need to get out this verbally abusive and gaslighting relationship and I will in a few months. But untill then I am so close to losing it I just need advice to improve myself, my reaction (inside and outside) and make myself as stable as possible. I just need to get myself to feel OK.

TLDR part:
Advice I need with:
1. I see most things black and white - one moment I am raging about nothing or crying on the floor, the other I am completely okay. 
2. Either love or hate my mom/dad/partner/people in general.
3. I want to be outgoing and more social but I am extremely panicky around people and fking scared.
4. I want to be more productive but I feel often drained and procastrinate. Cant get myself to write my thesis, I am layin in bed all day.
5. I need to learn to keep myself calm in conflicts and not scream and say hurtful things.
6. I need to let go of things (jealousy, insecurity, paranoia bc of cheating in my previous relationships, harmful remakrs that were just jokes towards me and I overract).
7. I want to change my introvert nature, I used to be extroverted but covid and trauma (extreme betrayal) made me loathe and distrust people.
8. My life and environment is a mess, I cannot keep clean around my room.
9. Universitiy overwhelms me and I hated it since started but now only have my last semester left.
10. I feel fucking ugly, I am not. (according to other people). I want to focus less on my appereance. 
11. I want to be less affected by basically everything and learn how to not let things get into my head easily.
12. I cannot stick to a schedule, I tried to do lists with reminders but I am drained and cannot do basic tasks.
13. I want to stay calm and collected at all times and be less codependent on my actual partner/favourite person.
14. Id like an idgaf general attitude that is not just a facade and I can actually not care about every little minor inconvinience in my life.
15. I dont know how to set daily schedule, I can for 3-5 days but then my depression(?) hits and I give up. Repeat every two weeks.
16. I want to be kinder. I often think I am funny/doing playful banter but I end up hurting people.
17. My partner is also oversli sensitive snd I dont know how to handle that, he is psycho and will not listen to reason. How do I handle that.

These are just some things I would really appreciate some advices for, how do I start? What are some techniques?How do I ground myself when I am losing my shit? How do I stop being irrational in fights and make it escalate? Theraphy has been not much help so far.
I do not want all these things to change at once but I want to start somewhere and reband myself, I just keep failing constanly.
Any advice on any points i really really appreciate and hope some people can help me that have been through similar difficulties. These are not all my bad «habits” but I wanna start relatively slow.
Articles/books/videos are appreciated as long they actually give usable advice and practices and not just general “work hard be disciplined bs”.

Please I know I sound pathetic, but be gentle with me, I really want to change being a horrible person for others sake and for my own mental stability. I feel like I just need strict order in my life.
Thank you all for reading this and thank you in advance for your trips & tricks.

i even got happy pills to fight the blue big bear that lays on me. 
the happy pills helped at first and now i’m just in this place where i’m not at rock bottom but not at that hood state anymore. 
last week my therapist asked me if i’m suicidal, i said no. 
and i really am not. i am highly afraid of death. it leads me to the point i avoid huge ppl crowds so i’m not going to end up in a terroristic act. she gave me the diagnosis of social anxiety too since i often do have panic attacks.
like i said, i am afraid of death, can i be depressed and afraid of death at the same time or am i missdiagnosed?
she (my therapist) never went on the topic that i have many signs of ocd that i told her about. i have to do everything three times and if i mess up i raise it of doing it even five, seven or nine times. other than that is just wrong. 
i really have no idea how to talk about anyone since i feel like i’m not worth enough the time, that i am not that mentally ill so i need someone to talk to. i just waste time of the therapist since she doesn’t even really goes into topic anymore, we often just play board games so i don’t overthink and cry.

Now, she and I both struggle with mental health, and for a little while now she has been in a bit of a depressive spiral. I have a lot of attachment and emotional issues, which makes me want to help, a bit too much. I’ve been told many times that I push a bit too hard for people to open up, or tell me what’s on their mind, and I am aware of the fact that I do that, just not the best at stopping it from happening. And that’s the exact situation now. I just want to help, and make sure she knows I’m there, and genuinely, truly care, but I’m pushing too hard, and don’t know how to stop myself. Im fucking terrified I’ll fuck up what we have, either by not being there when she needs me, or by pushing way harder than I should in a misguided effort to help in some way, and it’s fucking me up, and causing a lot of my own depression to flare, out of fear I’ll fuck it all up. I just want to do the right thing, be a good boyfriend to her, and help in some way, even though I don’t think I can. I’ve decided to just give her some space for the time being, and apologised for pushing too much, but making sure she is ok is all I think about, and it takes so much effort not to check on her, even though I know doing so would probably just make things worse

I've influenced two people dear to me to kill themselves without meaning to. The ex I was dating a couple years ago was the person I always came to for my problems, because I loved them a lot. I couldn't think of anybody else I wanted to be with. However, my problems started getting too much, and the things I said were influencing them. I didn't know because they never told me, but I know I should've just known. I didn't know as much about how much I was influencing people then as I do now. He attempted suicide, luckily it failed, and broke up with me.

My friend did the same thing, basically. I asked her if it was alright to tell her my problems, yet I didn't know they were so influential. Just a couple months ago, I learned she also attempted suicide. Her mother blames me. I blame myself as well. I should've known that it would've happened, that the things I said influenced her.

I dated a girl a couple years ago, though I loved her dearly at the beginning, I was struggling so much and was so angry at everybody and everything that I just started telling her I hated her. I didn't mean to hurt her. I told her once, ""Sometimes I feel the urge to tell you to die, and others too"" I feel horrible for it. I'm aware it's verbal abuse, in a way. I'm glad it never extended to physical abuse, but I don't think I'd ever resort to that no matter how bad it gets. Back then I also didn't know what was going on, or how to deal with all the bullshit going on around me. It felt like she hadn't cared about me, she kept telling me she loved me but told people shit about me. Which I understand, I don't blame her for it cause I was a dickhead.

I just feel like it'd be better to die, though suicide isn't the answer. Suicide can't erase the sins and harm I've done to people.",1677571286.0

context i guess, im at a point in my life where every day feels like a struggle. im a 21 year old college student, no job due to my emotional state making it hard to work, parents more worried my grades slipped up last semester, and no real social interaction in the outside world. i barely have any energy to work on things,  iwant to break down and cry most of the time yet im not supposed to because ""men dont do that"", and i have huge body dysmorphia because i feel ill never become the woman i want to be,  the only time i feel any semblance of joy is when i interact with my friends online. but at this point its feeling less like proper joy and more like a mindless distraction for a few hours every night.

i love these guys, theyre genuinely my best friends, and we all have a great time together, playing games, talking about art and the community were in, its all great and we havea great time

idk how to properly structure this, but honestly i cant take it anymore. i feel at this point i am forcing myself to stay alive because my friends also have mood swings and depressive episodes. its gotten to a point where when someone is upset in my friend group im the first one they go to to ask and see if i can help them out. at this point i have a fucking list of people i help. literally its almost 10 people im having to keep track of at this point and it feels like im drowning and being pushed down as i try to get out of the water and ask for help

i dont wanna sound selfish and like i dont care, because i do. i care about my friends, and i want to be sure they are all doing well. i genuninely would be ok if i was somehow able to cary the weight of their problems if it meant they would be happy. however i feel im not getting the work i put in back.

now i dont deserve it, obviously friendship isnt supposed to be a trade system. but it feels like when i attempt to put my own emotions up front, i get shut down for it. be it friends leaving the vc until i leave, comparing their issues as if to one up me, or just flat out making the situation about themselves to where what is happening with them is more important. i cant blame them for some of it, as said they all have their own issues, some of them also with suicidal thoughts, but i just feel like that im helping everyone else. making sure theyre ok, spending time with them, staying up late to make sure theyre ok when they ask, and all i get is a pat on the shoulder or ignored.

i dont deserve it, i dont feel like ive earned it, but i dont feel like i can turn to anyone with my problems. my schools counceling system is garbage, my parents dont seem to care, i have no money to see a therapist. at this point im not even asking for advice,  i just needed a place to vent. im a mess and no one is here for me. i know the day i end up finally doing it they will be more worried about theier therapist being gone rather than worried a friend is lost

I'm at a dilemma where death feels like a better idea than continuing my life. I don't know what to do. I've been at rock bottom many times but every new time I hit it, it becomes deeper. Everyone needs love but when did it start feeling corrupted? I probably need help but I can't even get help to be put back on my feet. Maybe a bullet to the brain would feel better than this. I don't have a gun or bullets to act upon wishes so I still can't get out of the deep bottom by ending everything. I'll just keep the blood flowing because at least when I cut I feel a warm embrace when everything else feels cold and unwelcoming. Sorry for the rant, please forgive me.",1677565083.0

What should I do? I’m backed into a wall and I am scared.

Lately, I have been starting to feel scared every single time I walk on to the campus. I always feel anxious and get headaches because of how stressed I get constantly. I never fully grasp anything that they say in class and even when studying my mind can’t focus. I’ve been thinking about going to trade school instead for a degree in literally anything, but, I am scared to think about what my family is going to say. They have always had high expectations for me and I don’t want to fail them. I know they love me and would support me but I’m scared to see them think I’m a failure. My dad tried college but couldn’t go through with it and I feel like it bothers him that he didn’t do it. If I didn’t do college I feel like it would affect him.

I just can’t do it anymore though. So that’s why I want to tell them tomorrow that I want to go to trade school for a specific degree and then live life and work.

Once again my family is very supportive but I also don’t want them to worry about me constantly and think I’m a idiot that needs protecting (yes I know that’s a job of a parent).

So what’s should I do? Quit college and go to trade school or continue college and probably fail many many times which would cost a lot of money that isn’t mine but my parents?",1677564469.0

Hey I’m just going to say my name is dc. I had a decent childhood I guess. I seen things I probably shouldn’t. From my mom getting beat or getting choked out at 6 by my step dad. I watched my step brother who I loved very much up till this day put a knife to my mom’s throat. I suffered from social anxiety and depression as a kid cause I wasn’t a really rich kid and tbh I didn’t look all that great. Got made fun of a lot picked on never had a real relationship up until I was 17. I lost my best friend at 18. He died of a drug overdose.. so everybody thinks but he told me the night before he was going to kill himself and I tried to help him every way I could.. it kills me to be one of the only people that know it was suicide and I couldn’t help him.. My dad past when I was 22 I walked in on him having a stroke and I had to hold him for 30 mins till the ambulance got there crying about how bad a son I had been and how I love him so much.. I signed a dnr for him on my birthday.. cause that was his wish. I tried to kill myself on my birthday with Coke and Xanax and alcohol cause I didn’t want to live without my dad.. 11 days later he pasted and I woke up to see him take his last breath it was just me and him.. it still kills me everyday to be without him.. I went to the park lot after he pasted andtold my mom and brother on the phone that I loved them and was headed home.. I took 3 Xanax bars smoked a blunt grabbed my gun and put it to my head and pulled the trigger it misfired and I busted down crying.. I went through a 2 1/2 year Xanax mostly but also pain pills alcohol and coke. I overcame all that I’m now 2 years sober with only a few slips up with the Xanax but no long term use. I graduated college.

nervous breakdown,1,11dxp98,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11dxp98/nervous_breakdown/,0,"do you ever feel so overwhelmed and alone that it's debilitating? Like when you're trying to walk through a ball pit to get out, it's really difficult right? Your feet are heavy and it pulls you back in. You want out but it's too hard. That's how I feel, and now I'm drowning. Here's why:

Work: I've always been a high performer at work. Worked my but off to land a good WFH job. Well, working from home has proven to be crushing. I'm alone and feel confined to the same room all day. The less I see people, the less I want to see people, and the cycle goes on. Every time I talk to my boss she has a list of things for me to do, on top of an already overwhelming workload. And I feel like she really only cares about her own status in the company. I don't feel validated or part of a community. And I've been struggling recently, missing deadlines, zero motivation, constantly distracted by anything but work. It makes me feel terrible about myself 

Home: I live with an elderly family member (not parent). I do so much for them. Cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping, personal hygiene. I didn't plan for this when I moved in, just fell into it, especially since working from home. I feel like I'm the one that holds my family together in general, planning dinners and getting us together. My brother adopted a dog, who also now lives with us and I take care of while my brother is away (which is most of the time). I'm struggling to keep up. Trying to care for family and their pets

Coping: I've coped in various ways throughout the past year. Exercise classes, therapy, brief opioid usage (which I had to identify was a problem and detox on my own), smoking, general neglect of personal hygiene/responsibilities. I've idealized suicide (never planned), wishing to make it stop. All of this, the ways I've felt, and things I've done over the past year, has been known by me only.

I feel like I've given given given to everyone else, but what about me? Where is my support? Why won't someone ever just offer to take one thing off of my plate? Why can't I find the motivation to work like I used to?

I'm tired. I'm tired of feeling this way. 

Mental health is so important and I feel like I have to always work to keep mine in check or else I always get back to this state, in some way, shape, or form. Why isn't it like that for everyone? I'm envious of those that don't have to work at it in the same way as I. I just want to be better. And I think I know how, but I have no motivation to do it.

I almost got raped a month ago and I can’t get over it,1,11dxlys,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11dxlys/i_almost_got_raped_a_month_ago_and_i_cant_get/,0,"I’m a 20 yr old guy and nearly got jumped and raped by a guy who was obsessed with me. This happened the first day I came back from winter break in college. This guy John was harassing and threatening me during the first semester. He joked about raping me, threatened me, and would always make fun of me. I didn’t want to tell my ra that this was happening because I knew I would be in danger if I did. After the first semester was over we had a month long vacation. A few days before the vacation ended and  had to back to school, I broke down and told my parents everything that was happening. They wanted to call my school, but I told them not to because I was scared. I made them promise not to tell but I guess they did it anyways and they keep denying that they did, but I know they did. 

Anyways, the night on the first day I came back, John and his friends were standing near my door and were planning on beating me senseless, raping, and torturing me. They didn’t think I was in the room because when I came back I told my dad I was going out to eat, but I decided to smoke weed instead. My psycho neighbor Todd was listening to my conversation and told them I was out. I stayed in my room stoned as hell hearing all of these horrible things they wanted to do to me and I was in shock. Todd was in his room with his girlfriend Kate and just kept repeating “I hope John actually rapes OP.” It legit felt like a horror movie, the lights kept flickering  on and off because it was stormy out. I genuinely wanted to fucking die.

The reason why this all happened was sort of my fault. There was another gay guy called Liam that was harassing me but not as bad as John. I told my parents about Liam as well and for some god damn stupid fucking reason they thought that he was the main aggressor and focused on him instead. I even told them John was the biggest problem but they didn’t fucking listen. Liam never threatened to rape me, he was creepy af though. they told my ra that he was the one threatening me. So I looked like a fucking liar and rat to all these assholes on my floor.


I dropped out right after and I’ve been a complete mess the past month. I’m only now starting to work again and I’m not the same person anymore this shit really really fucked me up. I keep blaming myself. I’m scared my parents think I’m crazy and that I made it all up to get out of college because I couldn’t handle it. I feel like I should have gotten over it by now because I wasn’t physically harmed and there’s no threat anymore but I just can’t. I cant stop thinking about it. About how ridiculous this all is.

I’ve been doing this a lot lately. 

All I do at home is listen to music and sometimes watch videos. I like to draw. I like to write. But I haven’t made anything, I get wonderful ideas, but put them off until they dissipate. 

At night I cut myself, every day. Always in the same area. I used to care a lot about not making them overlap. I don’t care anymore, the older ones don’t even get the chance to scar anymore. I’ve been thinking about going deeper. How easy it would be to just take the blade and slash my wrist with a lot of force. I might painfully bleed out, or get sent to the psych wars. I’ve been thinking about the latter a lot, if I attempt then I’ll go there, and I won’t have to go to school and I won’t have to be at home, and I won’t have to do anything anymore. 

Sometimes I feel like my life isn’t my own. I can’t ever be myself. I don’t talk at school, I don’t have friends there. At home I have to pretend to be a girl and have a name I don’t want. I can’t talk to anyone about anything. I went to therapy for about a year for anxiety, and really, I was never sure if I had it. I don’t even know if I have depression, never been diagnosed, never bothered to ask. I at times don’t want to get better, maybe that’s why I never bothered.

I transferred from a different school I was at last year. My biggest fear was not making any friends, and guess what? That fear came true. I threw myself into a relationship within the first 2 weeks of my first semester here and it ended in less than a month. Didn't really talk to anyone else except him and his friend group. Big fucking mistake.

Everyone else already has a group. I try talking to people in my classes, in clubs I'm in, people in my major's building, but no one seems interested. I try reaching out first to people to see if they want to meet up and hang out, but nothing has ever come of that. No one has asked me if I wanted to do something with them. Not one person since my ex broke up with me which was 5 months ago now.

I have a new partner but he doesn't go here. He used to, but dropped out and now lives at home about 40 minutes away. It's hard making plans with him because he goes to his local community college full time and also works part time, and I go to school full time as well. I tried not to center my life around him when he was at my school, but that's what I ended up doing and now I have baseless connections with other people who I feel like don't want to be friends with me.

My best friend from home also transferred schools this year and she has a huge friend group at her new school. Hanging out with people everyday, going out on the weekends, typical college life. I was hoping for the same. But no. I'm in my dorm 24/7 except to go to class or drive around alone.

I did what everyone tells you to do. I joined clubs. I pushed myself out of my comfort zone and talked to people, asked if they wanted to hang out, but nothing. I feel like I'm doing something wrong and it doesn't feel fair. I was so excited to leave my old school and come to this new one as it's in a location I enjoy, the weather is nicer, the program for my major is a lot better, but I'm not going to lie, having no social life in college is fucking killing me. I know other transfers and they all have a group and their people but I have no one. It doesn't help that I'm 400 miles away from home too. A lot of people here go home for the weekends, but I can't do that obviously.

I had in project in one of my classes where we had to make a video for something. Everyone else's had their friends acting in it, a lot of people I know of or even people in the same class as me. I was the only one who did it solo. I felt so fucking embarrassed. 

I was dreading going home for winter break, but once I was home, I loved it and was dreading going back. Now I'm excited to go home for spring break and dreading returning. I don't talk to my roommates either. I did random selection since I came into this school knowing no one and I have nothing in common with any of them. I tried talking to them throughout the first few weeks, but again, nothing except awkward small talk. Thankfully we all have single rooms.

I feel so embarrassed to say this but I just want friends. That's it. I just want someone or a group to hang out with and do things with instead of sitting in my room talking to my friends from home all the time.",1677559041.0

Nightly thoughts,13,11dwbey,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11dwbey/nightly_thoughts/,1,"Hello Reddit. 
I don’t know if this is the right platform to post what I am about to write, but I need somewhere to put my thoughts. So here goes.

It’s 4 a.m. and I’m laying in bed after I think an hour of talking to myself in my head. The last few days have been eventful . Last week I turned 30. My mother, her husband and my grandma came to visit for celebration. It was nice. Few days later I had gathering with my friends in a bar where we celebrated not only my birthday but also my best friends. It was again a really nice day and night. One of my friends even met a women, who he went home with after a two year dry spell. All in in all a good week.

The day after I was pretty hungover but felt good. Until come midday a voice came creeping up inside my head. I don’t know why I heard it and why it kept saying what it was saying. But what I heard repeatedly was: “I want to die.” Over and over again it kept repeating in my head. And suddenly I didn’t feel good anymore. All the fun I had the past days seemed to just disappear . I was sad. I am sad. 

I tried blocking it out. Every waking moment I listened to something else. I watched shows, listened to music and spent countless hours on YouTube shorts. And it helped distract me. But come night , laying in bed trying to sleep the voice came back. Repeating the same phrase again and again: „ I want to die“. 

Which brings me to this point in time, where I am lying in bed and this voice still in my head. 

I want to tell you what I thought about while laying in bed  not able to sleep. First of all this is not my first rodeo with these kind of thoughts and it won’t be my last. This is just the first time I write it down. 

I imagined myself in an psychiatrist‘s office where I am the patient and the doctor. Seeing myself having a breakdown, while talking about how my life isn’t as bad as other people I know, but I still feel like shit. Like the one friend who was recently diagnosed with a chronicle illness . Who lost his dad when was young. Or my other friends who lost their child before it was even born. Where they had to cope with that while raising their twin daughters. Where she has a chronic heart disease.
And then there is me. With a family mostly intact. Still having both my parents, all my grandparents and hell even my brother. What are my problems. Sure I have them, but they are mostly self made. I am fat. I am a student with the age of 30 who doesn’t go to class. I am just lazing around day in day out, waiting on change that will never come. Well until of course I would show some initiative. 
But honestly it’s been like this my whole life. Living in day dreams. Imagining myself as the last thing I have seen on tv. Or imagining myself turning my life around with so much willpower I will never have in real life. And all this imagining lead me where exactly? Right. Laying inside my bed at now 4.35 a.m. not being able to sleep, with a voice inside my head saying:“I want to die“. 

You know. I thought a whole lot about killing myself. Sometimes I envisioned how I would do it. My personal favorite is cutting my wrists in the shower, so there isn’t to much of a mess. But most of the times I thought about what would happen after I die. Me as the third person perspective watching how the people I care about would react. Placing the thoughts I would want them to have inside of them. Hoping they would miss, maybe cry over me. But I always came the conclusion, that I could never do it. Not because I want to live, but I don’t want to die. I am afraid to die. All of the feelings that I want my friends to feel when I die, I would never experience , I would never learn about. Because I would be dead. And what is there after you die nothing.

I think I am starting to ramble around. So I will stop writing now. Sorry if what I left hear was just a great mess and not coherent at all. But that was what was/is going around inside my head. If you read this far, thank you for indulging in my thoughts. I will try to sleep now",1677556951.0

I’ve never seriously considered it until recently. I feel as if I’ve started to convince myself it’s the only option I have left. 

I’ve tried everything, going to the gym routinely, cleaning my room everyday, going through a morning and night routine to keep up my hygiene, going outside and running, throwing myself into work, doing my favorite things like going on drives, working on my car, playing video games, but nothing makes it stop.

I am a 30 year old female, in a 4 year long relationship with a 32M.   He has been depressed since before we got together.  I was hoping my love could soften his edges, and show him its safe, and he is worthy.  It has been a struggle and we are four years deep and things just feel like we are worst off than when we got together.  He has anger issues that have left me deeply troubled.  It started off as a rare occasion that he would get into these really dark ""broody"" moods, but for the last few years its been almost daily (he must have just been good at hiding it while we were early phase dating).  I have noticed his anger issues have also increased, to the point that now he has having some sort of physical outburst at least 1 week.  I should note he has never hit me, but he will hit everything else.  The amount of times he's broken the cabinet doors, or kicked a laundry basket, or slammed the door when leaving, or threw something off a shelf, is too many too count.  I have told him I have a boundary around physical violence, so now he does it 10 seconds after I close the door (or less).  This still feels traumatic for me.  I am desperate about my situation. I Have tried encouraging him to get help for years, even paying for his therapy....it all just seems like my own volition and never his own.  He finally started anti-depressants after a major breakdown this christmas (he locked himself in his room on Christmas Eve + day and wouldn't join in on any of the activities).  But now he seems to just resent me for the fact that he is on anti depressants?  He complains about it, and makes passive aggressive comments like "" I guess I will just shut up and go take my pill now, cause that's what I am supposed to do"".    


I honestly am at a total loss and am ready to move myself out.  My heart is breaking because I just genuinely don't see a path forward with where we are right now.  Nothing has worked, and I feel like he might need to take the next steps of his healing journey alone.

"Back in depression, autoliving and destroying my life",5,11duhkr,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11duhkr/back_in_depression_autoliving_and_destroying_my/,0,"Hello to whoever is reading this.

I am looking for support since i never talk about mental health issues and I am at my wits end. I am 24, doing my bachelor (to which i havent had much significant progress since the last 3 years). I had been in depression (self diagnosed) before in life due to many factors (bullying cuz of ethnicity from age 12-16 and had almost no social skills following this).

When i turned 17 I wanted to change my life. I got in touch with my cousin (who has been a role model of sorts. He was jacked, good in school, did well with friends and dating) and he is someone who is like a brother to me. I wanted to become more like him ,so i started lifting and he introduced me to everything. I had improved my life, had made more friends than i could have imagined having, constantly challenged myself out of my comfort zone, did well in school, got jacked and strong. Once i was done with school at 18/19 yo with good grades i changed my environment and started working somewhere where i was forced to socially interact a lot. With time i got well along with others, started to date, had my first girlfriend, was happy with my appearance and body. Simply I was happy with my life and it was probably the time where i enjoeyed life the most.

Then half a year later i started my bachelor in computer science in the winter semester. Did well the first 3-4 semesters, made friends, partied a lot, gotten good to alright grades, still continued to work out. I had good relationships to friends and family.

But I slowly got unhappy (this started in 2020 or the end of 2019). Due to bullying in my teenage age i had a hard time trusting people and i think i still do to a certain extent (not as bad as it used to be). I also did a number of errors while socializing with friends, which i am not proud of, because of my lack in social skills in the time. Burned many bridges in the process, which i never really tried to fix. Because mostly i felt ashamed on the things i had said/done to them. Then one thing which in my sight isnt/wasnt my fault was a friend in my closest friend group, who had betrayed my trust multiple times and also i felt bullied by him (he might have influenced me also a bit on my actions towards other friends).

I started to go less and less to the gym, distanced myself from said friend more, slowly also distanced myself from other friends of my closest friend group aswell. I always also played video games, to which i got more addicted more and more.

Its been now 3 years since i got back into depression. During that timeframe i did almost nothing productive (except maybe 2 workstudent jobs). I could have been done with my bachelor in 2021 (1 year after my problems resurfaced started). I voluntarily socially isolated myself, because i always felt depleted after social interactions with time. I lost all of the discipline i had built i had prior to this. Be it self care, doing things for uni / work / gym. I started to procastinate a lot. I havent worked out in 1.5 years at all. With lack of activity i also gained weight during the pandemic.

I know the solutions to my problems and i have tried a few time to implement them, with little success \[i guess they would be to contact back/repair bridges i had burned and or friends i hadnt contacted in a while and starting to work out again, get in shape and force myself to study again in a schedule with overtime improvement and most importantly get out of my comfort zone\]. Now i feel like i am autoliving my life, not in control, numb, depressed. I also have difficulties maintaining a proper sleep schedule or just to wake up in the morning in general. Simple tasks feel a lot more worse than they used to be.

Technology addiction (gaming, porn, you name it) amplified all of these symptoms and made me not face the things for a long time. Maybe i didnt wanna help myself? Maybe i just dont care anymore what happens? I am not too sure.

I have no ambition, no goals in life, am self destructing my life and future. 2 weeks ago i finally contacted counceling offers in my uni and got an appointment via phone there. Better late than never ay?

Left out a few details/issues here and there but this should summarize most of the stuff. Am interested in what i could change to get out of this pit again and fix my life, because i am not able to do it by myself. I have bottled up all of this for a long time thinking i could resolve it by myself ""like i did it the first time"".",1677551618.0

I am so tired of life. Everyday is a battle and I don't know how it's going to get better.

I am 27 year old trans-woman in the UK. The vilification of people like me every day in the media is making me scared to go outside.

I have been signed off work for 3 weeks and I am so terrfied of going back. I just wish I could hide in my flat forever but capitalism means I have to slave away using the little energy I have just to barely afford rent and bills.

I really want to end it all. The only time I'm at peace is when I'm intoxicated or asleep... and even sometimes then nightmares and flashbacks mess with my head. I'm looking for the most painless way to die and hopefully I will be brave enough to do it this time.",1677497635.0
I Can’t listen to music anymore,1,11dua76,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11dua76/i_cant_listen_to_music_anymore/,0,"Hello everyone 25M, and currently I’m going thru a terrible depressive period of my life cause of existential and quarter life crisis. 

I use to listen to music a lot and it would comfort me whenever I was sad. Now I can’t listen to music anymore cause it brings back intense memories which trigger such strong emotions that are to much for me to bear so I avoid the song/album completely. 

I also can’t listen to music because I remember how I was depressed high school and instead of trying to overcome my depression I just numbed my pain with music, which is a very big reason why I missed out on so much as a high school student. 

Has anyone felt something similar and how did you deal with it. I’m very heavy music listener so not being able to listen to music is a very serious problem for me.",1677551051.0
High functioning depression,2,11du8mn,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11du8mn/high_functioning_depression/,1,How do all of you with high functioning depression feel? I'm high functioning and everyone that knows me absolutely love me because I seem so happy and genuine with my mask daily mask on but I'm actually very depressed and sad under the surface. When I'm alone I break down into piece just to wake up the next morning get out of bed and be the super happy person in the room everyone seems to love. I've been faking it for so long that I don't feel like I can even tell anyone because they all can't see how I could be depressed because of the happy impression ive left on them for so long. I don't ever plan on being a downer to everyone because of my own mental issues. The energy of holding it all in does get to me sometimes though and causes me to lose it some nights more than others but after a big break down like that it seems like it resets my brain back to where it was before still very depressed but back to the happy act that slowly fades away until I break down again alone at night.,1677550927.0
"I can't stop doing ""the right thing""",1,11du8d6,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11du8d6/i_cant_stop_doing_the_right_thing/,0,"Everyone around me tells me how lucky I am to be smart. Everyone tells me how lucky I am to be such a perfect student. Hell, people have even told me how lucky I am not to be mentally and therefore succeed in school (that bitch should see my upper thigh). I've always done what makes other people happy, and what I thought the good thing to do was. 4 years of straight As, various extracurriculars, 20+ hours of work a week, sports, 4-5 hours of sleep a night, 14 APs, and an SAT score that actually made my father say the words ""I'm proud of you"" later, and none of it means jackshit. I've never been happy -- busy or not; I've never seen the point. All I do is shove me back into the little corner in the back of my head and do what I've always done. I'm unhappy so why not to ""the right thing"" anyways? I'm unhappy so why not give myself a real reason to be? Why not get out of bed each day knowing full well this one is going to be just like the others? I'm apparently too much of a pussy to kill myself so why not bite off everything and say to hell with even trying to chew? Why not fucking drown?",1677550906.0

I’ve always wanted a friend,2,11d6ehk,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11d6ehk/ive_always_wanted_a_friend/,0,All my life I’ve never had anyone that loved me or cared for me the same way I do for them it doesn’t matter if it’s a friend lover or family member. Ive never really felt like my parents loved me as a kid and I know they try very hard to show it now that I’m in my 20s even if they’re not very affectionate people. I’m tired of pretending like I’m not suicidal like the thought isn’t always in the back of my brain. My friends never reach out it makes me feel replaceable like I’m not wanted or needed. My boyfriend he makes me feel worse the one person who’s supposed to love me no matter what doesn’t.. I don’t know what I’m sticking around for I know he’s never gonna change or get better that’s just how he is. I think it’s time for me to ctb soon. I can’t do it anymore things get better only for a moment only to get so much worse I’m tired.,1677485275.0
How do I deal with someone who avoids everything?,2,11d6dux,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11d6dux/how_do_i_deal_with_someone_who_avoids_everything/,0,"Hi. I have a very close friend (let's use the pronouns they) whom I have been talking to for months. They have been so sweet and nice to me throughout our friendship. But they would avoid me (everything) if they have been dealing with depression. This is the second time that this has happened. I also suffer from BPD which means I would overthink everything when a slight thing happened in my relationship with others. So, I would message them non-stop until I get the answer I want. 

But, how do I deal with them? Should I give them space and wait until they message me first? Or should I send him encouraging stuff? Should I tell them to update me from time to time? 
 

Thank you.",1677485211.0

Been alone my whole life not once have I ever felt a hug, holding hands, or a loving touch not even platonically to. I hope one of these days I die because fuck living a life like this.

Stuck in Hell,2,11du05x,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11du05x/stuck_in_hell/,1,"Have a shitty job, where I'm constantly worried I'm going to be fired. Hardly make enough to survive, Cant quit because then I would be homeless with nowhere to go. Having super depression and anxiety since there's constant teasing and very toxic work environment. There's about 2 people who really enjoy trying to make people miserable, mainly just me. The type of teasing they do is basically mocking me when no one else is around, doing things that they can tell makes me sad and triggers me but would probably make me seem insane if I went to anyone for help and could just easily deny it. They probably know I'm depressed, but don't seem to care  but make it seem like I'm using drugs which I don't.  Maybe they actual do think I'm on drugs. They are friends with the boss so I'm sure the boss also thinks this so I probably have no future at this employer. I can't really get much time off to look for other employment, and I am so mentally drained. I don't know what to do. I just get home, try to eat a little and lay in bed to wait for the torture to begin again. Why do people do this to others. I feel almost paralyzed with fear/depression...",1677550260.0
"Lonely and Listless (TW Brief mention of a ""suicide attempt"")",1,11d622x,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11d622x/lonely_and_listless_tw_brief_mention_of_a_suicide/,0,"Most of my friends have left, and the remaining ones are often busy. I've been jobless since fall 2020. My girlfriend left me which caused my first ""suicide attempt"". I have no motivation to do anything, even hobbies. I end up sitting in bed watching TV or YouTube while also browsing Reddit. Sometimes the stupid upvotes give me a tiny jolt of seratonin, but the last few days, people have been attacking me and calling me stupid. 

I thought I was making progress in January, but Valentine's Day reset me. I can't stop missing her. She left because I didn't love myself and pushed her away as a result. I don't hate myself anymore, but I'm still stuck. All I want is for her to take me back but I know I need to be in a better place because it wasn't fair for her to be with someone who was as stuck as I am.

I thought I found a job I could do, but I never applied. It sounded like a good job for me. It seemed like low stress and it was a job that would be helping people (which is highly important to me). Why can't I just apply? Why am I so fucking scared? I tried taking a Google job certificate course in IT Support but I got to a certain point and now I just have zero ability to motivate myself. It's always ""I'll do it tomorrow when I have nothing else going on"".

I have the same problem when my doctor asks me to get blood work done. I always tell myself that ""tonight is the night I won't drink something after midnight (other than water) that will affect the test results in the morning"" but then I end up anxious about going to do the test resulting in me not being able to sleep. So then I need a drink, and of course I give myself a flavored drink to make myself feel better for the few moments the flavor lingers.

My sleep pattern is fucked. I can't sleep for more than a couple hours at a time and then I can't fall back asleep. Then during the day I can't keep my eyes open. I have no energy.

I'm also gaining weight again after seeing a dietician and losing some.

I see a counselor biweekly who is the best counselor I've ever had, but the time in between appointments is like drowning in a maelstrom. I'm on medication too but that hasn't helped even though I've tried a few.

TL; DR: How the fuck do I get unstuck? How the fuck do I combat my complete lack of motivation or energy? I'm 34 and it feels like I've got nothing left and it's too late to fix myself and fix the things I've broken. How do I repair them? I know this is a lot of questions...

Addendum: As I write this, I feel stupid, like I can't express my thoughts coherently and intelligently. I feel as though my word choice is poor and unvaried. Fuck I'm messed up.",1677483975.0
