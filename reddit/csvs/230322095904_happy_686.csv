I got some of those Munchlings, they're little blind boxes that come with a mystery Disney character in the shape of food that are scented. I got a dupe, Winnie the Pooh as a honey roll.

I walked around for another couple hours, but I felt weird approaching a family and offering them a plushie out of the blue. We decided to call it a day, and we got the boat at Disney Springs and got off at French Quarter. When we got off, there's this young girl who stood with her mom and held the gate open for all the passengers. I thanked her and almost forgot about the Winnie plushie. So I went back, handed it to her and told her that I had a double, and she deserved to have this one for being so polite.

I don‚Äôt wanna overshare but these goddamn health conditions destroyed my mental health, the end of my teens, and almost killed me twice. 

But!!!!!! BUT!!!!!! 

This year I decided I was going to try to get out of here. That at least if I lived somewhere I liked, I‚Äôd probably be happier. So I applied to my dream school. The dream program for the only career I‚Äôve ever really wanted, thinking it was a total waste, that I was never good enough to make it, and especially not now. 

And I got in. 

It‚Äôs been a few days and it still doesn‚Äôt feel real. Every time I remember it I just want to cry and scream and jump around like a maniac. I don‚Äôt think I can explain in words how much this means to me. But the most important part of my soul almost died and I somehow survived long enough and did well enough that they saw something in me. 

I feel so validated and proud and excited about life for the first time in ages. This is genuinely the greatest thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me. I don‚Äôt start until September... I can‚Äôt even imagine how much happier I‚Äôll feel when I get to Toronto. 
I know I have to focus on school and it‚Äôll be so much work but it‚Äôs work that I love. 

It‚Äôs like I can see this life that I never dreamed I could really have, and I‚Äôm finally on the way towards it. 

I just wanted to share because I feel like I‚Äôm bursting at the seams and I don‚Äôt know how to talk about things with real life people without it sounding like bragging or without rambling for ages. Hopefully this makes someone smile a little. :)",1679363130.0

I would like to thank the Children's hospital for providing me with 2 weeks of food (I swear, is that the longest time me being neglected has had?)

Unfortunately, I tried to get in with the last 2 weeks but it seems like your age is cut-off. So I ended up in the general hospital as maybe the youngest person to be there. If not, I'm probably the second one to spend the birthday as legal age there.

I said that if I had a 10% chance to meet one of the Children's hospital's nurse again, it would be worth it. I did exactly like I said.

And there she was. I don't regret anything. I've made no mistakes that I know of and my smile was always on.

Some people started crying I think at the hospital because of my nicee actions.

The ""thank you"" page on their website is broken sadly, but I would have typed out ""thank you for raising me"".

I worked countless hours to pay back the 2 weeks of food. Not a single second wasted in my 12-14 hour workdays.

We met just under a week ago on Reddit and fell hard for each other. Her name's Julia, and she's my sugarplum. We're so perfect for each other! I've written her six poems so far and four posts exploring the raw feelings and thoughts I have for her. It's simply crazy! There's someone special for me. Me! That shouldn't be allowed under the Laws of Thermodynamics. That bears some explanation. 

See, I'm a trans, schizoaffective and autistic juggler and cult leader. About as penguin of d00m one can be while still being self-aware of myself as humanly possible. I haven't dated or hooked up with anyone in five years; that's when my ex and I escaped from a real cult, not to be confused with the fun marketing campaign I use to get people to read my awakening propaganda here on Reddit. After, we parted ways because the experience of literally being turned into gaslit, manipulated, and brainwashed slaves changed us into different people. I then spiraled into homelessness for three years while traveling the country until the FBI v& me for applying all I learned about marketing over the years to generate approximately one hundred thousand views on my profile per day. So what if they couldn't tell if I was serious about fucking my dead sister after dismembering her as I spammed the most demented and deranged content across random comment sections? I got people of critical target demographics to learn philosophy, spirituality, and mental health skills.

Anyways, sorry I had to explain how impossible it has been to find someone to accept my crazy ass that still believes the CIA is programming me for a mission. Everybody ghosts you when you're like me and open up about anything a single standard unit of deviation away from the norm. Now, I'm honestly a nontraditional monk, so I haven't been ruled by loneliness, but the last couple of years where I've been housed have had moments with many tears.

But, as of last Saturday, that's all changed! I found the perfect person who has already filled me to the brim with feelings I haven't felt in forever. They've taught me more about myself and what I really like in a person. I was aiming to find a carbon copy of me in order to have my significant other be able to understand me and vice versa, but Julia's very different from me in a lot of ways. But, the affection and passion we exchange...it's utterly divine!

We're so compatible in every which way. Romantically, we give each other a star's worth of warmth and care and nurturing we need. Sexually, well, I'll just say I had no idea I was a sub before meeting her. Artistically, I make the art and she reads everything I create. Intellectually, she matches me on handling herself in a debate, but we prefer discovering our differing opinions on things instead of butting heads with each other. And spiritually, I feel like I've been waiting my whole life to meet this woman, and her for me.

While things are great, like how I never realized that some songs I know are actually love songs, we are not in a perfect paradise. We've had a couple minor hiccups, but each time we took the time and effort to communicate with one another and express our needs, and that has shown us that we are more than capable of working things out over the long term. We really trust each other and are letting ourselves be completely vulnerable. Obviously, love is a massive thing and takes a lot of time and effort to get the ball really rolling, but this is something out of a fairy tale. Truly, Julia is magickal and I am under her spell, while I cast mine on her.

We're both so happy! I can't believe I deserve something this perfect, someone so sublimely magnificent, fantastic, and beautiful. Someone pinch me, this is a dream that I never want to end.",1679111738.0

I struggle with PTSD and besides work and errands I've been really struggling getting out for anything, and honestly I struggle with just doing those basics too. 

You know that saying ""we are what we eat?"" I'm feeling like I need to feed myself with happy or more positive things so maybe everything can feel a little less intense, dark, and heavy. I'm wondering if anyone might be able to post some upbeat, optimistic, or happy music video playlists. Music by itself doesn't seem to make me feel much anymore. But I found this music video playlist and it just helped to make things feel a little less heavy.

https://youtube.com/playlist?list=RDQMjsx7wq9UCXw&playnext=1

Any movies you guys can think of? TV shows? Most everything I've found as far as TV shows right now just seems dark or dystopian. Recently I found a show called Kim's Convenience on Netflix though. I liked it and it just feels light and kind of funny. Would be nice to find things that maybe are just hopeful and optimistic too. Things that are more playful or peaceful than intense.

I would appreciate any suggestions you all have.

Thanks!!",1678357674.0

It‚Äôs a long time to take to say I love you, I know. We both have had struggled with a lot of things in the past so the word means a lot to us. It took me over a year to say it and for his personal reasons (that we have had many discussions about), he warned me it would take him a longer time to say it. 

I‚Äôve known he‚Äôs loved me for a while, I was just waiting for the words. I never wanted to pressure him into saying it because he has showed me. Like on Valentines Day he accidentally got me sick and he just rubbed my stomach for an hour. Or he worked on a guitar song for me for months so it would be perfect. He‚Äôd sit there and listen to me as long as I needed.

When we first started dating, again he‚Äôd warned me it would take a while, because to him, saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù wasn‚Äôt just something to say, I very much agreed. To him, it meant he wanted to marry me, that he would take a bullet for me, that I‚Äôm up there with his mom and sister (he‚Äôs very close to them).

I knew that when he said it too it would be a MAJOR deal because his ex left him in the middle of a medical emergency. The only girl he said it too before me. So to say it again, it was scary to him. He didn‚Äôt want me to ever be hurt or heartbroken after hearing those words. He thinks I‚Äôm so pure and so good that he couldn‚Äôt bear to hurt me. But he said them to me!!!! And it‚Äôs been a while of me waiting to hear those words but I wouldn‚Äôt change it for anything!! I know how big that was for him, how major of a step that was for him. 

We have been super happy in our relationship. But this past week has been like utter bliss and then last night happened and I am literally over the moon!! I cried when he said it, then asked him to say it 2 more times lol.

All the waiting and dating for almost 3 years, it honestly made that moment so special. It made it so much more emotional and meaningful. 

He‚Äôs the only guy I said it to and he‚Äôs the only guy to say it to me so I feel like I‚Äôm back in a honeymoon phase with him. I couldn‚Äôt be happier with him than I am right now. 

I wouldn‚Äôt change anything about how our relationship has been!

We stay in their luxury condo, drive in their expensive cars, and have our needs met by their hired help ‚Äì many would consider this the epitome of wealth.

My wife and I, on the other hand, live in a small apartment, drive a leased Toyota, and do our own chores ‚Äì we struggle to pay the bills some months.

I‚Äôve been extremely happy since the day I met my wonderful wife, but I now know how truly rich I am.

You see, my wife‚Äôs sister and her husband have more money than we will ever know, but they fight daily; they are both deeply unhappy, and it‚Äôs obvious how they try to fill that hole with fancy things. 

When my wife and I take their kids, they are happy, well behaved, and average two and six year olds. The moment their parents walk in, they become spoiled, screaming, attention-starved brats.

I‚Äôve noticed their kids have been showing how much they envy my family, as we interact with each other and our son. It‚Äôs very sad, but also very obvious that they see how fundamentally happy and loving we are, and they want to be a part of it.

My intention here is not to criticize my in-laws, though ‚Äî I love them very much. It‚Äôs just that living with people that have all the money in the world has shown me that I have things they can‚Äôt buy: love, loyalty, and friendship.

It‚Äôs a cliche, but: ‚Äú*Clich√©s are clich√©‚Äôd precisely because they are valid enough to warrant endless repetition*‚Äù.

On Monday, I met up with my employer and she told me I‚Äôll be able to have a regular, part-time role (I was originally told I was going to be a substitute).

On Tuesday, I got a lot of work done in my school‚Äôs library. There‚Äôs something so peaceful about doing work on the 8th floor of the library, hot coffee next to me, with the sky slowly getting darker. 

On Wednesday, I went out for a walk since it was so nice out!!! I also got closure with a friend I lost touch with, something I subconsciously needed for a few years. 

On Thursday, I had my first therapy appointment (something long overdue), aced my psychopathology midterm, and got boba with my friend!!! 

Yesterday, I took the day for myself and didn‚Äôt do homework so I could properly unwind after the last few weeks. 

And today, I finished my drug awareness essay I had been procrastinating on, and I‚Äôm about to start watching a new episode of one of my favorite animes!!!! 

This week has been VERY kind to me and I am extremely thankful. I can tell March is going to continue being kind to me, and not just because my birthday is soon and I‚Äôm getting my first tattoo. 

I hope you all are doing well and I wish you a great week!!!!!! ü´∂üèºü´∂üèºü´∂üèº",1677975523.0

I'm just so peacefull in my life, last summer i posted about suicide and my chronic depression was at the lowest and honestly had the idea of trying to kms and serious plan and opportunity to do it. My life before was a whole valley of trauma,  i never had the luck to being born in a happy family, system who failed to protect me, doctor and teacher who always pretended to see nothing about bullying or domestic violence. 

My love life was also an hell, when u never learn how to love and grew up for surviving u become the perfect victim for every kind, broken abusive kid like you or other who don't have any reason to be ah other than it was easy to abuse you and they won't remember about ur name or being shocked by the consequences their actions provoked. Therapist failed me for good, i hate meds cuz they put me in when i was younger and i had a serious past of od and addiction to shit like valium and xanax. 

Now i just feel like i finally can take a breath, i finally had the strongness to escape an abusive relationship i was trapped in, to take time for myself during month's and i never collapsed again. 

It's been almost 5 month's since i met my bf, we live together, we wanna adopt a rabbit or a kitten together. It's just so calm, i do my stuff, we sometime lay on each others but we just choose to break the cycle, now i restart my life slowly, finish to do my paper and i will restart my studies in the domain i love ! (makeup and hairdress) 

I always did what my parents wanted in terms of studies and as a result I had to stop high school because of burn out and since then I don't have my highschool diploma and I can't set foot in a school without having a panic attack, so all of this is surely ridiculous in the eyes of the world, but it makes me happy to do it at my own pace for me, to see myself, the child I left in my childhood room who was crying silently and hoping that she wouldn't die tonight. 

&#x200B;

I am saving her little by little, I am sad about the past but I have a lot of hope for the future, I am doing my best, the bagel of dissociations that is my life is filling up little by little.

Citizens who consume art tend to be happier than those who don't. [A study of more than 20,000](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332097023_Does_Art_Make_Us_Happy) adults found those who went to the theater, concerts and read often reported more positive well-being. Researchers from the Institute of Social Sciences Ivo Pilar recruited 4,000 Croatians to test a similar hypothesis. [They found a positive correlation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-010-9724-2) between subjective well-being and time spent on leisure activities such as going to art exhibitions. Medical researcher [Grossi also identified the link ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265139702_Cultural_Participation_Relational_Goods_and_Individual_Subjective_Well-Being_Some_Empirical_Evidence)among Italians who consumed music, literature, and art.

Art can improve your subjective well-being by influencing how you feel. *The Blind Side* is a movie about Michael Oher, a homeless Afro-American kid who eventually becomes a first-round NFL draft pick. For non-American football watchers like me, let me explain. Drafts allow teams to recruit players throughout the rounds, as few as seven and as many as thirty. A team picking Michael in the first round meant they found him so valuable they couldn't risk losing him. This story is bound to elicit positive emotions in almost anyone because we can[ place ourselves in the fictional story.](https://nicolasforero.substack.com/p/you-should-probably-watch-more-netflix) We can feel the protagonist's thankfulness, respect, and courage. ""He deserved that,"" we all think.

*Quick note: You might be thinking, who are you, and why should I listen to you? I'm a social scientist, author of In the Arms of Morpheus, a human behavior newsletter.* *Pleasure to meet you :)*

There's a chance plays, movies, and artwork won't make you feel emotional easily. It's common among ""cold"" people, those who don't often bring their emotions to the forefront or who lack the vocabulary to voice the emotions they feel. As a ""cold"" person, I can tell you that art can still improve your well-being. 

Art can make your brain simulate how you would act in complex situations you haven't lived without paying the cost of living them. In[ You Should Probably Watch More Netflix](https://nicolasforero.substack.com/p/you-should-probably-watch-more-netflix), I wrote:

""You don't know how you will react to discovering your partner cheats on you until it happens. And I can't think of anyone who would like to experience that to know what it feels like. Watching or reading a fictional story of someone dealing with a cheater is a better alternative. ""

You open the space to think about how you would react to situations you might live in the future when you watch a fictional play, movie, or painting about those events. It is not guaranteed. But, often, the decision you come up with will have more benefits or fewer costs than the one you would have made without thinking. 

Let's say being cold is not the problem, but not liking art, or at least the art forms you can access. Art will improve your well-being even then because it can raise your status. Galas, art shows, and operas often host prestigious people. People who are more likely to change your career or life in the least amount of time or know someone who can. One conversation is all you need to outweigh the annoyance of yawning. With time, you might develop a taste for art and squish every drop of benefit.

Sometimes, your social status won't change, but the group itself will improve your subjective well-being. 

I'm part of a writing community called Foster. In 2023, twenty-five writers and I flew to Puerto Escondido for a four-day retreat. In it, I met people who fit the ideal of a friend I'd built over the years. My anxiety about meeting people like them was so pronounced that I spent five weeks in Mexico in 2022 because I felt I had more chances to meet them there. In close to 24 years of living, I hadn't found these people. So it does not sound irrational to believe it could've taken me more years if I hadn't participated in Foster. But I found them. And, thanks to that, I've been feeling more positive emotions than I've felt in months.

Now, if people who consume art are more likely to be happier, shouldn't most artists be happy? Or at least happier than the average population?

While I didn't find scientific data backing the idea that artists are unhappier, many artists I've met seem unhappier than others.

Of course, this could be an illusion. 

My experience and conventional wisdom tell me artists tend to be more attuned to their emotions and less ashamed of sharing them than people in other fields. How they feel about themselves and the world inspires them to create. Without emotions, few ideas would come, if any. There would be nothing to express. So when artists create, for example, poignant artwork, it isn't because they are in despair. But because they have the emotional serenity to discuss these events without affecting their feelings. 

If this is true, I can see how those who work as artists aren't unhappy, on average. But how the kind of people who want to become artists have inner challenges already and seek art to solve them. Their ""negative"" art is, thus, not proof of art affecting their well-being but of their need to express these emotions somewhere to heal. So the benefits of art are still there.[ Higher relaxation](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421656.2016.1166832),[ reduced anxiety](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.4276/030802213X13603244419077), and increased well-being. It's just that the average artist trying to enjoy them has gone through more than the average person. 

What I can see as a cause of unhappiness, though, is artists' average incomes. Architecture, design, and production are artistic paths that lead to an above-average income. But dancers, entertainers, actors, photographers, and musicians earn [less than other fields. ](https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/Artists-in-the-Workforce-Selected-Demographic-Characteristics-Prior-to-COVID%E2%80%9019.pdf)Fine arts, art directors, and animators earn, on average, $50,505 annually. More than the US median of $48,305 but below the average in business-oriented creative fields such as marketing, branding, and creative direction. 

As a result, many artists live in below-average rent, food, and safety conditions that affect their well-being. How ""bad"" these conditions can make them feel depends on how good or bad their social circle is doing. Studies have found that absolute income doesn't have a significant effect on life satisfaction. But[ relative income does](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797610362671?journalCode=pssa). Suppose an artist earning 30,000 a year hangs out with others earning the same. In that case, he might not obsess over his below-average living conditions. But dissatisfaction will likely come if everyone around them makes 200,000 a year.

Those ""sad"" artists you meet, assuming they are ""sad"" and not just attuned to their emotions, might be because of their past and living conditions. Not because art is not improving their well-being.

**So it's worth asking, how can you benefit from art?**

The obvious question is to ""do"" more art. Go to more museums, knit, and learn to play an instrument.

This is a valid suggestion, but there is a caveat. For art to bring the benefits we have described, you must be engaged in the activity. Quality of life researcher[ Alex Michalos found](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225498000_Impact_of_Arts-Related_Activities_on_the_Perceived_Quality_of_Life) weekly time spent on any of sixty-six art-related activities didn't predict happiness. But how engaged people were in the activities did. You won't know if you will like a particular creative activity, though. So benefiting from art might be a matter of jumping between artistic activities until you find the one you like and then building a habit of doing it.

""If you hear a voice within you say 'you cannot paint,' then by all means paint, and that voice will be silenced,"" said Vincent van Gogh. The most unfortunate thing that can happen is spending a few hours on an activity you don't like. The most pleasing is that you will have a method to be happy for the rest of your life.

**I'd love to hear about your experience with art. Do you consume or produce it often? What's motivating you to do so?**",1677432496.0

Thanks to someone I confided in on good ol' Reddit, and the maze of emotions I was trying to find a way through, she slapped some sense into me!  Long story short:  I just got married for the first time at the ripe young age of 60 (she's 55)!  I've had a successful career but was just too scared to get close to anyone.  It's a long story, and if you want details, well, you can read the whole sad story in my comments history.  Whether it was fate, luck, or some kind of conspiracy, the sister of my long-dead girlfriend came into my life.  She broke through the emotional walls I had built up over 3 decades and showed me that I am capable of loving without reservation.  Did that come out cheesy?  Ah, who cares? 

Anyway, she's never traveled outside the US so I told her we'd go anywhere in the world she wanted.  She made a list and we're going to cross off every single place!  We were in Hawaii a few days ago and just seeing her in the sunset, I knew I couldn't live without her.  So, I asked her to marry me, she said yes!  We are honeymooning in Japan at the time I'm writing this!  Pardon my rambling, but she makes me feel like I'm a teenager again and I'm looking forward to actually living again instead of merely existing.

Reddit and Redditors out there, you've given me an outlet for my frustrations, a place to tell the stories I've accumulated, and the opportunity to make a few friends along the way!  But it's time that we slow down.  I just want to let you know that it's not you, it's me, lol!

Wish me well on my new journey (or roast me, I don't care which, lol!).  I'm going back to my warm and no-longer empty bed!",1677256126.0

I lost all joy in life. As the years went on, some of my old self returned but my will to do anything was just gone. I lost my creativity, my motivation to do anything that I used too. I wasn't depressed, I just never thought about those things anymore. I felt broken but whole.

So anyway we talked and I just felt comfortable with them and it was like therapy; they listened and replied and it just made sense. They were so caring that I told them that I had to do something important and started crying; Not tears of sadness but of joy! I haven't smiled or felt so happy like that in a long time.

I was born 27 weeks premature (I weighed the same as a pound of butter at 1 pound 15 oz!) and spent my first 4 and 1/2 months in the Special Care Nursery. My lungs hadn't had the chance to fully develop, so I was on a respirator for 2 1/2 months-- and I had laser-eye surgery around that same time for something called ROP (Retinopathy of Prematurity). The laser surgery prevented me from going blind, but up until about 8 months ago, I still had to wear glasses with a very strong prescription. (As mentioned in a few interviews recently, I had a life-changing eye surgery back in April/May of last year, that gave me 20/20 vision for the first time ever!)  And that's just the tip of the iceberg!  Long story short: I overcame a lot in my first few years and was a little fighter! So to me, this song is a representation of everything I've been through. 

Hope this song and video makes you smile! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7zCsCkuhto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7zCsCkuhto)",1676818889.0

I wanted to share a personal story that I hope will inspire and motivate others to take control of their lives and make positive changes. A few years ago, I was in a really dark place. I was unhappy with my job, my relationships, and most importantly, myself. I felt like I was just going through the motions of life and wasn't living up to my full potential.

But I knew deep down that I wanted more for myself, and I decided to take action. I started small, setting achievable goals for myself each day, like going for a walk or reading a book. As I began to accomplish these goals, my confidence and self-esteem began to grow. I also started to surround myself with positive, supportive people who encouraged me to pursue my passions and dreams.

Eventually, I made some big changes in my life, like leaving my unfulfilling job and pursuing a career that I was truly passionate about. It wasn't easy, and there were definitely some bumps along the way, but I'm now living a life that I'm proud of and excited about.

I want to encourage anyone who's feeling stuck or unfulfilled to take the first step towards changing their life. You don't have to make big changes all at once, but every small step counts. Whether it's starting a new hobby, reaching out to old friends, or even just making your bed in the morning, every small action can lead to big changes.

I hope that my story can inspire others to take control of their lives and make positive changes, just like I did. Let's all support each other on this journey and remember that we're all capable of achieving great things.

Thanks for reading, and I'm excited to see what positive changes you all will make in your lives!

Warmly,

He often felt frustrated and defeated, and he found it hard to feel happy or positive about anything related to the bathroom.

One day, while he was in the middle of a particularly difficult experience, he heard a strange noise coming from outside the bathroom window. Curious, he peeked out and was surprised to see an old clown hopping around on the sidewalk below.

The clown was singing a delightful song of nonsense words, and his energy was infectious. The man found himself smiling despite himself, and he felt a sense of joy that he had not experienced in a long time.

The clown noticed the man looking out the window and waved cheerfully, inviting him to come outside and join in the fun. At first, the man was hesitant, but the clown's enthusiasm was contagious. He took a deep breath, gathered his courage, and stepped outside to join the clown.

Together, they hopped and danced to the rhythm of the clown's silly song, and the man felt his spirits lifted. For the first time in a long time, he felt truly happy, and he forgot all about his bathroom troubles.

As the sun set, the man said goodbye to the old clown, feeling grateful for the unexpected interruption that had brought him such joy. From that day on, he made a point to seek out moments of joy and happiness wherever he could find them, and he remembered the kindness of the old clown every time he went to the bathroom.

In the end, the man realized that happiness could be found even in the most unexpected places, and that life was too short to waste on worries and troubles. He learned to cherish the moments of joy and laughter that came his way, and he was forever grateful to the old clown who had helped him find his way back to happiness.",1676583788.0

My husband‚Äôs family never does favors for free (I get it) and even then, they won‚Äôt do any favors that would inconvenience them in any way (also understandable). My husband‚Äôs car broke down so we had to carpool in mine to work. He both work an hour away from home, right down the street from each other. His family all live within 5 min from our house. The problem with carpooling is that he works 7-4, i work 9-6. Our baby needs to be picked up from the sitter‚Äôs at 5:30 at the latest.

So i called my brother who lives 20 minutes away from my house, an hour + 20 min away from my work. I asked him if he could pick me up from work and take me home, so my husband and i could carpool in the morning and my husband can drive my car home after work to pick up the baby on time. He didn‚Äôt even hesitate to say ‚Äúokay, what time do you need me there?‚Äù I paused and told him ‚Äúit‚Äôs far though‚Ä¶i can pay you gas money or whatever an Uber would cost.‚Äù He told me ‚Äúnot necessary, just let me know what time you need me there and I‚Äôll be there.‚Äù

This is super early into our relationship, I know, I mean we still barely know each other, but from the little I do know about her I honestly think I might truly love her.

A little more than a year ago, I broke up with my ex-gf who I was together with for a year before that. Despite me breaking up with her, I had a lot of fun and enjoyable life experiences with her during our time together, and ever since we broke up I met a few more girls here and then, but we never had the same connection like I did with my ex, and they never appealed to me like my ex did.

For the first time, this girl I'm seeing right now, I like her more than I did my ex or anyone else, I think she could be the one. I keep saying this hesitatingly because it's still super early and we have much to learn about each other, but I am really hopeful we could build an amazing long-term relationship together.

I've only been with her a week, and she can be kinda rough and frustrating, but I've never been so sure or happy in my entire life.

I've been stuck in a long cycle of being down on my luck, having issues with relationships and severe depression. My heartache started last February when I had to let go of my cats for a deathly allergic roomate and had them rehomed to my absolute dismay. My mother stopped talking to me and my entire relationships and financial stability in ruin.

And three weeks ago, I had an abortion I regretted (and still do) greatly that hurt me very bad, as I felt I had lost something that I couldn't fathom not being able to love, but had to let go because I and my partner were not in the place or able to take care of it. This specifically destroyed me and I had almost taken my life because it was too much to handle with the guilt I felt

But then I got Yumemi (my puppy) and I've never been so in love. Not only did things look up for me with getting her, but this adorable little girl literally saved me from myself. The love I have for her is immense and the week, almost two come tomorrow, had been the happiest things have ever been for me, and the way my life so positively turned around getting her makes it all the better.

I'd do anything for this puppy, which means I'm going to push on, and grow with her. Sorry if this was ranty or edgy, but here's a photo of Yumemi (right) with my roommates Chihuahua, Concha (left) and some more photos (including her first walkies and my fave picture of her first pup cup)",1675491748.0

We met on tinder somehow, first date went great and the rest is history over 3 years later. 
I've never felt so comfortable with anyone. I have so many odd quirks, so many weird things I can't do or don't like. Yet I'm so comfortable being open about my weirdness and have someone who tries to accept and compromise with me on the things I can't or don't want to do. Someone who has given me such a solid foundation to a relationship. No lying, nothing suspicious. Just love, trust, respect, and consistency. 

He helps me take care of my grandparents, he supports me through school and a career change while he was going through his own, does the tedious daily tasks (like cooking and cleaning) that I sometimes don't have the patience or energy for. Takes care of me when I need it but also knows I'm independent. His friends are amazing and he easily gets along with mine. Hes also handsome as can be and exactly my type üòâ How could I be any happier! 

He realizes things he can work on for both himself and our relationship. Prioritizing mental and physical health as well as trying to be better at communicating (which we both are working on)

I never used to want to have a serious relationship, get married, or live with anyone. Now we've been living together for a while and I wouldn't have it any other way.

I also wanted a collection of pretty rocks- I have one. I wanted to know the names of different wild plants and trees- and I do, at least for the Boreal Biome. I have struggled with self loathing for most of my life- and I realized the version of me I hated no longer exists. I‚Äôm not that person. Maybe that person never really existed in the first place. I wanted a romantic partner who loves me for me. Who I don‚Äôt have to try and be someone I‚Äôm not when I‚Äôm with them. Who understands and appreciates the same things I do. This dream felt impossible, that such a person could not exist. But they do, and I am so grateful to have them in my life.

What‚Äôs your story? Do you have any regrets about the timing of having your first born? Was it planned or an accident? How did you and your partner took it and handled it?

I am asking because I (27F) virgin who has lived a very stressful life most of my life, with not much life experiences..
spent most of my life at home, with almost no social life studying all day.. and only had 2 six months relationships.. my mom always told me to wait till marriage to do anything that I want to do, such as travelling with my partner, sleepovers etc.. this made me very lonely over time as most people wasn‚Äôt living that life still and didn‚Äôt want to date me.. or even befriend me as I had a different mindset 

I am still studying and living with my mom.. and doesn‚Äôt have the freedom and money to do what I truly want.. like going out to parties, activities with friends etc.. 

I am naturally extroverted but I‚Äôve been living a very introverted life for as far as I know.. this left me with mental health issues, no friends..

I haven‚Äôt lived the life that I wanted to live at all and has been so unhappy for the past 13 years.. I am finally graduating this semester.. and I met a gentleman (28M) a year ago who asked me to be his girlfriend about a month ago.. 

We‚Äôve been together for 2 weeks and yesterday he expressed his desire to have kids in 1 year.. while I feel like I would need at least 5 years.. only because my body probably wouldn‚Äôt allow me to wait for 10 years.

He also would like to marry me first of course. But I am so tired from studying, switching careers and all that I do not mentally feel ready for kids at all. I want some time for my self and for us.. to rest, live life, find happiness, and better prepare to have kids.. before bringing them to the world.

If I have kids anytime soon, I feel like they will prevent me from finally living my life.. as they will constantly need me. And the fact that I never truly been happy in life makes me scared that I won‚Äôt know how to make them happy.

My partner on the other claims that he is always happy and has much more life experiences than me.. travelled around and had great life experiences with his friends and previous partners and lived his life much more than I did. Maybe that‚Äôs why he feels ready today.

Am I exaggerating? Are my worries valid?

501,Reasons Why You‚Äôre Feeling Restless and Unmotivated,21,10o9zmu,happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/10o9zmu/reasons_why_youre_feeling_restless_and_unmotivated/,1," 

Being restless means you feel the need to constantly move, can‚Äôt calm your mind, or both. It can also come with hyperactivity, anxiety, palpitations, agitation, or not being able to sleep(**insomnia**).

Being restless means being unmotivated and having trouble focusing on or completing tasks. For example, when you‚Äôre restless you may find yourself unable to focus on anything for very long and find yourself unable to get anything done. Other times, being restless means feeling anxious or nervous without knowing why. For example, you may feel restless and anxious when you‚Äôre at home, but when you‚Äôre at work you feel perfectly fine.

Sometimes people feel restless when they‚Äôre unmotivated. When you don‚Äôt feel like doing anything, you‚Äôre often said to be ‚Äútoo restless to sit still.‚Äù This isn‚Äôt the same thing as feeling anxious instead, it‚Äôs a kind of low energy and a lack of motivation. Sometimes people use the word ‚Äúrestless‚Äù to describe being unable to relax or unable to stop moving.

## 12 Common Reasons for Feeling Restless And Unmotivated :

#### 1-You Don‚Äôt Have a Clear Goal:

It is hard to stay motivated when you don‚Äôt have a clear goal. It would be helpful to have a goal that you could see yourself achieving. Once you have this goal in mind, you will be more motivated to work towards it. If you don‚Äôt have a clear target, it becomes much more difficult to stay on track and push yourself. Having a good aim will help keep your motivation strong, as well as see the progress you‚Äôre making towards your goal.  
To increase your likelihood of success, set small goals that are both manageable and challenging.

2-Pursuing many goals at once:

People who say that we can achieve anything we want in our lives do not mean that we can achieve all things simultaneously. If we have multiple goals, we need to achieve them one at a time. Working on too many things simultaneously can lead to feelings of restlessness and dissatisfaction. It is important to choose your goals wisely and to avoid multitasking if possible. Doing things one at a time will lead to greater success.

#### 3-Not Getting Enough Sleep:

Not getting enough sleep can make you feel restless and unmotivated. Make sure you get enough sleep each night so you can feel more energetic and motivated during the day. When you don‚Äôt get enough sleep, you‚Äôll be tired during the day, you won‚Äôt be able to focus, and you won‚Äôt want to do anything...[**Read More**](https://viemina.com/12-reasons-why-youre-feeling-restless-and-unmotivated/)",1675005397.0

As you can guess my confidence was non existent. I had an interview yesterday and the employer actually went out there way to accommodate my dyslexia.

The interview went so well that they offered me the job the next day.

The best thing you can do is embrace change and learn how to deal with it.

In the face of change, sometimes the best thing to do is to change nothing. Other times, the best thing to do is to change everything. The choice is yours. The only constant in life changes and the only thing that can be changed is what you choose to focus on.

Change is inevitable. One minute you may be living in a difficult moment and the next you may be living a happy one. Remember that everything is constantly changing. Change is inevitable in any field, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it has to be a bad thing. Learning from your mistakes, as well as your successes, is crucial for growth and improvement. Embracing change and making it work for you can be the key to happiness and success in your life and your career.

**15 Ways to Embrace Change in Your Life :**

**1-Identifying change :**

If the change impacts you negatively, do not run from or attempt to hide the discomfort. Instead, name the change. The ability to identify the emotions elicited by a change can help you to accept the change more quickly. If you find yourself feeling stressed, frustrated, or anxious, take a moment to consider what is causing those emotions. Acknowledging the discomfort will allow you to understand what parts of the situation you can control and what parts you cannot.

**2-Remember that change is necessary and ordinary:**

It can be difficult to accept that change is simply a part of life. However, if you can keep this in mind, it may help you to better deal with change, especially if you are currently facing an uncertain transition. Keep in mind that change is often necessary, and this can help change your mindset.

**3-Look at the situation optimistically:**

It can be difficult to see how change might positively impact your life; usually, people default to considering the negative consequences first. But there‚Äôs no use dwelling on the negative try thinking about the opposite instead. When facing a change, it can be helpful to make a list of all the potential benefits. This can help you to stay positive and focused on the potential outcomes. The people around you may also benefit from the change, so it is worth considering how they will be affected. Whenever you need motivation, refer back to a list of the positive changes, both short and long-term, that this will bring about in your life.

**4-Keep a diary:**

It is useful to take notes about your thoughts, reactions, purposes, and dreams when you start your journey. Writing in a diary once a day or once a week will help you see your story. This will help you deconstruct, reinvigorate, and love your life.

**5-Preparation:**

The goal of the preparation stage is to get yourself ready for the change. This means doing the mental work and planning so that you can take the steps needed to make the change you want. By the end of this phase, you will truly believe in your ability to change.

**6- Visualize the change in your mind**...[Read More](https://viemina.com/how-to-embrace-change-in-your-life/)",1674862453.0

534,How to boost your mood with simple and easy ways,27,10ki6xs,happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/10ki6xs/how_to_boost_your_mood_with_simple_and_easy_ways/,2,"  Having a bad day? Feeling down? We all have those days. Life is unpredictable and it can be hard to stay positive. It‚Äôs normal to experience low moods or feel overwhelmed with day-to-day tasks. In these uncertain times, it can be difficult to find joy and peace. The constant worries and anxieties of everyday life can leave us feeling exhausted and overwhelmed. But, it is important to remember that our mental and physical health are connected and that being in a good mood can help us stay healthy and optimistic. Fortunately, there are a few simple steps we can take to boost our mood and cultivate more joy in our lives:

## 1-Get up early:

When setting your alarm, aim for 15 minutes before your usual wake-up time. You'll be able to plan your day better and be more productive with this extra time. Allowing yourself this extra 15 minutes in the morning can make a huge difference in how your day progresses.

## 2-Go outside:

Even though it sounds simple, being outside in the fresh air may make all the difference. Our bodies were not made to sit in front of fluorescent lights all day. You'll feel more at peace if you get some fresh air. Taking some time to enjoy nature and step away from the stresses of everyday [life](https://youtu.be/S6ntQQ68c54) can have a significant positive effect on both our mental and physical health. Whether it's a walk in the park or a hike up a mountain, immersing yourself in nature can do wonders for the soul.

## 3-Workout:

It's likely that you've heard that exercise releases endorphins, which provide the familiar and cherished emotion of happiness. Yes, it is true! Turning your day around might be as simple as going for a walk or a run, or working out with weights to release stress. Not only does physical activity produce endorphins, but it can also help alleviate symptoms of depression, reduce stress, and increase self-confidence.

## 4-SMILE:

It may seem far-fetched, but research suggests that forcing a smile triggers an increase in positive emotions, as the muscles used in a genuine smile release endorphins that interact with the brain to make you feel good. So smile and laugh. it's easy.

## 5-Treat yourself:

What do you find enjoyable? Is it a book? a tasty hot beverage? Chocolate? To escape that rut, reward yourself from time to time. After all, there's nothing wrong with taking a break and rewarding yourself after hard work.

## 6-Pet your animal:

Take a moment to pet your pet, whether it's a dog, cat, or some kind of bird‚Äîwhatever pet you chose to have. You feel happier and less stressed after petting an animal. After all, what's there to be upset about when your pet is beaming at you?

## 7-Give a hug:

It is scientifically proven that hugging someone we love for a few seconds makes us feel happier, safer, and more cherished. all of that in under a minute! (But be sure the person you're hugging wants to be held, or you might be in trouble.) This simple act of physical contact can have an enormous impact on a person's mental state, reducing stress, calming the nerves, and providing a sense of security and comfort.

## 8-Take a nap:

Taking a nap might sound counterintuitive when you're in need of a mood boost, but according to a study from the National Sleep Foundation, it can actually be beneficial. It's because a nap gives your body and mind the opportunity to rest and rejuvenate, which can help reduce stress levels, improve your mood, and increase your energy. It's important to keep the length of your nap in check, though, as too much sleep may leave you feeling groggy and sluggish. That's why it's important to choose the right length for your afternoon siesta‚Äîa quick 20-minute nap should be just right for a mood boost!

## 9-Have some mood-boosting foods:

Eating certain foods can help boost your mood and make your day a bit brighter. Whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats are all important nutrients to add to your diet to help with mood regulation. Foods like dark chocolate and walnuts are especially helpful in releasing endorphins, which can make you feel good.

## 10-Drink more water :

Making sure to drink plenty of water can also help you stay hydrated and energized throughout the day, further contributing to your mood.

## 11-Put on your favorite dress:

Wearing something that you feel comfortable and confident in can bring about a feeling of happiness and even help boost your productivity. Wearing some of your favorite clothes will instantly lift your spirits and make you feel more prepared for the day, even if you spend the entire day at home.

## 12-Keep up with hobbies:

Occupying oneself with a hobby is a really beneficial way to remain content and motivated. A hobby may be the honing of a skill, a craft, or simply an enjoyable pastime that enables one to relax and take a break.

## 13-Get More Sleep:

When one is tired, they are not themselves, and partial sleep deprivation can have a huge impact on one's mood. Sleep is essential to lead a healthy and successful life.

## 14-Have a quick tidy-up:

Make sure to reserve some time, even if it‚Äôs just for five minutes each day, to tidy your environment as it will be beneficial for your mental health.

Some people at work know I'm working on this, but they don't know that I'm trying to get it done BEFORE the outside firm finishes their work on our project.

I was tired of having my GT 1030 PC which was struggling to run games made past the mid 2010s which was extremely frustrating for playing new games with my friends. Alas,  at the end of the summer I had saved up $2000 dollars and bought all the parts for my pc. I build it and nothing. No signs of life at all. Did some diagnosing and thought I had found the reason why it wouldn't work. A defective part. Was so certain of the issue that I returned the part I ordered and got a replacement. Still wouldn't work. I was so certain I did it AGAIN! STILL WOULDN'T WORK. Was so mad that I gave up and for about a month was very down. I sacrificed hours of good times with friends for something that didn't work? I thought about it everyday and thought that I had just wasted a summer in one of the best times of a human life due to no responsibilities and less accountability. Don't want to sound cheesy but I genuinely felt depressed. Eventually I started to forget and over time it started to matter less as in school I was doing good. Great friends, the highest grades I'd had in my life so far, and enjoying life in general. However as Christmas came around, there was one thing I wanted. To fix my computer and put that chapter behind me and be able to move on. My dad offered to help and a couple days after Christmas we took it to a repair shop. I don't know what the issue was, and frankly I don't care as I have finally moved on from this difficult part of my life as the PC is working and I am currently typing this from it. These past few weeks have been on the same level or better than the days before covid. I really hope that later in life when I'm, going through a rough time I can look back on this post and think that there might be a light at the end of the tunnel :)",1674531130.0

I have some great things going for me: I was born with a fully functioning body (besides allergies) and to two amazing parents who, although they both have mental health challenges, love me. I had access to public education as a kid. And I'm really smart (not a genius though, but pretty close) 

But other things were tough right from the get go: I have autism for one. I couldn't enunciate enough to be coherent until I was about eight (I still struggle with being heard right to this day). At that point,  I was diagnosed bipolar because I tried to kill myself. I believe part of this was due to trauma that happened when I was four. Regardless, my brain had stopped regulating emotions and, from that point, I was either trying to rule the world (with full confidence that I could) or trying to avoid humanity and sleep until I passed away. I was still forced to go to school where, although I received top marks without caring, I refused to conform and became the target of my peers and sometimes my teachers wrath(this would continue until I graduated.)

After that I was repeatedly hospitalized for being a danger to myself, or not being able to take care of myself. (16 times) 

BUT here's the good part:
Life is good! Things are still hard, my meds don't help 100% and I'm struggling with housing, but even when I'm down, I love life! It's the little things that truly count. A leaf from a tree, dipping your fingers in a stream, finishing an art project, a smile from a stranger,  or having just enough money for Starbucks hot chocolate and being able to tip the change. You might ask why do all these things make me rich if they have no measurable value? Why does this make up for the hard things?  Because I chose to give them value.  When we are grateful, we give value to the things which the universe has given to us, and that makes us all the richer. Maybe the key to happiness isn't getting more, but placing more value in the good things which we do have. 

Going forward, I want to fall in love (and get married). I want to hike from Mexico to Canada, and am planning on doing this on the CDT with my mom in a few years. I want to adopt a kitten and see it through its whole life. I want to experience as much as I can of what the earth has to offer me. I have hope that I can find a little thing everyday, and that makes me happy.",1674347508.0

But through team work and cooperation we can get the answer faster.

today i ordered a lyft to get me from the airport to a gas station to buy some cigs and on the way i chatted up the driver along the way. to my amazement, i offered 25 in cashapp to get me 3 packs(since i dont have my ID) and a ride back and he did it with such kindness. he even offered to book me a hotel for the night to save me having to stay at the airport.

i got his contact info and let him know id probably take him up on his offer. something about the whole experience left me all giddy and smiling. its just good to see good people doing good things for others. even if it seems too small to matter or too big of a nuisance, to the one needing the help it could mean the whole world.

i hope this story makes someone as happy as i am right now.

I had a shitty immune system, extreme irritation, self-harm, paranoia, occasional hallucinations, etc. And my parents were considering supporting me for the rest of my life and not sending me off to post-secondary. Thankfully, my school advisor heavily pushed for it and said to give it a go, since my grades made the bare minimum for acceptance. 

After moving out for university, however, I landed my ass in a very chilly apartment. It was really fucking cold, so I had to bring a bunch of extra blankets. The weight was oddly comforting and helped me sleep. Within a week, just about every mental issue plaguing me was gone, and afterward I realized I hadn‚Äôt been seriously sick for an entire year. When I went back home to visit though, some of my symptoms came back. Anyways, I realized most of my symptoms were chalked up to sleep deprivation because my parents‚Äô house is too hot. After they turned down the thermostat I was back to normal. 

I‚Äôve been sleep deprived for 17 years and everyone thought it was mental illness. I‚Äôm so happy that I‚Äôve been ‚Äúcured‚Äù. I‚Äôve gained an appetite for the first time, my skin is clear and not scabby, and my mind feels so clear. My physical health is getting better too, as I‚Äôm no longer as sickly and put on healthy weight. I‚Äôm ecstatic and feel amazing, and have been acing my exams without any special accommodations.

Looking back, I think my first inkling that this wasn‚Äôt a mental illness was that I was like a different person on vacations, when I got to stay in a heavily air conditioned hotel room all day and got proper sleep. But as I got older and struggled more with school, I couldn‚Äôt afford to go on vacations anymore. Better late than never though, I‚Äôm just thankful that everything is sorted.",1673940705.0

So a while ago I [28F] started talking to someone [27M] via Reddit chat. We immediately hit it off and had a lot of fun talking to eachother, with deep and long conversations. We told eachother real personal stuff though, things you don't easily tell people in real life. It's Reddit so it's all anonymous and we're never going to meet.


I'm from a tiny ass country in Europe (Netherlands) where Reddit isn't super popular, so you don't often meet people that are on Reddit (although it's increasing) or even know about it. I felt completely safe sharing all this personal stuff with a stranger, because he was just that, a stranger. It might've turned kinda flirty at some point. No harm in that right? It's all anonymous.


After talking for a while he said something regarding the weather at his location, which was stunningly similar to mine. The realisation kinda dawned on me, so I asked where he was based. Lo and behold, he told me he was from the Netherlands. I sat there looking at my screen for a good bit. I couldn't believe it. How big is that chance?


We'd been communicating solely in English at that point, as one does on Reddit. So I asked him which area, which turned out to be the same as mine. We live 30 minutes apart. My job is close to his house. So, I answered him in Dutch and let him know just how close to me that was.


After getting over the initial shock, we kept on talking and eventually exchanged numbers. Both deciding to lose the anonymity, we started to get to know eachother, kept on talking for hours and hours on end. So, after deciding he was thrust worthy, and he probably deciding the same for me, we decided to meet up.


A lot of tension had been building at that point, but we also already knew things about the other that we'd only told our best friends, or in some cases no one. That's a real different starting point then one normally has when going on a first date.


Well, Reddit, it was amazing. We had so much fun, sparks were flying everywhere and it also turned out we have the same interests, some of the same hobbies, we ran in the same circles and, while our paths were wildly different, are now in the exact same phase in life. 


Over time, we started to figure out we also want the same things in life, have quite the same outlook on life and what we want life to be like, and we really can talk to eachother about anything. He's also smart, kind, insanely funny, considerate, caring, loving and also he's very, very hot. 


I felt super safe and comfortable with him from the start, and I not only started developing feelings, I was falling madly in love with this man who ticked off every single box, whom I met through f*cking Reddit, of all places. Who's going to believe that? 


I somehow never doubted he felt the same. I was looking for a catch, something wrong, but somehow everything felt and was right, even more so when we were together. We spoke about our feelings, with the added bonus of knowing things about eachother that not many people knew. 


And then, Reddit, he called me his girlfriend for the first time, and it was the best feeling in the world. A bit after that, I almost blurted out ""I love you"", but caught myself just in time. I thought about it, and realised I felt it, meant it. But, I also knew about his past and while I'm not going into that, at that moment I didn't want to put too much pressure on him.


So I waited, and almost blurted it out a couple times more. I knew this was some sort of russian roulette, which could only end up with me blurting out ""I LOVE YOU"" at a very inopportune moment. 
Reddit, I'm here to tell you that after a couple of days, HE told ME first. Oh, the pure and utter happiness I felt in that moment, I'm still relishing in it. So I told him I love him back, and the love we shared in that moment has to be what life is all about.


Right now, we're building the deepest connection I've ever build, and also having a connection that's so deep, so intense, that I've never had with anyone else. It feels like I'm right where I'm supposed to be, and I love him so, so much.


So I've got to thank you Reddit. Not only for being my source of entertainment, advice, lessons, laughs, tears, frustration, sadness, outrage, happiness, cute animals, funny animals, and everything in between. But also for changing my life in the most meaningful way, and having me meet my amazing boyfriend (I mean really, what are the chances? I tried to look it up, and there's like a 1 in 1500 chance someone is from the Netherlands, but there's so little data that I have no idea what the chances then are they're from the same area as us, so yeah). 


Truly, from the bottom of my heart, thank you.",1673171410.0

I have never heard that compliment before and since then I always wished a girl I was into would say the same about me because I feel like her husband and I share a lot of idealisms but I never wanted to force such a compliment, so I never told anybody about this desire.
Cut to now, I‚Äôve been talking with this new girl nonstop for the last few weeks and she randomly complimented me saying she really loves my golden retriever energy.
My face turned so happy and my grin was smiling nonstop.

685,ive been accepted to the college of my choice and as of 2 days ago ive been 6 months clean!!!,42,103r23b,happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/103r23b/ive_been_accepted_to_the_college_of_my_choice_and/,6,"tw for some talk of suicide at the end, but it happy! I don't want to die anymore!! 

I haven't been able to talk about it a whole lot with my friends because I know that it'll make them sad, all of my friends are juniors and it's a couple of states away, so I'll rarely get to see them, but I'm finally getting away from my bad household!!! I've been dreaming of this day for like 4 years- I'm finally getting out from a large part of their thumb!!!! I'm so happy- I've cried over it a couple of times,, I was considering staying closer, but things have been getting so bad with friend groups- so I've decided to go out of state!!! I'll finally be able to live how I want to live, I'll be able to have my own schedule, I won't be berated everyday, I'm finally getting some actual freedom in my life, even if it comes with other responsibilities- I'll finally get some fucking control!!!! and it's one of the colleges of my choice!!! they have everything that I want to focus on!!! they have a good forensic program, which is what I'm hoping to study, they have a good theatre program and have some good choirs, plus a good entomology program which I might minor in!!!! I'm just- so relieved-

and also, as of 2 days ago, I've finally been clean for 6 months of self harm!!! I've made a lot of improvements to myself that I'm really proud of!!! it's been a little over 4 years since I started and I got kind of addicted to it in early 2021, so it's been tough getting here, I've only been able to get here twice since I started, and now that I'm here for the third time, I'm not terrified that I'm going to relapse!!! it's, such a weird feeling,,, I know logically that I might relapse again, but the fact that I don't think it's going to happen soon really means so much to me- it's like I've finally gotten to a point where I can actually see the progress I've been struggling to make for years- I'm really proud of myself for that!! I've been able to develop so many new coping mechanisms, and I've been through so many shitty things and relationships, I think I'm actually going to make it to college!!!!!! for the longest time, maybe mid middle school, I've had the deep feeling that I'd never make it to college, whether I'd fail out or I'd kill myself before then, I finally think I can make it there! I can finnaly, actually see a future for myself!!! I don't have to think that I'll die before then!!!! it's such a relief- I cannot tell you how much this means to me- I've always thought that I'd kill myself before senior year ends, but I think I can actually make it out of here to college!!!!",1672897734.0
