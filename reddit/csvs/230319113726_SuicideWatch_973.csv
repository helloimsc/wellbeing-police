This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail. 

Thanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.",1567525791.0
1,Please remember that NO ACTIVISM of any kind is ever allowed here. No matter what day it is.,719,pl9suy,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pl9suy/please_remember_that_no_activism_of_any_kind_is/,43,"Activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues (and suicide is, inescapably, a social issue) is absolutely against the rules here at all times. 

Please understand that we're all for smart, strategic mental-health and suicide-prevention activism. It's essential to fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and to fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding. Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL. 

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population. We used to allow it but the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming.  We do regret the need for this rule, but the need is inescapable. 

Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our community's wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

**tl;dr** Any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's about any cause or issue (rather than a request for personal support) is not allowed here.  Please report everything of the nature that you see.",1631232110.0

I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment and failure. I'm sorry you have wasted so much of your time raising and caring for me, I'm sorry that I'm such a coward that I couldn't push through this mental pain any longer. I'm sorry I have terrible communication skills.

I have been feeling like this for many MANY years I think I have hid it well enough for a while but as some have probably noticed the mask has started to peel away. I haven't truly been happy in a long time and most days I just fake it in an attempt to not be too much of a burden.

The world is not designed for someone like me, I feel like I dont belong anywhere. No matter who I talk to, work with or wherever I am or whatever I do. I feel like don't belong, I have always felt like an outsider. Whenever I talk to people it hurts so bad it feels like I'm going to throw up, it's hard to explain and I have pushed through this feeling for as long as I can remember so I seem somewhat ""normal"".

I have tried working out, Antidepressants, ""faking it until you make it"". Every job Ive had has ended poorly, every friendship ive made has been lost (most have ended thanks to one person that i have been forced to keep forgive because ""blood is thicker than water"") I have told others about these suicidal thoughts I have had and nothing has helped me. I am a useless memebr of society that will never make anything of himself. This I feel like is my last option left as nothing or nobody can help me. And even if I were to get better I wouldn't survive in this world long anyway, with everything going on in the world I don't have much hope for humanities survival.

To my siblings, I'm truly sorry for leaving you guys I know it's not right. I want you guys to know that I have always loved you and will always love you no matter what. Do me one favor though, be a better person than I am. Make your thoughts and emotions known, don't bottle your feelings. If something bothers you express yourself don't be a doormat for others to walk all over. (Joe you can have pc if you wish, you know my passwords for stuff. Lexi I don't really own anything you might like but you can have my phone I know you are in need of a new one)

I know I am loved and I know I might be missed, I am grateful to you all for the life that I have been given. It is more than anyone could ever ask for. I hate nobody and forgive anyone who thinks that I dislike them. May you all have a fruitful and happy life after I'm gone, I know this is a selfish thing to do and if you hate me please do so, but never hate yourself.

Please take care of my cat when I'm gone, she has saved my a handful of times from going through with this. Also take care of yourselves and try to forget about me, Im not much of a memorable person anyway so I'm sure it won't take long.

There are a lot more things and people I'd like to address, but I don't have the energy to say anything more. 

Oh and always remember, hate me not yourselves. Peace out.",1679164526.0

There was Reddit user, let's call him X, (his name actually began with an X,) but this dude kept asking for n\*\*\*\* and I kept objecting, but I didn't block him, straight away, (eventually I did, but not at the time) because I didn't want to lose a friend, but he kept insisting on n\*\*\*\*, so I just sent him a random picture of an obese man's chest that I found on the internet.

&#x200B;

The first time he reached out to me was on this subreddit, through my old Reddit account, three months ago, which I deleted, because it was a throwaway, I thought he wanted to be my friend, but I was wrong, because he turned the conversation sexually very quickly, the first time I spoke to him.

&#x200B;

I remember he told me that the only way he could ""Only tolerate me sexually,"" which is so unfair because all I ever wanted was friendship and he knew that. He also said, in the past, he doesn't like to sexualise women, but it's okay to sexualise me? He's clearly a liar and he gas lit me, but had previously accused me of gaslighting him.

&#x200B;

I kept going back to him, which was wrong of me, yes, but now I see all the red flags and will never talk to him again or even use his real name again.

I only went back to him because I felt sorry for him, he also said he was suicidal and had nobody that loved him, maybe it's true, maybe it's not, but if he acts like a predator and manipulators, in real life, you can't blame them. He always made me feel guilty about leaving him, when it was the right thing to do, he was toxic. I guess I was also toxic for going back to guy that had no respect for me, but I really thought he could change, I was wrong.

My dad passed 2 weeks ago and during that time I found out my s/o was having an affair on me because I have been such a shitty person to her and much much more than that. I thought I could fix my own problems for years and it just made it worse as time went on. I don’t know if things will get better but it fees never ending lately with these thoughts . I have stayed away from the blow as best I can, but I just want to feel anything at all. I have quit cannabis and blow when I found out my s/o was having an affair (long time addiction ) and that is making things so much worse with everything else going on. Fuck. I hate myself so much for not getting help a lot sooner when she told me too. Things just feel un fixable at this time and I am just so broken and tired of this all.",1679188652.0

I just need to put this out into the ether I guess. I really am having troubles going on. Its too long of a story to go over for what feels like the ten thousandth time this week, but to sum it up, I'm the father of a 14 year old kid who's own depression, anxiety, and mental disorders (borderline personality disorder) has caused a complete colapse of my relationship with my partner. I've stuck with my partner through thick and thin over the last year, but my child's sociopathic behaviors have proven too much, and she has her five year old to think about. Yes my child has been diagnosed, but getting the kid to accept help is incredibly difficult.  


So now I'm here, alone with my kid, trying to get her help, and she's just gone. And no one's called me to see how i'm doing. I cant afford anything so I need to get a second job. I'll have to work 14-16 hour days just to make ends meet. I'm alone. I feel abandoned by everyone. Meanwhile she's got an extensive family, some significant wealth saved up, so she can afford to go. I've got no money. No time. No support. I'm supposed to care for myself and this sociopathic teenager of mine, and I don't know how? I'm just so overwhelmed.  


I keep looking through all these suicide help lines and I keep thinking about how I can't handle calling them. I don't want their bullshit platitudes. ""Oh, its so tough what you're going through. You're so strong for calling and seeking support."" I don't want any of that. I just want it to be over. And what happens after I get off the phone. No like they can do anything. It just goes back to being the same as soon as I hang up. Like I said, I don't know why i'm posting here. I don't expect anything. I just need to get this out of my head. Everything has collapsed, and no one's reached out to see that I'm doing okay, because i'm not. I'd go to the hospital and check myself in, but then I get the anxiety that I'll lose my job, and then I'll lose my house and how do I take care of my kid then?  I can't afford to stay at the hospital. There's no answers, theres no solutions.  


I'm just alone. And abandoned. Posting to a bunch of faceless nobodies on the internet hoping it'll give me some sort of insight.",1679195375.0

My childhood wasn't great. My parents were incredibly abusive, their expectations for me were always borderline insane.

By the 4th Grade they had given up on me and branded me a failure, I was never given any support from them again. They'd seen stories online of child prodigies/geniuses that were in college or university by the time they were 12 or something. When they discovered I wasn't one of those they decided the best course of action was to deplete the money they had set aside to fund my post-secondary education to fund a series of tropical getaways and turn all their focus to my sister.

As I entered my teens I was made to work as soon as I legally could where I live. I was made to pay them rent because I lived there. I moved out at 22 but based on the math I did I had paid them at least 30,000 by that point. I had a good job in sales but I still wanted to eventually pursue my education further and I was on track to do this when I first met my ex.

She seemed perfect in every way she was kind, funny, generous, loving, empathetic, caring and so many other traits. I had always been socially awkward due to my anxiety issues stemming from constant verbal abuse growing up but it felt like she was someone I had known my whole life. We moved in together after a long road trip and things seemed perfect for a while.

She was my soulmate and best friend. Or so I thought. After a lot of reflecting and pain the last few months I finally learned that she had almost certainly been a narcissist. She created an illusion I fell in love with, once the illusion was gone I held on and suffered through constant emotional & verbal abuse for years, hoping to see who I fell in love with again. I gave her everything I could until I had nothing left to give, constantly trying to make her happy but never being enough.

Like many of these relationships, I was discarded without a second thought after I was financially, physically & mentally drained. That was six months ago.

Here I am now. I don't have many friends left. I lost a lot because of my ex. The ones I have are good people but they're all very much busy with their own lives, careers and families.

I'm drowning in debt. Yes, I can pay it off eventually but by the time I do I'll be closer to 40 than 30. I won't ever be able to afford a family or pursue the education I wanted. For so long my ex made it seem like she was on the verge of not having a dollar to her name so I would take on more of the expenses but I would eventually learn that her savings were equivalent to what my debt is today.

Nothing brings me joy. I used to have hobbies but now even the most simple things I liked such as gaming aren't something I care for. I just feel too tired and nonchalant about any of these things anymore. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm drowning and the only time I'm not is when I go to sleep. Falling asleep is tough so I'll usually take something to help me go to bed, sometimes as early as 8PM. I have no one and now I don't even have a way to pursue a life worth living anymore. I don't want to spend the next decade or so struggling just to get back to where I was years ago.

I don't want to die but I also don't want to live. I don't know what the point is. I've always been so resilient even as a teenager, holding on to the hopes of a better future that I was fighting to get to. But the hope of a better future has been pushed back so far that it may as well not even exist at this point.

Now let's get the obvious out of the way, because I've noticed from past post from others that everyone here just goes to the same tired statement of ""I bet you're not even ugly, you just think you are"", or something down the lines of such. Firstly, I'm deformed which is technically worst than being ugly. As I've discussed with this forum over a week ago, I was born with bilateral cleft lip. When I think back to everything I've experienced in my life mostly bad or unfortunate of course, it always goes back to my appearance. Whether it's social anxiety, not having friends, not having and never having had a partner etc etc. You can be as nice as the world will allow and people honestly could care less. You're ugly and they don't care to be around you. It's they have their minds made up the second they lay eyes on you, that you're this and you're that. Having a job is the absolute worse though. Going through with the interview process and orientation which you have to do with multiple normal people/employees. You wave to people and you can tell they don't really want to wave back or they just don't and you haven't even done or said anything to them. I'll forever be unhappy in this world because of the unfair hand I feel I was dealt in this life. Man, I could go on and on about how being UgLy has just destroyed my life, my self esteem, my future. I will never get the chance to have the experiences that just come natural with being alive and existing. Going through life wondering are people looking at me or listening to me when I talk.

It's not like I was dealt a bad hand, I have plenty to be grateful about. It's not like I can't have fun or enjoy things. I can complain about many things, about how I loathe myself, about how I think I'm an annoying and draining person to be around, how I'm fatigued all the time, how I never act how I want to, how I'm lazy, how I can't enjoy things and never feel accomplished, how isolated and lonely I feel, etc. But there are far more people with much worse going on, of course. And it's not like these things don't have a solution, or are impossible and unassailable. 

I just feel empty, stagnant, and hopeless anyways. So then, I have no one to blame but myself. But self-loathing in perpetuity never brings a resolution.

I've made a post like this before and I'm back because it's worse, I'm going to keep this shorter then my other post because I just don't want to remember it but your free to go read it. In a short my mother is a very gaslighting, my way or the highway kind of person. She'll make you feel like shit just to get her way, she'll make you terrified of her just to get her way. She's always throwing harsh insults at me. She used to hit me until I was bruised but she stopped but I don't want to grow up looking down at my arms remembering where bruises and self harm marks were. I'm so tired it's not something I can take anymore it's not. I pray that God takes me away everyday. I'm homeschooled and I have no friends and I'm not allowed to leave the house. I'm not allowed to talk to any family apart from who's in the house. Which is only my mother father and sister. They've always been so much nicer to my sister. There's always been moments where she has not respect for anyone or anything yet my parents just let her be. She'll say stuff like I don't love you to my mother. She'll drop drinks and glasses and through all of this she won't get yelled at. My father is always busy if it comes to me. He's like a stranger in my house at this point. I feel like he doesn't even know me. My sister being as spoilt as she is purposely gets me in trouble sometimes. If I were to even drop a little bit of water my mother would tell me how annoying and worthless I am. She does it in such a toxic way She'll say it in an indirect way so that if I ever bring it up she'll say l never said that. Like when I was younger she hit me so hard and said she couldn't care about me unless I was passed out on the ground. I brought it up and told her she didn't care about me unless I was dying and that she said that herself but she just said she never said that but she did. I always hear people saying they have a mother or father like mine and that they understand but they don't. They're no being homeschooled by that toxic women. Their not taking tests under her watch. Your not staying in the house 24/7 with her. It's not like you don't see your cousins. I'm so tired of people telling me they understand but they don't and they always say that I am just being ungrateful or dramatic. I've done school from 7am -3am because my mother broke a glass and was in a bad mood. I was only 7. I ended up with so many harsh words and bruises that night.  I'm so tired I know people are going to say it'll get better.  I can't wait for it to get better its been like this since I was 7 I wanted to end it all at 8 I've done self harm at 10 and attempted at 10. I'm 13 and I still suffering I can't call cps cus I don't want them to get in trouble, but I can't keep living like this. I don't know what to do it's so tiring I just want to quit idc if it'll get better I'm not waiting until 18 or 19 to move. I don't want to grow up with all of this trauma I just want out. I don't want to talk to them about it they won't understand. They don't care either. My mother has done alot for me such has convince my dad to get me and my sister phones and playstations. But money and expensive things can't make me forget and it can't make me forgive. It can't make me happier. It not like we have a big house or alot of expensive things.

62,I give up,23,11ukt28,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11ukt28/i_give_up/,5,"Hi,

I live in the country that invaded Ukraine on 24 of February 2022, and I want to opt out of life. These are the main reasons:

1. There is no way not to sponsor the war and repressions, since I have to make money in order to have something to eat. I contribute to the federal budget with my income tax (13%), I also pay VAT (20%) every time I buy something. 32% of the federal budget goes to the army (17%) and the police (15%).
2. I don’t want to put an effort into my life that will be eventually taken by the state. Sooner or later, I will be mobilized. The options will be: a) go to the war, b) go to prison, c) go to the war in transit through prison.
3. Guilt. The war is my fault as well, and I could’ve done more to stop it. I’ve been trying to redeem myself with charity, but it doesn’t help much. Not sure if that feeling will ever go away.
4. Anti-LGBTQ+ laws and propaganda. Well, I’ve accepted the fact I’m such a second-class person, but it still hurts.
5. It feels like I’m an alien here. I don’t get the concept of “patriotism” and “duty” to the state I didn’t choose. Neither do I understand the mentality and the obsession with WW2. Let the bloodthirsty people live with each other in this godforsaken country, but without me.

Unfortunately, I don’t think it will get better. At least I won’t live long enough to see that happen. So, I decided to spend some time with my parents and friends and then take my life. Thank you for reading. Really needed to speak out.

P.S. Please don’t think that I’m trying to belittle the challenges Ukrainians have to bear. I do understand I’m quite privileged that the war zone is not in my country.",1679136393.0

For the longest time i felt like i have been trying to surviving 
Priority was to aim for a better life, a stable job. Not trying to live day by day thinking of finances 
I was working 12-14hours a day during my school holidays to earn enough money to put me through school and pay for my food day by day
I could not afford to fall ill because that would mean not enough money for rent and food 
Barely have enough time to do my school work
And could not afford a social life 
Because that meant more spending which i didnt have 
I had no time to reflect
No time to connect finish the damn school and get the paper
After failing my final year 
I had to repeat
Which destroyed me financially 
But i pulled through

I got a loving bf 
Got the stable job not what i have studied for but good enough

And now everything starts crumbling down 
The constant pressure of financial is gone 
Which is good
But now what? 
I feel empty, i have time, i can reflect
The pressure was all i had to keep me going to a goal
And now that that is gone
I feel weird 
I got free time that i never experienced 
And i dont know what to do
I dont feel like i have a meaning anymore 

I feel the financial struggle and physical struggle with my job had strained me for so long 

At this point 
Because i cant properly work anymore 
I feel i lost a meaning in life

Lot of people tell me “work to live”
And not “live to work”

But what if all i knew is to live to work? And now that is gone
I feel i failed?
No career didnt make anything about myself 
I have achieved nothing 
I am a wreck 
I already attempted twice
Had a third initial plan but got too scared

I promised to wait till my therapy session 
But 
Im not sure if i can live to that day
It takes too damn long
And honestly 
It feels weird 
I am actually putting all hopes on it 
And if it ends up in failure

I do feel all my hopes will come crumbling down 
I have tried everything then at that point
Maybe i just can’t be saved
Maybe it’s just meant to be a short one 
I dont know anymore

The only things that are in my way are my funeral arrangements so nobody has the final burden of me, once again. I am trying to see if my body could be donated to science.. I will have to figure out how exactly I can do this without leaving it for someone else to do. 
I have picked a playlist for when I follow through. I also have ideas about how exactly to do it with no chance of being discovered too soon or it being unsuccessful. I have plenty of notes I have penned throughout the years for other attempts. 
The peace I get thinking about how it could truly be over in a set amount of time gives me an overwhelming euphoria. 
I’ve seen the drs been in the hospitals, therapist after therapist, medication after medication. There is nothing else for me.

When I have all these thoughts in my mind I always lack the energy to write it down and plan to do it another time but then I never do because then I'm not in the mood anymore! For fuck's sake, I just want to put my thoughts on paper! Why is this so hard?! However, I don't want to force myself to write it when I'm not in the mood. I want to put some heart in my words because otherwise I feel like I would just write some emotionless home work. But it means something to me.

It is as ridiculous as it sounds but it's a real problem I have. It's not that I have a concrete plan to end my life (yet), it's more like that I think that it's very likely that I will do it at some point, and for that day I want to have it all together so I'll be ready to leave. I'm sure I eventually come to write my letters, though. But I needed to vent because this is really aggravating me!",1679171813.0
84,I feel suicidal so I come here to empathize,15,11um9sh,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11um9sh/i_feel_suicidal_so_i_come_here_to_empathize/,3,"But everytime I see the differing levels of engagement on each post, I get depressed. I can't help but feel we lose someone here among the posts. Which perhaps is morbid. But its that quiet pain, the thing that kills us over time. Mental health is a journey but fuck, this isn't something we can do by ourselves is it? There's always an indifference.
 Personally I just wish I had a support system I'd want to be around. Friends and family that put in effort. A community that cares inherently, but we're all so busy trying to survive. I just want someone to listen without giving me advice or the need to rewire my dark thoughts and challenge them. I know what I'm feeling is bleak and extreme, can anyone just listen? Listen like I've listened to all of you? (You being my friends and family.)
I've been thinking about my life past a friend's wedding and I don't know what I'll do after. I often think it'll be one last memory before I go. I probably wont do it, but I feel like I eventually will. If I don't fix my life by my early 30s I'm more likely to end it by my early 40s. It just seems par for course given  how much I've wasted my 20s. I'm constantly reinforcing I have a literal deadline in my head. 3 years to change things.

now I feel trapped, I'm only alive for other people it feels like. there is very little that keeps me alive that I feel are actually my own. even that it feels like people are trying to take that away from me 

if I died now I'd probably ruin someone's life. I understand that people care about me and that's lovely but it's so painful. my ""moral"" is to understand as much as I can instead of choosing to hate things instantly. It's good sometimes because I end up being less arrogant/pessimistic, but I end up just being used by people who know I'll try my gosh diddly darn hardest to listen to them and most likely be helpful and comforting for them. while I don't expect anything in return, I don't understand why people then choose to harm me.

I'm glad I am the way I am but it sucks. my last attempts at a romantic relationship have ended in me being ridiculed, shamed, abused (emotionally and once physically) and had my panic attacks weaponised against me (being a group of people intentionally putting me in a situation with full intent to cause a panic attack and (they said they wanted me to) have a relapse)

the only time I feel any sort of release is just lying in bed. as someone with autism it helps me let for for a bit. in the time ive been trying to live with my sh, depressions and anxiety, I only feel disconnected from it whilst lying in bed or making music. I feel myself craving more though, that being suicide. at this point im almost looking for an excuse to kill myself. I come from a good place, my parents are supportive (when sober lmfao), I have nice friends and I'm very capable.  the real reason is that I can't bare life anymore, not even from lack of trying at this point. I'm in a vicious cycle of self harm and torture thats been going on so long that's it's hard to pick an exact point where it started. 

what im trying to say is I have nobody to blame but myself. and that is okay! I love you all and I wish you the best of luck, the realistic part of me says I won't make it out alive but the optimistic side is still hopeful <3",1679189561.0

I don't get much attention normally. :(

She was the one who raised me as a child, as my parents had busy lifes and I always saw her as a mother figure. 

Can’t really explain it myself why I always feel so sad, I have been blessed in so many ways and was born with a silver spoon, always had it easy in life. Yet, I always felt so alone. 

And it’s only getting worse. Been in this place so many times but this time it just feels different. I feel like I am damaged and broken, can’t sleep right, can’t eat right, can’t do anything right.

I knew I needed to get help when I found myself thinking about ending my life and had to call the crisis hotline back in December. I started therapy and my doctor prescribed me a medication (bupropion, not a SSRI). My therapist diagnosed me with ""adjustment disorder"" because all of this was caused/exacerbated by a particular life event (that rejection).

For a little while I seemed to be getting better, but three months on things are now getting worse: I've started thinking about suicide almost constantly, and for the past few days I've cried on and off pretty much all day. I feel like I'm a different person now from who I was before ""the event,"" and I don't think I'll ever get back to where I was before. I'll admit I also have an intense amount of anger towards the person who caused me to feel this way. I have very few people to talk to about this outside of my therapist: I only have one good friend these days, and he's been helpful but he has his own mental health issues and I don't want to ""trauma dump"" on him.

I don't plan to kill myself in the near future, because I know my mother would be devastated and my father (who passed away 12 years ago) would never forgive me if I did that to her. I really believe and hope that I will be able to spend eternity in the afterlife with them as a family - it's sort of the only thought that brings me any sense of peace right now. 

Maybe I'll try to get a different prescription and see if that one works better. But if therapy and medication don't work, I don't see how this ever ends.",1679179481.0

Nobody needs to read this to be honest, it is a admittedly a somewhat pathetic vent post. I just wanted to tell this to someone even if its the screen of my phone, as I can't say it to my family or friends.

When I was 15 yo I decided I'd wait until I was 25 yo to decide if life was worth it, life was shit for me at that time and I already had been struggling with suicidal thought as far as I remember, I was done with all of that and I wanted out, but I decided to stay cause I didn't want to leave my brother alone in the hell and mess that was our home. He's 5 year younger so I thought that if I waited until he was 20, he'd have a better chance at life, away from our family. However I just don't have the energy or hope to wait that long anymore.

Three years ago I moved to Australia away from my 2rd world country, I hoped that would be a much needed reset and that life would improve but it was even worse, I had no friends back a thome but here I couldn't even understand people enough to even try to make friends. I was failing at school, my home life got even more conflictive and My life got more stressful in general, I also had the worst day of my life here on my graduation party. Then my results came back, 61% which is 10% below what I needed to get into uni, and then thay government refused my visa so I have to go back to my country where I have nothing. I'm tired of trying just to things get even worse, Im tured of living in this cycle of feeling like shit everyday just to get a few months of hope and then feeling like shit ince again. So I decided in last new year's eve to end my life two years from there. I wanted to enjoy a little bit of time and leave my brother enough money to get into uni himself, I figured that if I worked this two years I'd leave with enough money for my family to use when they arrive to our country and pay fro my brothers study. 

Thankfully I got a good job and I've saved 30k Aistralian dollars in these two months, that's crazy Monet in my country and that will definitely pay for my brothers studies, I have no reason to stay alive anymore, mh brother is now 14 and I'm sure he's strong enough now to fight against my parents shut, he's a great boy and I'm sure a great life awaits for him, the only thing I know Ill regret is not living enough to meet his children, I never wanted kids but I thought I'd be a great uncle.

I'm thinking about taking a vacation for a couple weeks, one relative here in Australia offered me a trip to tasmania last year as a gift for my graduation and I refused, he said the offer is still up tho, so I'm gonna try to enjoy the trip it, and then off myself with helium I bought a few days back. I already set a list of the places I wanna visit there, and have a plan about how I'm gonna do it, I left instructions for them to make the process of my burial as easy as possible, and now I just need to write my goodbyes, there's not many people I wanna say goodbye to so it shouldn't take me too long.

It feels kinda relieving, I'm less stressful these days knowing I'm ginna die, its still a few weeks away but I dont feel fear which surprises me, I thought I'd feel worse about it but I just feel ready.

Last Monday I visited a gender clinic for the first time with the intent of starting hrt, I waited 4 months for the visit and had undergone many tests prior to it. 
Where I live you are required to bring a letter from a mental health counselor recommending you undergoing the treatment with you on your first visit to the clinic. I asked my therapist for one and at first he was hesitant but after speaking with him he said he’ll write it for me. Sunday night he sent it to me after I reminded him to send it to me a few times. The letter he wrote me wasn’t recommending it at best and straight out forbid  them from me starting it at worst.
It completely broke my trust and the bond I believed I had with him (he has been my therapist for the last 5 years) I canceled my next session with him and in a few days I’ll probably inform him we will stop seeing each other. Because of his letter I will not be able to start hrt until I meet with the clinic’s psychiatrist, my meeting with her is scheduled to the end of September which means I wouldn’t be able to start it in the next year if everything goes smoothly and it might even take more. I can’t wait that long, knowing I’m supposed to start hrt soon is what kept me alive for the last few months. Ever since Monday my mood and mental state have both plummeted deeply. I almost haven’t eaten any normal meals for the last five days and am living mainly on ice cream, soda and alcohol, i haven’t been taking my meds for since Monday night, and have started actively cutting myself after a long time of not doing so.

I feel like my life is going nowhere. I don’t know if anything will ever make happy.

I’m always left out at school. It started in primary school. Kids would invite the whole class to their birthday parties except for me. I always sat alone. I was always insecure.

It didn’t get any better when middle school came around. I was left out again. My classmates would laugh at me during presentations. They stuck gum in my clothes. They joked about being friends with me or being in love with me, because that would be the most rediculous thing ever.
At some point I started to get backpain, my docter had send me to fysiotherapy. It didn’t help, it only got worse. My docter and my family didn’t believe me and told me to stop being dramatic, they thought I was faking it for attention.
It got so bad that I could barely het dressed by myself anymore.
I cried alot at school because of this. It just hurt so much. A group of older boys used to look for me in the hallway, so they cloud push me. They thought it was funny that I cried so quick.

This went on for about a year. At some point my docter got sick of me making so many appointments, he sent me to get an MRI scan. They told me they would call back in a week with the results, but the call came the next they instead. They found a benign tumor growing in my spine.
Luckely I only had to get surgery once and they it was done.
But because they waited so long to help me, it did do some permanent damage. I now have chronic backpain and there are no painkillers that help.

The few “friends” that I had in middle school had stopped hanging out with me, because I had cried so much at school.

I was really loneley. I was home alone once and I was doing sh, like I almost always did when I was home alone, when I decided that I didn’t want to excist anymore.
I chickened out that day, I tried calling suicide prevention, but nobody picked up the phone. The I called my mom. I will never forgive myself for the I scared her that day.

I think I have seen like five different therapists and none of them have been able to help me, I don’t think anyone can.

When I was six my parents divorced (on the day of my birthday). My brother took this a lot harder then me. He started smoking in his first year of middle school and started doing and dealing drugs a bit later. When my mom wouldn’ give him money, he would threathen to kill is in our sleep, we even got new locks for our bedrooms. 

This only got worse when my mom got remarried. I didn’t like that man, but my brother really hated him, though I don’t blame him. He wasn’t a good man. My brother tried to pick fights with fik often. There wasn’t a door in our house that didn’t have a whole in it.
I slept with my “day clothes” on so if my brother tried to hurt our mom, i could get my baby sister and run.

One day before school, my brother was arguing again, he didn’t want to go ro school. I don’t really remember how it happend anymore, but my “stepdad” beat my brother. I watcherd him drag my brother to the yard and choke him. He was only sixteen then. He had to go to the hospital. My mom filed for divorce not long after.

The relationship that I have with my brother has never been the same as when we were little. He was placed in assisted living, because he was still a minor. He was still fighting with our mom.
It’s going a little better with him now, he has a job that he really likes and he has his own appartment now, but I barely see him anymore.

I’m now doing an mbo study (basically an associate's degree). But I still don’t have any friends there, or atleast no real ones. I’m pretty sure they talk about me behind my back, they do it to other is our group too.

I feel like something  is wrong with me, I get overwhelmed really quick and I cry very easely. Especially when I don’t understand the teachers instructions and they just pretend that it’s super obvious what I have to do.
It’s like their is something wrong with my brain, my other classmates always understand, but I almost never do.

I just feel so alone. I don’t think anything will make me happy.

I’ve noticed multiple instances of individuals and groups unwittingly and willfully shifting their desires and instincts after and during conditioning procedures involving desensitization to new ideas, thoughts, and behavioral patterns, stimulus exposure invoking curiosity of new internal systems, and confusion about what the individuals and groups are aware of what is conducive to their survival and prosperity in multiple aspects of life. Individuals who are raised in environments where these conditioning sequences are present in domestic, educational, labor and other social situations are more likely to adopt these as characteristics of their own personalities, meaning, susceptible subjects can develop a system of stimulus exertion designed to brainwash others as a set of standard social  functions. For example, if a susceptible subject becomes more loyal to a new group of occurrences and practices after exposure to the unfamiliarized stimulus and information, and comes into contact with less witting/free willed individuals in the same/different environment, indirect conversion can occur if the involved parties are receptive and adherent to internal reward/punishment systems effective for motivating involved parties. It’s also important to mention the original subject would had to have been trained to identify conversion efforts as the acceptable social functions of the environment and inhabitants, without identifying them as conversion efforts. It’s not fruitful to be surrounded with less agreeable individuals who cannot exceed the intellectual capacities and social functions of their manipulators, especially if they are willing to enforce illogical systems at the threat of indignation. Conditions such as these often influence others to conform against the presence of conflict, and I don’t find it to be reasonable that one should need to lie and not be oneself to avoid conflict in one’s habitation.",1679175201.0

I've never hit a place where I feel good or stable. I feel ""okay"" for maybe a couple of months during the year but then I always cycle back to a new low.

I have some mental issues that make it very difficult for me to regulate emotions or maintain strong interpersonal relationships with people.

Overall, this has rendered me very lonely. When I think about any long-term goals, or reasons for being alive, the only thing I can think of that might be half fulfilling is having a family. The mental struggles I deal with I fear will interfere with my ability to have a healthy relationship with anyone, and I especially don't want any children I might have to be affected negatively by me.

Nothing else feels like it has any meaning at all. I don't really care to work as I don't find fulfillment in it. I try to make new friends despite how difficult it's been, and I can't seem to keep any around. I don't have any true interest in anything, and I hate it when people tell me to find ""hobbies I enjoy"" because there ARE none I enjoy (and I don't resist trying new ones). I feel like I'm becoming more apathetic towards everything as the years drag on.

I've tried various therapists and antidepressants. I've tried reading different philosophies and watching different people talk about their struggles. I have a stable job (for now) and even tried to work with a nutritionist to at least stabilize my physical health, but it didn't really help when I started to wonder why these little things even mattered when I'll never be able to pursue the life I want because my mental health is so wrecked.

I guess I'm just wondering what the point is of working and doing anything really when I feel like at the end of my life, I will be alone, mentally sick, and incapable of getting better. I really want to get better. I want to feel better and I want to be excited about something and it's so frustrating and discouraging to feel like trash every single day.

I was born in some place of Europe, in some boring era, and since the instant of my first breath I've been doomed from what I call the creativity syndrome. My parents both worked very hard and simply didn't have the time to keep an eye on how me and my brothers were doing in life. 
I developed a deep social anxiety and a slight bipolarity because of the years I spent being bullied in school, sitting at the window of my house for days with zero thoughts in my head, and slowly gaining consciousness of my misery as I approached my  teenage years. 
I became mature through my highschool years, and was kind of kept together as a person because of the High standards I put on myself to not fuck everything up.
Now let me tell you, my social anxiety kept on growing since primary school, at the last year of highschool I was so miserable that I deliberately chose not to eat at the school cafeteria out of shear fear. For an entire year I only ate breakfast and evening dinners. My parents also divorced in a fairly long and unnecessarily ill mannered way.
I entered university a year and a half ago, I changed my course of studies from electrical engineers (my mom chose for me, I had no say in it) from the study I actually wanted to do for years, English literature and civilization. Those studies are interesting, but the mere act of leaving my house (where I live alone by the way, that's technically my mother's house, but she lives with her boyfriend who's half her age) is enough to make my skin flare up and my knees to shake. I have scoliosis, bad teeth, bad vision, no muscle, a bad memory and a awful amount of hate for anything that has eyes to look at me with.
I resisted the urges to scream, run, cry, and severely injure people around me for as long as I can remember.
On the outside I am a skinny guy who never smiles and who some might call introverted, but in the inside I am a literal timed bomb. I keep knives around, sticks, matches. I make plans to kill myself every day of my life, and probably one plan a month to poison or assault one of my family member. I really can't stress this enough.

That was the lifestory and insight of mind, I guess. Now with the actual existential crisis.

What I call the ""creativity syndrome"" is basically me at 12 years old having the most insanely miserable and traumatic nightmare ever conceived by man, and in said nightmare a character emerges and stabs me in the heart. In that morning I cry a lot, but I also make sketches of what I saw. I grow up, and probably 2-3 years later I come across those sketches and decide to write a story inspired by them. I shit you not, I've spent the last 7 years of my life writing, sketching, drawing, painting, and singing about fucked up shit, I designed entire novels, booklets, and movie scripts, I make concepts for video games, TV series, and fucking theatre plays. I've been working on pages, post it notes, computers, phones, I've recorded my voice, I've filmed myself dance and act, and I can't even begin to start explaining about how that fucking story develops as the unconprehensible amount of elements it contains just keep getting lost or modified over time. 

While sharing this story with the only very few individuals I ever trusted in life, I came across The House of Leaves novel which kind of seem relevant now that I mumbled about my existential need to scribble and draw all the time. 

The existential crisis goes a little bit like this : 

Option A - I continue going to university, keep looking at my feet when I walk, punch the walls when I get home, and eventually succumb to my (undiagnosed) depersonalization disorder which seem to enable to have debates with no one but me in the middle of the night, and which also seem to like to hide messages inside texts and drawings for me to find later on. ""Succumb"" here either means I kill someone or I kill myself.

Option B - I drop out of university somehow and find the courage to look at myself in the mirror, and also, I guess, prevent myself from stabbing myself in the chest with a kitchen knife. And eventually start my carrier as an author, which might finally help me find peace, or endless amounts of work to finish I guess.

I don't know what to do, and I don't know how long I'll be able to live like this. 

PS if you need more proofs of my instability, I did stab my own brother in the eye with a fork when I was only but a child, and I did try to both set fire to my own house and myself multiple times.

But to bring whoever’s reading this up to speed; I’m 29m w/ BiPolar Disorder + OCD, PTSD, and as of recently a huge stress issue that’s been triggering psychotic breaks. And when I say psychotic break, I mean I literally leave this reality mentally. And the closest thing I can describe the experiences I have while that happens, is a waking night terror. It’s been an especially difficult 6 months for me, both personally & professionally. Things are starting to turn around professionally which gives strength to me being able to help myself personally - but as I mentioned, it hasn’t come without a heap of stress unlike that of which I’ve ever known before. This stress triggered the first psychotic break about two weeks ago. I was very stressed by work & was in a private car to a train. My biggest fear is car accidents, and go figure the driver got in a fender bender. However upon impact the stress caused me to snap and when I did, my version was that the world kind of “blipped” and the simulation was crashing… everything was like a GTA game. Apparently what really happened is once we hit the other car, I took my watch + jacket off, got out of the car and walked across 6 lanes of active traffic then just sat down. This was the first time anything like this had happened. 

Last weekend, I was away for work with a client that I’d spent a month & a half preparing for. This work is that aforementioned stress. All had gone great for 6 days, until things had started to take a considerable turn on me both personally & professionally. From afar, my ex was embellishing me with guilt over an abortion we had two years ago. This abortion + her already triggered a suicide attempt that that I am gonna bring up shortly. One of my “best friends” was starting a case against me for their own fraud. Nearby, I had friends falling out with each other because of situations surrounding me. And professionally, things were going great until there was an issue with the local law & my clients, where I was made the “middle-man” which caused even more issues for me (as I was doing nothing illegal and would never jeopardize my business). This stress built up to my straw snapping at the catalyst of the local law detaining me at my clients event at a moment I was trying to collect myself privately, and triggered a second episode. Luckily most of this was kept private until the end when the law was shipping me out to the hospital, then I was brought in front of some of my clients. This lead to a complete falling out with the client I was working for, and the loss of my pay + 2 months of work. It also lead to me losing a housing opportunity I had been banking on. However was kept private enough that I saved enough face to allow me to accomplish the rest of what I wanted from the weekend professionally.

What’s strange is during that second episode… the vision I was having was that I was dying. And I literally thought I was. I even said “I am dying, these are my last words”. But I think that’s just because when my brain took into consideration the loss of pay I was gonna experience, the two months of work + all the blood/sweat/tears out the door, the apartment off the table, and the loss of this connection/client - my subconscious knew I’d rather be dead then experiencing this & this version made more sense lol. Because now I am in some pretty serious debt having fronted a bit of the bill in my relationship with this client. And it lead to a complete falling out with me and several of my closest friends. It forced me to leave the country early & with my head in shame. A big part of me keeps wishing I had actually died. 

It’s been about a week since then. My immediate plan was to do something drastic, but given the situation doing something drastic would’ve came at the expense of someone else one way or another… and being the person I am, I would never want that for anyone in my life. So I decided to just kinda sit on my hands & see what happens next. And strangely enough, things are turning around for me on their own. Professionally like I said, I had already proven myself that week amongst the other clients I wanted to pick up - they want me - they all want to lock in. And on the personal front, the situation of fallout with others brought me closer with some of my other friends. My other friend is dropping the case with the realization that he’s screwing me because he screwed himself.

Cleanly of course, I wouldn’t want my family to clean up my blood from the floor.

183,why i'm leaving tomorrow,2,11ushg9,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11ushg9/why_im_leaving_tomorrow/,2,"just giving the reasons why I am dying tomorrow:

I don't have any friends. Had people that care about me but I'm much more concerned about the way I'll live the rest of my life and the embarassment of how lazy I am in comparison to them was enough to cut them off. Came from a good background with a supportive and well learned family. I went to a private school and got into a good university. The things I went through in the past (having nude pictures leaked and being acused of being a terrorist at school) came back to haunt me through my first two years of uni and I ended up smoking weed, drinking, and playing video games. 

I haven't progressed in terms of work and my IQ somehow deteriorated (possibly depression + taking meds temporarily for a psychotic episode) so now I'm unlikely to pass uni, given that I'm currently retaking a year and finding it extremely difficult to focus. The reason why I'll kill myself is stupid compared to what others are suffering and irrational considering that I believe in the possibility that an afterlife exists and the punishment for suicide is to go to hell, which would be worse than living in any kind of state until death by old age. However, I'm incapable of doing low level jobs and end up getting laughed at by colleagues because my brain functioning just isn't there anymore.

I understand that the rest of my life will be embarassing and I'll feel insufficient than others because of the successful people I grew up with. Happiness is unimportant to me and I'm not sure about whether or not an afterlife exists. I guess I made this post to say that anyone young who is feeling suicidal, find at least one skill and work it hard. I've been suicidal for 7 years now but if I had worked I would feel like I have a shot at life. The method I'm choosing is hanging. I don't feel bad for my family because I know that once I'm gone it won't matter to me either way. Maybe I'll go to hell for this but I'm taking my life in the hopes that I stop existing altogether.",1679155980.0

I'm only back here because after countless years of suicidal ideation, I actually want to live. I have no idea why exactly -- I'm in a healthy relationship, on new medication, and detransitioning. Maybe all of these are contributing to lowering my stress levels. I lost most of my friends due to mental health struggles and I finally feel okay waking up in the mornings, more than ever actually.

I feel like an actual living human that actually wants to do things. It's so bizarre to experience. It feels like my head's above water after drowning my whole life. I just want to share my experience with someone because I was 1000% sure I wanted to die for years and I've finally changed my mind. It took years and trialing different medications.

I’ve been trying to cover up my feelings for years. The last year had been especially rough. I don’t feel like I have the right people in my life. They all make me really sad. I had kids too young and I don’t know how I can make myself be happy with those decisions. I am doing this for the rest of my life. I don’t care if I’ll be only 38 when they’re out the house. Kids are kids and they are there forever. And my partner… I love him but he doesn’t try the best he can to make sure I feel alright, I will tell him straight to his face I want to kms he asks why but that’s it no further discussion and he never checks in on me. He’s going to walk in on me with a bag over my head and do nothing. He won’t care if I die

And I’m so tired of hearing how I shouldn’t think like this because my kids need parents well they have a parent and apparently he’s doing a much better job than I am so let him have them. No one likes me and I don’t like anyone. I didn’t want kids at this time. I didn’t want to be sad everyday. I don’t want to be on my feet all the time. I don’t want to be in school or have a job.

I don’t want them to find me like that. I’ll have to go somewhere quiet and I can’t find the things I need because america is so damn hard on people not killing themselves but then doesn’t stop people from WANTING to kill themselves.

I am a 22-year-old male from Greece and I'm (probably) struggling with depression. I haven't been diagnosed with that yet, but I'm pretty sure I have it..

I was sexually abused by my father's wife from 13 to 15. Although, I'm lucky in the fact that I didn't do anything with her. She was trying to touch my thing and sleep with me whenever my father was out.

A little back story from that though.

My parents split up in 2010 iirc, because of a lot of reasons, but the last one was that my father was cheating on my mom (with his current wife). A few years past, and he introduces her to me and my sister as her partner and from there we kinda bonded. And then it all started... She tried to touch me in my private area and sleep with me while my father was gone for the night, but sometimes she did it in from of him as well. After a while, I told him I didn't feel comfortable, but he did nothing.

At that time I didn't know that it was so serius tbh, because I was young. After a few months I had a ""fight"" with my dad about something irrelevant to this, but I ended up stop going to his place. After a while I told my mom what that woman did to me and my sister (fortunately it wasn't sexual abuse, but psycological abuse) and she was shocked.

I decided to go to a psychiatrist and he really helped me at that time (no medicines). I stopped talking with my father for 3 years, but my psychiatrist told me that before I stop, I had to talk to him about that. And we met, I told him what she was doing and how I felt, but he took her side and said ""it was only a joke"". I was really disappointed...

After 3 years I decided to give him another chance, but to not talk about what happened or about her. Meanwhile, she gave birth to a girl and when I meet her, I don't feel comfortable at all, but Idk how to tell him that, because it's not the kid's fault...

A few days ago, he came to my grandmas home (I live with her because I study where she lives) and he came and told me ""Will you come eat with all of us?"", I told him ""Nononono"" because I was shaking just in the idea of being in the same room with her. And he responded ""Someday you need to let go of stuff. I did let go of a lot of stuff as well"". And that was what triggered me. But I remained silenced. I know that he's a piece of shit when he wants to, but he's my father and I really need a father figure in my life. Even if it's like that. And I know what I have to NOT do.

The only thing he ""let go"" was that he didn't speak to me for 3 years and he was feeling sad. And whenever someone asked him how I was, he didn't know how to respond.

Meanwhile, I can't have sex, I don't feel comfortable most of women, I don't have the confidence that I had. And the only thing I need is a hug.

I just want to find a girlfriend to hug. And feel nice around her. But whenever I open up about those things, most of the time they dissapear after a few days...

I just feel like I'm not enough for anyone. There are a lot of stuff that I didn't write down now, but most of them come from this...

I can't concentrate in what I want to do (sports journalism), just because once in a week or two I just have my mood changed for no reason. Just like that. And I'm like that for a lot more days after...

The conversation I wrote was in the past Sunday.. And my mood hasn't changed since...

I just want to end it all and be done with it...

But the only reason I don't, is because of my sister (not his new daughter, the other one).

Yeah, and that's the fucking problem.

My whole life I've had on and off episodes of being a night owl, and I fucking HATE it. I DESPISE only being awake at night. The world is dead. Everyone is asleep. Everything in public is closed. I have to be so fucking quiet when I do everything. And guess what happens when I finally fix it and go to sleep at night, like a normal person? I gradually fall asleep later, and later, and later over the following nights. I fucking hate being alive.

I don't even fucking remember 95% of my dreams. And out of the few that I do, probably about 75-80% aren't even fucking pleasant. They're just weird, morbid, sad, scary, disappointing or just otherwise unpleasant.

I had something important I needed to do this morning, but missed it, all because I attempted to fight sleep and lost.

I'm so fucking angry and upset, that I literally want to fucking cry because of how much I fucking hate sleeping.

I'm so fucking angry at a normal biological function, that just out of spite for my own body, I have an insatiable urge to keep myself awake until I pass out from exhaustion and need to go to the hospital. I don't know why.

A lack of sleep increases my risk of Alzheimer's? Don't care. In fact I'll GLADLY take Alzheimer's. And every other health problem that comes with a lack of sleep. I'll gladly take a whole EXISTENCE where I never sleep, even if it means horrible health side effects.

Or better yet, just fucking snap, go to the grocery store, buy 2 or 3 bottles of sleeping pills, down them all in one sitting, and fall asleep FOREVER by dying of a fucking overdose. AT LEAST THEN I'M FINALLY GIVING MY STUPID FUCKING BODY WHAT IT SO DESPERATELY FUCKING NEEDS!!!",1679150329.0

Then my mother was stressed with work (my father is always the breadwinner so she is never financially pressured) and she lashed out on me from then until now (I was about nine). 

Then I became ugly and was bullied by male classmates. My father said to my face that I am ugly both inside and outside. My mother is always ashamed because she is pretty and I am not. She show her hate to me, she says that I smell bad (others say I don’t). 

My father cheated and my mother fought with him. I was by her side and supported her. But you know what? She doesn’t remember any of it.

When I finally told my parents about it at the age of 8, none of them acknowledged it. Dad has been emotionally distant who rarely talked to me throughout my childhood and my mom was the one who needed emotional support so I was the one who filled that place for her. This continued throughout my life and it's still the same. I don't have close friends and they only person in my family that I talk to regularly is my cousin brother (who is in a bad state right now so I am supporting him as well). I have never been in a relationship nor been even liked by a girl, ever. The loneliness is killing me and therapy isn't doing much good either as I am in it alone. All I ever wanted was a loyal partner who would stay with me till the end and seeing how the dating scene is right now, I don't think I ever will. I know that I am not attractive looking, don't have a job (currently a freelancer and actively looking for one), have multiple chronic illnesses (type 1 diabetes since the age of 2, hypothyroid since age 3, hypertension since the age of 18). Recently got diagnosed with c-ptsd, borderline personality disorder and severe depression and there is no one I can share my feelings with. No shoulder to cry in. Stuffing it inside for all these years and now I've lost all hope. I don't know what I did to deserve this but I guess I'll be alone till the end. If it is going to be like this, I will end it all after 5 years. That's my last date to hopefully meet someone who I can care for and who cares for me. If it's still the same by then, I will follow through my plan. I know that I am just a random stranger on reddit posting this so there is no reason to take me seriously, I just wanted to leave it here.

These feelings will come back in the next few days.

249,My husband hates me and I can't tale it anymore,0,11uok31,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11uok31/my_husband_hates_me_and_i_cant_tale_it_anymore/,1,"So here's a little backstory.

 I(M24) married my husband(M26) in September 2022. So we've been married for just over 6 months. Unfortunately I know that he's hated me since we first got together. My husband suffers from schizophrenia and is also a notorious narcissist. Despite this I love him more than anything in the world. I've broken off friendships that were important to me for him because he got paranoid. I've purposefully created a divide between my family and myself because he hates my parents and my sister and I've dealt with his schizophrenia for almost two years now and always tell myself that he can't control his emotions and I shouldn't take what he says too seriously when he's triggered. Unfortunately my husband also has a fetish for trash bags. To be exact, he enjoys watching me throw the trash out. When we first met he told me about the fetish and I assumed that it was simply something relegated to the bedroom but I was wrong. His fetish has consumed my entire life and I often get the feeling that our entire relationship revolves around it. Just after we had decided that we were no longer dating but rather a full on couple, I made two mistakes. I used to work for a local grocery store and on one evening I was told to take out the trash from the meat section. I did this and I, not knowing that I had just made one of the biggest mistakes of my life, called my then BF and told him about my day and told him that I helped out in the meat section. I didn't know it at the time but this led to his longest schizophrenic episode yet. At that time, though, I didn't know about his condition. This was followed two days later by the second biggest mistake of my life. A trash can on the balcony of my apartment was beginning to smell and there were maggots in it. (This was in the summer and it had been standing in the heat for a while). My cousin, who I was living with at the time, and I freaked out and immediately started cleaning up and I was told to bring out the trash bag full of maggots. My then BF was in the bathroom shaving while this happened and came out to me holding the bag in my hand. He approached me wanting to kiss me. I felt like this was weird because I was freaking out and didn't associate the situation with his fetish. I honestly didn't think about how my BF must be feeling in the situation. So I told him ""Not now, please, I need to clean everything up"" and walked out of the building to throw out the trash. This triggered him again. Later that day he had a severe episode and he told me about his condition. I finally understood why he had reacted the way he did after those two mistakes.

 Fast-forward to a year later and we're getting married. I had hoped that everything would calm down but no. He demanded that I essentially give him a redo of those two situations but this time with him watching. Mind you I quit my job at the grocery store because he told me to and now he wants me to retake my old job and recreated the same situation there but with him present. He demanded the same thing for the second situation. I managed to recreated the second situation but the first one is proving to be very difficult. I don't know if I will even get the old job back and certain small details such as the uniform have changed, making it impossible for me to give him the same situation as back then. Ever since those two mistakes I have been confronted with them and my angry and confused reactions to his episodes EVERY DAY since then. Every day I have to hear from him how he regrets ever dating me and marrying me. How I'm the most selfish person he has ever met and how I'm worse than his previous BFs who ALL cheated on him. The rift between myself and my friends and family has become so wide that if he were to leave me I would have no one. I would be completely alone. I don't want to leave him and I know that we could be happy if he just let go of those mistakes I made but I know he can't. I constantly tell myself that he can't control his emotions and I shouldn't be mad at him for his outbursts or the constant episodes but I can't take it anymore. He hates me and tells me how much he hates me all the time however we also have many days where everything is fine and we laugh and love each other like any other couple. I've gone to therapy because these issues but it hasn't helped. The only person who can truly change the situation is my husband.

 Among those things I am also constantly criticized for my past relationships. As if I cheated on him with people I was with before we ever met. I fell like everything I have ever done is bad and every fight we have every small thing I do it immediately connected to the two mistakes I made in the summer of 2021. I can't do this anymore. I just want to be love for who I am but I also want him. I need him and I want to live out my days with him but I'm scared that my last days are coming faster than I want and that he'll just find me dead in our apartment on evening after coming home from work. I've tried several times in the years since I made those two mistakes but have failed every time. I just want to rest. The only times I truly feel well is when I'm sleeping or when I'm at work, on neutral ground where we rarely argue at all. (We work for the same company now). I just hate my life and I want it to end so badly but I don't have the strength to end it myself so I just hope that one of these days he'll have a major episode and just kill me. It would make it so much easier for me and he'll get the satisfaction of making me pay for the mistakes I ""did on purpose because who does something like that and doesn't understand the consequences"".

 If you've read this far then I thank you for you patience with me and this post. This is the first time I've ever posted to reddit but I needed to tell someone about my feelings. I would leave you with a warning, though: Never assume that someone is telling you everything and be careful of schizophrenics. They might seem normal but one mistake can make them hate you forever. That's the lesson I've learned from my time as a married man.",1679146212.0

Maybe I deserve all this. I have a pretty peaceful plan to take myself out, it'll be at a beach it'll be lovely. I don't want to have to figure out something else to do.

I have a note and a method of doing it and everything. A little scared of the pain before it goes away but I know it'll eventually lead to my death so I'm fine with it. I'm sure everyone around me will be a lot better when I'm gone anyway.

At the same time, though, there is a little voice telling me that maybe there is another reason to not kill myself just yet. That part of me, of course, is what is telling me to make this post in the first place. Even if it is small, I'm just looking for one good reason to live just a while longer. One last attempt at talking me down, if you will. 

I appreciate anyone who reads this, and I truly hope that if I do end up killing myself, that everyone else here finds the hope I couldn't.",1679084315.0

Although I do dream of killing myself, I refuse to do so without doing something fun and eventful that I can look back on and be proud of.

Specifically, I’ve been fantasizing about gathering up my funds I’ve saved up, traveling to Las Vegas, staying in a luxury airbnb for a week, and having as much fun as I possibly can before I end my own life. I really don’t see a future for myself that I can look forward to that will give me any pleasure in life.

Usually i cut myself wuth blade, and when ig starts bleeding add bunch of salt to increase pain. 
What hurts the most is that there is not easy way of dying without affecting people I know. Not being able to commit suicide is worst living life. I've always had suicid as a backup plan no matter what comes in my life. But I am un a place where I can't commit suicide without others knowing. 
I was thinking maybe a alchol overdose maybe a solution but drinking in car and if someone tells cops then I'll be in more trouble before I can kill myself from overdose. 
If push comes to shove, I won't care about people around me at all. I wknt drink in car but I have some few other ideas.  Ill make sure write a suicide note that's for sure cause I don't want to shutdown any businesses near me. 
Why is it so hard to die. Don't people need heart replacement, can't I donate all my body parts and die peacefully.  Don't scientists need human Guinea pigs to torture and experiment for betterment of humanity.  Can't I be become one of those Guinea pigs. 
Life suck. Other people just want you live it more miserable then them so they can feel better about themselves. I wish euthanize thingy was real. 
I can deal with endless physical pain. But mental pain stress and all is just too much.

i have a time frame in which it has to be done.

When I was 16-17M I had a drinking problem. I would drink whenever I could get my hands on alcohol because it was the only way I knew how to escape. I would do all kind of stupid shit when I was drunk, try to fight people, verbally abuse people for no reason, throw up in peoples houses etc. i would often get angry at my parents for no reason and once I even had a fight with my dad. 

2 yrs ago aged 17 I met up with 3 girls and a male friend. I had had a lot to drink at this rate. I was sitting in a bench with one of the girls and I put my arm around her. She did not object to this so I thought I was on the next stage of flirting. I asked ro kiss her, she said no to that. A minute later I asked again and a minute after that I asked once more. All 3 times were rejected. Eventually i came to my senses and realise my attention was unwanted. I feel as though if I was physically stepping the line someone would have intervened. I cant actually remember any of this happening, this is just what I got told. I never forced myself on this person and I didn’t get aggressive or violent when rejected. After this happened she and all her friends left the venue and texted my friend that I fucked up and that no means no. I probably freaked her out bad. I didn’t understand what I was doing and I thought I was flirting but I got it horribly wrong and upset someone 

Everyone alienated me after this, all 4 people involved stopped talking to me. My friend was extremely angry with me and started calling me a harasser. 
Due to the response provided I have false memories of what happened. I only asked for a kiss but my mind keeps telling me that I groped/raped her because of how angry everyone was after the situation. I live in constant mental imprisonment. 
I know for a fact I had no bad intentions but in my drunken state I got it horribly wrong. 



 When I heard about my actions the next morning I felt disgusted with myself, I instantly apologised to the girl I did it to. 
Looking back it was quite s lame apology, I said some shit like “I’m sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable last night I was really drunk” i didn’t know what to say
She told me she forgave me, my friend told me that she was initially upset after it had happened that I pushed her boundaries, but she accepted my apology. I don’t know if she just said this to make me feel better or what not but yeah. That was the last time i spoke to all the people involved. I feel disgusted within myself, I feel like a predator who kept pushing someone. I feel as though I might have traumatised her and ruined her life cos this was such a bad experience. It was after that I stopped drinking alcohol as a whole because I was now aware of its destructive nature. I haven’t done a thing of this nature since and realised that it was the alcohol dictating me. 

After I apologised I didn’t think too much of the incident, but 18 months later for some reason it’s come back into my mind and it’s all I think about 24/7. I really can’t understand why I did what I did. I certainly wouldn’t have done it sober, but I’ve realised that it’s no excuse. Their friend said to my friend it wasn’t that much of a big deal but I still can’t forget about it. 
I feel like a piece of shit for trying to do something without the other person’s consent. I was verbally asking for consent but I was being pushy about it. 
Since this has been of my mind, I haven’t allowed myself to have anormal life, I’ve since quit my job and I hardly leave my room. I feel as though this is who I’m gonna be forever. That drunk idiot that kept asking. I told one of my friends bout it and he said it wasn’t a big deal. I can’t even look my own mother in the eye knowing the way I treated a woman that night. No charges were ever pressed or anything, idk if I did something illegal or not but it was certainly immoral. 
I don’t know if asking for a kiss more than once is illegal (might fall under harassment) 
But I feel I should’ve received some punishment for my actions 
I hate myself for it every day and I’ve been thinking about ending my life over this. Once u do something like this in todays society there is no going back. 


Although im 2 years sober and wont do something like this again I just cant let the past go. This haunts me 24/7 and honestly, I don’t think I’ll ever forgive myself for it. 
I thought of myself as an ally of women but this situation says that I wasn’t. 

I’m a pig. A disgusting man who ignored boundaries. I’m sorry to all women that have to deal w shit like this. I’ve heard some horror stories from some other girls and the stuff u have to put up with us disgusting. I wouldn’t consider myself a part of that domain but this encounter proves otherwise.

I have been experiencing severe depression that has been getting worse and worse for almost 13 years. I've tried medication and I've tried counseling, but nothing has helped. Every night I lay in bed and my brain constantly replays every single hurtful event or word I've felt in my life.

I know I should be feeling happier because I have someone who loves me enough to propose to me, but all I can think of is all of my past relationships. They all ended with my boyfriends and girlfriends cheating on me or leaving me because they couldn't magically cure my depression.

Tonight is one of the worst nights. All I can think of is my last ex's words. She dumped me two days after my grandmother, who I was very close to, passed away. She said that she gave me more than enough time to ""get over myself"" (regarding depression), and that ""I'm going to be even more insufferable now with that"". She said that if I wanted to be loved, I needed to ""act normal because no one will tolerate that miserable bs for long"".

My fiance is an incredibly amazing and kind man who is very supportive of me, but I just can't shake the thought of him losing patience with me too. I love him so much it hurts, and I can't stomach the thought of him one day leaving me too. I really, really want to find the motivation to keep living, at least for my fiance.

That being said, I know they can't help me if I am not 100% honest. And the matter of the fact is that I do have a plan, and access to said plan. I have done months worth of extensive research on methods to kill myself, and have access to a certain method (poison) that is 96% effective.

I am being vague on purpose, because the poison I have access to is not a legal substance.

I also have a date in mind. A sort of ultimatum with myself. ""If things don't change by this time, we give up."" That date is my birthday and is still 8 months away (give or take a few days).

329,Don’t know what to do,1,11ug115,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11ug115/dont_know_what_to_do/,0,"Hi, so I don’t expect anyone to read this but I don’t really have anywhere else to vent to so I suppose this will do.

I’m 19F, currently unemployed and attending university. I’ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts and self harm since I was about 13/14. I used to be a bit more of an attention seeker when I was younger (as any young teenager is) — I’d cut myself in class, openly tell my friends I intended to kill myself, what have you. Over the years I recognised how upsetting this was for the people around me and worked on keeping my thoughts to myself so that I wouldn’t be a burden to anyone around me.

I thought things were getting better, I’m currently just over 9 months clean of self harm, have a new circle of friends around me, have been doing constant exercise to stay fit, etc etc. But recently I’ve realised that I don’t think I was ever getting ‘better’. I think I never changed at all.

I wake up in the morning and all I want to do is cry. Every day blurs together and I’m constantly on the verge of breaking down. I have the constant, persistent urge to relapse. I’m constantly sleeping because I hate being awake. I hardly ever leave the house unless it’s for uni. My usual hobbies sometimes make me happy, but any feeling of happiness is so brief that it hurts me to be happy more than anything. I’m lonely, I cry myself to sleep most nights because I just feel so empty and depressed. I’m not medicated at all, I stopped going to therapy about a year or so ago.

But it’s not like my life is bad at all, you know? I’ll be the first to admit that I’m privileged, my family doesn’t face financial issues, I live in a nice house where all my needs are met, there’s no pressure from my parents to work or do much else besides make sure that I’m happy. So why do I feel so shitty all the time? It makes me feel guilty, like I’m just being stupid and whining about problems that don’t even exist.

The other night I was at my train station waiting to go home, and every time I saw a train coming I thought about how much I wanted to just run in front of one and end it. How easily I could do that and nobody could stop me. I felt so peaceful and calm thinking about it, honestly the best I’ve felt in ages. It’s all I can think about these days, how much I want to off myself, but I’m too much of a coward to do it. I always end up thinking about how much it would hurt my family, but never about how much I’d miss out on in life. Because truly? I don’t look forward to life. I absolutely dread the future, because I’m a naive idiot who despises the thought of having to work for the rest of my life just to make sure I can live comfortably. The truth is that I just don’t want to be stuck in that fucking cycle day after day. All I hear from my parents is how much they hate their jobs and how much money the bills cost and how much it costs to support my sisters and I. Adult life frightens me, and I don’t think I’m cut out for it.

Maybe I really am just a stupid privileged kid to say this, but if life really is just work till you drop, then I want no part of it. A part of me knows that I’ll never be happy living in this society, nor that I’ll ever be able to function in it. It really is only a matter of time before I decide that my desire to die is greater than my desire to not hurt my family. I’m just not meant to live in this world.

I don’t like complaining or talking about my feelings because it makes me feel weak, so I suppose I’m sorry for sitting here and ranting the way I am. I’m just so hopeless and have nowhere else to turn. I’m lost and I don’t know what to do. I just want to die, I don’t even know if saying all this will help me or make things worse. I guess I just wanted to get my thoughts out of my head even if it’s to complete strangers.

TLDR
Shit up bringing by single mother. Struggled since early teens to be an adult.
Soft drugs not so much drinking.
2 relationships
Now 36, getting married this year.
No kids


So, where I'm at now. Ive had 2 previous attempts early teens and mid 20's. Rope and pills. Life was a ball ache, it was always a battle to try move forward.

After second attempt I basically vanished, started my life again somewhere new. Alone to start, met my partner and things moved forward. Got a degree, decent job not in any debt either ( mid 20's grind solved that but lead to att.2 ).

From early teens I told myself that my existence wasn't real. That I don't belong in this timeline and that the next life would be the one where I'd actually have a chance to make it. I said to my mother at 16 that I'll for sure be dead before 30 and she should accept that. It's been hard, I would have attempted more times have I not been a person that doesn't want to hurt my mother like that so I kept on the grind.

Flash forward to now, my life from an outside perspective seems rather ok. Compared to my situation before life restart I'm good right now. But I can't shake this thought/feeling just recently that I shouldn't be here and it feels wrong.
My partner has started to notice me just staring off into space for hours sometimes but that's when my mind is doing what I hate most. Which is calculating the potential outcomes of my death scenarios. I feel like now I'm organising my own death and trying to adjust for collateral damage.

I'm not sure why but I'm at a point where even now I'm sat in bed awake all night knowing there's a solution that means no one gets hurt and I can move on peaceful ly. 

I'm not looking for a talk me down, or sympathy and yes my partner is right saying I should seek counseling but truthfully I want this. I want to die, I don't want to think anymore. This world, society, people just don't fit right in my eyes.

Im scared to be hurt but I think purposely going out and getting murdered would be the best solution. Anything vehicle related has the potential to end up badly hurt but not finished so that's not really an option. I figured accident hurts people less than a suicide.

It was such a specific time frame. And with as many jokes as he makes at this expense, all I could say was ""I don't find those jokes very funny.""

He apologized. But he didn't take it back. He didn't say he didn't mean it.

A spiritual path that gave me reason to live. Slowly the attempts dwindled. Depressive periods happened throughout my life but... dealt with overcame them. Learned to live with being chornically suicidal despite the inherent contradiction of that. Even had happy periods and eventually came to a place where I accepted myself.

Afterwards there was a ""sharks smelling blood"" kind of effect when I was trying to recover and the rest of 'community' basically took it as an opportunity to try to push me to point I will never recover(the way the people in it have been revealed to be absolute pieces of shit as people is one of the few things that have made me doubt the validity of the subject... not in terms of results, I know results happen but in terms of... if everyone in a path that is emant to cause spiritual progress is a piece of shit then maybe that does say something about the path. However, it is and will remain my only option).

3. Until the only reason I've ever been willing to live(at least since I was 11-12) is fully secure and I feel safe and able to achieve my goals then anything else is pointless. ""Mental health"" concerns are... they're there but they're not on top of list and will only be able to even begin to be addressed until that's taken care of. Same with finances or anything else.

So I'm probably going to kill myself on the date I've set for ""if this isn't fully worked out by then I'll do it"". I have a basically certain method. A lot of days including today I wonder what I'm waiting for.

Now go on and tell me to give up on the only reason I have to live and live a life I would always consider worthless and meaningless, that seems the standard response.",1679084292.0

I like being alive. But I don’t feel like I deserve to enjoy life or the things that make me happy anymore.
I’m LGBT, but a few years back I betrayed my own community. I have OCD and was sucked into a terrible obsession about religion, and long story short I was sucked into fundamentalism and convinced that God hated me and was going to send me to hell for being gay, and I had to “spread the word” to others do they ALSO wouldn’t be smitten by fiery wrath, or else God might choose not to save me. 
I ended up hurting another LGBT friend of mine badly. I’ve since reached out and apologized but I don’t know if they forgave me (I wouldn’t forgive me either). 
My whole religious-zealot-phase seems like a bad nightmare, now. It shocks me that I ever came to hate myself and turn against the people I loved so much. No matter what, I don’t feel like I can forgive myself. And if more people knew about it, I don’t feel like they’d forgive me either. 
I was a teenager when these things happened, but from what I’ve seen online, if someone pulls the kind of shit that I did- they don’t get forgiven. Even if they were young. Even if they were part of the same community they hurt. Even if they did what they did because they were mentally unwell. I’m pretty convinced that I’ve ruined my chances of living a good life. It doesn’t matter if I am no longer the person I was, the hurt I caused was still permanent. There is no excuse for what I’ve said and done. 
I honestly think that the best way to punish myself is to take everything I love and care about away from myself by ending my life.
My only concern is that I’m scared (the fear of hell is still something deep rooted in me) and I don’t want to hurt my loved ones by making them have to grieve over me. I don’t want to cause pain by leaving the world, but I also feel like I’m causing pain every second I’m living on it and being happy or successful, because I don’t deserve that any of that after everything that has happened. 
Before anyone asks, yes I’m on meds and seeing a therapist. I’m convinced I’m a bad person who doesn’t deserve their help, though. 
I don’t know what I’m posting this here for. I think I want to convince myself that I shouldn’t hurt myself (because I REALLY don’t want my death to hurt my loved ones) or that my fear of being hated and I forgiven by everyone is just me overthinking (but I just don’t think I can get myself to believe that no matter how hard I try). Maybe I really am a bad person. If you think so, please just say it outright. I don’t want sympathy or pity. I just want the truth.",1679084271.0

I forever will wish to just fcking die. I'll always want to kill myself. I wanted to kill myself ever since I was 9.
Nothing's ever going to change, i'm sure of it.
I can't go on a day without ""joking"" about killing myself. I won't even call it attention-seeking/asking for help (or whatever people like to refer to it as). It's just that I can't cope with this shit without joking about it.
I think about killing myself every day. Every day feels agonizing and like it's a task. Even when I am having a good time, i'm exhausted and i'm waiting for it to be over. 
I probably traumatized the shit out of myself with my half-assed but violent suicide ""attempts"" that I can't even deal with them mentally, if I don't meme it out, then i'm just rotting with it in my mind, thinking about how ridiculous I am. And honestly, what's really embarassing about it is that i still keep joking about kms around my friends (i've got like 2), and if i do end up killing myself they will probably feel guilty like ""omg i wish i would've said sumth"" so there's that.
I hate it here. I hate myself.
The amount of shame i feel just by thinking about it. Ever since I was like 9. 
This is my last year of being here if my mental health doesn't get better. I'm done with ""help"". Been in ""therapy"" for a year now and i didn't make any progress regarding my mental health. In fact, while I was in therapy i lol
Even on social media, i always see people in ""depression/mental illness recovery"" but I never see one person who is fully recovered. Because I know for a fact, that I'll probably live the rest of my life like this. 
Self-pity is disgusting, but here I am, feeling sorry for myself. Then I punish myself for feeling this way, because I still feel like I deserve it. I do nothing. Just wasting my time. Waiting to kms. Knowing full well i'm going to do it one day. 
I'm just an impostor amongst living beings.
Most of them probably want to be here.
I don't. I just stick around because i am suppsed to. I am obligated to live, right? There is no right to die in this society, even if you really want to. 
I honestly say: fuck society, fuck nature, life and fuck you for putting me here and then expecting me to live. I don't owe anything to anyone. 
Why try and push through... when it's not getting better? 
I have spent an entire year helping someone recover from their eating disorder, and then they just tell me to go fuck myself because like ONCE FUCKING ONCE i actually opened up, talked about my feelings and expressed the way I feel about my life (wanting to end it). I DO NOT EXPECT ANYONE TO TELL ME ANYTHING, I JUST WANT SOMEONE TO SAY THEY UNDERSTAND. 
I always try to help others. But i never got the same thing back. I do not deserve help anyways, as the sub-human I am. I doubt any kind of help would even help me, at all.
So much evil happens in this world. Even just hearing about all this horrible shit is gut-wrenching. I live next to the country to Ukraine and the stories I hear are horrible. 
I HATE HUMANS I HATE HUMAN BEINGS WITH ALL MY HEART.
Coming across these unfortunate souls too, like I have no idea why we have to appreciate life when it sucks for everyone, and why do we do live if we all die in the end?
I could try to find so many distractions, but i'll never succeed because this feeling will always linger inside me. I've been alienated from this world years ago, and I'm not even a part of it since that.

I am the ultimate impostor amongs living beings. I refuse to even call myself a human because I am merely just a sub-specie of a monkey. 

I LITERALLY HAVE PPL IN MY LIFE WHO ARE DISSAPOINTED I HAVEN'T KILLED MYSELF YET, BUT IF I WERE TO DO SO, THEY'D ACT LIKE THE VICTIM!
People wouldn't be surprised if i killed myself. It's written all over my body, it's printed on my face, in my jokes, dude that's my whole existence and personality. 
They'd be surprised if I managed to live.
I hope the ones who have seen me as a burden or found me too hard to live with/care about will throw a fucking party when I die.I hope everyone who ever felt any kind of negative emotion towards me will be happy on the day that I die. Because I sure as hell will be. Not having to deal with this shit would be great! I'm a failure of a human being, but this is the last time I'll ever try! 

No one is at fault if i actually just wake up and succeeed.
It's only my ""fault"". And will always be. To make it clear, it was my choice.
No one is at fault. Just me.
And to clarify THERE ARE NO VICTIMS HERE. Not even the ones who knew me. Ifthey even knew me a slight bit, at all.

Hehe, hope anyone who's read this thing had a blast and I managed to make you laugh because I was just joking lol

Am I really that worthless. Unable to be loved or cared for. Not allowed to enjoy life. Is that you.. or me? 

My heart hung itself on a nicely tied rope, because of the emptiness you bring. Why is it still trying to pump warm blood in my cold body. Why do you pump when so weak? C'mon little heart please tell me. I am barely holding it together. I am barely here.. 

Not able to function. Everything slowing down, while life is speeding up. Responsibilities piling up. Can't move, can't achieve, can't compete. I am stuck.

Standing in a dark space. People around you, but not able to reach. Longing for warmth. Stop being alone. I take a step, everybody starts to move. Huh things going well. Mr hole you really there? Wait, I can't keep up. Dont leave me! 

I fall on the ground. People walking past. The faint sound of steps going further and further. Nothing to see or feel. Full of dread and silence. I am on my own.

Mr hole are you there? I have felt you grow. There is not much else anymore. Its just you now. My heart has stopped. It is so dark. I am not sure what I am anymore. Is there a way out? Mr hole... please take me.",1679072285.0
428,My relationship is broken and i have nothing left,1,11u6q7n,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11u6q7n/my_relationship_is_broken_and_i_have_nothing_left/,1,"I’ve been having a lot of problems with my husband lately, and after posting and asking people for relationship advice, I realize that there’s nothing to save, I can’t change him, nothings ever going to change. He’s never going to respect me. This week has already been really hard and yesterday I was the most depressed I’ve ever felt in a long time. I almost hurt myself. Now I feel even worse. Because everyone in the comments was telling me to divorce him, to leave him, he’s always going to be like that. I guess I’ve just been naïve and stupid to believe that he actually loved me and wanted to fix our relationship but I guess not. The only thing keeping me here is the thought that I’ll be able to see my siblings again one day, but as of right now I’m not allowed to speak to them because my parents are religious fanatics and don’t allow them contact into the outside world, so what is the point of me staying alive for a few more years to see if my siblings turned out crazy or if they turned out OK and leave my parents? 
Last week when I relapsed on self harm after a year clean my husband said he can’t deal with it emotionally anymore, he can’t deal with my shit. He’s already not there for me emotionally, he’s not supportive, but I understand why a partner wouldn’t want to stay with someone who relapsed on self harm after a year. Right now it’s taking everything in my body not to swallow my entire bottle of antidepressants, not to look for something to hurt myself, not to just walk out the door and into traffic. If I divorce him, I lose all financial support and I won’t be able to go to college. I have no family besides him, as the rest are abusive narcissists. 
What is the point in continuing my life? I really have nothing else. I have no energy for anything. I never want to be in another relationship again. Everything feels fake and horrible in my life. I don’t feel like I fit in. I have no friends. Dealing with mental illness every day is really hard in my situation. I have no motivation for anything else in my life. if I do end up dying tonight or this weekend, I don’t know what would happen to anyone. I don’t think anyone would care. He’s even told me that if I kill myself he’s not going to give me a funeral and he’s not going to tell my family that I died so I’m worried about that. I don’t care if I don’t have a funeral but I wish my family would at least be told. I don’t even want to die though. I want to have a happy life, I want to have a loving partner who respects me, I want to have a positive not toxic family and a happy environment with a successful job and two cats and a bunch of plants. 
But all of that seems so unattainable now. I feel so heartbroken, depressed, useless, pathetic, and hurt and betrayed. I know I’m not a great person, I’m not a great wife, I’ve done a lot of damage in this relationship as well but at least I’ve been trying to get better. And it seems like I’ve been trying to get better for nothing. 
I guess the only thing keeping me alive right now is the fear of dying, I’m scared of the pain, I’m scared something will go wrong and I will be left a vegetable of a human for the rest of my life, I’m scared that I’m going to go to hell or maybe nothing happens after I die. There’s no point in me trying to go to the hospital, because going there is justice torturous. you sit there for three days with nothing to do but the occasional coloring sheet. I’m tired of this horrible world, I’m tired of America, I’m tired of my life and I’m tired of this draining relationship. I can’t do this anymore. 
Secretly I hope I find the courage to finally end it all, but I’m scared of that is truly selfish and a horrible thing to do to my husband and his parents, but then again why does he care. He doesn’t respect our marriage. I kind of feel bad for him because he had a rough upbringing as well and maybe he doesn’t know better but that’s not an excuse to be a chronic narcissist and a liar. I will feel bad for his parents though they’ve done nothing but support me and love me and I really do love them. His mom treats me as his own daughter and she hugged me for a long time last night when she noticed i was sad. 
And I will feel bad for my siblings, because they will have no one to turn to in the future when they realize that my parents are in a cult and they need to get out. My husband already said that he doesn’t want them to live with us so I would have to leave him in order to take care of them anyways. I just hope that they come to realize the truth soon and find their way out and have good lives. I feel super guilty though, because a family friend of ours committed suicide a few years ago and my parents told them she died of sadness obviously because they were too young, and they were broken. How would they feel if they heard the same thing about their sister? 
I want to end it so badly but I guess I’m just a pussy.",1679093589.0

When I imagine the mess that will happen as soon as i reach the ground even if i might not feel it but it sounds not something i would do. I have read about helium gas and still there's a chance it fails and making things even worse. It seems that there's no way to do it peacefully. All ways involves act of violence on the body. I can't do it to myself. If I can hire someone who would shot me and make sure that I'm dead i would do it. If i just can trust him (with my death). So relax suicide help lines.

i lost my childhood, my soul and everything at only 5 years old and thats like one of the first memories i have. my old friend is dead and thats my fault. maybe i have a moral duty to kill myself. she needed me and i was also drowning. i told her she was loved but too fucking late and i deleted my account so she doesnt reply, i was scared of losing a friend. i was scared she was mad at me everytime she called i was high under my covers.
lately, i stopped eating, and i cry before i go to sleep  and when i wake up. i wish i didnt have so many things to do for those i love before i go. i hope its not scary and i hope its not hades and even if it is i’d get used to it just a few weeks in id be like oh well it is what it is isnt it, i’m just gonna let hades fuck me, use me, destroy me. 
there’s also this urge with an addrenaline every night before i sleep to take all the pills i have at home and id get some more and drink myself to death.
but everytime i go for it this feeling of guilt i dont know from what but its sooner or later. i don’t think i’d be able to endure this pain, all the pain, betryal. 
as a child in a horrible place i thought like all the princesses i’d have a happily ever after but my vision has gone grey even if the sun shines. 
like id beg someone to kill me i even ask people indirectely to do it nowadays.
i was only 14 standing at beachy head thinking the same goddamn thing, that is precisely a decade ago. 
i didn’t get better, things got worse. and i’m literally all alone, nobody to talk to when im sad or happy nothing is as good if you dont share it but nobody understands me and nobody can stay and watch the my cruxifiction. god i want to sceam somewhere in the wild my heart hurts. nothing is fair. 
the ones who never considered suicide perceieve the suicidal as selfish and crazy but all we want the agony to stop. 
i let men use me because ive felt dirty since i was 5, like to prove to myself that i am all the things that have been said to me. for every beating i had or praying to god that my father doesnt kill him and i whilst he was racing drunk, taking his head out the window like a teenager. memories haunt me. love is what would save me but thats an impossible. im like its always been bad, youre the devil, but then this god complex mania lifts me from the pits of hades and im like youre beautiful, divine, kind, you like to make everyone happy but i have no strength to stay to be fighting, i can’t save myself, nobody can save me not even if there is a god he cant only i, but kinda prefer to escape than to waiting at the airport for a boat. but goddamn it this guilt.i’m in a lot of pain and whoever feels the same hugs and kisses im holding your hand. fuck",1679093115.0

432,Inexplicability of Individually Developed Feelings Towards Abusive Societal Demands,1,11u5sdx,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11u5sdx/inexplicability_of_individually_developed/,0,"The suppression of energetic related science in the modern civilization does not an honest service in the preservation of one’s own desired individuality, more so towards a criminally disparaging series of efforts to extort, blackmail, and destroy the involved beings through change. The Soul is an invaluable resource, and provider of warmth, softness, and unconditional Love when in a lively state. In the midst of an effort to cooperate with labor demands to support oneself to achieve financial independence, it has become clear to one that an uncontrollable force has decided to prevent labor from occurring in and outside of a state of cooperation, through the deployment of poisons and technological weaponry somewhat useful in the task of destroying one’s brain. In addition, the energy and internal security necessary for enduring periods of labor and achieving profitable productivity temporarily strips the soul of its lustrous vibrance and leaves a cold, solid, and dark figure capable of no other than begetting the deepest sensations of lonesome remorse, so severe, the moments of absence are intolerable. One has concluded the destruction of one’s body by means of externally derived attacks to be preferable against the change of one’s soul, perhaps as a result of an understanding which could have only been acquired through mentioned moments. Life is too delicate and irreplaceable to turn away from for any amount of time, and it’s an over demanding sacrifice for success in the material world, however, success doesn’t appear to be promised in one’s unique situation given any sacrifice, as one seems to have been chosen for sacrifice by a less observable force.",1679091603.0

In the male suicide pandemic is veryone always says “talk”. But talking is seen as wanting attention, and gets shut down all the time. As a male i feel, dont speak up, unless you want more hurt. Try deal with it yourself- or just kill yourself. 

Everyone who wasn’t there for you will mourn for a day or an hour and continue life as notmal. As all you were to them was a little add on in their life.

I fucking felt it, and now hours before prom she tells me. And the FUCKING kicker!! She **still** wants to go. So all along, she was leading me on, and sent me pictures, etc because she only wanted to go to the prom. 
Fuck life. Do not tell me “it’s not fair.” 

Bonus content: the last two queer avenues I have been in. In 2019, after one date, that ending in making out and even a celebratory victory of “I really enjoyed that” then to several days of dwindling interest over a change of text responses, that I also wasn’t a fucking idiot to. No surprise, she wasn’t interested! Then in my first queer fling, she sexually assaulted me and ghosted me 8 hours later in 2012. But not before telling my very loose peers [our mutuals] at MY high school, at which she didn’t attend at all. In 2018, I found out shortly after she ghosted me because she was raped by a man, became pregnant. But I was a BIG denier of a queer identity because of this. Only this week, I acknowledged that she really raped me… I couldn’t before because “girls can’t lose their virginity to girls” and I lost my virginity to being raped. So I told others variations of the truth without realizing this, for years… She had two kids and she had Huntington’s disease, which I was aware of in 2012 for the chance of inheritability. But now she’s dying of it. Shortly after I ghosted her. And in the present, I did not text the girl I was seeing since January back. KARMA IS A BITCH!",1679073466.0

None of the people I truly trust will hug me. No one was ever interested in my romantically. No one ever held me tight. No one is deeply interested in me as a person. None of the people I liked a lot in my life have liked me back that way. My heart is so tired.

Yesterday, I was at an event and I sat in between two couples. This person on the one one side had their arm wrapped around their partner all the time and was leaning on them. They were just sharing moments of warmth and simple touch. I felt happy for them but it hurt so much to sit there knowing I will never know what true affection feels like. I am not mad - I mean, I am not attractive, I don't have my life together and I am very depressed. I am just really really sad.

I even get sad driving around the city seeing all those beautiful people and couples. Everything reminds me of this loneliness and the fact that I can't be loved or have a relationship because I of the mess I am. I don't know if people understand on the one hand what it feels like if no one ever liked you back in the way you liked them and on the other hand how hopeless you can feel with regard to this topic when you are suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts. In the past it always hurt but I could handle it somehow. But last year in November I fell in love and I hate it so much. Not only does the person not like me back that way but it also brought all those fears and intrusive negative thoughts to the surface and I don't really know how to handle it. I mean, who wants to be with a depressed, suicidal person?

I know I need to learn how to love myself blah blah blah. But for now I am just craving warmth and a long hug. It doesn't even have to be romantically. I just wish there was someone to hold me and comfort me during those times.

He knew how fragile I was, he knew how happy he made me and that I was smiling constantly thinking about him. 

But as usual, 1 week of being in a high state of temporary happiness is followed by an eternity of despair and darkness. He used me like a toy even though he held my hand so tightly and smiled wholeheartedly at me. 

He ghosted me on my birthday but before that he promised, pinky promised we would go eat ice cream together. 

I am so broken. No matter how hard I try, I can't connect with anyone. Every friend backstabs and ghosts me. I'm always being nice to everyone since I know how hard it is being hurt and being in mental anguish constantly. But no one gives a shit about me. 

I can't resist this cold, dark urge to harm myself. I CAN'T cope anymore. And again it's not just him, the past months been absolute HELL or more like my entire past.

I really want to meet other people, create a large group of friends and do a lot of networking but I absolutely hate the idea of having to go to the office every day.

I want adventure but I'm fully aware that trying to live like that will bring my possibilities of starting a business down to 0, but I'm asking myself if it's really worth trying doing the latter since the probably of succeeding is miniscule and i will probably waste my last years of youth in the rat race trying to acquire sufficient wealth and connections.

I was born cursed with a that mind wanted to experience all the world had to offer but without the time/possibility to do so and I just realized that because I'm too old to experience some of those things.

Then my mind started thinking: ""if I will never be happy and always yearning impossible things, if everything now is tasteless and the future will probably be gray maybe it's better to just end it all now""

Anyways, I don’t want to come off so harsh, but I’m over the stage of where “hey, let’s talk” is worth anything at this point. I think this is just my way of processing the inevitable, and for someone to know why.

I’m a medical student in my last year of school. Technically, it’s supposed to be a 4 year program, but my life has been such a shit show it’s taken me 7 years. I’ve had a failed engagement in addition to numerous other failed romantic relationships (primarily my doing), I lost my dad to chronic disease and watched him die in the ICU to a traumatic series of events where his organs failed one by one. My mom was truly one of my last hopes for holding onto any kind of “family” in life, but fell last year while on fentanyl and alcohol intoxication leading to quadriplegia. She’s now in the hospital (and has been for an extended period of time) and teetering with life and death. Not to mention she’s the reason for a lot of my childhood trauma, but that’s another story I don’t care to have anyone hear. Raise of hands anyone on similar stories?

Well, as I write this, I remember my 5 year old dog, Lenny, who I had to put to sleep a few weeks ago. I adopted him from the local shelter here in North Carolina when he was just 6 months old. He was perfect in every way. Honestly, if he lived as long as I did, I would’ve never considered suicide again. He was my best friend. He loved affection, cuddling, everything you want in a dog when you’re as lonely as I am in my late 20’s. Not to mention the crippling chronic depression from the age of 12 mixed with depersonalization/derealization that I wasn’t treated for until late college. Meds aren’t really helping I guess haha.

So to make this story even better (I know you’re interested and invested now), I am $200,000 USD in debt from medical school, but I have practically dropped out due to the previously mentioned events. So what am I left with? Nothing. Oh, oh… I know, we are all here for a greater reason and it’s selfish to consider this. But I am beyond reason at this point. I give up, I truly do. And this isn’t something I’m even happy to write about. I cried a few tears earlier because as I counted the tablets of 1.8 grams of tramadol and 8.9 grams of gabapentin I accumulated while my dog was sick, I realized this terrible nightmare will finally come to a close. 

This is terrible to write. It’s probably more terrible to read for some, but I know someone out there has more courage to reach out for help than I do when you’re in this situation. Don’t make my decision. You’re probably loved more than you realize.",1679035173.0

519,A year ago tomorrow I tried to kill myself and it’s bothering me,11,11tbaj1,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11tbaj1/a_year_ago_tomorrow_i_tried_to_kill_myself_and/,3,"On March 17, 2022 I hit a desperate low composed of loneliness, abandonment, stress, grief, and shame and decided I was done trying. Everything felt so crystal clear in that moment—like reality was finally coming back to me in my dazed mindset. 

I made a plan to drive about an hour out to a rural waterfront my family used to spend the summers at when I was a kid. But before I went, I hugged my animals and took the time to lay in the soft spring grass sprouting from the moist soil, treasuring them one last time even if I was numb to the peace they once brought me. Then I told my sister I was going on a drive and that I’d be back later. I looked my sister—my best friend and the only person supporting me—in the eye and lied to her. I had no intention of coming back home. I was gonna lie down at the water’s edge and die there, and I was ready to let her believe I was coming back. And honestly that bothers me more than anything else. 

I remember not even being worried about what my family would think. I knew they’d eventually worry once they stopped being able to reach me, knowing my state of mind and all, but even if they did call the police after a few hours, I didn’t figure they’d care much. I figured they’d be relieved I was gone. After all, they wouldn’t have to think about turning the corner into my room anymore and finding me dead, nor would they have to watch me waste away alive. It’s delusional, I know… I can see that now. And yeah… that’s another thing that really bothers me—how little I thought of them, even if they weren’t all that supportive. 

The thing was that I was also dealing with insomnia and anorexia at the time, so I hadn’t eaten that day or slept the night before. Had to pull off the road before I got to the lake so I wouldn’t crash and end up taking some innocent soul to the grave with me. The side of the road was as good a place as any, I decided, and I numbly reached for my method of choice in the passenger’s seat… only to discover that in my sleep-deprived, half-starved daze, I’d forgotten it and my wallet at home. I’d no means to harm myself, and no way to obtain a means.

I’ve definitely been on the mend over the last year or so, but last spring was my rock bottom. And with the date so close and the weather soft and the grass finally starting to green again, I can’t stop thinking about what I almost did. Is this normal? Should I feel as awful about this as I do? How do I lay this to rest for good and just move on?

I'm sorry that I couldn't tell any of my friends or family before this, but they would just try to stop me or blow this out of the water.

It doesn't feel like I'm crazy, honestly I feel perfectly sane, I've thought this out and made my choice. 

Two months ago, on my birthday, my parents dental insurance expired. So I went to have them checked one final time. Because I would never be able to afford that on my own since I can barley afford rent every month.

I was told that I have an infection that'll cause my teeth to fall out permanently, if not treated over the next three to five months. The cost of the treatment was 1.8k with the insurance. Of course that ended just two days after, so now the price is 4k.

Frankly, I don't have to explain how that is unobtainable. At 22 years old, I don't want to live the rest of my life without teeth, and my mouth is in constant pain.

This post is to explain why I did this to those that know me, when they find my account. Sorry I couldn't tell you guys. 

I don't have four thousand dollars. Please try to understand from my angle. The only thing to blame here is our Healthcare system. Those with money live, and people like me, die.

Today I made my choice.

I live alone and while I have good relationships with family and friends it doesn't always feel like it's enough. I just think back to when my sister was living with me and was pregnant and I would go out of my way constantly to help her like even waking up at 5:00 in the morning to go pick up her boyfriend from his job because he didn't drive. I know that these things were inconvenient and honestly not very healthy but I have a bit of a savior complex and I just feel like I have more value when I give to those around me. These days my sister and her fiance are doing pretty well with their family and I don't need to be a part of it which is good but sometimes it's hard.

I normally get most of my value and feeling needed from work but I'm even struggling with that as of late. I am far too critical of myself and often it feels like if I'm not giving my all that I'm not worth much at all. An example of this is the fact that I put the other manager on a shift to cover for an employee that needed the day off instead of taking on the shift myself. I work 4 10-hour shifts and taking the shift would have cut my weekend right down the middle with short turnarounds that would make it feel like not much of a weekend at all. I feel bad for saying that I need a weekend and I need to feel like I can recoup for my week and even though that feels like a very normal and reasonable thing to me it feels like I'm failing. Mind you the other manager would be there anyway but just working in the warehouse instead of the storefront So it really doesn't feel like an unreasonable ask but he kind of made me feel bad today about it.

At least I have my cat, he is starting to feel like the only thing that makes me feel needed. I'm struggling and I don't feel like I want to keep going. I will but it's getting hard.",1679035567.0

I'm sure noone will read this but I wanted to get it out.",1,11to2wk,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11to2wk/going_for_help_made_it_worse_they_got_police/,3,"I got sexual dysfunction that started out mild, some mild ed due to a pelvic floor problem. I went to a doctor they just said it was due to my generalized anxiety. I wanted to fix it so went to a psychiatrist. They prescribed me olanzapine and buspirone. I only took one pill olanzapine but didn't like it, then I took buspirone for a few months but lost thr ability to enjoy music and genitals became more and more desensitized.

After a year of this with no answers and out of frustration with my life I felt suicidal. I went for help. I told a social worker I was suicidal. They told me to go to the hospital. I went and they just kept me in a room and I told them I was feeling better and left.

After I got home two police officers showed up. I told them I was feeling better and that I was fine it was more a panic attack. They told me they had to bring me back to the hospital and I had no choice under Canada's mental health act. I told them I was fine and they pushed their way into my home and forced me with them with threat of jail time.

I was put in a hallway overnight, In the morning I saw a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist informed me that my loss of sensitivity to my genitals was due to depression. They gave me a prescription for bupropion. I asked if it had any sexual side effects, they told me it reverses sexusl dysfunction, that it has no sexual side effects.

I went home and I took 1 pill bupropion xl 150. I drank caffeine after, not knowing it interacts. After a few hours I became extremely agitated, I tried to masturbate that night only to find that I had completely lost all feeling in my penis. 
I went to a pharmacist and told them I was having a negative reaction, they told me it was fine to not take another pill as it would be out my system in a few days.

I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, I got extremely sick  2 days later. I was throwing up, I had diarrhea, I had muscle soreness. Test results showed that my testosterone dropped fifty percent since taking bupropion. I became completely emotionless. My symptoms are: complete genital anesthesia, inability to get erect, shrunken genitals, digestive issues, restless leg syndrome, insomnia, visual snow, anhedonia, inability to feel adrenaline, unable to orgasm, emotional blunting, severe memory problems, low testosterone, muscle weakness, cognitive problems. I can't follow movies, I can't do my hobbies. I can't remember anything, I couldn't even remember my own address.

So now I have no choice but to kill myself. I lost every single thing in my life. I lost my family and friends before all this, then I lost some of my sexuality. Then, after going for help I lost my ability to feel joy on a biochemical level, have been chemically castrated, completely stripped of all sexuality, became stupid and weak. Nothing I can do can build it back up, all my hormones and body functions are fucked.

I went back to the hospital, they told me ""it doesn't do that"". It is absolutely futile to talk about. The tests show my testosterone dropped 50 percent in a month. They tell me to get some sleep. They tell me it's anxiety. They don't help. I know I can't tell them I'm suicidal. It's what did this to me in the first place. None of what I worked my whole life to overcome and learn matters now. I am just a walking corpse. I needed my strength and intelligence. I have absolutely no reason to keep going. I just wanted to vent my frustration. It's been 5 months since I took the pill with no improvement.",1679051496.0

It’s come to a point where my BPD, depression, anxiety, and Asperger’s have completely taken over every aspect of my existence. I know it’s not healthy to define yourself by your mental health diagnoses and neurodivergence, but it’s hard not to when it consumes you entirely. 

Asperger’s doesn’t seem like it would be so awful to deal with, but it causes constant social dysfunction. I don’t have many close friends anymore, the ones I do are through social media, and I love them to death but the lack of people in my physical friend circle is non-existent. I can make friends occasionally, but I’m too afraid to interact with them, so I slowly disappear from their lives. I don’t know how to socialise like a normal person, I freeze and forget how to talk, and I don’t know how to respond to anything. My best friend is my partner and he’s the only person I can truly talk to openly and honestly without the fear of judgement or the deer in headlights response- which is great, of course. Would be a lot more enjoyable if he wasn’t in prison for a crime he didn’t commit. The lack of connection from my Asperger’s also extends to my 3 year old son. I have no idea how to communicate with him, play with him, or bond with him at all. And I wish I did, because I love him but can’t give him the relationship he deserves. This is harder to build because he is in foster care. 

The BPD and depression make everyday a high speed rollercoaster with tons of loops and twists and unexpected steep drops. I experience the full range of human emotions in one day, but the one emotion that does remain for longer periods of time is crippling depression. When I’m not depressed, I’m probably pissed off for no reason. And I start throwing things- once again, for no reason. I can’t get a damn thing done when I don’t know what emotion I’ll be experience at high intensity in the next hour.

Overall, I have no quality of life, all I want to do is get high off my ass and blackout. I have no motivation or drive. There’s nothing I want from this world, and I don’t see the purpose of staying around waiting for things to “get better” because realistically THEY FUCKING WON’T. I’ve been like this since I was 9-10, and I’m 22 now. I’ve been hospitalised 14 times. Attempted more times than I can count. Been on every SSRI AND SNRI known to man, even tried ketamine treatments at one point, to no avail. 

I’m ready to go, but I’m afraid of hurting the people around me. I am aware I am loved and care about by a few important people, and I cannot imagine putting this kind of burden on them. This is the one and only reason I’m alive. I wish I could end it, but I don’t think I can. I’m fucking irritated that I have empathy and am not so naive as to think nobody gives a damn about me.

Raped and molested as a child. Sexually assaulted at 20.
Raised by two narcissistic parents.
Beaten as a child. Yelled at, screamed at, so much work, so much gas lighting and manipulation/lies. 

I’m on max dose of Zoloft, a bunch of other meds. I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Without meds the pain is debilitating, with meds my mind works against me. Without meds my mind works against me.

I have several degrees and can’t seem to make above 50k a year when inflation keeps rising. Student loans are impossible to pay off. Rent is going up, I’m getting booted from my apartment so landlord can sell. My rent will double.

I’m losing weight despite eating a lot.
All I see are images of rape and my horrible past abuse. I’m going to get fired from my job for incompetence/forgetfulness. Not because I can’t do my job, but because my own mind is so scattered I can’t focus anymore. 

Four prescriptions for this and I still feel like killing myself and want to die. 

Because of childhood rape I can’t use the bathroom properly. My body doesn’t tell me when it’s time to go until it’s urgent and I barely make it to a bathroom. I’ve had accidents at work and home. So embarrassing. I’m in physical therapy but it’s slow going. 

I’m in a codependent marriage and my wife dismisses my feelings and makes me feel bad for wanting a hug. I try to meet her needs/wants. She also lied to me about her past, telling the truth just months into marriage which has broken my trust. She also deserves better, as I hate sex. Sex only reminds me of rape/assault and I have almost zero feeling in my genital area. I at least told her this early, honesty is important to me.

I have no pleasure in life. I can’t sleep right even with help. I go to the bathroom several times a night. Can’t continue life struggling constantly. I hate that my abusers are living their best life while I struggle. I’m sick of people telling me they’re sorry I feel that way, or to just be positive. I’m sick of my therapist telling me to have hope. 

All I have to look forward to is pain (physical and mental), struggling daily with even minor tasks. I take 5 steps and forget what I was doing/where I put something. I can’t focus on anything. 

It’s so frustrating because I could be capable of so much more. Instead I’m constantly frozen, flighting, fawning. Been trying for years to get better, it’s not working. I have extremely complex PTSD. 

Sleep is a struggle, working is a struggle, personal life is a struggle. I missed out on so much life and basic human experiences. People are terrifying and amazing. 

I don’t think I’m worthless, my traumas aren’t my fault. I just have no more desire to live with images/videos of what happened. To struggle in every aspect. Too choose pain or medicating my brain into a fog, it’s foggy anyways! I don’t I can even work at a grocery store. I used to be a teacher and musician/engineer! The stress destroyed me. 

My future is increasing pain, constant struggle. I hope I can find the courage to end my life, because living is suffering and has been since I was an infant. I know therapy can help many, but I’ve come to the conclusion my demons are more than I can handle. I’ll try to hold out but I don’t think I’m strong enough anymore. I’m so tired and exhausted from the constant excruciating struggle.",1678983851.0

The feeling I have now, it's like nothing I've felt before. It's been here for a while, at this intensity. I have this strong disillusionment for everything around me. I've lost all hope really, there's nothing in this world that sticks out to me as worth anything to be enticing. I only leave the house on weekends for my job. I'm taking time off from college after not being able to get out of bed after transferring (stupidly, I was less than a full semester's worth of classes away from my original degree). I transferred so I could be happy after having issues at my previous college and it being laced with memories of my active eating disorder. I switched my original major after a professor told me that she didn't think I was that passionate about music as I originally thought I was. It ruined everything for me, and at a small college, I had no other option in voice teacher.

I was going to a new music program after that being my true passion. I didn't make any friends last semester. I have no friends now besides my husband. We got married last summer. In a way, he was the only way out from the claws of my narcissistic mother. I still don't know how to drive and didn't have a job until college. I went NC with her last year.

I stay at home day and I do nothing. I know I have promise but it's pointless. Everything is. I feel so worthless and I just know that everything I've ever promised to myself was pointless.

I don't feel like I can connect to any other human in my life. I don't feel like I even connect to anyone else. I seriously think that something is wrong with me and that also causes me a large amount of distress. I know that I'm different. I know that I always have been and I know my brain isn't like everyone else's.

I now pretty consistently get high or drunk whenever I want to self harm, or whenever I don't want to feel anything. I don't do it every day, couple times a week, but I know it may be maladaptive. It's of concern. My therapist thinks I may have PMDD too which doesn't help anything. I'm too scared to see a GYN because of past trauma, and I can't really take any SSRI.

I've been thinking a lot of psych wards. I know they aren't great, but I feel like I need a break away from everything, including my husband. But I have deadly food allergies and I've heard and read stories of so many people not getting the right food, only food that would hurt them and then I'd have to not eat to protect myself, but when I stop eating, I'll stop eating myself into a relapse. I even was exposed to my allergens at a residential ED facility after my dietician told me I had nothing to worry about, to alleviate some fears around eating.

So, a psych ward could do more harm than good. These are very much passive thoughts, but I'm afraid of escalation.

I don't know what I want. I'm high right now, so this didn't make any sense I'm sure. I know I'm smarter than the grammar I utilized above, so please believe me on that, my intelligence is the only thing I have some faith in (but even then, I think that maybe I'm not as truly smart as I think I am and am only lying to myself and in real actuality, I'm actually not. It would be the end of me.) Advice would be nice. I know I need to get out of the house, but my husband is at work all day, I can't drive, no public transportation, can't afford rideshare, an intense fear of strangers. I'm also scared to leave my house sometimes now.

Whatever you say, please don't be a dick. I'm sorry it's long and there's no TLDR, but at least I used paragraphs to break it up.",1679020292.0

Why should I kill myself if anything I do is pointless and meaningless? Why should I live if everything I do is pointless and meaningless? 
Is our suffering pointless?
God is a joke. It brings comfort to those who have fallen and do not wish to see the harsh reality of life. Why do we suffer? We are not your son. I am not your son. I cannot rely on anyone to bring me my own death except myself and I shall do it. There is one problem though. Should I really be the judge on whether or not I should kill myself? That I have the right to die? I was born to die, we all were, so what would it matter if I was the one who killed myself? Nothing matters. Life is meaningless, we will make out of it what we can and will and I decide to kill myself. Life is so meaningless that it’s absurd that it doesn’t have one, despite that being the meaning which makes it even more absurd. Good people die while the bad succeed. I will never do anything great or honorable in this world. I will never get to be the man I would like to be, it’s not possible. I am not saying that out of pity but it is quite literally the truth. It’s fact. Mother will never see me and Father never will as well. I will never experience the things I long to experience. Nobody will see me as I do not even see myself and will never. It saddens me that I will never do anything in life. We are born, we grow, we work shit jobs and die as a nobody. There are so many people I will never have met or known their stories and ideas and creations. Places I will never visit or go to. All of these people I’ve met and spoken to will all be gone.Their stories, their ideas, their faces, their voices and their opinions. My memories with them. They way they’ve touched me or spoken to me or had made me laughed. Gone. As well as the stories and ideas and creations of people I have not met. The films I’ve watched. The music I’ve listened to, crying or not. My suffering I’ve endured. My pointless slitting of wrists. I’m tired of trying anymore. I attempt to put myself in places of good but it seems as if I do not see the point in being happy or making others light up in the happiness I will never achieve. I cannot be truly happy, nor can anybody but even momentarily, I feel like total shit. All the people around me will be gone when I am dead or when they die. I understand that death is the meaning to live but it lingers on my mind so often that it’s torture. I cannot be happy because the reality of everything is so loud, so harsh. All of my stories and memories will be long gone and forgotten and I can’t do anything about it. I don’t want to forget everything, I don’t want my stories to be forgotten. In the end, it doesn’t matter how I feel or want because the fact is that one day I will die by my hands and nobody will see it coming. But I don’t want to die right? I just cried on and on about how I didn’t want to forget everything but now here I am planning to kill myself, to bring me my own fear. At the same time, it won’t matter so why care when I am dead and rotting away? Because I am still alive, right now, in this moment. To want to die and to not, it is such a problematic situation that I cannot get myself out of, it’s unbearable. Why do we suffer so much pointless pain and then die? Everything we went through, everything we thought and felt. Gone. To confess, I want to live. I don’t want to die. I enjoy being alive. Smelling everything. Listening to sounds. Seeing everything around me. Touching what can be touched. Feeling what can be felt. Suffering. I find satisfaction in being alive. I want to be happy. Everyone wants to be content and to live even if they do not believe it or agree. It is only human to want to live, suicide is unnatural. To want to kill yourself is such an odd idea. Why were we given a body? To live. Which means we shall suffer as much as we shall create moments of pure pleasure. I am not natural though, I am sick in the head and I believe that there is no other choice than to resort to suicide. I don’t want to die. I want to live but I cannot. I will not.

My dad and my sister have delt with drug addiction, my little brother had a rough time and to top it off, my older brother took his own life when I was 15. I think about how much it hurt to lose my big brother. It hurt us all and my dad relapsed because of it. 

I had witnessed my dad relapse even though he had been clean since I was about 3ish. My parents divorced and everything fell apart. I had to swing fists against a meth addict who was my father. 

He's clean now. My parents are actually planning to get remarried. My dad is amazing when he is clean. They're doing better as well as my other siblings. Here's my struggle...

I'm mad. I wanted it to be me. My brother that took his life was in another state. We had different moms and his mom was amazing. My mom broke my rib by kicking me after she beat the fuck out of me. 

I know I shouldn't compare struggles. But I was left without my big brother, while our dad stole from me. My mom beat me, and it was worse when my dad was pissing her off. She would take it out on me. Where I'm at... I wouldn't call it forgiveness because when I bring it up to my parents, they deny everything. So I just choose silence. 

I'm mad. I want it to be me. But if I end it, my dad and sister might relapse. My brother would be hurt. I'm not sure how my mom would feel... but I wish it were ok to give up. And I think if my brother would have never took his own life, I'd do it.",1679032172.0

New environment, new job, new everything, it was a stressful period but we had each other. She left me last Christmas for someone that is far richer and far older than me. Her decision was made apparently for months already and she told me that she sees me only as her brother or best friend. I got friendzoned by my wife if you can believe that... 

According to her I was not earning enough (on the same level as locals or more than her), I was not extraverted enough (I can't really make friends with nobody in this new hermetic place) and I was too much of a child (I was not trying to buy a beachfront house for $4M). And she met of course a 40 something millionaire, with a beachfront 3 stories house, that doesn't need to work and parties all the time on his yacht. My already low self esteem just reached the Mariana trench depth. I'm never good enough for nobody. 

After work I come home to an empty flat. I do groceries alone, I go to the gym alone, I watch a movie alone. There are weeks I don't open my mouth at all. I'm alone with my thoughts

I don't touch any alcohol because that's a slippery slope. I tried to install some online dating apps but nobody wants a relationship anymore just hook ups or dates. I'm coming home and I work out and watch YouTube and that's my life. My parents are long dead, I don't have any friends here, my friends from college all stayed in their countries with their families. 

So I just exist. What's the point?

For 3 months now every time I go to sleep I think about ways to commit suicide. That pills are not reliable, that hanging or cutting would be too painful. So I was thinking about blowing my brain, drowning or using car exhaust. And I'm just waiting on god knows what? And it got me thinking about the subject of this post. Why don't I hop on a plane and go to let's say... Marocoo or Nepal? And I got my answer. Because I will be also alone there. Happiness is being able to share your thoughts and your happiness with someone, family, wife or friends. I'm alone here and ill be alone there. Anyone that tells you to ""first you need to find happiness inside you"" or ""you can't basé your worth on someone else's love"" has never been truly alone. 

I could drown my sorrow and my thoughts in alcohol but that's not the way. For the time being, I make them go away with media and with work but it doesn't always work.

Ive lost all motiviation all the things Ive wanted to do or make can be done better by someone else and now AI. which all take all the jobs in the area I want and make it impossible for me to obtain a job after college. I will be washing dishes my whole life and my degree and everything i have worked for so far and for the next two years will be worthless just like i am. its my own fault for ever having the ego to think i could be worth more than the shit on the floor no one bothered to fucking throw away because it just was not worth the effort. 

&#x200B;

the computers the AI will replace everything, anything that makes us human art, literature, drawings, human creativity of all kinds has been devalued out of existance there is not point of pursuiting anything because the things that made us happy and human are now nothing and we will all be consumed into the void with no escape in site, either that or we will be vaporized by nuclear warfare as if it even fucking matters anymore how we fade away from this sad stupid existance. 

&#x200B;

Nobody seems to see it, not one person ive met or seen seems to see what is going to happen everyone is just going through it as if they are not about to be replaced as if not every single person except the very wealthy will be replaced. in the old days they wanted many children not just becasue many would die to disease but, they needed a growing workforce to keep the engine of society running. Now that is gone eventually robotots, AI models, computers, drones, kiosks and all will replace those jobs and then the everyone will no longer be necessary or important. they will remove us in some way, in the best case by making sure we dont reproduce slowly depopulating us or in the more likely case finding someway to remove us in a more forceful manner. it wont  happen today tommorow or even very soon but, i believe before the end of the century or even by the 2050s.

&#x200B;

the is no more point in continueing if i no for certain the world i will continue into will be worse than the one i already hate living in and i cant change i never will be able too nobody can no matter how nieeve of a person they are they cant change it. It was'nt any better in the past it never really was we just got good at hiding it. because it was never the physical pain of living outside needing to survie not having electricity, dying of disease, no clean water, no comfy first world life. no not in my diluded eyes, it was the pointless the void, the fact that the pain that is inflicted upon us that we are forced to endure no matter how miniscule first world problems they may be or man made horrors beyond comprehenion. we experience these for no reason, nothing, one day we will die, and maybe there might be some fun things along the way to hide the truths but ultimately the end will be same.

&#x200B;

unlucky for me i find little to no joy in anything anymore my mind is dull and slow and foggy except for void that will consume me completely one day with no hope of chainging it. maybe the fog is what prevents me from seeing what THEY see but, i feel that i this may not be the case. I just wish it would consume me faster or relieve itself and let me see what they see again but, neither will happen.

I dont see anything in the furture anymore just foggyiness, nothingness, dread and fear at I will be forced to deal with despite having no energy or motivation to do so even thought they may not be bad things really in the grand scheme of things. My life is'nt bad i live a first world lifestyle things have been handed to me and ive never had to struggle in the way others have, never had anything horrible or painful happen to me. I am just simply weak even with life on the easiest setting imaginable i still struggle and fail at almost everything and manage to be completely and utterly incompetent, i will never i acheive anything, past highschool i have made no freinds and i most likely will reamain that way, im almost certaintly never getting a love interst, or girlfreind or whateever, im never going to create any of the things i have wanted to, nobody really likes although nobody truly hates me either, i will never have anything to add and I have no excuse for any of it.

&#x200B;

I cant stand this fucking shit anymore everyday it gets worse and worse, everytime i hope it will get better. I try to better myself everyday, i go the gym, i try to eat healthy elminating foods, i drink as much water as i feasibly can but, im constantly fucking thirsty, i take cold showers, i take supplements, i go to a phsych/therapist, i take medications. None make a difference, not longer than a few months anyways. and it just gets worse today my lower back and testicles hurt so fucking bad but, i can tell no one and there is nothing that can be done to solve it and even if there was why? one problem medical or physical, or life, or the car, or the computer or whatever the fuck problems just run into more problemss wo why even bother solving them. 

&#x200B;

We are going nowhere i dont understand where anything is going its just moving but, for what why i cant rap my head around because, in the end its just a question nobody has an answerer and not without a lack of trying. but, everyone else has distracted themselves with other things and moved on wither their life. But i cant, i dont think that i can, the dread, the emptieness, the hopelessness, the no will to do anything, the lack of joy, the lack of anything human and the lonliness of it all. I will be forced to go through it time and time again for nothing and no reason at all i hope the hand of god comes down wipese me off the face the earth as if that would ever happen. 

&#x200B;

But, it would happen if i ever found a way out of everything than that would be the day the world ends becasue thats how it alwasys fucking goes so why even try. I want to do it so bad i loathe those whome care because they make it so that i cant do it and the door will reamin locked keeping me in my chamber. I wish i could just do it anyways its not my fault they put thier eggs in a poorly woven basket. but i know that I wont because i would have by now if i could.",1679021058.0

I don't come into the office unless there are specific tasks that he wants completed. Usually site visits or meetings with clients. When he texts me, he usually gives me a reason that I'm coming in.

&#x200B;

When I first met him (started talking to him) he was always talking about suicide. Every time I saw him he would tell me how much he wanted to blow his brains out. I naively thought he wasn't being serious until one day he wasn't at school. The next day he told me his parents caught him with a rifle in his mouth. I then started taking it seriously and started thinking up a game plan on what to do. A few weeks later he misses another day of school, and when he came back he said he swallowed an entire bottle of Benadryl and spent the night in the hospital. After the hospital visit they described him Xanax for his anxiety, (you can see where this is going.) Just today he told me he swallowed an entire bottle of Xanax, and died. His abusive and absent dad (who was visiting the family because my friend's cousin committed suicide) saved him by putting him in an ice bath. I remember last night having a bad feeling and wanting to message him, but I didn't. I nearly killed him.

I tried to find things for him to look forward to, and we came up with an elaborate plan to run away to Brazil via sailboat. The plan was great, on paper. Once he figured out it was impossible, and his cousin committed suicide (the second cousin to commit suicide in 2 months,) he changed. He started taking multiple Xanax and other pills in school. Just today I watched him take 13 Oxycodone.

One of these days he's going to succeed, and it will be completely be my fault.

For what is worth Im in a country with a very different culture from USA when it comes to living with your parents after 18, but yeah, Im a loser. Honestly, I could just rent something and be out, assume Im one more if my generation that is going to be living paycheck to paycheck and fuck off, so I know Im putting up excuses to not do it.
But I've been the only thing holding my family together since as long as I remember, or at least it feels like it. When you have been having to put up with your older sister mental struggles, random fits of rage, and nightlong crying and screeching for the most absurd shit, since you where going to elementary school, you end up adapting to it; You know your parents have no room left for bullshit anymore, so you learn to be the good kid that always try to reconcile both parts, or at least not cause more trouble. Somehow, that makes your sister resent you and put a target on your back, but you are kind of glad because now its you taking the brunt of it and not your mom, and you can handle it better since you've already been born into it and its not your daughter, so you can just dehumanize them in your mind to rationalize what her erratic behaviour.
But its not like your sister is the only one making sure you cry yourself to sleep curled up in a ball at least twice a week; Being so young you couldn't put your finger on it, but when you start going to highschool you finally see your parents have the emotional intelligence of a toddler; So you have been growing up bottling up your feelings and your family's fits and madness deep inside you, because you know you are the only one who can be the storeroom of so much shit and ain't no way your parents are going to help you unload all of that; If anything, the few times you actually shown them the storeroom, they saw it as an opportunity to add some more trash to the pile.
And that's how, through the years, you have been growing up to be the glue that barely holds together your dysfunctional family. You are so accustomed to the silent treatment from your dad when he gets angry for whatever reason, you end up liking when he goes for months (up to a year one time) without talking to you, not even acknowledging your presence when you are in the same room, for the peace that it brings to the house. Eventually your sister fucks off to some random place to work with animals, so its you and your parents now, the main antagonist is gone (with regular guest appearances that would bring back the good old times of slamming shut doors), so maybe you can finally have some semblance of a normal family life, right? 
You guessed it, nope; There is quite an age gap between my sister and me (12 years), so when she went away my parents where  like 5 years away from retirement. During this time life was easier, while still carrying the storeroom of shit with me, at least it was not growing so fast; Ended my studies, found a job. Then my parents retired and home was fucking hell again; As I said, my parents are incapable of having a constructive, nuanced discussion to solve disagreements; My dads standard response was the silent treatment (with hour long sessions of the most hurtful insults a parent can say, said high enough for you the hear while in other part of the house); My mom, crying, screaming, and throwing the pitiest arguments and most vile shit she could remember at you, with your heart wrenching each time you see her cry because she is your mom, even if she is destroying your sanity.
 But now it was aggravated by both of them being home all day, and of old age. My dad started having no qualms with matching my mom in screaming matches while also throwing whatever he had in hand around, to the point Im convinced he is showing early signs of dementia. 
So now Im stuck here, waiting for the daily dose of screaming and crying displays for the pitiest, most absurd shit again. 

Some days it makes me want to walk out of my room while they are in the living room, pass trough it to the terrace and jump headfirst. I had many days where I almost did it when I was younger, but know I dont even have the hope of this ever getting better. The solution is so easy most people that have endured actual physical abuse and dealt with much, much worse cards in life will be mad at how stupid I am. I just need to bite the bullet and fuck off this damn house forever so I can be another cog in the machine for the rest of my life. Most people dont have that possiblity,  but somehow here I am disregarding it like a worthess piece of shit.

But somehow I still care about them, and I truly fear what would happen in this house if I were not here to store all the shit, and care for them now that they are older. 
I just wish I could cease to exist sometimes

I want to die so badly, everyday, but am so scared how it will effect my partner and my family. I am certain I wouldn't be here if not for them.
I want to try to stop obsessing about it, but they are pretty intense intrusive thoughts. They don't subside, they just get worse, more graphic and detailed. Nothing stops them.
The worst thing I do is try to be present. Present here? No thanks. The more I pay attention to the world we live in, the world around me, I don't really see a place for me. People are so hateful and angry. I don't fit anywhere.
I sometimes think being stardust is probably a lot more pleasant than being stuck on a dying planet, in a body that isn't mine, surrounded by people that hate me, with leaders that will do nothing to change any of the bad in the world. It will all just get worse. And what, I have to sit and watch? I have to be around for this s**t-show?

Its getting easier to not be afraid, at least. I haven't been talking to family, that has helped. It rids me of some guilt when they're far from mind. And I think my partner is starting to get tired of how sad I am anyway. I never want to go out, I stopped going to the gym, I can't even put out cuz I can only think about how worthless I am during s**, and then I start crying during, and so the intrusive thoughts win there too. I think about how it would feel for him to smother me-gently, caringly, mercifully putting me out of my misery...
And I try to justify these thoughts by telling myself that, without me, he will get to meet some other nice girl that isn't so broken, that can give him children, that will be happy for more than a fleeting moment once in a while. She would make him truly happy rather than bring him down like I do.
I just feel like poison, and all I do is make people sad or hateful. I kill joy in everything I get close to.

Almost half of my life. Grew up in a single parent physically and emotionally abusive household. Developed crippling anxiety at a young age. Social events make my anxiety spike so I isolate myself which leads to suicidal thoughts. I coped with my terrible upbringing by subconsciously getting into codependent relationships. Entered my first relationship at 14 dated that girl until I was 19. Dated another girl from 19 until now. It sounds cliche but the loneliness is catching up to me. I struggle to build meaningful friendships because I don’t trust people and I have never had the energy to seek new relationships they sorta just happened. I center so much of my life around my s/o’s that when they leave I feel I have no purpose. The little family that I have all lives across the country because I moved to be with my gf at the time. Now I’m thousands of miles from anyone I know. My father passed away within the last year and I haven’t properly grieved his passing (if there is a proper way). I can be in a room full of 5,000 people and feel more alone than when I’m alone. I fear that suicidal issues aren’t as simple as thinking differently or adjusting your lifestyle. Yes, that can help. But there’s a reason highly successful people with the world in their hands also kill themselves. Our brains are wired differently. We don’t produce enough positive chemicals. There is no natural way to fix this that doesn’t require medication which ultimately leads to the same end result. Us people with suicidal ideation aren’t “crazy” or bad people - we just were dealt a bad hand. We feel our negative emotions much stronger than most. Choosing to take your own life is not weak or selfish, in fact it’s quite the opposite. We live in a world where the best life advice you will receive is “do what’s best for you” and right now when I’m evaluating what’s best for me - it’s not being alive. Ask yourself - “what are the cons of being dead?”",1678995339.0

I have a knife I keep sharp, and I meant into my throat and hit my carotid or jugular.

I know that sounds dramatic and silly, because both are deep and covered by a lot. But I'd done planning and I figured it was worth a shot.

So long as I hit that, it would be done, right? I know stabbing oneself is a hard thing to do, but I figured if I could get the angle right, it'd be like jumping into a cold shower.

I'd practiced with a spring-loaded toilet paper holder, thinking it the best (if very rough) proxy for the mechanical action of it all. I also practiced driving my elbow into a door-frame, thinking that level of indirection might make it easier to succeed.

Of course, it didn't, but the *experience* was strange. It felt as if the range of motion of my joints simply didn't allow me to go any further, no matter how much momentum I tried to build beforehand. But while I was there, I decided to keep pushing the knife deeper. It felt as if I had gotten the knife *deep*, and I was even worried I hit something noncritical, but nope, I barely even broke the skin.

I'd tried a few different times, and I had drank a lot of alcohol thinking it might make it easier. Still no, I just ended up drunk and sad.

My best friends back in 3th grade kicked me out because I was able to skip my exams because of surgery. They were jealous I could graduate my year without my exams. Since then they have been total jerks to me and are still in my class.

After a while I became depressed, i really tried to hang in there like everyone was telling me to do. After a while a different classmate asked me if I wanted come with them to a bar, i gladly accepted and went with them. It was my first time ever being in a bar, but I liked it. I went 2 more times with them until they told me they rather have that i would stay home. Broke my heart again.

2 years I walked around without any friends at school. Only friend I had was this girl I had a huge crush on at my art school. We became really close, and at some point I told her how I felt. She rejected me and began to speak awful rumours about me. 

I though my life was over for a few months, untill I recently met a nice couple of people Wich i went to parties with a couple of times. They were also Friends with this girl, but that didn't matter to me. The group contained my neighbor, someone from my school and a whole bunch of people I didnt really knew. 

I was really happy again. I thought I had great friends, school went okay.. but yesterday I got a text from one of the people from that group Wich stated that they didn't think I fit in their group, because they knew each other for so long and the group was getting to big with me in it. 

I am miserable.. 

My parents keep telling me ""your time will come, you will make friends"".. i am sick of waiting, trying, getting rejected everywhere. I'm almost 18 and never had any real friends.

I just don't know how long I can keep going like this, i really wanna rest, a quiet life.",1678983975.0

I am a senior in high school in Canada and I have not felt alive since 2019 I used to be so outgoing and participate in events  and could start conversations with people on my own  and had so many friends were people knew as a nice and kind person that people can talk to  and during grade 8 in 2019 there was this girl that I met that i liked she was so special to me she was the first person I ever liked we met one recess where she was by herself and i asked what was wrong she shared her feelings the details were not important but i felt so great when she shared it to me we started talking and texting and facetiming like every day It was so fun we got to know so much about each other and i fell in Love with her even though we were just friends I told her I liked her she said she liked me but didn't want to date then I said I loved her she probably thought I was an idiot because how could you love someone if they don't even like you back well i did then I found out she liked my friend and this completely crushed me they didnt date but still this completely destroyed broke me she noticed she kept saying sorry and asking for forginvess and wanting to still be friends I accepted but we just argued all the time we were still close but it wasnt the same people during this time called me depressed cause i was sad that this girl didnt like me which was true I was sad even she noticed I even asked her to prom even after everything she said yes but a week before our grad she said no saying she didnt think it was right I should of known she didnt like me i should have enever asked garde 8 ended she left schools we still texted upto grade 11 then we stopped cause she I felt she was forgetting me and she would takes days to respond and even forgot my birthday multiple times and this made me das because at one point she knew me beter then myself it took me from grade 8 to grade 10 to finally get over her I cried myself multiple times to sleep thinking about her well atealst the sad music felt so good to listen to now. Sorry for getting off track , summer of grade 8 was great though I spent it with my friends and we even recorded youtube videos. They never got that many views but making them was an amazing experience that I will always remember. Grade 9 starts and I was scared which was normal but i was so introverted and nervous that I didn't talk to anyone I just assumed people would talk to me this never happened and on top of this I have really low confidence and my friends just started to call me to introverted and awkward which was true but I took it to personally and I let those words define me and sadly this is all I know and I still let it do for me they all made other friends and I was also no longer part of the group chat and parties but I know its my fault cause I distanced myself from them and other people in general but sometimes I tried to talk to people but covid came while I was in grade 9 and this did not help with my social skills I was alone i did the work and got good marks in th 80s but when grade 10 came i chose a bunch of useless courses that I thought were good cause of the youtube gurus in business so i chose them not knowing that they weren't good also grade 10 was also online so I was at home like 90% of the year and my parents wanted me to go outside but i didnt because I was terrified of finding people my age and having to inteact with them grade 11 came and it was in perons i went back and itw as the hardest thing ever cause U ahd spent the last years cheating and did not know that much and on top of that I had nobody to talk to my marks dropped and I hid in washrooms during lunch so i did not have to see other people I went back online for the second semester this was a huge mistake this is when I stared to get stress I would throw things and cut myself hit my head say horrible things to myself because I was tired i would even say Im going to kill myself to my parents My dad would get mad my mom would cry and I did not mean to make her cry or hurt but I still kept saying that and additionally I completely burnet my self out during the end of grade 11 and i am still recovering from it with heavy procrasanting and sterasing for any amount of work. But in the winter of grade 11 I started working at a grocery store were I met this girl and for five months I was so scared to talk to her or approach her but I wanted to cause I felt like we could of had something special and one day during the summer i heard a coworker saying she was going to leave the country  and then got the courage to talk to her so I did and for the entire week before she was going and it was amazing we did have a good connection but i t was to late she left and I was so disappointed I know I fall in love to fast and I know that I am selfish for wanting someone to love me and I can't even imagine someone saying I want you only you and wanting to spend the rest of their lives with me and saying I love you but I want that so bad to have a person love me the same way I would love them to only want to spend time with that person over everybody else to be someones favourite person but I Know that will never happen it took me very little time to get over this girl now for grade 12 it got worse I was now fully in person alone with bad marks and stressed spending lunches in a corner on my phone like an idiot I reconetd with some of my old friends but its never going to feel the same I still feel like an outsider and that our time has passed I even called the suicide hotline cause of uni appliactions and I was going to do it by jumping of a tall bridge near my school my mom wants me to go to therapy but i dont feel like I am deserving of that and also there have been some school shooting threats at my school but I still went to school hpoiing to get shot and killed and die a t a young age which I am still hopeing for.",1678995217.0
709,I've been emotionally abused twice in one year and I kind of want to end my life,4,11sryn4,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11sryn4/ive_been_emotionally_abused_twice_in_one_year_and/,2,"So backstory, earlier this year I was essentially being used and taken advantage of by a person who I think exhibits all of the signs a person with narcissistic personality disorder would exhibit. He was the nicest, most charming, sweet endearing person until one day he wasn't. The more I began to figure him out, the sooner he began the discarding phase and he found a new girl to basically latch onto and as the gay friend, I was history once she showed up. Now this poor girl has no idea what a psychopath he is yet and he's probably going to destroy her the way he did me. 

Then upon exiting that relationship, I began a new friendship with another person who I bonded with based on our history of abusive people we let into our lives. He was super supportive at first and was there to listen to me vent about what's his face on a daily basis. I was having anxiety attacks about what the narcissist did to me and I was traumatized by the whole thing and he was there for all of that. The only problem is that this guy is a fucking know it all and then one day we got into an argument and he turned into one of the biggest assholes on the planet. I wouldn't call him a narcissist, but I would go so far as to say he totally would rather die than admit he was wrong. So he did things like gaslight me and he ghosted me out of thin air not once but twice. And he'd say things like ghosting was the ""adult"" thing to do. And he has been lying to me about getting back together with his abusive ex girlfriend who he just learned was the mother of his child. My friends have shown me screenshots of him telling them he's trying to get back together with her. And I accused him of lying to me about that and he's been saying things like I'm ""delusional"" and ""crazy"" and that I'm not living in reality and don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Etc. Etc. 

And at first, I am not going to lie, I wanted to attempt to kill myself just to make him feel terrible for how he treated me. But then I thought this dude is so deranged at this point that he'd probably still convince himself that he was entirely in the right and even if I literally killed myself and died tomorrow, he'd somehow warp the narrative to make it so that he was the victim and I was the villain. And now, I just want to kill myself because twice in one year, I've emotionally invested in two people who I legitimately thought were good people who cared about me. And it turns out they were backstabbers. And so now I don't trust my own shadow. I don't trust ANYONE. I feel like everyone fades away or let's me down or I stupidly push them away and the one thing that seems to be constant is that no one ever sticks around. And I hate my family. I hate everyone I know right now. I hate everything except for my dog. He's the only thing that is keeping me alive right now. But I have a box cutter and a bottle of Windex next to my bed and I'm thinking of straight up splicing myself open and I'm thinking of injecting poisonous chemicals into my body.

And I'm pissed off bc I'm trying to get laid. I'm a porn addict and I can't stop with that. And everyone's ugly on Tinder and it feels so fucking hopeless. I feel like I'm failing in every department of life. Any time I make an effort to improve some aspect of my life, it seems like it's all for fucking nothing. Career goals? Don't have the money to start. Relationship goals? Everyone's ugly or unavailable or heterosexual. Friends? Liars and backstabbers. Family? Manipulative and fucked up. I only wanted to post to this thread bc honestly I don't want to talk to a professional. They'll just try to get me committed to an asylum. God, I just wish there was somewhere I could go that isn't the fucking psych ward where I can just mentally escape all of this bullshit. I can't go to rehab bc I'm sober so I don't have anything to ""recover"" from... Does such a place exist and is it low cost or covered by insurance?? Bc I'm about to just get in my car and go missing for a month if that's the case... I hate my fucking life!!!",1678967760.0

My sister in law had recently came to my husband and told him her plan. She cried and told him about her suicide letters and her shame that she has not written one for him. She stated her new involvement in drugs, how tired she is, and more. I read that these are all major warnings signs. At first thought despite being in a similar low with similar thought, how selfish it is to do such a thing. I went on and on about it, but quickly realized I shouldn’t think about it. I certainly when I was there wouldn’t want to hear such words. I would have been more inclined to do such a thing for how much worse It would make me feel. I didn’t talk to her yet at this point so I am happy I didn’t say that to her for I hear it is a major no no. 

She is reading a book called the final decision. As another note and posted about her suicide letter. 

I have looked up things and I have reached out to show I am hear and will listen. I am frustrated and tired myself so I fear I may not meet what she needs because of everything I am dealing with. My husband is calm about it and is showing no signs of anxiety which has concerned me. I never know what he is thinking but I have seen behind the scenes things so I know he cares (i have autism so it is hard to read people) 

I fear I am not doing enough and worry more and more what will occur if she does. I know this part is selfish of me. I am worried about everyone and everything that may or may not happen. I worry is she goes what her parents will do. Her mom isn’t mentally well and I fear another death will occur soon after. I fear for my husband’s mental health for she is his best friend. I fear I may not be strong enough to support everyone involved. I feel responsible for not taking her seriously the first time for I heard those speaking about it would be okay. 

She has no insurance and lives with unsafe things. 

I know if worst case were to happen it isn’t my fault, but I would be lying if I still feel like it is. Please help me find a way to help and what to say. I am a blunt person and that may not what she needs. 

She may commit suicide in the upcoming days. Her dad will come over to talk about it at 6pm. I need to bring ideas to that meeting in form a plan and what might be best. We don’t want to push her off the edge and so I think a hospital is the last resort, but at the same time we would not be able to afford that kind of help. Anything can help.",1678993226.0
712,Need help: I just learned my 13 y/o is talking about suicide,29,11sesaf,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11sesaf/need_help_i_just_learned_my_13_yo_is_talking/,13,"Two days ago, my son’s best friend contacted me. He’s very concerned because my son told him a few times in the last week he was thinking about it… kind of in a joking way but kind of not. 


 Looking for advice/ideas from anyone who has gone through it themselves or with a loved one. I don’t even know how to bring it up with him.

UPDATE: It is around midnight now and I’m so emotionally drained, but I wanted to give an update to thank everyone who shared encouragement/advice, and also just share what happened in case it helps anyone else. 

1. I found out this information out two days ago. I was pretty frantic and terrified to let my son (I’ll call him Jake) out of my sight, so I took yesterday off work and kept Jake home from school to just have a fun day centered around him. I could tell right away he was delighted that all my focus was on him and I agreed to activities I’m not really a fan of but he loves. I had been thinking my son is just getting to that age where he doesn’t want to spend time together, but I don’t think I realized how often I am too distracted by my phone/work/own internal monologue  to notice that Jake is just waiting for me. 

2. Today while he was at school, I had a phone meeting with my sponsor (I’m in recovery) to make sure I’m still able to protect my own sobriety… put your own oxygen mask on before helping others and all that. I then had a phone appointment with my own therapist to make a plan. She emphasized that it’s just too serious to “wait for the right time” to talk about it or dance around the issue. 

3. My therapist agreed that Jake’s friend who came to us with this information is a hero, and telling Jake where we got the information might damage this possibly life-saving relationship they have. Instead, Jake’s dad and I discussed things that have happened in the last month or so that we didn’t really think twice about, but in hindsight now seem like they could very well be red flags. 

4. Jake’s dad got a sitter for our younger child and drove to our house (Jake lives with me during the week) and I made Jake’s favorite food for all of us for dinner. During dinner, we just talked and joked like normal. Then once dishes were cleared, we explained we had something serious to talk about but that Jake was not in trouble and there’s nothing he can say that would upset us. We then both shared a personal story from when we were Jake’s age and had some very dark thoughts that led to destructive actions, and how we wished we had been able to talk to our parents about it but didn’t know how. It’s funny I had totally blocked out some really distressing things I felt/did as a kid until I started thinking about how I would talk to my son about his struggles. We really tried to emphasize that mental health issues are very common and not his fault, but they are also serious and may need immediate attention (we likened it to visiting the doctor or ER if you sprained or broke a leg). 

5. Then we basically presented all our “evidence” that made us concerned (without mentioning his friend at all): he had been spending more time inside w video games than outside with his friends, he might be losing a little weight, this short story he wrote that is pretty dark, and the cuts on his hand. Then we asked point-blank if he had ever had or was currently having thoughts/curiosity/plans/actions about self-harm or suicide.

6. He pretty much denied everything immediately, and we just reiterated that even if he was feeling/doing those things, it would be okay and we love him and could/would help him in any way we could. 

7. Then I pulled out the suicide-prevention action plan one-sheeter my therapist showed me (I don’t have the link but just Google “suicide prevention plan template). It had 6 sections to fill out, including how he might identify himself that he is in crisis (like certain emotions or actions), ways he can distract himself long enough to move his mind away from spiraling (such as watching a funny YouTube video or taking a cold shower or calling a friend). Then there was a space for people/contact info of those he trusts he can tell about a crisis, and contact info for a suicide/self-harm hotline for teens he can call, as well as a text hotline he can contact if he wants to text someone for help. 

8. At the beginning of filling out the sheet, Jake was pretty adamant that he didn’t need it, so we compared it to how we have a sheet on the fridge with poison control numbers, urgent care info, and all our doctors numbers and stuff - not that we would need them and hopefully never would, but it is good to have them just in case. So we asked Jake to help us fill out the form just sort of imagining what he might feel/do in a crisis, just in case it ever happened. That helped relax him and he contributed meaningfully to the sheet, which we ultimately put in a drawer by his bed so he would know exactly where it is at all times. 

9. By the time we were finishing the sheet, Jake admitted that he had been cutting. We thanked him for being brave and honest, and then tried to flesh out why it was happening or how he felt before, during or after. He said he didn’t really know or remember, and we took that opportunity to explain that emotions are often complex and it’s ok not to know how he’s feeling or why, but that’s why therapy can be really helpful. We talked a little more with him about whether he was afraid he was going to hurt himself in the next few hours or days, because we can get immediate help (again comparing it to it being totally normal/responsible to seek immediate help if you break your leg… sometimes you need to do that for mental health too and there’s nothing wrong with it at all).  He said he didn’t think so - and we did believe him. We said to come to us if that changes, but in the meantime we are going to schedule an appointment with a therapist who specializes in teens as soon as possible. 

10. We wrapped up with a turn back to some silly jokes and making plans to do something special this weekend. Jake’s dad had to leave, but Jake and I played Halo snuggled on the couch until bedtime. Jake was pretty reserved during our tough convo, and I’m sure only shared a fraction of what he’s going through, he was so happy and talkative during video games - in a way I hadn’t seen recently. I hope that means at least some of the load he’s bearing lifted when we opened a dialogue.

I was so terrified all day dreading this talk. Like many peeps my age, this was just not a conversation I could have had in my home growing up. But I feel so much better, as does Jake’s dad. Talking about it was soooo much better than ignoring it and hoping it went away.

And to anyone who has a child in junior high, I cannot stress enough how grateful we are that Jake’s friend had the intuition and bravery to tell us what He did. It couldn’t have been easy to reach out directly to a friend’s parents at some risk to himself. I have no idea what percentage of kids would have done the same thing in his shoes, but it probably isn’t high. Jake’s friend quite possibly saved our son’s life. Even if your child isn’t struggling mentally, they may be another child’s only lifeline. Please talk to them about recognizing red flags and safe and/or anonymous ways they can report concerns.",1678927089.0

It's been more than two decades or more that I've been excusing myself like this. I thought I hit the teenage hormones early when I first had thoughts like this. Weirdly enough, initially it wasn't so much that I wanted to die as much as it was that I didn't want to live. I simply did not want to go through all of it, despite the fact that my life was theoretically going pretty well. Some troubles yes, but nothing that should have sent me to this lane. 

I would attempt something to myself, it would fail, I'd tell some more excuses. Work on things. Maybe it's physical. Maybe it is mental. 

What I feared most was failure of my attempts. I did not want to go through the conversations should anyone discover me midway or after the fact. So I'd always try it in ways that I'd be able to get away with it or explain it away should they fail.

Severe vomiting? Oh it was just the restaurant food never mind me. gimme a couple of days. 

I was at least smart enough to be aware that I wasn't normal. Not smart enough to do enough about it though. Or smart enough to help others do enough about it.

I’m 6ft tall, ectomorph body type (long legs and short torso) black hair with a receding hairline so yea ima ugly as hell

Never even touched a girl or spoke a word to or by one since 2012 and that was coworkers who treated me like shit compared to other dudes. I was once described by girls in there as ‘the one they’d stay away from’ 

 (I loved the job other than that tho)

Skip forward a year in to that job managers changed over to women who came in and called the shots, the way they treated me compared to the other dudes made me never the same since they were in short awful towards me. Pinning things on me that were the attractive guys faults but they didn’t want to get them in trouble. (This happened so many times the main boss mark tried to force me out all the time) basically I didn’t meet their approval on the looks department so there.

***one female staff in there actually told me to my face: ‘we had a debate on which guy we’d stay away from in work and we picked you’ whilst giggling***

After that I left and just worked at football stadiums twice a week which was good and the people were mostly nice but yea I at one place got treated differently for my looks, I was always given the jobs nobody else wanted to do. 

Women spectators would literally look up at me then walk past me to ask someone else I’m working with instead where they’re sitting etc (that happened so many times you wouldn’t  believe it)

▪️Even before that bar job I had a pretty job advisor for 6 months and she was horrible to me but nice with her hot ones. They got help and effort from her I never got even the  abusive prison ones got a nice version of her than I did. they got phone calls I only got an email for example. (I never got over that tbh) 


When the pandemic came I was so relieved as I can take a break from people and come back better but I was way worse, I got a very pink nose, dark malar bags/festoons, i gained weight and my hair went more receded and unstylable 

▪️Now I’m
On the sick and I drink a lot of scotch every night and can’t leave the house as my skin problems makes me hideous I can’t do anything I wake up rough every morning I drink myself that silly 

▪️I won’t leave the house unless it’s dark to go to a store and even then I have to keep my hood up and face covered (thankfully the guys in there understand and allow me to wear that in doors) 

▪️Even on Reddit here I once asked about my hair for advice and got comments one said ‘very ugly male’ and another replied to another giving me advice ‘he’s clearly balding and hideous btw’  then he replied ‘I know lol’ 


Every bday and Xmas alone it’s all down to looks. You Personality enthusiasts are bullshit btw 

▪️ even suicide puts me off because I think ‘the coroner would look 
At me dead on the table and see what a freak I was and know why I’m dead then’

The point is that don't be assholes and lie. I would prefer someone to tell they don't want to talk to me because i am shit person or something else. I've never lied in my life. I was always honest to everyone and they don't like it. I told my family about my suicidal behavior and they neglected me.

It's not like a believe that someone would walk into my life and help me because in theory it sounds okay but in reality that never became. 

How long do i have anyway?

I actually felt like I was going to kill or hurt myself, and I was desperate to get help. I really wanted to go to the hospital. I would be open about this with friends because that’s the right thing to do—you tell someone you’re feeling suicidal and not hold it in. I probably didn’t communicate this in the best way because it made people uncomfortable, but I did the best that I could. I never blamed or threatened anyone with it. I simply always just tried to talk about how I was feeling. I’m not used to expressing what I need but I’ve been trying to work on it instead of putting everyone else before me like I did my entire life. I was crying for help. I ended up having a panic attack at a concert 100 miles away from home with 20 of my friends there and told the EMTs how I had been feeling, and they ended up detaining me in the medical room at the venue. Everyone kept checking in and  and I felt more loved than ever that night. I got sent to the emergency room after the concert was over, where I encountered a really unempathetic ER doctor who… got mad at me for feeling suicidal? He basically told me that if I tell him it’s not that bad then as a favor to me he won’t send me to a psych ward so it won’t end up on my personal record, and he can send me home asap. He was so intimidating that I agreed to it, as I just wanted to get out of there as soon as possible. But I ended up being parked the hallway of the psych ward in the ER overnight, and because I wasn’t a checked in patient, I got passed up for food and basic care. The whole thing was extremely traumatic. Some of the nurses were like, “partied too hard? Haha” it felt awful. They told me not to use my phone. My phone ended up dying so I had a lot of anxiety in the morning when I was trying to contact friends to pick me up after they finally released me. 

The next few days were extremely hard. After that night, no one really talked to me about what happened or checked in. Was it bad for me to be upset that no one did? I tried to talk about how I felt, only to have people be upset with me that I didn't appreciate them.

Fast forward to the present. My boyfriend told me that shortly after that, one of my friends had a conversation with him where they basically said that they think I’m a narcissist because of it and that I bring people down, and that he agrees. This has broken me. I don’t know what to do. It makes me feel like I can’t reach out for help when I’m feeling suicidal. It makes me feel like I should actually do it so that they know it’s real and not just something I’m saying to gain sympathy or attention. This is the most horrible feeling. I don’t know if I should even stay with my boyfriend. I feel so put down and blamed all the time for how things were when all I was trying to do was survive and get help. I think there is merit to how everyone feels, but it is a big thing to call someone a narcissist. It’s worse than calling someone selfish for being suicidal, and that’s not someone thing you should ever say. I feel like my pain was never believed or taken seriously. Maybe I am just a horrible person and I'm in denial of it and I really am as manipulative and terrible as they say I am? I don't know. All I know now is that I feel more alone than ever, I don't have a support system, and I still think about dying.",1678981275.0

I hate every single thing around me right now. I am angry. I am angry that I don't get to feel happy, I don't get to live this fucking life however I want to. 

People lied, cheated, abused, neglected me. I have felt furious, depressed, lonely, crazy. I have talked to myself for hours. I expected everything to drive me mad.

I had the things I fundamentally deserve as a human being, taken from me. I do not feel anyone's love. I do not think anybody is on my side. People take from me; take, take and take. I am drained. I loathe it all. Despise it.

I did nothing to deserve this. Absolutely unacceptable. I will not stand by this. I will not be stripped of my fucking life and be abused by a bunch of worthless assholes. 

If nobody loves me, that's fine. Nobody supports me? Very well. There are people who are better off and will be better off forever? Fingers up to anyone above me.

It will not end this way. I will see better days. I swear on my blood that I will not give it up and accept defeat. I do not need anyone. I do not want anyone's love. People can stick their pathetic support up their asses.

I am at this point in my life and I came here all by myself. I did everything myself, with my own two hands. I will do it again. And again. People are fucking useless. The only thing they are good at is ruining everything. Selfish wastes of flesh.

I will not give up. I refuse to give up. This will not be the end. I will live and go forward.

I did some doordash for money, talked to my husband about our finances, and I felt like I could maybe live my life like this. For once I didn't have engineering to think about. Tuesday I woke with a migraine and have been getting more and more obsessed with death since.
I was suicidal before I quit, thats why I quit. I broke down one morning and quit after staying out for a 3rd day. My job was ridiculously high stress and 100% a STEM boys club/ right wing nightmare. I knew quitting alone wouldn't help, so I also went on different meds.
Now I don't want to do anything. I just want to throw myself onto the road in front of my house.
I feel so useless. I feel like I'm letting my husband down. I feel like everyone thinks I'm a failure. I want to go out and make money but I start panicking at the thought of leaving home. I don't even know what I would be working for. I don't want to do anything. There is nothing I feel like I can happily work towards. I just want to die.
Every time I try to think about something to do around the house to have fun my mind immediately races to ""go hang yourself in the closet"" or ""choking would feel nice."" It's not even like my mind is treating it like death. It's like my mind keeps presenting it like a fun activity and I don't know what to do.

I was severely depressed and wasn't doing anything other than playing video games for 2 years. I isolated myself from the real world.

2018 I started feeling better cause my gaming friends just makes me happy. I started to pick myself up and learned new skills. I learned coding, made a website, learned another language, taught our language to foreign, learners, did freelance on translating, then landed a stable LIDAR data job.

But I was never FULLY better. I still was depressed but I just learned how to live with it. I also have a mentally abusive mom (too long to say the details). She's nice half the time and extremely mean half the time too. It's like having an abusive boyfriend who's so full of pretty promises, except I can't cut ties with her so it's more mental.

April last year, I started to have severe asthma flare ups. It was so bad, it never went away for months. I quit my job cause I don't have the energy and to recover faster. I got a little better but there were still flare ups several times a week. I was so drained physically, mentally and financially.

October, I felt the pressure to find a new job. I did transcription but I only got paid about 3usd for 2-4 hour job. I then quit cause it wasn't worth it.

January, I was severely depressed again like I was years ago but I did seek therapy this time. I went to the dentist cause my wisdom tooth was hurting. Had it removed by February after several back and forths cause surgeon wouldn't pull it out without my Pulmonologist's green light.

NOW I AM SO LOST. I still have many teeth that need to be filled. I still have my asthma sometimes and meds are expensive. I still need to do psychotherapy but I CAN'T AFFORD A SINGLE THING NOW. I leech off my parents for food and shelter, I can't find a decent job online, I can't find a job in the real world cause I don't have the skill set and I'm just too thin now no one would accept me. I'm down to 34kg like holy sht. Business is my only option now. I thought of a business that's not too expensive to start. I only need about 1500usd for starter but even that I can't afford.

Which song I want to listen to one last time. 

Every time I think “this is it. This is what I want to listen to as everything fades away” I find another song or think of something else I’ve already heard. Sometimes I’m in a “I’m going out because it’s MY choice” type of mood, and that dictates a ferrule of song. Other times I’m in a “I feel so empty. So disconnected. Like when you say a word so many times it loses all meaning” type of mood and that dictates a very different type of song. Sometimes it’s neither of those. Sometimes a song I love comes on and I think how disappointing it would be to never hear it again and maybe I’d listen to that instead.

779,Suicide by senselessness,3,11sljve,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11sljve/suicide_by_senselessness/,0,"My sisters 20th birthday. Only 4 of us, a very brief celebration, silence in the air and bad theatre acting. Thank god they probably think better. I wanted lead.

I’m pretty sure I’m not depressed. I used to be mildly, but that is gone. I’m healthy, my toe was a little bit fucked up because of the nail biting into the side but that’s fixed now. I’m getting more fit and thinner, I enjoy humour and reading novels. Academically I’m not most successful, my grades only permitted a state university, but it’s far from the worst. Speaking of which I just got rejected from a slightly more prestigious state university. I like eating. Lately I’ve been cutting so trying to keep a deficit. It’s not hard because I had experience with being fat and a couple years back I lost 20 kilograms through OMAD, which made me adept at controlling craving but also it could be better anyway. To be frank I think it’s the bleakness of perspectives that gives me the dark thoughts, although, I would not call them dark. When I think of suicide, I think of a quick way out of this, I jokingly in my mind call it a quick lead injection at 370 m/s to the soft grey matter area, excuse the edginess. But, again it’s not the sadness of life that gives me these urges, but rather the lack of any possible future in a way I want. 

I’m an immigrant. Unlike in previous immigrations my parents did not bother with the diaspora either out of the lack of initiative that this new country requires unlike the past ones in which the company would organise diaspora social life itself, a lack of initiative that makes me still be dumbfounded at how of all people my parents found themselves in immigration. This new lack of social life for a good number of years now demonstrated to be bearable, the diaspora of my heritage in here from my experience is borderline crazy anyway and I had no desire to participate. The lack of sociality was probably a less so issue for my parents most likely as they are old, established and don’t really care anymore, my sister and I though found it harder, although she’s older than me so even together we have a lack of connection. There’s an observation I had a few years back about the household that all people under this roof have probably been depressed at some point, it gave me a paralysing despair. It’s sad but what is to be done? One of those unsolvable miseries of life that  leave me standing there refusing to breakdown about it or run around trying to fix it like a mad man. I still had a social life don’t get me wrong, I had various friends, mostly scum, and we went into creeks and participated in the teenage delinquencies of petty theft, buying weed and smoking in creeks and getting drunken scars. Even some romance to a very mild degree. But those were small and shallow little marks that only highlighted my low position. You see in the country of past immigration, I was not at all discriminated, even a little bit valued, i as a child got acting gigs for ads, because I was a white kid in an Asian Americanised country, connections and reasons you puzzle together. Here? I was looked at as no different, everybody is an immigrant here and my looks of unique where not seen as a virtue rather than the opposite. But there was no excessive bullying or discrimination, mainly the coldness was expressed in the lack of acceptance than active persecution. Sometimes it probably hurts more to be ignored than hated. Another language, seclusion and lack of a frame of reference probably did the bulk of the lifting, social seclusion it was. Internet, weight gain, you know the rest. But as mentioned it got better, a social life, which is now gone mostly except for a few friends, gone for personal reasons really, but it did exist and I don’t think my struggles were related to a lack of some life experience, being seen as a cliche internet alienated loser would be the worst annoyance. But I was never put at the top of the local social hierarchy and neither was my sister. This is just autobiography by now so I’ll move on.

I live a middle class life here, I lived one before but now it’s even nicer, material wants could be fulfilled like a desire for new gadgets and getting them only proved how pointless they are at bringing happiness and satisfaction and only put further disappointment in material goods. It’s the suburban lack of movement and initiative that dooms me, everybody sits around, my parents, my acquaintances, everybody is content at misery and it drove me crazy, nobody wants to change the balance out of courtesy and self shame, so they brew in their houses of misery, only the egomaniacs here are socially and hierarchically active. I was on fringes of this life and I knew it. I need to do something? I do it, but only because I have to, otherwise I won’t. I won’t move out of shame or ego or some insecurity, no. Egomania or self hatred is motivation that I won’t accept, I’d rather sit and do nothing then let those move me. So I lie and sunbathe during the pointlessly long break hours and read novels on mostly empty classes which leave us to do either busy work or no work at all. What to do? Integrate? But I gave up on integration, if you integrate you admit your lower status assigned here, fuck no, I’d rather leave you dumbfounded and in fear or inability to explain of my character, than in acceptance and in admittance of my inferiority. Nah, I’d rather be the unexplained little stain on your canvas of reality. Go back? there’s almost no way of going back, my borderline paranoid parents would not permit it, but you say, assert independence, get a job and escape to a society that you would enjoy? But why? That’s society would not see what I have seen, perhaps an even deeper alienation might follow, or I won’t find that desire of a social rebellion that I want. 

I feel dissatisfaction. I eat hot sauce and drink black coffee and with every day they taste more mellow and senses are less and less interesting, sometimes I lose a desire for masturbating too, I still do it, it just doesn’t feel like the best of lust. Perhaps it’s my lack of sleep lately, or lack of interesting feelings, but the numbness of this existence, the good, the bad.. but man does it all feel less and less interesting. Perhaps it’s better to say suicide not by boredom, but by senselessness. Yes, I’ll change the title. This life.. It’s not because I lose at it, it’s because I don’t want to play. I don’t want these men as friends, these women as lovers, these old fucks as mentors and these old cunts as employers. I simply don’t want to participate in your society and I do out of courtesy to my perhaps delusional mother, I don’t want her to hurt. Post modern reality, collapsing system, general lowering of everybody’s expectations for the future and then this whole other personal perspective I have? No it’s just too much. I just kick back and relax, and although I’d like to do it in an understanding company with similar world view, across the pond, to get there you have to be an active little shit and lick a lot of ass and would that not be a betrayal of my whole principle of not giving up my dignity for a low price in the first place? Simply no answer. I don’t fear death, I fear missing life and more than that I fear having to chase it. Maybe a lead injection at 370 m/s in the grey matter is my way out, just gotta wait for my mother to die.",1678945771.0

A few years after my dad died a family friend and my dad's friend did suicide with overdose a few years after his death anniversary. It must have been correlated because they were really close. My friends joke about suicide alot and it triggers me. I go online and watch videos like the infamous Ronnie mcnut video. Recently I've been kind of depressed and I've been watching them more. I like to make fun of the people doing and say they are stupid. I've been thinking about how I would do it hypotheticaly. I am not suicidal but I've been thinking about the topic more. My biggest fear is ending up like 3 people in my family and commiting suicide but I don't really understand. I've had dreams about it but idk.

I’m young, but I have a debilitating chronic illness that is now causing symptoms it’s not supposed to. I have to literally crawl out of bed and dress myself laying down. I have to sit or lay when I take showers. When I go to school, I have to cling to the wall and I can’t walk for longer than a minute and no more than maybe 300ft at a time. 

Those symptoms have been progressively getting worse lately and no one believes the pain I’m in. I hurt so bad all I can do is sleep. I’m 35+ assignments behind, although I try very hard to be and was an A student. (My grades are currently: A, A-, C+, A, A)

School was the only thing making me happy. Specifically my History class. My teacher is amazing. We bond over a band we both like. He’s the only one who believes I can graduate. He’s the only reason I’m still alive right now.

I haven’t been taking my meds because they make the pain worse, and give me severe headaches. Needless to say, I have a stockpile. I also have some of those precision face blades women use for facial hair, which don’t do much but I’m sure with enough persistence they would. I also have thought about hanging or otherwise asphyxiating myself; that’s how I almost died last time. I would like a gun but I have no access to one.

I want to live. I want to live so bad but I don’t know what to do with myself or my life. I don’t seem to be particularly good at anything. I don’t have any real friends despite being well-liked by my peers. I’m in so, so much pain constantly. I’ve let everyone in my life down, including myself.

I don’t want to make it to my next birthday. That would be the 2 year anniversary of my suicide attempt anyways. (I died but they brought me back and I somehow didn’t fuck up too majorly)

I can’t do this anymore.

I want someone to hold me, or stay with me on a call or something and be there for me and talk, but I don’t know anyone anymore. I just want someone to be there. I’ve been so caught up in my numerous self-destructive habits and school that I haven’t met or connected with anyone, and now I’m so goddamm alone…

My parents made my childhood great. They’d threaten to kill me, threaten to kill themselves, fake their deaths, encourage me to commit suicide. They would hit me, touch and caress me because they knew I hated it, scream and insult me 24/7, throw things at me, threaten me with weapons, kick me out, and told me everyday that if they die or kill themselves it’s my fault. They’d starve me, forcefeed me for hours on end to torture me, try to make me eat rotten food out of the trash, threaten to destroy my belongings, threaten to start abusing me (?), admit that they enjoy seeing me in pain, admit to neglecting and traumatizing me on purpose, tell me that the only reason for me to live is to make them money, threaten me saying that I’ll be kidnapped, trafficked, and killed if I ever leave them. They tell me all the time that people are out to kill me because they want my blood. They’d try to rip my clothes off or force me to strip so they could pick apart how disgusting my body is. They made fun of me for grieving my boyfriend’s death and blamed me for his suicide. Sometimes they’d come into my room in the middle of the night multiple times to remind me of how much they hate me and I’d wake up to them in the middle of yelling at me. They lecture me saying that I should avoid anyone who’s nice to me because you’d have to be dangerously stupid to believe that someone as pathetic as me deserves anything good and that people who abuse me are the ones who are treating me in the way I deserve. They always tell me that I should be thanking them for being amazing parents because they’ve never raped or killed me before. List goes on. They still to this day say I’m the abusive one. 

So many times they’ve told me that no matter what happens to me, no matter what I’m going through or how close to death I am, it’ll never be enough for them to care and they will do everything possible to make sure I never get help. My mom has said to me that she wouldn’t intervene when my dad was abusing me because she enjoyed watching it but she never hesitated to defend my brother because she loves him.

Countless teachers, counselors, nurses, doctors, etc. have begged my parents to make a safety plan with me to prevent me from killing myself and they always refused. Even when they were told that I will die if they don’t, they’d just reply with “Yeah we know.”

My parents say that to get my phone back, I need to cure 100% of my mental illnesses and if I ever ask for help, they’ll disown me.

They refused to give me medication for months while I was having debilitating psychosis.

Every time I go to the hospital, my parents see this as a chance to find compromising info on me so they can share it with mental health professionals to sabotage my treatment. They get so excited about it too.

The most infuriating part of it all is that every adult I’ve told this to, have sided with my parents and pretty much insinuated that everything is my fault. When my parents found this out, they rubbed it in my face, “See? I told you no one cares about you,” and “You can’t be mad when all of your nurses and doctors believe us.”

For the past week I've been crying for hours every day, mostly at school and no one cares. I come to school everyday with new, large gashes that expose the fat in my arms and none of my teachers care or ask me if I'm okay. Maybe if I killed myself someone will finally notice me.",1678924075.0

I haven’t given up yet but in a logical sense I really feel suicidal sometimes, it doesn’t even feel like it’s the depression anymore so much as the quality of life I am living. I just don’t know. 

This has never gotten better in 10 years and I don’t see myself being able to meet any goals. It sucks. Not a terminal illness, it doesn’t even show up on any test so I am essentially “healthy” and I look young and healthy.

After Covid our company laid us off so we switched companies. Although sometimes he paid those interests late I used to cover for him by paying them in advance before my friend gave it to me.

Not that long ago i had about 3 people pass in the span of 2 years and it hurt a lot. One of those people were one of my parents ofc so i just felt horrible. After that i had 0 motivation to do anything and i was failing in school and even got held back. I at the moment have no friends and the only person i talk to right now is the parent i live with. 

I have a personality that is very annoying, im quite loud, and im basically clingy so its hard to find someone to deal with that which makes me feel worse and i really want a new personality. I also have really terrible social anxiety to the point in 3rd grade.. quite embarrassing but i was really scared to talk to the teacher to ask to use the bathroom so i kinda peed myself. So i cant talk to a hotline for help because i wouldn’t be able to get any words out. 


I cant really make friends or talk to someone for help because of my social anxiety and i feel hopeless because my anxiety stops me from doing stuff i want. Ive got in trouble loads of times because of it and I even have social anxiety through calls and texts. I always get in trouble because of it and they always say its very easy and its not hard to talk to people and i get called dramatic. My routine is i get up to do homework then i eat and then i just watch youtube or play games till i go to sleep which is usually around 5 or 6am. I really want to learn Japanese to go to Japan and thats whats keeping me here tbh but because of my social anxiety it would be hard to find a teacher or someone to teach me.(Been self learning for like 6 months)


I cannot overdose on something like Benadryl because I am allergic. I just don’t know what to do anymore and I always thought that drowning would be a peaceful way to go but i heard that it feels good at first then starts burning. Also I would prefer if no one says “but your young” or “It gets better” or “kids these days…” I know okay but at this very moment i want help.. I just want to be happy

I've been clinically depressed for almost 6 years now but I've had severe anxiety problems since I was 13 yo. I live in a 3rd world country where therapy is not really an option for me. I tried meds but I was never been able to take them for more than a few weeks at a time. 

Suicidal thoughts began to seriously show up about 3 years ago. I recently graduated from med school and I'm about to begin residency which means I will probably deal with more stress than I've ever dealt before. I'm completely unmotivated about my future and I have very limited social life. I've been dealing with feelings of extreme loneliness for a decade even though I have friends and somewhat normal social abilities.

I hate everything about my life and I have deep feelings of self‐hate that stem from past childhood traumas. I also have a severe porn addiction that is wasting a huge part of my time. I struggle with routine and daily tasks and can't get myself to concentrate on anything. 

A major reason for my deep rooted self-hate is the fact that abused my little sister when I was a teen. I knew that what I was doing was wrong but I did it anyway. She ended up telling my parents and they confronted me but were shockingly understanding and they just agreed on moving on and to never talk about it again. I just recently had the guts to apologize to my sister who told she had moved on but that I should have apologized earlier which would have brought her more peace of mind. I can't and I won't forgive myself for the trauma I brought upon the whole family not just my poor sister. I know that both of us were supposed to get counseling but it's simply not available in my country. 

I want to be gone and just be a fading memory in people's minds but I know my mom will be devastated. My family would seriously not be able to manage in a religious society where suicide is already rare and and a taboo subject. They would get blamed for my death and not get the proper mental and social support and I can't put them through this. 
I keep fantasizing about scenarios where I just die painlessly in an accident or just not waking up in the morning or having incurable cancer. 

I don't know what to do. I just want it all to end but I can't do anything about it. I also haven't figured out the method I want to use and I can't find the suicide advice websites on Google.  I prefer a painless death but it's not really that easy as it seems. I might try pills and alcohol but I heard I could just end up with nothing more than a sore stomach or a fucked up liver or brain.

My 23 year old brother dies from the fucking pig flu. He left a 4 month old baby.   


At 22 my parner that i was married to, decides my brothers death and the drama that followed is too much to handle and leaves. My only coping mechanism was art.   


Develop horrible axiety, survivor guilt, and sadness.   


My brothers wife, started doing drugs and tried burning down the house with all of her children in the house.   


My Dad decides on fighting with everything he has for the custody of my nephew. 5 days before my dad has the hearing for the final adoption, my 55 year old dad and best friend dies of a heart attack. My dad changed some documents for the ease of the adoption so when he passes i found out he married the evil bitch, and she turns against me imediately after my dad dies and completely isolated me during the furneral as well as still has not allowed me to get some of his things. All i own of my dad is a baseball hat that i love with all my heart.   


To escape the stress of what i was going through, my mother suggests we go to vegas for the weekend of my dads birthday/my brothers death aniversary. October, 1st 2017.   
The worst shooting in US history, i was less than a mile from the shooting. The next morning of the shooting i go to my hotel just to to open my blinds and in the center of my view, the Mandalay hotel and a broken window.   


Get back home, develop ptsd, and start getting panic attacks out of nothing, 3 years pass, and when covid hits, we loose our wedding photography gigs. So to figure out another revenue for my beautiful son and wife, i got in touch with my childhood friend from mexico. He is a very successful lawyer, and has a doctorate in philosphy. We start a business selling covid related solutions, its going really well so we sell all our shit from the USA, and decided on moving to mexico to persue a new future. A better future. Within 6 months from being there, It becomes aparent that my childhood friend that i loved like a brother was hiding something. Well, something he was. He had schizophrenia, was psychotic, and had 8 personalities. As well as he was just a really good ponzi scheme artist.   


Overnight, we ran away, grabbed what we could fit in a van, and drove back to the US.

846,Lost In Life,1,11sla53,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11sla53/lost_in_life/,1,"I feel like I'm lost in life. First, I started to feel like I don't fit in people around me. I started to distance myself from my ex friend group because I didn't like them bringing out a little inconvenience we had with a friend like a joke, irritated me so much. Then, there is school. I got a really low grade from maths and physics exams, barely passing. I didn't know few topics because I was struggling, so I had so many absent count, there is 2 and a half day. If I pass the limit, I can't graduate and stay in school for one more year. Getting low grades made me kill myself. I try to do everything perfect because I know I have a potential to do so. I have assignments waiting to be completed. At the start of 11th grade (junior year), we had a conversation with my mother. I told her I want to pursue my higher education abroad and she told me you also need to study national programme curriculum. Therefore, I tried to keep up with national and IB (International Baccalaureate) curriculum. I also  started to go cramschool aka prepschool after school. It was so overwhelming and tiring because I was arriving home at around 8:30 pm. I had zero motivation and energy to study - shout out to friends who can study both, I really admire them-. Maybe, it couldn't be a problem If I had good relations with my family and had a great friend group or ,at least, an opportunity to socialize. I felt so isolated. While I was barely struggling with life, it was hard to maintain a great academic performance. I was aiming to apply instiutions with high reputation. With my current grades, it is nearly impossible now. Yet, I couldn't submit my EE and TOK components. I had discussions with my teachers, one of them told me that she has never seen or had a student like me and it stuck with me since then. I really feel shame towards them because I couldn't complete my tasks/assignments on time. I also drop out of ballet choreography because I couldn't find shoes that fit my feet and I also felt isolated there because some of my friend there were also learning advance 1 and they were discussing moves. I also wanted to attend advance class, but my teacher rejected my request. Although I may have weaknesses in techniques according to her, I can't improve it unless I practice. I had a loss in means of strength and stamina. I also don't think I can live long (probably I won't see 2025 or maybe 2026 if I'm lucky). Lately, my only motivation was to help people and animals who were also struggling or need help. I don't have any interest in my wellbeing anymore. I feel so helpless for so long. When I enter room for taking any exam, thoughts of failure or being not good enough never leave me alone and I start to compare myself to others or asking myself ""what if"" questions (ex. What If I could solve any problem like \*name\*?). I don't have any sense of purpose or I don't serve for any common purpose now.There are more things I can write here, but I don't find any point in ordering them here.

i was living alone across the country away from my family, working during in lockdown so luckily i was still able to make money but because my parents didn’t let me get vaccinated at the time, once the country started to open up again i still wasn’t allowed to see my friends or even socialise in the real world. 
i was glued to my pc playing games all night and slept all through the day getting no sunlight, having no motivation at all everything at the time was getting too much for me and i’ve never seen myself living past 18 (i’m 19 now) 
i’ve been through a lot in my life, i’ve been homeless, abused, cheated on, been told i should’ve been aborted and more 
i feel so worthless and useless 
i don’t feel as if i have a proper impact on anyone’s lives i’m there to have fun with them whilst hiding how i truly feel on a day to day basis 
during the lockdown i was staying in a 43 floor apartment, i used to go up to the rooftop most days convincing myself how easy it would be to do it but truth is i don’t want to go out of this world like that 
i want to die peacefully in my sleep i don’t want anyone around me to blame me for being selfish by taking my own life 
i want to just let death take me like in a car crash 
i don’t want to survive it or attempt and fail because i’ll end up in hospital and i can’t afford treatment and in my country if you try to end your life but survive you get locked up in prison as it’s illegal 
my suicidal thoughts are back and i finally opened up to two of my close friends last week about my mind state during 2021 and they had no idea but i didn’t tell them because i wanted them to feel bad i told them because i wanted them to know me better 
one of these close friends has had attempts before and had one during our friendship and i felt like shit i felt like i didn’t do enough for her or put as much effort as i should’ve and i don’t want anyone to feel like that about me 
all of these thoughts started again around last month and 3 days ago the guy i was seeing ended things because he’s not in a good mental state either but he’s the first person i’ve loved in so long and tried to treat him my very best given my mental health issues 
i lost myself over him nearly the end of the relationship because i already felt him pulling away and i didn’t want it to end 
we ended things mainly because he’s going to study abroad and i can’t afford to do long distance with him 
i went out last night to drink away my sorrows and i saw him there and it sucked i couldn’t even drink because i haven’t eaten in days and everything i out in my body just comes back up 
my friend left me last night and my ex sent me home in a car after i saw him talking to this girl he said it wasn’t safe for me to be out alone
i felt so worthless and disposable 
i also just got my period so i know all my emotions are intensified but i feel so so numb and couldn’t care if i died i just don’t want to take my own life and survive

Deceased, gone, ceasing to exist. If you are sitting here wondering “oh my god how could this happen he never showed any signs.” You either don’t fucking know me at all, or you have your head so far up your fucking ass that you don’t even know what year it is. If you’re wondering why, I honestly couldn’t give you an exact answer. I could sit here and give you an entire speech about every minor detail in my life that got me to this point, but that would be a waste of mine and your time, and it doesn’t really matter, does it? In the grand scheme of things, I don’t matter. Nothing does. 
	Throughout my life, I have been beaten down, crushed, stepped on, whatever you want to call it. I have been broken, but I have also done the breaking. I have hurt so many people. There's pretty much an 85% chance that you (the person that’s reading this) are happy I’m gone. At first, I cared, more than I should’ve. I actually fucking cared about who thought what about me. Now, it couldn’t mean any less to me. I could not give any less fucks if you dislike me. 
	Okay...let’s just get right into it. Confession time. I am an addict. This may not come as a surprise to you, but I am addicted to opiates and other drugs such as nicotine, weed (a debatable subject, but I’m still dependent on it), and narcotics. I have tried to quit, well...maybe. I take breaks from using, but I never entirely stop. It doesn’t matter how or why I started, and maybe they’re why I’m so damn depressed. Not that I actually care, you have your way of dealing with the bullshit, I have mine. We are all going to die anyways, so I may just have a damn good time. The real reason why I do the drugs though, I don’t know. I hate myself, I guess. Nothing about me has ever been and will never be correct. I honestly hope you all fucking hate me and if you don’t, well I hope you do now. If you hate me I won’t be an awful person for killing myself, I’ll just be a statistic and a dumbass.  
	I’m not going to sit here and tell you every bad thing that I’ve done and apologize for it as if I feel bad, because I don’t. I don’t feel bad at all. You all have fucked me over to the point that I don’t care who I hurt anymore. Literally fuck all of you. You’re all just a bunch of no good, mother fucking, bitches, who couldn’t care less about anyone else but yourselves.

Life just keeps throwing bad shit at me. I can never seem to do things ""right,"" and when I try, Life says, ""Ha! You thought. Here's some more bullshit, loser.""  


Two days ago, my toxic father banged on my door while I was only half-awake. As it so happened, when I took my mother's wash rags out of the washing machine and put them in the utility tub next to it to do my own round of laundry, the rags somehow clogged the tub and began waterlogging the *completely bare floor*, so he told me to mop it up. Apparently, this was something worth borderline traumatizing me by banging on my door like the fuckin' FBI. I sank to the floor in tears after he'd left. I can't take the drama with him anymore. (See previous post for why I can't just up and leave.)  


Today, I had my Anatomy & Physiology II lab practical, and I completely bombed it, as expected. I don't have the resources that I had in AP I (study groups, or even people taking the same class during the time when I'm available), and I don't study well at home due to the toxic parents and distractions. I only take this class, lecture is Tuesdays and Thursdays at 2, and lab is Wednesdays at 2, but because I don't have a car, the toxic parents drive me to campus, where I can only access the study lab this semester on Tuesdays and Wednesdays at 5, and barely anyone who takes AP II is there at those times, so I end up studying alone. It's a lot less helpful, when you have to look up all of the information yourself, and, since it's an Honors class, because my professor somehow misplaced ENORMOUS faith in me during AP I, there's more and harder work than expected in the regular class. As a further kick to the face, a former friend from AP I, who already does cardiac bypass at a children's hospital, doesn't even need these classes, yet she's studying at a relatively average pace and saying how \~hArD\~ this is and still got 103/100 on her first exam while I'm studying my ass off and getting, well, not the same score.  


The company website for my online textbook *and* portal from my school's website to the company website won't even allow me to access… my online textbook. So now, I'm fighting for a refund because it's now past the 14-day refund window.  


Finally, while typing this, I just found out that I was rejected from my allied health program, so even if I finish AP II with a passing grade, I'm now on a wait list that NO student wants to drop out of, so I have to wait a fuckin' year to be reconsidered, meaning *another* year with my toxic parents—because, as a disability student, I can't work and study at the same time, because my retarded ass can't handle it.  


So what does all of this have to do with the aforementioned Princess Audria Rose? If you've never seen *Descendants 3*, Princess Audrey is a formerly supporting character whose destiny is altered when Mal, the protagonist, inadvertently wins the heart of Audrey's boyfriend and assumed future husband, Prince Ben. After being snubbed too many times, Audrey casts aside all of her benevolent qualities, breaks into the Auradon museum, and steals the queen's crown and the magical scepter of Maleficent, transforming herself into ""the Queen of Mean.""  


I don't believe that enough people in the world realize it, but this is exactly how people can only be pushed so far before they snap. Being plagued by misfortune, not receiving support when needed, watching others succeed while you fail, witnessing the betrayal(s) of (a) loved one(s), enduring platonic and/or romantic loneliness for too long… These things alter people's perceptions of humanity, leading to cynicism, jealousy, indignation, depression, and seclusion. If suicide ""is never the answer,"" eventually, people who've lost hope turn to selfish manipulation and cruelty in order to survive—to advocate for themselves when no one else will. They become Kings and Queens of Mean.

As much as they would say it’s not true, I could always tell. My mother used to tell stories about how badly she wanted to abort me. She never wanted to have me. I remember her telling her friends and laughing about it. Since that point my whole existence has felt like an inconvenience. I would always try justify my worth threw over achieving. Getting good grades, getting into good organisations and school so I didn’t feel like I was causing too much harm on my parents.  I did what I had to do to keep the peace. But it was never enough. 


It wasn’t until the pandemic started when I started to notice that these ppl really hated me. I never really spent time with my family. I was always with friends because I was either studying or at work. I had many jobs because my parents would only give my siblings an allowance. Not me. I never really spent much time at home with them. Then I got covid myself. My symptoms weren’t normal. I lost my hair, lost my ability to walk and struggled with fatigue. My family told me I was lying. Covid isn’t real and that I am doing this for attention. I ended up getting so fatigued I went to see a doctor. He diagnosed me with long covid.  My family told me I was lying again and I couldn’t deal with it so I left. I went back to live in my apartment and just tried my best to finish school. 

One day my mom showed up unannounced and she was upset that I had left. She told me that I am ungrateful and that she wished she had killed me when I was a child. That one hurt. She said more things to me but I was just stuck at the part where she said she wished she had killed me. 

I stopped talking to them.  Finished school and moved in with my friends. My friends made me food and helped me get energy to be myself again. My family found where my friends lived and called the police to say that they had kidnapped me. They threatened to sue my friends. And they have been spreading rumours that I have an abusive boyfriend. I don’t have a boyfriend. 

They took all my savings. I worked for the family business at the time and they took my retirement and never paid my salary or leave days. I worked so hard while I was there because I love to work. I started a whole new department. Gave the company a fresh new voice and never missed a day of work apart from when I was sick or studying. 

Everytime I ask them to give it back to me they laugh. They have been so cruel ti me for no reason. And completely isolated me from my other family members. There is only so much my friends can do for me. They don’t have enough money to support me so I feel like a burden. Everytime i ask for help no one can help me. They don’t know how. I am so happy that my friends have helped me  where they can but I fear that my time here is limited. I am so happy about the life I have lived and I am proud of the person I was despite all the shit that I went through. But I don’t want to die of starvation or cold. I keep contemplating if I should just do it myself. End it all while I still have energy. Either way i don’t think I’ll make it to the end of the year. 

My family sends random men to bang on the door to traumatise me. They tell my name. Take photos of me walking on the street. They take photos of my friends and send cryptic messages telling me to wish my friends happy birthday. I struggle to keep jobs because I am scared they will show up and ruin my relationship with my co workers. They call my new landlord and threatened him.  They stalk my banking account to make sure I don’t have money. It’s too much for me and no one knows how to help me. I am broke. Sick and extremely mentally ill. I quite my job on a random day cause I couldn’t do it. I was performing well but I just needed a sense of control in my life. So I left. I regret it so much but it was purely out of fear. Purely because of the abuse I am experiencing and I can’t do it anymore. I wish to leave a note saying that I killed myself because of my family. But that’s not fair on me and the ppl in mg life who actually care for me. 

It’s just too much and no one can help me. No one knows how to. It’s just an endless cycle of abuse that I don’t want to endure anymore. I’m so sick of it. I need such so much help. And no one can help me. They don’t know how to. It’s so annoying when someone reaches out like “if you need anything let me know” then when the times comes, they can’t. It makes me feel like I am alone. 

The only thing stopping me from killing myself is the fact that I don’t have pills or a knife sharp enough. Im too scared to leave the house to jump off a building tall enough to kill me.

Doctors have not been able to figure out what’s wrong with me thus far. None of the doctors seem to believe me or even care. It has completely taken over my life. I have debilitating, near constant fatigue that makes everything seem impossible. 

I have no support from anyone. My parents don’t believe me and tell me it’s all in my head. Same with my friends. I am expected to function like a normal human being while I feel like I’m physically falling apart. I’m also living on my own and have no financial support. 

This has become too much. I feel like death. I want to die. If my illness does get worse to where I can’t force myself to work, then I’m absolutely fucked. I will not receive help from anyone. 

I’m loosing hope. I’m growing very tired. I’m trying my absolute best to keep trudging through life until I find an answer. But the toll that this takes on me is massive. Sometimes I feel like I literally cannot go on. 

I’ve been having thoughts of doing it. Lately they have been getting stronger. No one would give I shit if I actually did. I’m all alone",1678922261.0

I understand why anyone chooses to die or want to die because we are too busy having to work so hard to get by. The monotonous routine is the challenge here. You either can bare it and suck it up or you starve like in nature. That’s what this life is, survival of the fittest. 

I’m not dead because I am happy outside of work but I’m probably not going to keep my job from how slow I am.

I am a senior in high school in Canada and I have not felt alive since 2019 I used to be so outgoing and participate in events  and could start conversations with people on my own  and had so many friends were people knew as a nice and kind person that people can talk to  and during grade 8 in 2019 there was this girl that I met that i liked she was so special to me she was the first person I ever liked we met one recess where she was by herself and i asked what was wrong she shared her feelings the details were not important but i felt so great when she shared it to me we started talking and texting and facetiming like every day It was so fun we got to know so much about each other and i fell in Love with her even though we were just friends I told her I liked her she said she liked me but didn't want to date then I said I loved her she probably thought I was an idiot because how could you love someone if they don't even like you back well i did then I found out she liked my friend and this completely crushed me they didnt date but still this completely destroyed broke me she noticed she kept saying sorry and asking for forginvess and wanting to still be friends I accepted but we just argued all the time we were still close but it wasnt the same people during this time called me depressed cause i was sad that this girl didnt like me which was true I was sad even she noticed I even asked her to prom even after everything she said yes but a week before our grad she said no saying she didnt think it was right I should of known she didnt like me i should have enever asked garde 8 ended she left schools we still texted upto grade 11 then we stopped cause she I felt she was forgetting me and she would takes days to respond and even forgot my birthday multiple times and this made me das because at one point she knew me beter then myself it took me from grade 8 to grade 10 to finally get over her I cried myself multiple times to sleep thinking about her well atealst the sad music felt so good to listen to now. Sorry for getting off track , summer of grade 8 was great though I spent it with my friends and we even recorded youtube videos. They never got that many views but making them was an amazing experience that I will always remember. Grade 9 starts and I was scared which was normal but i was so introverted and nervous that I didn't talk to anyone I just assumed people would talk to me this never happened and on top of this I have really low confidence and my friends just started to call me to introverted and awkward which was true but I took it to personally and I let those words define me and sadly this is all I know and I still let it do for me they all made other friends and I was also no longer part of the group chat and parties but I know its my fault cause I distanced myself from them and other people in general but sometimes I tried to talk to people but covid came while I was in grade 9 and this did not help with my social skills I was alone i did the work and got good marks in th 80s but when grade 10 came i chose a bunch of useless courses that I thought were good cause of the youtube gurus in business so i chose them not knowing that they weren't good also grade 10 was also online so I was at home like 90% of the year and my parents wanted me to go outside but i didnt because I was terrified of finding people my age and having to inteact with them grade 11 came and it was in perons i went back and itw as the hardest thing ever cause U ahd spent the last years cheating and did not know that much and on top of that I had nobody to talk to my marks dropped and I hid in washrooms during lunch so i did not have to see other people I went back online for the second semester this was a huge mistake this is when I stared to get stress I would throw things and cut myself hit my head say horrible things to myself because I was tired i would even say Im going to kill myself to my parents My dad would get mad my mom would cry and I did not mean to make her cry or hurt but I still kept saying that and additionally I completely burnet my self out during the end of grade 11 and i am still recovering from it with heavy procrasanting and sterasing for any amount of work. But in the winter of grade 11 I started working at a grocery store were I met this girl and for five months I was so scared to talk to her or approach her but I wanted to cause I felt like we could of had something special and one day during the summer i heard a coworker saying she was going to leave the country  and then got the courage to talk to her so I did and for the entire week before she was going and it was amazing we did have a good connection but i t was to late she left and I was so disappointed I know I fall in love to fast and I know that I am selfish for wanting someone to love me and I can't even imagine someone saying I want you only you and wanting to spend the rest of their lives with me and saying I love you but I want that so bad to have a person love me the same way I would love them to only want to spend time with that person over everybody else to be someones favourite person but I Know that will never happen it took me very little time to get over this girl now for grade 12 it got worse I was now fully in person alone with bad marks and stressed spending lunches in a corner on my phone like an idiot I reconetd with some of my old friends but its never going to feel the same I still feel like an outsider and that our time has passed I even called the suicide hotline cause of uni appliactions and I was going to do it by jumping of a tall bridge near my school my mom wants me to go to therapy but i dont feel like I am deserving of that and also there have been some school shooting threats at my school but I still went to school hpoiing to get shot and killed and die a t a young age which I am still hopeing for.",1678934949.0

I was threatened with violence. I was guilt tripped, gaslit, and ignored in favor of my golden child brother. All that while I watched my parents fight over their awful marriage that shouldn’t have happened.

In my teen years, I had to deal with bullying and hearing from others, including my own father, that people like me (LGBT) were disgusting subhumans. I’m from the south if you couldn’t tell, so I could only trust one person irl enough to come out to her. I did not and would never have chosen to be bisexual. It’s just what I am, and I have to deal with it.

In adulthood I am realizing how horrible the world is. I never paid much attention to the news when I was younger. Now I know what’s going on in the world, and I don’t like it. I feel like I’m suffocating, I’ve never been so overwhelmed. My job is awful but I’m too worthless for anyone else to hire me I guess. I make okay money but it’s mostly being used on medical bills right now. Don’t even get me started on my health. I’ve never felt worse in my life, and not even just because I’m sick. The medical system is a damned nightmare. On top of all that I have to live with trauma.

I’m genuinely tired. I just want out of this awful existence. Recently I wrote a suicide note and deleted it. I thought about taking pills, but nothing is planned currently and I’m told it’s not the best method anyway. I’m reaching rock bottom, but maybe that’s a good thing?

The primary issue with being situated in an environment where collective denial of less educated civil members perdures life threatening economic inflation, mass ignorance, hate, and constant distrust in the environment of individual placement, is that there comes a point where there seems to be no gratification to justify or distract from the issue. Is someone with a will to live and resolve a crisis of this magnitude intended by the Universe to submit to demands of sacrifice to depart from the hostile territory, or persist amidst the terror until a resolution is achieved? Why would implications of abandonment become present in regards to spiritual security if one cannot overcome the demands of their own survival instincts?   When did the demands of those that insisted on fueling one’s individual financial failure and personal agony, become the will of these Angels and Healing figures who seem to know better? Is it Truly God’s will for one to commit suicide? What happened to independent will and freedom to choose without the threats of death and torture? It doesn’t effectuate a welcoming process of thought to hold someone in a position where their degraded psychological/spiritual health is to be worsened if any attempts to immediately alleviate physical world issues such as financial instability through means of effective medicinal applications. Is the spiritual wellness of oneself to be disregarded to the point of physical destitution because the affliction isn’t identical to potentially terminal conditions such as cancer?

They agreed based on my state that care from home at this point, because of the wait times.

My main concern is binge eating which is my most recent method. There have been years when I starved myself or put myself on restrictive diets to “feel proud of myself”. 

Yesterday, I was coming home from a doctors appointment and I was speeding. I was pulled over by a state trooper who immediately told me to step out of the vehicle so my car could be searched, not even mentioning the speeding. I panic a little because I live in Mississippi and I do in fact have enough cocaine to cover the tip of my pinkie (still a felony) in my backpack that I forgot to take inside the other night after a party. The officer thoroughly searched me and even accused me of having illegal pills (my antidepressants). Sure enough, he found my cocaine and some weed. Though I was completely sober, I was arrested for possession and DUI. 

My father bailed me out a few hours later. I have about six charges to worry about and a lot of money due. I am already very poor. I make 12 dollars an hour and don’t work many hours a week. 

I have not eaten since my arrest. My dad is currently yelling at me about everything that has happened as I type this. I’ve struggled with suicide attempts and suicidal ideation in the past and today is no different. What I’m wondering is, can I stop eating and wait for myself to die?  

I don’t want to be alive anymore. Before what happened yesterday I was still miserable. I don’t have friends and love interests are few and far between. I know for a fact my mother doesn’t love me and I’m starting to think my dad is about to be the same if he isn’t already.

I chased my dreams and fell flat on my face. I'm stuck in an area that I cannot stand with no friends and no family nearby. I'm out of a job after spending 4 months being threatened by my boss and verbally abused by coworkers.

I don't even want to be here. I hate this area so much and am only here because I can't afford to live in the first area I've ever actually enjoyed living in. I finally found freedom and hope and then lost it.

I've been suicidal before, but I actually had a future to look forward to before. I had something to fight for before. I can't identify anything worth fighting for this time. 

I have no passions that I can pursue without going back to college, no drive to keep working the only field that will have me. I'm getting too old to start a family and people in my area can't stand me anyway. The one friend that I thought I had had a hand in lying and gossiping about me at work.

Just being able to get that out even over text is better than getting deeper into it going about my day confronting all the ways I wish I could off myself. 

I have plenty of mental health and life in general issues that send me down this thought path. And I’m left kicking myself every time I come out the other side just too damn curious about wtf happens tomorrow. Sometimes it’s worse, sometimes it’s better, sometimes it’s the same old shit. I guess you could say I’m glad i stuck around to find out. I guess im also glad that im so afraid of failure and terrified of medical procedures that I wouldn’t actually dare try to un-alive myself bc the chances are I’d face pain and that’s what I’m ideating to get rid of in the first place. I always come around thinking the path to death has more unknowns, for me, than just doing nothing. 

This doesn’t mean I don’t feel awful all the time though. Every few weeks or months, I face a few days or weeks that are just hours and days on end of suicidal ideation. Where I feel like I cannot be helped and that I cannot even help myself. I wish I was born without all of this anxiety and depression and over-sensitivity and poverty; or even in those instances I would’ve been happy just not being born at all. It’s a big reason I dont want kids or anyone to take care of bc I can barely depend on myself or the ppl I’m supposed to depend on. There’s just a lot of shit that no one I know could possibly understand that I go through pretty much daily for years; it’s been like a decade now. 

A lot of times, if I don’t actively feel like burning garbage, I feel like my general contentness is avoiding the inevitable bad feelings. In its own way tho, feeling content with feeling content, even if I know it’s temporary, is still relief. And sometimes I’m just lucky enough to realize and let myself believe that Relief is what I was searching for in the first place. And I just have to take it for what it is and ignore the uncomfortable and dark emotions I have for just long enough, while they are small again, until they pass again. No matter how short that amount of time is. 

Thanks for the space to get that thought process out on a page where it has the chance to connect with someone who might think similarly enough to where they feel a little less hopeless/alone. And if not, at least I got through/past these awful thoughts on my own again. I’m afraid to tell family/friend/dr bc I feel like there isn’t much to do/say to when it comes to this.

I was so close. I was late on this March rent but my lease ends next month, the 25th. That's only two rent payments left. I don't think they'll accept doing an arrangement. There's no point in me living with an eviction on my record. With my credit score + the eviction I'll never be able to rent again, never be able to buy a home like I've always wanted, and it'll be a glaring record that I am an unreliable payer and a bad person. The worst part is I could make up the rent if I just had more time and I was so close to being able to get out of this apartment and find a living situation within my means. I even called all my other companies with bills and made arrangements so I could pay them after I paid off this late rent and my last months rent. 

I decided if I find out I'm getting evicted I'll write my letters and jump somewhere, or hang myself. I've already packed up what little belongings I have so there will be no hassle for anyone. I got ready really nicely today so I could feel good in my skin one last time. I think I'll wear my favorite clothes too. I have a dress with daisies on it and a cardigan from someone I loved a long time ago. 

I really wanted to live. But I don't think I can afford to live anymore. I feel like my debts have a gun to my head. 

I even have four interviews for nice jobs on Thursday and Friday. And I'm supposed to meet a potential roommate on Thursday. None of it matters if I get evicted though. I just didn't fight hard enough. I wasn't good enough. 

I don't completely know why I'm posting here. I've made up my mind and come to peace with things. There's no reason for me to live with an eviction on my record. My whole future will be ruined. There's not much point in asking for help. Talking with someone won't help. And I don't deserve any financial help. 

Last night I woke up from a nightmare about it all. And when I couldn't fall back asleep I prayed. I' agnostic so that doesn't mean much but it helped me feel a little better about not knowing where I'll go. 

This is my own fault. I deserve this. 

I was supposed to turn 23 at the end of this month. My lucky numbers involve threes so I was really excited.

Context:- I am a pretty good student academically and i scored 92% in my highschool finals.

My family told me to pursue medical after highschool. On contrast I am pretty good at computer science and i scored 98 on that paper, i love coding and i can do it all day. But since I was naive at the time i listened to my family and chose the carrier they wanted me to pursue.

It's been 3 years of me taking entrance exams for a medical college without any success. In India it's really tough to enter a government college and it has a selection ratio of 2 percent.

My family is fed up of me failing to get in a college after 3 years and they call me worthless. My dad beated the shit out of me a few days ago just because he had a bad day. He told me to die somewhere out there by getting chopped up by a train ( my house is really close to railway tracks).

I ran away from home that day and returned in the evening. My mom was crying.

But now after 3 days my mom and sister are back to calling me worthless and a stain to the family.

I made some money off of coding for a guy (freelance stuff) and bought myself a gift. But my family is saying I'm incompetent and i don't deserve it and that this chump change won't make a difference.

I've been contemplating it i should just end all this suffering sooner or later since I'm at my limit.
