Back in September, I moved into my first apartment for school, being away from home for the first time. Moving away made me realize how many messed up things my mom has said and done to me throughout my life. She has over controlled and been to protective over me for as long as I can remember, as well as commenting on my appearance and the way I choose to present myself. She‚Äôs always been really judgmental with others, which then seems to reflect back to me. I started working out a year ago, mainly weightlifting, and she mentions how big I look. That is what triggered me into going down this hole I have dug for myself. The thing is, I only make myself vomit if I overeat way to much, which is maybe once or twice a month, three at most. Today was the first of this month where I ate to much and threw up. I also believe I have depression as well, and anxiety for as long as I can remember.

One day I decided to lose weight and through crash dieting (unintentionally) and doing 1 hour of jogging a day, I was able to get down to what would be considered overweight in about 8 months.

Then, I upped my caloric intake to a healthier caloric intake, which slowed down my weight loss, but it was necessary. Around the same time, I started to get into weightlifting. About two months ago, I was at my lowest weight (which would be considered healthy) and about a month ago, I felt that I started to get the weightlifting lifestyle correctly.

However, about 2 months ago, I started binging. In the beginning, I was in a binge and starve cycle. I even tried vomiting about once or twice at that point. But about a month ago, I decided to stop with the binge and starve cycle because I realized that it never got me anywhere. I went from binging every other day to binging every week.

My binges these days seem to be very, very big and I gained some weight since. Nowadays, I‚Äôm trying to eat at maintenance so that I don‚Äôt feel real hunger or feel like I‚Äôm over feeding myself. I feel like I lost the discipline that I used to have when I was losing weight and I feel hopeless in ending my binging. I feel like I might go back to being morbidly obese and I‚Äôm starting to mourn the progress that I have made.

I just wanted to talk to someone because I'm meant to be going to a concert later this month, and it's literally been my dream for about 4 years to see the artists whose concert I'm going to see. Like, my friends from other countries have all had their chance but my chance never came until now. However, I know outfits are a big part of a concert experience these days with social media and stuff being such a big deal, and also I understand that in the bigger picture they really don't matter much at all as long as you have a good time. 
However, I'm feeling so down and like I don't even want to go because I don't look how I want to look. I've been waiting for this for so long and I don't even feel excited because I can't get over how much I hate my appearance, and how I regret not trying hard enough with stuff like restricting and exercising because now the time is finally here and I haven't got what I want to show for it. I'm scared other fans will think I look disgusting or the artist will somehow see me in the crowd and think I'm disgusting. (Although, I'm rational enough in my head to know, they won't see me and even if they did, they're doing a concert, they don't care how I look!!!!!) And also, I've never once at a concert looked at someone else and cared in a negative way what they looked like or what they were wearing, so the anxiety is all revolving around me, and I'm not someone who judges people for what they look like, just myself. (I just really wanted to make this clear!!!)

But yeah, I'm trying to feel excited but I just feel so nervous right now because I wish I had more time to have changed my body more, because I'm not that far through what I want to achieve and I feel ashamed that I haven't made changes quick enough. I just want to have a good time but I am so scared that this will negatively influence my experience.

(I say ‚Äúbulimia-type‚Äù because I have not been diagnosed) My period has been irregular basically forever. On average, my cycle lasts 45-53 days.

There were many times when I‚Äôve relapsed. I‚Äôm currently 3 days ‚Äúsober‚Äù of binging and purging. I know it‚Äôs very early on but I‚Äôve gone through this over a million times. I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll relapse again. I want this to be it. It‚Äôs hard to admit that I‚Äôve been experiencing the binge and purge cycle 1-4 times a day almost every day. 

Anyway, enough back story. In these last 3 days I have been experiencing extreme bloating (very uncomfortable bursting sensation). At first, I was afraid I was pregnant as I had (always) protected sex 4 weeks ago. I soon realised that couldn‚Äôt be the case (though I haven‚Äôt taken a pregnancy test to give me some reassurance on that end)

With the loving help of my boyfriend, I haven‚Äôt been restricting or binging. I also don‚Äôt eat too close before bedtime to avoid discomfort. But I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôve been bloating so much even first thing in the morning? Any type of kind advice/comment is welcome :)

Once or twice a day i hear him chewing and swallowing so fast and mindlessly this s\*\*\*, and when i'm cooking something nice he won't be hungry and eat with me. This is not a problem to him, he doesn't care about his health which is perfect at the moment, he's happy like that so I'm not telling anything about it.

But every time i hear the sounds it triggers me so much negative feelings like disgust towards him, and disgust toward myself because i'm judging even if i don't want to. Also a bit of irratition thinking of all the money he gives to industries that produces this cancer to society. And it reminds me my hyperphagia phases, which alternates with enjoying healthy well cooked meals phases, et when I do exactly the same as him when i'm losing control - giving my money to industries i which could collapse, eating high quantities without even being mindful  and not eating stuff that are rotting in my fridge. Moreover, when he brings that stuff home he will share with me and it sometimes triggers hyperphagia urges.  


I don't know what to do, how to talk about him with him, I can't just ask him to hide from me when he wants to do this while we're together or in the same room.  


Does anyone relate to this ? Do you also have a loved one with eating behaviour that is problematic to you but not to them?

I really feel like i'm a horrible person for not just letting him be, wish i wouldn't care

21,New here - 40M with multiple eating disorders -,1,11iyldc,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/11iyldc/new_here_40m_with_multiple_eating_disorders/,1,"I am 40M and have struggled with multiple eating disorders since the age of 11, probably younger. I started over eating at the age of 4 when my parents divorced and I moved from a southern costal state to the rural midwest. Over eating caused me to gain serious weight and subsequently I was bullied through school. I developed a hiatal hernia to such an extent that it takes just an 8 oz glass of water to feel super-full. Purging, for me, does not require induced vomiting. I have GERD with reflux so bad that it's really regurgitation that happens at nearly every meal unless I eat 4oz or less. I discovered purging via extraneous exercise. Then I realized I could fast-track the weight loss by purging via vomiting when regurgitation happens. Once I lost weight, I gained popularity quickly. That's when I started relying on Binge Eating, Bulimia, Anorexia, and realized I also had Body Dysmorphia.

My disorders have caused many other health issues or have brought existing health issues to the surface. They also brought social issues to the surface. 

I've have been forced to do inpatient intensive therapy, which did nothing except teach me how to mask my behavior better. 1 therapist in my area specializes in eating disorders, but only sees female patients. I tried online therapy and they just stopped me within the first 5 minutes and recommended inpatient intensive therapy. I tried spirituality and meditation which helped a bit with being present and trying to stay hopeful.

I know what to do, how to eat, how much exercise I need, etc.; but, I still struggle regularly. I recently decided to open up about it to my psychiatrist, who had been amazing for 3 years, and she kind of flipped the switch. Now she sees me as high-risk, untrustworthy, and drug-seeking and threatened to take me off my medications. I'm still looking for help and worry that I won't find it. Every time I open up to a professional, I'm met with shocked, angry, judgmental reactions and am further shamed. Do I just need to move?",1678026992.0

33,Advice on how to broach weight loss with family member,3,11i9yuy,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/11i9yuy/advice_on_how_to_broach_weight_loss_with_family/,10,"Hi all- first time poster. This is about my sister, and I‚Äôd really like some advice as to a) whether she does display any warning signs and b) how you would handle a conversation with someone who is very sensitive about this topic. 

So: background. My sister became a very very chubby child age 8. She had a habit of stealing food in the house (we were never able to keep peanut butter or  jam or any sort of sweet stuff in the house because she‚Äôd sneak in and eat it before we could open it.) My mom put her on a gentle diet (take half of whatever‚Äôs on the table, share a dessert with me rather than one by yourself) etc.  and it slowly started working. 

When my sister was 12/13, our dad lost his job, our stay at home mom had to go to work, she had to switch schools and ended up sort of homeschooled but with nobody there to teach her for a few months. Her mental health plummeted, and what we now know was a cocktail of depression and ADHD and performance anxiety raised its head. She spent the next few years truanting from school, doing her classes one on one tuition and generally cutting her own educational path. Our mom and I didn‚Äôt realise at the time what was in her head but things were lots of fights at home, her days passing lying starfished on a bed and us yelling at her for 30 mins to please just get dressed tidy her room and stop being lazy. (The guilt, now we know where her head was at, is unreal btw‚Ä¶). She has tantrums and refuses to attend mom‚Äôs birthday because her stomach ‚Äòlooks fat‚Äô in a dress. She stands oddly hunched over and obsesses over the ‚Äòfat rolls‚Äô. 

When she‚Äôs 15, I come across a diary of hers that has pages of scrawls calling herself ‚Äúa fat disgusting pig‚Äù and ‚Äúwhale‚Äù. I show it to my mom and we both are very worried, cue a few more fights with sister where she‚Äôs aggressive and defensive about it but she‚Äôs now at a healthy weight. 

Then she starts chewing up her food at dinner but instead of swallowing she hides the chewed up food in her napkin. She tears up bits of pastry so the whole plate just looks like it‚Äôs ‚Äòcrumbs‚Äô but she hasn‚Äôt eaten any of it. She throws stuff in the bin and says she ate it. 

A couple of years pass, she‚Äôs now 19, her mental health is in a better spot and things are better. But she‚Äôs getting thin. Every time we comment on it she says ‚Äúit‚Äôs all that fat from when I was younger I‚Äôm really a sparrow under here‚Äù. She starts exercising religiously(and I mean more like the world is going to end tantrum stop controlling me fight if we gently said ‚ÄòCan you go to the gym tomorrow instead because we have dinner with your godmother planned‚Äô). 
She looks grey under the eyes and complains about being tired always. 

This year, She went away for a gap year and came home for Christmas. Started doing her crumble the food thing and was shockingly thin. Like, thighs smaller than her knees, bony hands , sharp cheekbones. 

Mom and I looked at each other and mom said ‚Äúare you ok darling? it‚Äôs just you look like you‚Äôve lost a lot of weight and we‚Äôre a bit worried about you. Do we need to pack you some home cooked food for January‚Äù 

My sister lost her shit. Her main argument is: stop building everything up into an eating disorder which she doesn‚Äôt even have, stop controlling her and clinging onto this image of her as a kid when she was fat and that‚Äôs not her normal, why can‚Äôt we see her body the way it really is, stop commenting on other people‚Äôs bodies. Since then we have tiptoed around it but she still looks unhealthy. 

People of Reddit, are we overreacting? My response is that her emotional 12/10 outburst suggests her relationship with eating isn‚Äôt healthy, but I don‚Äôt have experience with this sort of stuff. How should we have approached this conversation?",1677956368.0
34,Bulimia recovery & body image,1,11idiur,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/11idiur/bulimia_recovery_body_image/,2,"TW 

Hi everyone. I (F21) have been dealing with an eating disorder for a long time. I think I have bulimia: I tend to restrict myself, binge and then find ways to compensate. I would say that over the past two years, my ED has gotten much better as I have started a recovery process. Unfortunately, recovering is never a straight road and I sometimes still struggle with bulimia especially when I feel mentally unwell. 

Recently, I have been under a lot of stress, felt really lonely and quite depressed. So I would say that my relationship with food and my body is not optimal at the moment. What I struggle the most with is my body image. I gained a bit of weight and I feel very tight in my clothes, especially around my lower belly. I can‚Äôt stand looking at myself, I hate the way I look, I cry daily about that. I check myself every time I see a mirror and every time it‚Äôs so painful to see myself. I feel too big, my stomach and my legs are the main issues, I keep thinking of how I used to look like and I wish I still looked like this even though I hated the way I looked back then. 
I feel really hopeless about feeling confident in my own body‚Ä¶ it might seem stupid for some, but hating yourself this much is tiring and it really affects my life. Any tips on how to learn to love your body ?",1677964626.0

I have a history of starving myself and binge eating in secret which I'm slowly recovering from. And ate till my body felt content and good before the enthusiastic, ""here, come and eat more!"" Food is our love language, and they especially cooked today for us since we haven't seen each other in a long time. And that's what makes it harder to decline.

37,My ED history gets triggered by BF's sister,1,11i0q89,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/11i0q89/my_ed_history_gets_triggered_by_bfs_sister/,1,"Hi all. I'm writing here because I just need to a place to speak/type about this and maybe it'll relate to others.

I am 23 now, but have had an extremely unhealthy relationship with food since I was 5 years old. I've also been overweight/obese my entire life and have gone through periods of starvation, binding, and purging as well. I have not purposefully restricted myself or forced myself to purge in a while, however, I still constantly panic and stress over food and my weight. I have moments where I want to go back to my purging days but I am able to convince myself not to. 

I moved in with my boyfriend and his family a little over a year ago. I moved in since his place is near the University I attend where I am a full-time student. I love his family and they treat me like I am their own. This is very nice since I moved a few thousand miles away from my own family (that was highly dysfunctional). 

For the last year, I have been trying to lose weight in a 'healthier' and at a slower pace. I've lost a good amount but have been at a plateau for a few months. I try to follow a calorie deficit and then I end up emotionally eating at the end of the night.

Anyways, my partner's sister has also started to lose weight. She was given a prescription shot by her doctor and was able to lose the same amount that I did without diet or exercise but over only a few months. It took me over a year with dieting and exercising. She has talked about this shot and how much weight she is losing a few times to me, and each time has sent me into distress that I have to hide because I do not like showing my emotions to people. But, last night was a breaking point. The three of us were eating dinner at a table and then she brought up her weight loss again. Already, I was tempted to throw out my entire bowl of food and my heart began to race. 

Then, she mentioned that she believes she might have an eating disorder because she binges here and there. I offered my support but after I had to go to the bathroom and live out an anxiety attack because this conversation triggered my very bad relationship with food. It was very difficult for me to not try and purge out everything that I ate.

For context, I come from a traumatic childhood but don't feel comfortable sharing any details about my life or my mind unless I am very drunk. However, since I am very good at masking it, people don't believe that I have gone through things. On the other hand, she is very open about her experiences. And as much as I love her, when I try to attempt to speak about my own experiences, it becomes a competition of who has had it worse. 

I feel like unless I say something, I will continuously become triggered when the topic of her weight loss and such is mentioned. I do not ever bring up my weight loss journey with anyone because I don't want it to lead into a triggering conversation. I feel bad though because I don't want to set a boundary and make her believe that she cannot come to talk to me when she needs it.

I also don't know if this is making any sense. I'm writing this on a lack of sleep. I also have a history of severe depression and little things like this can flare it up. I am also in the works of getting professional health again.

Also I am not blaming her for my triggers. It's not her fault and she doesn't know anything about my past. I just don't have the confidence to advocate for myself so I'm just seeking support. Maybe advice.

How would you guys approach this? Would you just ignore it or bring it up to her and set a boundary?",1677940824.0

But lately het ED has gotten out of hand, the 4 years I have known her she had always sufferd from an ED but she always tries to hide it. It often comes in waves but the last couple of months it has been really bad. We go shopping together and she told me she pretty much needed all new pants because all of hers where too big. She has also given me 2 pairs of pants she used to fit into like 1 year ago. 

It's also smaller thing she never wears her rings anymore because they are all to big now, and at my birthday she almost did not eat and when she thought I was putting a slice of pizza on her plate she almost started freaking out. 

She has lost clumps of hair she is always cold and you can just see she has lost a lot of weight. Sometimes I will see her eat because whenever she says she wants to have for I always say yes. Or if she comes to sleep over she will also eat but often I think she does it to not make me worried and show me she is eating. 

We have talked about it but we only do it when we have drank a lot and then we just kinda not bring it up again.  I have no idea what I have to do, I will always be there and I will always listen to her.

If I endure it for the day, before sleeping or during the night I will go binge and eat too much, until I feel like shit.

My body dysmorphia is huge, I am disgusted of my body, I literally wanted to kms (and attempted many times already, last year jumping from a tall building) and I'm already doing therapy.

I can't do heavy exercises because my body is *ucked up after my attempts, so I can only do some simple weight training and cycling, which doesn't make me lose weight, but makes me hungrier.

I can't stop eating and I am seriously considering moving to heavy drugs for weight loss.

59,Finding PCPs,3,11gah2f,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/11gah2f/finding_pcps/,1,"Hey everyone

For some context, I used to attend a ED program, but because of work/money I‚Äôm unable to continue attending it. My weight is very low for my height, and I suspect it has a strong impact on my levels of fatigue, anxiety, depression, attention, etc. Despite this, I struggle to gain weight due to problems with appetite, food sensitivities, allergies, and anxiety issues (money being tight definitely compounds all of these issues too). 

My weight loss/appetite loss has accelerated pretty dramatically. I was already not doing great, but the last half a year or so has been drastically worse. I have lost a medically significant amount of weight in the last several months alone. I am worried that it could be something else on top of the disordered eating. Realistically I probably need to visit a gastro. But I‚Äôd like to have a PCP who is on the same page. 

So multiple times now, I have spoken with my PCP about this issue, and every time he‚Äôs extremely dismissive. He doesn‚Äôt respond/discuss anything at all, he doesn‚Äôt ask any questions, and multiple times he asked for a pee or blood sample, then left the appointment without saying anything and also doesn‚Äôt discuss on follow-ups. Even if nothing were wrong, he‚Äôs not taking any time to debrief with me. He has even responded to my complaints about my weight loss with ‚Äúyou look fine to me.‚Äù I don‚Äôt want to drop my numbers here out of respect for everyone else, but i can‚Äôt find a single metric by which I‚Äôm ‚Äúpretty fine.‚Äù

So my question is: What are some good ways to find a PCP who is more experienced with this kind of thing? Perhaps some good questions to ask a potential PCP that would help me rule out people who take it seriously? I suspect that a question like ‚Äúdo you take weight loss seriously,‚Äù or ‚Äúhave you treated EDs‚Äù would be taken for granted by most professionals.

60,I need desperate advice on how to help with my sister's eating disorder,39,11fk68q,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/11fk68q/i_need_desperate_advice_on_how_to_help_with_my/,28,"I (22M) am in desperate need for help with a situation that is destroying my family. My sister (19F) has been struggling with a devastating eating disorder for a year now. We have tried everything we can think of to support her, but nothing seems to be working, and we are near our breaking point.

Initially, my sister started off with what seemed like a desire to lose a few pounds. However, it quickly escalated into a full-blown disorder, with her spending hours on the treadmill every day and not eating anything. From the very beginning, my mother knew that things were not looking good. She constantly warned my sister of the dangers of the path that she is on.

My mom would try to help her and offered to see a therapist or nutritionist with her, but she viciously refused, saying that she knows what she's doing and that my mother doesn't know what she's talking about. She was constantly exercising and never eating, and my mom would try to explain to her the dangers of this and share her support for her. But my sister is extremely stubborn by nature, and would always just brush her off, attack her, yell at her. This continued for many months, my sister refusing any form of help, my mother worried sick for her, until she became dangerously underweight.

We were all extremely scared for her. My mother and I would cry almost every day, desperately trying to support her and save her, worried sick for her life. But she would always dismiss us. She was so malnourished that doctors said she needed treatment ASAP because she was at risk of organ failure, but she refused, and we cannot force treatment on her because she is an adult. If she lost any more weight she probably would have died.

At this time, my sister also wanted to get a nose job, but my mother explained to her that no doctor would put her under general anesthesia and operate on her in her condition. She explained to her that she needs to recover if she wants to be able to do the things she wants and live the life she wants, like go to college.

One day, after months of my mother and I crying for her and pleading with her, it seemed like she finally had a breakthrough. She seemed determined to get better and started forcing herself to eat. We were all so happy. We constantly supported her throughout the way. We thought she was on the road to recovery.

But now she recently got the nose job that she wanted, and she is slipping back to her old habits. Not eating, lying, gaslighting us, attacking us when we try to support her. Over the past month she has lost a dangerous amount of weight, and it seems like all of the progress she made is rapidly being lost. She is quickly entering a dangerous state again, but she is again refusing help.

She won't see a therapist or accept any treatment. She says that she can handle this on her own and nobody can help her. We have tried to talk to her gently, support her, and show our concern, but she just attacks us every time. It's like we're all held hostage by this eating disorder, a never ending nightmare that we cannot escape.

The situation is taking a massive toll on my mother. She looks depressed, exhausted, and stressed all the time. I am so worried for her health. She has a history of heart problems and high blood pressure, and I fear that all of this stress will be the end of her. I can't bear the thought of losing both my sister and my mother.

I feel so terrible for my mother. She lives for her children and the only thing that matters to her is for her children to be happy and healthy. This whole situation has been destroying her. I am depressed not only for my sister, but also my mother. My mother means the world to me, and it is devastating to watch my mother breakdown while my sister withers away no matter how much she tries to help her. It seems like this battle will never end and will eventually kill them both.

We all live in the same house, and I see my mother trying to gently support my sister only to get attacked. I hear my sister yelling at my mother for trying to help her and prevent her from dying. My sister has said such terrible things to my mother despite all she's done for her. Things like she's a shit mother, saying that she's never done anything for her, that she doesn't love her, that she doesn't care about her, when my mother literally devotes her life to her kids' happiness.

My sister even blamed my mother for her eating disorder, saying it's her fault that she didn't save her before it turned into this, when my mom has literally tried everything she could from the very beginning to help her. My sister has tremendous anger issues now and makes everyday hell with her terrible attitude, throwing things, slamming things, screaming at us for trying to help her, blowing up over everything, refusing to see a therapist.

I recently got laid off and have been struggling to find a job in this economy, and my father is worried about losing his job. If something happens to my sister and she needs to be hospitalized or needs medical care, we would go broke. This is such a nightmare.

I'm writing this post in the hope that someone out there can help us. If you have any advice or suggestions, please share them with me. I don't know what to do, and we are all at our breaking point. We just want our sister back, and we want our family to be happy and healthy again.

I'm F, 14, and currently underweight. Now, I don't know if this is a fucked way of thinking or not, but I *love* being underweight. I have this thing, where I'm absolutely terrified of getting fat or gaining any weight at all.

I love being called skinny, i love when people are concerned about how skinny I am because all I can think about is the fact that I *am* skinny.

To lose weight, I started intermittent fasting (16:8) and am currently still continuing it. I don't like looking at my body at night because it's bloated and often weigh myself in the morning, when I haven't eaten anything.

one thing i think i really did was cut out a large number of calories of my day to try to see better results. however, i now learn that this can do more harm than good when trying to gain that muscle and toning. 

the problem is, idk how to go about tracking if i‚Äôm eating enough to gain the muscle, but not eating too much to gain weight. i know a lot of fitness people track calories, but i used to do that and it was super toxic for me :(  counting my calories made my ed at its worst and i don‚Äôt wanna go back to that. however, i also don‚Äôt know how to make sure i‚Äôm eating enough without tracking them.

I would wake up, drink a can of mountain dew, and snack on some chips for my breakfast. I knew how unhealthy this was, and joined a gym and adopted healthier eating habits that summer. I started losing a lot of weight. I started to become occupied with the weight I was losing, but it was more so an achievement at first because I knew I was getting healthier.

Then, I started sophomore year. It became less of an ‚Äúachievement‚Äù and more of an obsession. I struggled with restrictive eating all throughout that year and kept losing weight. This is when I realized it was an issue.

During the summer before my junior year (my current year), I noticed that I was underweight. All my clothes were huge on me, but although I ‚Äúcomplained‚Äù about it, I secretly found satisfaction in seeing the difference based on how the clothes fit (and I still feel this way about old clothes).

In fall 2022, I started to get a bit better. I became less restrictive about what foods I would eat and allow myself to eat more than I would in the past.

However, in the past month, I have been struggling and nobody knows how bad it is. I am at my lowest adult weight ever. My boyfriend noticed that I lost weight, but it‚Äôs hard to open up to him about something that he doesn‚Äôt fully understand (I‚Äôve tried before but he doesn‚Äôt really get it). I am afraid to open up to any doctors about it because a) I still find satistfaction from the feeling of ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù in what I eat and look like and b) I do think they would cut down on my ADHD medication dosage because it‚Äôs an appetite suppressant, but I absolutely need that medication for school.

I know I need to do something about this. My weight isn‚Äôt dangerously low to the point where weight gain has to be in recovery, but I can‚Äôt keep doing this to myself. I can‚Äôt name one day this week where I have ate enough food to maintain or gain weight, and I feel like if I keep going down this route, there will be serious health consequences down the line.

As a brown person who has been helped primarily by white women, it is difficult for me to ignore how my eating disorder was largely shaped by the white supremacist idea of societal beauty, that was then followed by the white supremacist idea of recovery/help. 

In summation, I wonder if (in trying to help BIPOC communities) using **food and body** with any combination of struggle/challenge/barrier -- in addition to the term eating disorder -- that we might connect to ancestral wisdom as we work to find individual health and balance.

I have been recovered for about three years now but I still get bouts of extreme hunger at times. As soon as I make any changes in my diet (I have IBS so occasionally have to switch things up to avoid flareups), up my workout regime, or even if I just don't have breakfast because I'm late to work a few times in the same week, my body goes into this distrustful mode. I feel like it is somehow physically suspicious of me relapsing and tries to counter it with this intense, neverending hunger which I have only experienced in recovery before. It's bizarre and so far I couldn't really find anything about it online yet. 

I'm just not sure how to avoid this, because in normal day to day life, unexpected changes happen all the time. Sometimes I might have to have a late lunch a couple of times a week, sometimes I will need to change my diet, sometimes I just really want to work out a lot! But I immediately go into this extreme hunger mode even though I have a good grasp of my dietary needs, so I know I'm not undereating or lacking in protein or anything like that.

I‚Äôm new to Reddit so if I‚Äôm doing this posting thing wrong, I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm fresh into recovery with ‚Äúunspecified disordered eating‚Äù due to fitting many criteria for all the things‚Ä¶ I do not know people personally who understand ED or consider ED to be a ‚Äúmental illness‚Äù. My family is new to accepting mental health as an actual, realistic, and vital part of one‚Äôs health‚Ä¶ so needless to say it‚Äôs been lonely. 

My questions:
How do I go about helping those around me to understand my habits (good and bad) related to ED?
What are some strategies used to identify those habits when ED has convinced me that what I do is ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù since our messed up diet culture has made disordered eating ‚Äúnormal‚Äù..?
Is it common for other people to have sudden urges to throw away all food in the house and spray so much air freshener to rid the house of food smells? Just me?

I guess‚Ä¶ with my recovery I‚Äôm just always having all of these questions of ‚ÄúIs this ED?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow can I know if it‚Äôs because of ED?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs it ED or one of my countless other mental illnesses?‚Äù

I also don't have much of an appetite ever and sometimes feel disgusted at the sight or smell of food. I also do not like certain foods such as sauces, yoghurt, fish and some traditional dishes of my country.

I have faced a lot of ridcule over my eating problems and I am just really tired of them. I should probably visit a therapist but I can't afford one and I don't think my parents would be in favour.

She spent 2 months in a rehab center for her alcoholism, and then another 4 months in a different treatment center for her bulimia. 

Since she came home about a year ago things have been going great, she has been gaining weight, seeing her dietician and therapist regularly, while continuing to work on her alcoholism. To my knowledge she has not relapsed in either addiction. 

I'm so proud of her and all the work she has put into herself, however I got home late last night and could tell something was wrong. She was lying in bed sleeping, but there was food everywhere, which is not like her at all. 

She was very upset, but unable to speak much. However I did get it out of her that while she didn't drink, she had a bad night and binged on food. Not sure if she purged , but I assume so. I was also able to find out that it was something to do with work, and that people may have been talking  EDs and maybe that what's triggered her. 

She just wanted to be left alone in bed, but as soon as I sat down in our living room she started cleaning the mess and taking out the garbage. I assume because she was ashamed of her behavior and didn't want me to see. I tried telling her not to worry about it and that we would clean up later, but she was very persistent. I know that ED has a lot to do with control, and I feel like this was her trying to control the situation and she refused any help

I tried my best to just tell her I love her, and that it's OK. I cuddled her in bed until she fell asleep. 

I know this is a very delicate situation, and I just want to do my best to not make it any worse. I'm not mad at her, I'm incredibly proud of her and love her very much, but I need advice on how to help her through this slip. 

Should I suggest that she make an emergency appointment with her dietician and therapist?",1677234176.0

Our relationship was already in uncomfortable waters before I found out about her ED a few months ago. She exhibits a lot of what appears to be typical ED behaviour. It absoutely breaks my heart to see and weighs heavily on my mind 24/7.

I don't really want to go into detail regarding her specific methods but these examples speak to what is also an honesty issue in my mind.
After presenting to emergency department with heart palpitations, she tried to cheat a subsequent blood test by asking the staff there to supply electrolytes intravenously ahead of the test, and they declined, asked me to get her a powerade instead which I also declined because the professionals need to be left to do their job. She showed me her food diary one day recently and left out the binge and purge. There was a charge on the card for a takeout delivery that day which didn't appear on the diary. I'm struggling to see how recovery can happen if there's no honest acknowledgement of what is happening.

We're both in therapy. I'm suffering mental and emotional burnout from the stresses of this relationship and my work. 
Talking about recovery, I feel like therapy isn't enough for me, I *desperately need* a structural change in circumstances so that I can have a chance at leading a fulfilling and contented life. At the same time I don't know if leaving is an option because it feels like it would be sociopathic to leave someone when they're struggling to such an extent as having an ED. I typically have an overactive sense of guilt so it could just end up being a new flavor of mental health issue to throw onto the fire.

I think I have an ED, it has never been diagnosed though. All my childhood I remember thinking I was fat and hated myself for having no ""self control"" when it came to snacks and candy, I would eat large amounts of those in secret from my family. I remember thinking I wanted to lose weight and was afraid of gaining it, but I still wanted to be ""healthy"" and lose weight through adopting a healthy lifestyle. At 13 years old, I remember thinking that I don't care about my health anymore, I just want to be skinny, ""I want to get anorexia"", went on google and found the pro-ana community and all the ""tips and tricks"" to become anorexic. I followed them religiously.

However, it never came easy to me and I never ""got anorexia"" (never met the weight requirement). I'm 23 now. I still engage in those pro-ana tips and tricks to stop eating, but I always end up eating because I'm too tired and weak to resist my urges. I wouldn't say I binge, I eat normal sized portions but I'm always disappointed in myself if I eat more than nothing. So restricting has never come easy for me, in fact I have never managed to lose weight, only gain (always within normal weight). Isn't it supposed to become ""easier"" to not eat than to eat if I had anorexia/other eating disorder with no binging? I read those stories of people being so scared of food they couldn't imagine eating meanwhile it takes all my willpower not to eat and I fail all the time. Yet I fit all the other ED diagnosis criteria: I hate my weight, I hate myself, I want to lose weight, I am afraid of gaining weight, I think about food 100% of the time. This torture has never given me weight loss though.

Some days I'll slurp half my weight in tomato soup; next, I can barely stomach the metallic-tasting liquid. Recently, one of my comfort foods has been brussels sprouts. I'll eat them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. For the first time in a long time, I've been eating healthy and preventing dangerous eating habits. I didn't think there was a problem until everyone became adamant about voicing their opinions on my food. ""It smells gross!"" ""Stop roasting them. It makes our house smell awful."" ""Oh God, again?"" Every. Single. Time. I. Make. Them. 

Because of the barrage of comments, I tried cutting back on eating brussels sprouts, but that led to me gorging on bread or cake to try and fill the hunger. I feel so ill after eating anything other than brussels sprouts. In my opinion, they're all acting like complete dicks. I'm a vegetarian and never complained when someone made shrimp, salmon, beef, or chicken (which is every damn day)! It's no secret to my family that I suffer from an eating disorder (7 cavities and counting at one point from vomiting). However, I feel uncomfortable telling them to fuck off because this is my comfort food. They would say I'm playing the victim and make fun of me for being defensive.

I have a BED and I am currently clinically obese. I am trying to turn my life around and focus on recovery. 

One thing I wanted to focus on the most was eating around other people. My ED was caused by bullying/taunting around my choice of food and portions (even when they were a regular portion), as I‚Äôve always been somewhat on the curvier side (legs, bum etc). 

So one thing that became very common for me was to eat alone. Over time it has gotten worse, and I think almost encourages my binging behaviour as no-one can see what I‚Äôm eating, so along with controlling portions and making healthier choices I also wanted to start eating in front of people.

However, it makes me so incredibly anxious. Even when no-one says anything to me, I feel like I know what they‚Äôre thinking. If I‚Äôm out for dinner with friends and we all order burgers, I feel like I‚Äôm being judged for being the obese one eating a burger, but if I ate a salad I‚Äôd feel I was being judged like lol at that obese person trying to lose weight. 

Even in my house I have some great non judgemental housemates, but cooking and eating in front of them makes me really anxious. I went on a trip with work recently and had a panic attack in the hotel over the fact I was going to have to eat dinner with my team. I feel I‚Äôve got worse recently and I just don‚Äôt know what to do!

For anyone who has ever felt this way (at either end of the weight spectrum) what tips/advice would you give to someone in my
position? Are there things that worked for
you? Was it just like exposure therapy and keep pushing myself til I stop panicking?

Any help would be amazing :)",1677094115.0

I (22f) have gotten an issue with eating sweets for years, idk even when it started. i use sweets mostly to deal with negative feelings when i'm sad/depressed, stressed, worried or generally in low mood and when i'm bored. i can eat a big amount of sweets to the point where i feel i'm full or when i feel it's too much for me, but i can't stop eating it. when i start eating, i loose control and it's almost impossible for me to start chocolate or box of cookies and not finish the whole thing. even when my stomach hurts, i can't stop eating. i also spend quite a lot of money to buy sweets, i've tried methods like doing shopping list, not going to shop while being hungry, but it's not working - i see my favourite chocolate, cookies or just some kind of sweets i'd like to eat, i immediately buy it, it's more like an impulse which i cannot control. 

i've been shamed for eating so much sweets when i used to live with my mother, she used to rummage through my shelves to see how much sweets i had and checked my trash can to see what i ate and what amount of it i ate. i was trying to hide all of it, but i couldn't, so i used to buy sweets outside and eat it outside, so she won't see any evidence of me buying and eating it.

now the whole thing is in the point that i can't control myself when i buy sweets, when i eat them at home, i feel ashamed every time i eat them, cause i spend so much money and i risk my health for them, but i can't stop it. yesterday while eating i felt to guilty and ashamed that i went to the toilet and forced myself to throw the whole thing up. i know it's getting worse and i have no idea what to do. i know i'm addicted to sugar and i wanna have a healthy relationship with sweets, to eat them when i want them in reality, not when i feel some kind of mental hunger but I have no idea how to start. am i overreacting with everything or is there really an issue?

The amount of chocolate bars that I'm eating is affecting my triglyceride levels, which is dangerous for my health. 

Originally I thought that chocolate almond milk might be a good substitute. But I didn't have any on-hand hand and I'd have to wait until the next time I'd get groceries. 

I also received several helpful suggestions from other people on Reddit. But unfortunately I didn't have any of the suggested foods on-hand, and again, I'd have to wait. 

But just now I saw that I had bought some dried prunes.

I *freaking love* dried prunes.

I know that it's kind of a leap, chocolate bars to dried prunes. But I think it's *sugar* that I'm craving, not necessarily chocolate. 

Dried prunes aren't high in trans or saturated fats, which could help lower my triglyceride levels.

It's still not good to consume an excessive amount of sugar. But hopefully I can work on *that,* later on.

Now the problem is that I am a bulimic girl (active bulimia, that in my personal life means throwing up every single day - I usually eat just once a day but that lasts 4-5 hours and after I throw up for around 50 mins and after I am in a fasting state until next day‚Äôs binge) - this eating system to me is very important and if anything goes differently, I immediately panic and anxiety and deep lethargy captures me that generates a domino effect of canceling social connections and sometimes even modifying my working hours

My husband doesn‚Äôt know about my eating disorder, he never sees me eating and I have always rejected eating together ever since the start of our marriage - I tell him that I prefer eating at home, and that‚Äôs it 

But I ethically cannot skip all meals for 10 days and I am afraid what will happen if every single day I will be offered large amounts of food by several relatives a day several times. I am deadly anxious they will point out how little I eat and start asking questions about the reasons or if maybe I will hurt them by not eating

They lightly joke about my eating habits or jokingly/sincerely say good job if I ever finish eating something. it can get really patronising, I try not to think that way but sometimes it hits all the wrong spots.

All this is bringing unwanted self consciousness to what and how much I'm eating, adding to my subconscious stress. I just want to eat without thinking, whether I decide to finish the whole thing or half. I just want to go about without thinking abt it. because that's how I made peace with not counting calories. I don't mind that they ask questions but this whole teasing when it comes to anything remotely food is warping into something I'm not comfortable with I think. I haven't noticed it was affecting me this much, because I sort of disconnected whenever it happens and I feel like everything went in a blur while I remain stunned and speechless.

I'm not witty enough to retort back jokingly either, my social anxiety doesn't help either. Today they talked about how some of them used to hide food or throw milk down the sink and then included me in a joke. I dont even know whether to think it was triggering or feel invalidated. I didn't know what to say and add to their experiences knowing it was a different kind of experience for me. seems like harmless joking but i feel like I may relaspe into binge purge cycle bc of how much consciousness is going to what I eat now. I feel myself having less self control. I notice I eat a little more or force myself to eat more because people keep pointing out that I eat v little. tbh I don't care what they think that's why I eat little without caring but the constant pointing out is affecting me.

So, my wife is currently in the stages of getting better from her ED - anorexia. During the last few years before we got together, she had become a vegetarian and is now a vegan.

Now, I can accept all the moral arguments to support veganism, that is not my dispute here. I have vegan friends. What muddies the water on her moral or ethical stance is that, I believe, is that it is a very calculated way to control what she eats. Let me be clear, I don't think that eating meat or eggs will cure her. Its just that, for anyone else who is a vegan by principle, I could accept. But in her case, I believe it is a way to control and perpetuate her ""ritual torture"". By dropping her strict diet, maybe it will be a sign of a 'letting-go' of the rigid control she feels she needs to have.

I would happily adopt a vegan diet on ethical grounds. But in my case, there's no underlying illness that makes it convenient ruse for me to do so. I know you can be healthy on a vegan diet - you could be a bodybuilder on a vegan diet.

I can't help but find a link between the letting go of her rigid rules on eating and being more comfortable and closer to a 'shedding' of the power of being ill.

Even small things like choosing what to eat at a meal becomes obfuscated and becomes a drag.

I‚Äôve suffered from BED since I was about 12-13 years old, I‚Äôm now 26 and very overweight. Throughout the years I‚Äôve gone through the stints of eating better, feeling good for a few weeks and then relapsing and feeling helpless. I currently am in the state of feeling helpless. My family have always commented on my weight, my siblings always bullied me for it, I have always been the fat friend, I‚Äôve never had a healthy relationship with food 

I recently started on anti depressants for my depression, anxiety, and agoraphobia as it was starting to take over my life, while they‚Äôre still kicking in I‚Äôve relapsed in my EDs tremendously.

Binging and restricting has always been my main issue, I would make myself throw up a lot throughout high school from excessive eating but didn‚Äôt do it until recently, about six months ago I would magically ‚Äústart coughing‚Äù after every time I ate a big meal throw it back up and my boyfriend would always ask if I was doing it on purpose to which I‚Äôd lie and say no because to be honest I‚Äôve only really come to the realisation I was subconsciously doing it, I think part of my denial was my own self judgement of being fat but bulimic due to internalised stereotypes 

I‚Äôve been noticing a lot of subconscious behaviours around my EDs, if I go out to eat with other people (which is extremely rare due to embarrassment and fear) I always eat less no matter how hungry I am so I appear to not stuff my face, I‚Äôll also play with my food in a way where it looks like I‚Äôm just a slow eater

For my thesis, I am analyzing the role of different household dynamics (single versus double parent) in the development of eating disorders and/or disordered eating behavior. My research consists of 26 questions regarding personal/family medical history, family dynamics and feelings related to weight/body. The survey will take approximately 10 minutes to complete. ‚Äã‚ÄãThe survey poses psychological risks for participants due to the topic of eating disorders and other psychiatric disorders. The survey also includes discussion of eating disorder behaviors including restriction, inappropriate compensatory behaviors, and binging and purging episodes which can be triggering. An ‚ÄúI decline to answer‚Äù option will be available for all multiple choice questions, and can be stated for the free response answers if needed. Additionally, there will be behavioral health resources listed at the end of the survey. Due to the sensitive nature of this survey, no identifying information (such as participant name and internet protocol address) will be collected, and survey responses will be kept anonymous.

This is project #1551 and has been approved by the Viterbo University IRB.

I am requesting responses from individuals who meet the following criteria:

1. At least 18 years old
2. Grew up under their parent(s) care until at least 18 years of age.
3. History of or currently engage in an eating disorder/disordered eating behavior
   1. Disordered eating can be defined as but is not limited to: frequent dieting, anxiety associated with specific foods, skipping meals, chronic weight fluctuations, strict rituals/routines surrounding food and exercise, feelings of guilt/shame with eating or a feeling of loss of control around food including compulsive eating habits.

If you meet this criteria and are comfortable completing this survey, please click on the link below.

when we were just friends the warning signs were there. he is gym and health obsessed, and i was aware he counted calories. but my own sexism got in the way i guess, and i assumed little of it. infact i assumed it would make us incompatible. the gym has always been a slippery slope into the danger zone for me, so i opt to work an active job instead, and opt to walk whenever possible. maybe this'll change one day, but it works for now.
everything he eats is very plain and measured out. he cant really share food with me because it seems to upset him. and not in an annoyed way, in a sort of panicky frustrated way, if that makes sense? he also says hes eaten the same lunch everyday for the past year, and the same two or three meals for tea. i try not to push him because it might be a sensitive subject, but sometimes he cant eat food if its a certain colour or texture? he also tends to cut up food very very small, not sure if thats relevant? the most alarming bit for me is just how much of it comes out of a tub in powder form. ive also realised over the past few months that he tires very very easily, and is also completely caffeine dependent. ive mentioned some observations to him, but he always seems ashamed so im trying not to push too hard. honestly, should i be worried?",1676675259.0
260,Male struggling with Anorexia - My story until now,1,114y4oa,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/114y4oa/male_struggling_with_anorexia_my_story_until_now/,2,"Hello everyone! Wanted to share my story here. 

I first developed an eating disorder when I was a teenager. I was an overweight child, and when I hit puberty I became very self-conscious about my body. Eventually, I became obsessed with the thought of losing weight; despite being a fairly attractive person, I became convinced that I was fat and ugly. At one point, I was not able to eat as much as I normally would for a season, and I lost enough weight for people to notice. I received a ""good work"" from someone, and it all went downhill from there. 

I started restricting food and exercising a lot. I could not stop, and eventually I got so underweight for my age and height that I was constantly in pain and tired, and every time I saw people they commented on how thin I was and how worried they were. I went to the doctor one day and he told me that my option was to recover at home, or be admitted to a residential ED program until I could become weight restored. In favor of the former option, Mom sat with me at the table for each meal everyday for months to make sure I was eating.

I ""recovered"" by my eighteenth birthday after two years of hard work, but all throughout life I still had disordered eating habits. 

A few years ago, over a decade later, my ED returned with a vengeance. I lost weight after spending several years being obese, and again went into the underweight range. I was counting calories, over-exercising, water loading, and restricting. A relatively healthy change of habits thus downturned into being a full-fledged relapse.

 I weight restored to healthy levels back in 2021, thanks to the support and concern of my wife. However, I have actively been struggling with my eating disorder since early 2022. I purged for the first time last summer, and eventually did it a few times a week. I was always honest about struggling with this, and even nowadays my wife gets suspicious when I use the restroom right after eating. 

 Currently, I am struggling with extreme food restriction and over-exercising. My wife hid our scale, but I found it and have been secretly weighing myself. I've lost a lot of weight in the last month, and have been working with my therapist and figuring out whether I will need to attend an IOP ED program. 

 A lot of times, I will agree to eat more, and realize that I need to, but eventually I get so scared of becoming overweight again that I just do not do it. 

 Being male with Anorexia Nervosa has been quite a strange experience. Most people I know with the disorder are women, and a lot of my insecurities about my body are similar yet different to those I hear from others. Either way, it's hard to realize that I am so unhealthy, yet so disgusted with my own body that I struggle with recovering.

 Thanks for hearing me out.",1676669279.0

okay so me (21F) and my gf (20F) have been together for almost 2 years now. we've had up an downs but we really love each other and we practically see each other everyday. i've always known she has an ed, she has told me and it's hard but i've tried everything to help her. i'll accept that sometimes i've said really bad stuff and i know it made her feel worse, but i don't know what it is like to have an ed and it's really hard for me to navigate it with her, i always try to choose the right words but i never know if what i'm saying is only making things worse.

i'm skinnier than her. she is not overweight either. she has told me several times that she feels self concious or that she constantly compares herself to me, and it honestly isn't good for me either. i really don't like it and i've told her that, but i know i can't ask her to stop, i know it's hard for her. she has stopped saying it to me, though.

now, what i've done basically is ask her constantly what she has eaten or if she is with me i'll make sure we both eat and i stay with her the whole time. when we order food i try to ask her what she wamts or to help me look at restaurants so we don't order something she doesn't like, but she has told me to search for myself and pick for myself if she¬¥s feeling bad because if she does it it's gonna make her feel worse, so i'm trying to do that. sometimes she gets better but she relapses back everytime. another important thing is that we study musical theatre, which needs a lot of physical effort. i've tried telling her that she needs to eat so she can dance and do everything in a healthy way, but i don't know if it's helping.

recently i feel like things have gotten worse. she gets nauseous if she eats, she feels bad if we're watching a movie and she eats a whole bag of chips as a snack, she almost never wants to eat lunch, etc.

the other day we were in my house and she was telling me about something her friend had texted her, so i asked if i could see the chat in her phone and she said yes. i took it and unlocked it, and it was open on twitter, on an account i had never seen before (which is weird because we follow each other and are always sharing tweets). i thought she just changed her username and layout, so i asked why was her twitter so pretty (she usually just has a layout of cat memes), i looked at her and she didn't say anyting but she looked horrified. i looked again and i saw some weight on her bio (cw, gw, im not sure what that means) but i just closed the app and went to the chat i was supposed to look at.

at night, alone, i remembered her username so i searched for it, and i realized it was a edtwt acc. i'm not an expert on that side of twitter but i'm a little bit familiarized with it, and i know how toxic it can be. and i thought she knew that too, because not long ago she had told me she found one of her best friend's edtwt acc and that she thought it was horrible. but now, she's in too.

i didn't know what to do, and i know what i'm doing is bad because it's something private for her, but i've been stalking her acc ever since. it's tweets of her saying how pretty she'd look or how nice her outfits would look on her if she was skinny, complaining how she is the ugly one in the relationship, even tweets saying i never know how to make her feel better, which sucks because i've really tried. she talks abourt fasting and retweets a lot of ""inspo"" that is just... a lot. edtwt as a whole is a lot. she has also started taking pics of every single meal she eats, counting it's calories and posting it, even if she's eating with me. one time she even said she didn't want to eat lunch, but since i was at her house, she had to. she says she wants to lose weight and she's starting a new restricting diet, which i know it's not healthy considering the amount of workout we do on our major. she now spends all day in edtwt groupchats, and i know it because she even chats in them next to me, and it makes me incredibly anxious to know she's talking with strangers that could just convince her to enter unhealthy habits, i don't know. she has over 100+ followers now...

she knows i know about the account and after that i've told her that i've noticed she's not eating again (idk if that was a good idea) and that i really don't get why she has the account, that i'm not gonna force her to close it or prohibit her to use it, but that i need her to talk to me and explain everything to me so i can understand her, because i'm never gonna know how it feels and the only way for me to know a piece of her mind is if she shares it with me. she hasn't said a word, though. i've told her a lot of times to seek help and she tells me she's gonna do it but it never happens.

i'm so worried and i'm running out of options here, because i know she's gonna be uncomfortable if i talk about her ed with someone in our circle, and we basically know the same people, so i don't have anyone to ask for advice. i don't know how to talk about eds or how to help someone with one.

what should i do? should i try and talk to her again? search for a therapist? psychiatrist? any other option?

I eat if I am hungry though. Sometimes I eat if I am hungry. It is just that even when I am hungry, I'll just have a little and I will be full. My parents force me to eat full meals so that I don't get malnourished.  
I eat when I am hungry. But theb there are times (especially mornings) when even though I am hungry, I just don't want to eat anything.  So, I deny the fact that I am hungry and don't eat anything for sometime. 
Honestly, if it weren't for my parents, I probably wouldn't eat at all. 
I'll have food of it is good. I love curry and pickles and I love pizza too. But the quantity I have wouldn't be much.

the adhd medication i take causes me to feel sick when i think of eating, and ive been struggling to eat because of this. paired with my self destructive behaviour, im worried that it may become very bad, and it has just become routine and habit not to eat. 

i was wondering if you guys have recommendations on what i would be able to stomach? im very new to all this. ive found that i can eat some fruits, but thats all. everything else makes me feel ill. even simple things like bread and butter are inedible for me. i still feel the hunger, but the food disgust is stronger.

i regularly go to the gym, and while im currently a healthy weight, im very worried that i might quickly become unhealthily underweight.

Backstory: My wife and I have been together for 20 years and let me 2 years into my relationship that she has had Anorexia/Bulimia since she was 13 years old. When looking back at how I supported her these last 2 decades it hasn't been the best. I have guilt tripped her and I have criticized her due to a complete lack of understanding on the disorder. This past year I have found the error of my ways and I can see that this is something that she cannot control. I still struggle every conversation, and my wife gets super defensive when opening up, which causes me to be super defensive. SO! I am coming to Reddit for help because I am not succeeding with her preference on how to communicate.

This is what I have found out in regard to a few sessions of her opening up and what I need help with understanding on the newest conversation with her.

* Unless she is blatantly lying my wife has stated that her eating disorder is in no way related to any childhood trauma. She has re-assured me over the years that this is not the main trigger.
* My wife has stated that when she is triggered, she feels like all the cells in her body are ""heavy"".
* I cannot go into details on my wife's appearance due to respect of the group BUT I can assuredly say that my wife is teetering on the line of being underweight.
* My wife goes to a Psychiatrist who addresses her anxiety and has tried a few newer medications to address her ED. As you all know treating ED with meds is very difficult.
* My wife is pro-mental health treatment BUT when it comes to actually go herself - she exceptionally against going. She says it's too difficult and there is no proven therapy to treat ED.

My current situation deals with a conversation that led to an argument tonight. We were making a grocery shopping list and I went first to add to our shopping cart. My wife always makes me go first b/c she says her going first is a trigger. She quickly skimmed the cart and said that in the past I have told her that she needs to order more because it's not enough for the whole week. She stated that I need to add more food. She then criticized me for being too black/white when on a diet. My wife currently knows that I am not eating healthily and I do not exercise. I need to change that.. I have very high blood pressure and I am not healthy. We got further into our argument when I told her that I simply can't trade my health for hers anymore. I have to take care of myself and eat healthy/good foods. This caused her to spiral as there is materials and such on good vs. bad foods, and that by me labeling good food triggers her. I understand what she is saying and she is right. I am a Black/White person. When I get dedicated to something it's a super discipline. 

The issue that I am having is - How do I diet, care for myself, and take my health seriously without triggering her? I tried to ask her and she just says I don't know. Can anyone help me dig into this and help me and her at the same time?

Thanks,

As a child I was fairly fit, I played outside, didn‚Äôt eat often as I do now, and was pretty normal, atleast that‚Äôs what I thought. When the third grade fitness exam came around I noticed I was bigger than the rest of the girls in my grade and was fatshamed for it. I started shutting myself in, isolating myself, whenever I was fed by my grandmother I would eat fast just to go back into my bedroom for hours. I didn‚Äôt go outside and get exercise besides the daily PE class. As I got older my doctors told my grandmother 64F and mother 40F I was obese and they started forcing me to exercise.I was forced on the treadmill which i hated and so I started sneaking poptarts to the garage where the treadmill was just for comfort. When they found out I was sneaking poptarts in, they got extremely upset and ridiculed me. This started this trend in my family to call me fat and lazy and my siblings and relatives joined in. To cope with this I started eating in my bedroom to avoid them and sleeping in. I hate exercising because all I would hear is them calling me fat. During the pandemic I would make myself puke but it got exhausting to continue so I replaced that habit with sleeping. Highschool made it worse cause nobody wanted to date ‚Äúthe fat girl‚Äù and although I was desired it was only for sex or secretly. One occasion my mother asked the doctor if she could put me on pills to supress my appitite or a worm that would eat the food I ate once digested. I always tend to eat alot when I‚Äôm bored as well. 

I honestly don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs an eating disorder or if its just me being lazy. There are more examples on what my grandma and mom did to me but these are the ones in mind:

- Grandmother and mom kept feeding me unhealthy junk like burgers and pizza, yet restricted me from candy.
- Multiple occasions my mom shamed me in public for asking for candy.
- Forced me to exercise until I met the desired time.

Sometimes I enjoy exercising but when its on my own terms and not on anybody elses.
I‚Äôve tried to only eat salads and while I enjoy salads it just isn‚Äôt enough.

So am I lazy or do I have an ED?",1676320779.0

My husband (31M) and I (25F) have been together for 6 1/2 years. He has a number of physical and mental concerns I don‚Äôt need to get into here, but I will say he sees a spine doctor twice a week and a therapist twice a month with no end in sight. We don‚Äôt have a high food budget. It‚Äôs comfortable, but we can‚Äôt afford to go out to eat more than once or twice a month (meaning fast food or ordering to-go). If we could afford it and it was up to him, we‚Äôd go out a few times a week. 

I‚Äôll lead with the fact that I don‚Äôt mind cooking for him. I don‚Äôt mind meal prepping or needing to cook every meal. 

His issues with food have to do with childhood trauma and texture. For example, a comedy bit he used to explain it to me was someone‚Äôs mom making a popular fast food burger ‚Äújust like the restaurant‚Äù but it turned out to be a wad of half cooked ground beef with white bread. That‚Äôs kind of how he was raised. He will almost never eat generic brand anything because he can tell the texture and flavor are a little bit off. He doesn‚Äôt microwave cook anything. He doesn‚Äôt eat casserole-type dishes. He always needs something crunchy with the meal‚Äîlike chips or crackers. 

One of the biggest issues is him needing to eat almost as soon as he wakes up. We‚Äôll have a fruit smoothie in the mornings, but it‚Äôs not enough. When he gets hungry, his whole body hurts and he will sometimes dry heave. His anxiety kicks in and I can‚Äôt get out of him what he wants to eat. I don‚Äôt mind cooking whatever he needs but if I just make something, it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs never the right thing. On top of it, I‚Äôm pregnant and now I‚Äôm having food aversions, so it‚Äôs just a little overwhelming. 

I need help finding how to support him better so he can just grab something, eat, and move on. Eventually it would be nice if he could incorporate more veggies and whole grains because right now he‚Äôs not eating any. I know it‚Äôs not that easy, but anything will help at this point. He says he doesn‚Äôt want to make me do things but no matter how much I tell him I want to help, he thinks the worst.

A few moments ago, I had the worst feeling and I had a bit of a mental breakdown. I felt so emotionally awful and emotionally claustrophobic if that makes sense. The ‚Äúemotional nausea‚Äù was so bad I tried to make myself feel better by making myself vomit. It worked and it felt really good. 

To be fair I also felt a little sick because I ate a bit too much sugary foods on an empty stomach this morning. And no I don‚Äôt have an eating disorder at the moment, but I am a recovered anorexic.

I was recovered for like 2 years. I just realized today I am definitely in a relapse and have been since at least December. I was using my health issues (causing disinterest in food) as an excuse. They're only part of the picture. The reality is, I'm not fighting it, and on some level I want this again. I'm not even sure if recovery is something I want right now. I'm pro-recovery, obviously, or I wouldn't have committed to it in the first place. But now my commitment is wavering. 

I'm going to talk to a dietician again hopefully since that helped last time, and go to therapy. 

But how do you even make yourself want recovery again? How do you not feel like you've lost all your progress?

 I don't even know what I want. I want to not die anytime soon, I don't want to feel sick or damage my body, but I don't want to recover right now, really. Maybe part of me does but the rest of me doesn't. 

I'm not even depressed, and I feel semi-okay in my body. I just don't feel like I deserve food and I don't really want it right now and I think my life would be easier if I was skinnier. I'm feeling very similar to how I felt when I started the spiral into an eating disorder the first time around like 10 years ago. I am a bit scared though--I was healthier back then. Now I have a bunch of health issues. I'm not sure what this relapse will mean in my new context, and that's scary.

She was also addicted to speed and prescription opiates. I was 13 and was my sister's main support as my parents just pretended nothing was happening. My I stopped her killing herself several times, slept in her bed every night to make sure her heart didn't stop and had to deal with her off her head on various substances and behaving in a manic way (cooking really weird stuff, writing on the walls, randomly screaming etc). When I was 17 I lost a friend to an eating disorder too. I also have experience from an old housemate and a few friends who have eating disorders.

I met my friend, S, 4 years ago and we were instantly inseparable. I was bridesmaid at her wedding last year, I went on a road trip with her to get the ring when she proposed and I was the first person she told thay she was going to propose. We trained as nurses together and generally have been through a lot.

Last year was the worst year of my life. Among various things, I found out I can't have children, I had a cancer scare, I was scammed out of ¬£5k and I found out my partner was having an affair. That is only a few of the things that happened! I've been horrifically depressed and only barely coping. S is aware and has sort of kept her distance. She cheated on her husband and i think feels very attacked when j talk about my partner cheating on me (it was very different, won't go into why). I had asked S if I could live with her for a bit while I looked for somewhere else to live when things were bad with my partner and she just laughed and said no because I'm too messy (she is trying for a baby and keeps saying it's great I live so close because she'll always have free childcare) I'm not the best at opening up about stuff from having to care for people so much I'm used to my problems being irrelevant and I've just generally not talked about stuff, but she knows my whole history. I'm going through a rough time, but my eating disorder has been mostly under control luckily.

She has started to restrict to ridiculously low and obsessively calorie counting except one day a week when she binges. We're both nurses so really active at work and she walks her dog everyday too. She did once tell me that she was on the verge of an ED but found being vegan allowed her to get better before things got serious. She was sick this morning and had to miss work because it was her cheat day and she over did it. I said she's better off just doing a sensible diet and I'd have to restrict even lower as I'm a lot shorter than her. She said fine I just won't talk to you about it anymore then.

She then went for dinner with her sister. I have seen people on reddit say they've cut people off before and I've always figured I couldn't do that because my instinct is always to care for people and want to be there. But she's said she won't talk to me about it anyway and I can't do this all over again when I'm on the edge anyway. I just can't.

i'm sorry if this comes across as awkwardly written. i just really feel like i needed to talk to someone or get this out and i don't think i can tell people i know in real life yet.  i even made this account specifically for this so i hope it's all okay. 
so i'm 21, and a university student (my degree means often standing up in front of people and being on a stage, which has become a big problem for me.)

i've never really been a confident person but it got really quite bad last summer (i won't go into details but i was just very unhappy and very insecure.) after that, i started trying to eat less and eat more healthy meals. i also started walking my dog to try to help me feel like i was doing more. my family members told me since that i have lost a lot of weight but i can't tell myself, i look at myself and i'm scared i've actually put on. (this might be down to body dysmorphia which has been really affecting me for a while now.)

i used to eat more such as snacks or breakfast during the day, but i've almost completely stopped anything aside from one meal (that i can't not eat since my mum usually cooks for me) and a small snack like a piece of fruit or a couple of like m&m style candies. i've also fallen into checking parts of the internet (like twitter) that have people talking about eating disorders and this usually makes me feel worse or feel more spurred on to do these kinds of things. i just feel like i want to eat nothing and feel horrible when i do, i often feel like i should throw up when i've eaten something i ""don't need"" and i have tried multiple times, but i get scared (of damaging my voice or my teeth, of someone hearing or seeing or smelling, or just because throwing up isn't nice). i've only actually done it twice but very small amounts. i'm convinced i won't let it become a habit, and if i had more self control it wouldn't need to happen at all.  

something that makes me sad is that i started walking my dog for fun and because i love her. but now i do it twice daily, and i choose routes that don't make sense just to make it longer, and have a minimum number of steps that i need to do in my head. and i feel terrible if i don't do this. 

i just find it hard these days to think of anything else, and i'm in a really stressful time of university and i'm just scared that i'm going to sacrifice my performance in classes because of it, and it can't even feel valid because i can't tell anyone in real life. i just think of it when i'm alone, with people, going to sleep, waking up, in the car, watching tv, listening to music. everywhere. and it's terrible to have to stand up in front of people in classes and Want to look like anyone else on earth. 

sometimes i think i'm fine. i can forget about it. but it comes back every time and comes back worse. and i don't want to be sick, i don't even feel like i'm in the space to call myself sick or say i have a problem. because i know right now, i don't look like i should have this problem. and the fact that i don't scares me into thinking that im making it up or appropriating someone else's serious problem. because i'm scared that the exercising or the lack of eating isn't enough for me to qualify for these problems either, like i should be pushing myself even further. i just wish i could make faster progress (or feel like im making it at all), as sick as that sounds. i just want to enjoy things i always loved and not connect the most random things to wanting to look different and feel different. the anxiety it's causing me is just so hard to deal with. and when i live the same for like a week, and it feels normal, i feel like im doing something wrong and need to ramp it up somehow because i feel like im not trying hard enough. i'm just scaring myself. 

i have a really understanding mum and family. and i have some good online friends i could tell, but i don't want anyone to think of me differently. i'm still me. i don't want them to think i'm fragile or pity me. and i also i don't want to stop doing what i'm doing. i want to keep going. i feel like i haven't even done enough yet to qualify getting any help. and i don't want to stop yet. i want to lose weight and feel differently so bad it might kill me. but i feel so embarrassed of myself even saying that. sometimes i just feel like there's no point in any of this and i'm too old to be feeling this way. i just wish i'd been born as a different person. 

anyway. i'm sorry if that sounded dramatic or too heavy. i guess i'm just trying to figure out if i really have a problem worth noting. or if i'm making it up. i guess i just want to feel normal or feel like someone knows, even if it's a stranger. i just wanted to talk about it for the first time ever.

All from my parents. No one else. I get it, they worry. I get it. But telling me what to have and watching me have it, making me show you it? Peering into my cup to check if it's full?

They don't do it when I'm genuinely struggling because they don't know because I am now able to help myself. But when I weigh perfectly healthy! When I eat probably more than the average person! When I am seriously fine! Oh nope, you're trying to sabotage your diet, you're looking soooo thin, so pale, yup yup two cups of milk and extra of everything a day will fix this.

I dont like feeling full. I think at the end of each meal 2/3 full is fine. You feel energised, satisfied and not sluggish. I don't need to eat SO much to live, to enjoy living - you don't enjoy food when you're full. I mean if you're gonna force me at least give me healthy stuff instead of unhealthy! Funny thing is my dad has diabetes T2.

Yeah when I was underweight and hating myself and really sick. You don't need medicine when you are not ill. That's harmful. And the more they make me eat the more I avoid food elsewhere. Isn't it contradicting?

I don't know what to do. I have been actually cutting back on other stuff now because I feel too full. I can't talk to my parents about it and no they don't open my mouth wide and stuff food in there, but I can't say no or argue much. It doesn't work and I can't do it. Any advice?

379,Med changes for bulimia?,6,10yh067,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10yh067/med_changes_for_bulimia/,9,"Sorry in advance for the long post...

I started seeing a new psychiatrist in December and she also specialises in eating disorders. I didn't go to her specifically for my bulimia, but figured it was a nice perk. 
In our first session, I told her all the meds I was on, which included Olanzapine (10mg) and Mirtazapine (45mg), which had been recently increased during my last inpatient admission last year. I also gave a general history of what I have been diagnosed with, which is when I mentioned the bulimia.

She asked me if I was a smoker (which I am) and how much do I smoke. When I told her she said that when someone is smoking as much as I do, it basically nullifies any therapeutic benefits of Olanzapine only leaving me with the side effects which include weight gain and increased appetite. So she gave me a plan for the following 3 weeks to come off it.
She also wanted me to start using Recovery Record again (eating disorder logging app) and link her to my profile so she can see how I am going, since she was concerned about how often I said I was binging and purging. Which was no problem for me since I already am logging everything on Lose It anyway. (I've actually been finding it interesting/helpful being able to log my moods, thoughts, behaviours, and urges as well).

During our second appointment on the 27.01, she said that she knew from what I had explained during the last appointment that the bulimia was a significant issue, but she didn't realise how bad it actually is. That everytime she reviews her patient's on Recovery Record, I am always at the top of her list and always in the red. She asked me again if I would consider another eating disorder admission (first/last time I did an ED admission was in 2016) and I told her no.

She then said that she wants to take me off Mirtazapine as soon as possible. That because it significantly increases appetite and weight gain, that it was making everything even worse (apparently vets use Mirtazapine on animals that need to gain weight for various reasons, including due to cancer... which blew my mind!). That even though the CPTSD is the primary issue, that the binging and purging was making my anxiety and depression symptoms worse, which then feeds into the eating disorder, and it's just a vicious cycle. Her hope is that by coming off the Mirtazapine and starting a new medication, it will help with one piece of the puzzel. She explained that it wasn't going to get rid of the eating disorder, but maybe if I am not having as often and stronge urges to binge, that I won't be purging as much as I do.
She actually seemed a bit frustrated that I was not only put on these medications in the first place, but that they increased my doses during my last admission since I have a history of eating disorders.

SO (lot of background for this one question, sorry), she instead wants to put me on Vyvanse. She said that it's an ADHD medication (which my psychologist is very interested in me trying because she thinks I have ADD), but it has been used to help manage Binge Eating Disorder. Since I am binging, it should help with these symptoms.

Has anyone been put on Vyvanse to combat bulimia/BED? Have you found it helpful or not? I did a quick google and it does say it has been used for binge eating disorder but am curious to hear other's anecdotal evidence. 

If you made it to the end... I am impressed haha thank you",1676006061.0

I never eat breakfast, and I often just have a snack during the day. The only real meal I eat is dinner.

And with dinner, I can't eat things that have certain textures or smells. So I learnt how to cook just in case someone makes something that I don't like, so that I can make my own dinner.

Recently I moved into University, and where I'm staying they make meals for you, and you get to choose from about three options for each meal. Everything that they had, I couldn't stand to eat (other than plain rice), and sometimes I would just not eat or eat a very small amount because I could smell the other foods and they were destroying my appetite.

Thankfully now that I've told the staff about this, they're moving me into an area where I can cook for myself.

I, 36F, have been friends with J, 40F, for 17 years. I used to consider him my best friend‚Ä¶ until he said that he had anorexia. He knows I have it, and he knows I‚Äôve gotten down to XX pounds. He weighs around XXX, and he thinks that he has anorexia (‚Äúatypical‚Äù?!) because his therapist told him that. Not a doctor, not a diagnosing person. Just his therapist‚Ä¶ because what happened is that his wife called him fat and said other rude things and then left him. Well, he had a series of panic attacks, and he related them to food. I, uh, am kind of ashamed of this, but I refuted the diagnosis for him. (I have an associates in human services and had to study a lot of psychology.)  I dumbed it down, like, ‚Äúhey, all that happened was that you were afraid of food because your wife called you rude stuff‚Äù. He then said something like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you think that could have been a trigger to set it off?‚Äù. I said something sarcastic, and then he claimed to have a work meeting. Twenty minutes goes by, and he comes back. Doesn‚Äôt even address my comment or the issue. He straight-up said that we should leave his marital issues out of it and that he and I were ‚Äúedging‚Äù on an emotional affair. Uh, so, after that, I told him not to talk to me.

I say all this because‚Ä¶ when it comes to trigger points, yeah. I can see how something his wife said could have set him off; however, he was on the same token talking about how he didn‚Äôt want to make the effort to lose weight. That‚Äôs not anorexia (unless it‚Äôs recovery?). He‚Äôd started the whole talk by telling me about the movie ‚ÄúThe Whale‚Äù, and he wanted to know about other Ed stories.

Before this, I had no problem with non-Vegan food and ate processed food regularly, even ate fast-food too, but now I am really focused on eating whole / unprocessed food and non-Vegan food.

It's getting to a really unhealthy point and I've lost a lot of weight (genuinely without trying to) and i'm wondering if it's because of the diet? I do track macros / calories and the nutrients / calories are exactly the same as when I wasn't vegan but I have rapidly lost weight.

My gf has had ED for about 5.5 years now and she has gone from B/P-ing 6-8 times per week to about once or twice a month. She even held out with 0 B/P for three months!

I really try to do everything by my research, while also staying true to myself (not sounding fake or forced). 

How can I support her when she does relapse though? I feel so saddened and hurt when she does 'slip' but at the same time, it hurts a lot less from when it was really bad because she has gotten a lot better. 

Ive been talking about therapy but its been hard to find a faith-based ED therapist (we're both Christian). Not saying thats the only option but I do think that it would be helpful to talk about this with someone who also understands our spiritual background.",1675889312.0

i have really bad anxiety and one of the main symptoms i get are super bad stomach aches but they never make me throw up usually but apparently today was different.

i was already having a bad day, i‚Äôve been stressed out because a lot is happening in the next few weeks and i don‚Äôt cope with change all too well but i thought i was feeling better until all of a sudden i had to rush to the toilet and throw up. i felt really gross after i did it but then i felt a lot better. i‚Äôm at home now and i feel really uneasy about all of it.

i‚Äôve been eating less and less the past few weeks anyway because eating food makes me feel really guilty and it feels like this is a sign of how it could become. the more i think about it, those intrusive thoughts that say i‚Äôm disgusting are telling me to do it again as if it would make me feel better and i‚Äôm scared maybe it would make me feel better.

i‚Äôve been in a bad headspace for a very very long time now and i feel like every time i get upset im going to want to throw up from now on to feel less guilty about my weight and eating habits.

424,I binged...,0,10vxoa0,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10vxoa0/i_binged/,2,"Apologies ahead of time if this is TL;DR. I'm hoping someone will read this and have some insight. Something. Anything.

I had a doctor appointment yesterday that I'd been putting off because I knew I wouldn't hear anything good. I have type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. I'm on meds for all three. I'm able to keep these conditions under control when I'm able to maintain a healthy diet and exercise regularly. My problem is that for the last ten years, I've been unable to maintain a healthy diet and regular exercise routine consistently. At some point, I always fall off when I stop seeing progress (e,g., weight-loss, strength gains, endurance gains, etc). I get frustrated and lose the will to continue. I give up. It's actually a pattern similar to addictions I've battled.

Anyway, the goal with my doctor has always been to get off the meds and that would be possible, if I could maintain the healthy diet and exercise. So I have a strong reason to eat healthy and exercise regularly. Even before I'm going in, I'm feeling frustrated, stressed, and sad. I listen to my doctor reading off the lab results from my blood work and it's as expected. This pattern too has repeated itself between my doctor and I. One visit my lab results are great and I'm on the right track, the next visit the exact opposite. Up and then down.

On the drive home, I had thoughts of rolling through a Wendy's drive up and buying some comfort food, but kept driving. Then had thoughts of stopping at the grocery store for a tub of ice cream, but kept driving. I got home and immediately was in the kitchen, foraging. I tried fighting this for a while. I forced myself out of the kitchen, only to find myself wandering back in a few minutes later. Rinse, repeat a few more times. Fortunately in a recent grocery shopping trip I was focused on buying mostly healthy foods. I didn't have the pizzas, pastas, mac and cheese, instant mashed potatoes, and the other types of bad foods I normally would have stocked. I did however manage to make a black bean and cheese burrito with onions, ate a whole 8oz bag of Biena Habanero chickpeas, and also a few pieces of home made chicken jerky. After sll that I did manage to stop myself from going back to get more food.

I guess the plus side to this, is I do now recognize some of my triggers. I also recognize that while I was eating, I knew I was eating to sooth myself and I justified it. Even though while it was happening, I knew I would feel like crap afterwards, and I knew it wasn't good for my health. So again, I'm posting this in the hopes that someone else might recognize some similarities and could provide insight or advice. Words of wisdom. Words of encouragement. Something. Anything.

425,I think my ED might be encouraging my gf into disordered behaviors,1,10vx3vf,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10vx3vf/i_think_my_ed_might_be_encouraging_my_gf_into/,0,"So basically the title. I usually fast/restrict a lot but have been under a lot of stress and lately I've had several episodes of b/p. She worries a lot about it and she has known I restrict for a long time, but she just found out about the binging and purging lately.

She has struggled with body image issues her whole life and she's told me in the past she fasted sometimes and ate less so she dropped a lot of weight and she was underweight. She never had an ED and is currently at a normal weight, she eats whatever she wants and she stops eating when she feels full.

Lately however, I'm afraid she is skipping meals/somewhat restricting.

Yesterday I made her pancakes for breakfast, she didn't even eat one of them. At lunch time, she didn't even eat 1/4 of her plate and had a couple croissants for a snack.
So at dinner time she said she wasn't hungry and wasn't gonna eat, I offered to cook something for her or for her to eat the pancakes she left but she kept telling me she didn't want anything and she was full. I knew this was a lie since I know she barely ate. She ended up telling me to cook some bacon for her and then, after eating it, she told me she wanted some more and ended up eating a normal dinner. Which made me realize, she was actually hungry, she was just trying not to eat. She also said some things which are worrying like, she had a craving for bacon for a couple of days and she said that it's too bad that it has so many calories.  
I count my calories religiously so I'm also scared she said that because I do it.

I'm really worried about her, I don't want her to develop an ED like me and I know this shit is contagious and specially since she has those body image issues.

I don't know what to do, she tells me I always blame myself too much but I want her to be alright and feel really bad thinking it's all because of me. Also, I'm scared that this will make my own ed worse too or getting competitive about it. What can I do to avoid her developing an ED because of me?",1675759722.0

I broke my 3 year long streak of being clean from sh, I had to move away from my only friends, my mom doesn‚Äôt really accept me for who I am, and every day I‚Äôm reminded of how ‚Äúskinny‚Äù I am or how ‚ÄúI need to eat more‚Äù. Ive heard those comments ever since I was old enough to come to family is led to me hating eating in front of anyone no matter who they are, when I have to eat in public I force myself to eat everything to appear ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, then I either throw up a little, and end up drinking tons of water bc I feel dehydrated all the damn time now, and I‚Äôm always exercising because I‚Äôm so self conscious of my weight, I‚Äôm always thinking about it. I stare at myself in the mirror for minutes to literal hours and hate myself so much. I‚Äôve lost a significant amount of weight when I‚Äôm already underweight, and my mom is starting to notice I‚Äôm skinnier too. I can‚Äôt handle the thought that I could have an ED again, and I need to tell her so I can get help. How can I make her believe me? I‚Äôm so scared to even tell her because i just know that she‚Äôs gonna wanna refuse to believe it. I just can‚Äôt keep this to myself anymore. I seriously want and need help for this, because i know I cannot keep living like this. I also want to at least know if I‚Äôm diagnosable or not so I can have some closure, even just a little bit. Please help.",1675743098.0

I started throwing up when I was twelve years old. And it wasn't for a reason like I thought I was fat or something like that. It was because my Nana kept taking my phone away, so I would steal it back from her hiding places and hide in the bathroom to text my friends. She and my aunt came to the conclusion that I was in there throwing up. Don't know how or why but
they were positive that's what I was doing, no matter how much I denied it and no matter their lack of evidence. It got to the point where they were confronting me all the time, refusing to let me go to the bathroom alone, trying to get me into eating disorder therapy. Finally I just said to myself, ""fine. If they think I'm throwing up and won't believe anything otherwise and won't stop harassing me about it, I might as well start doing it so I'm not accused of something I'm not doing"". And that's where it actually began for me. 

The more I did it the more it became like a sort of addiction. It was the only thing I had any control over at all in my life. If I was angry I could go throw up. Stressed? Throw up. Depressed? Throw up. It became my solution to everything. I would stop here and there but always start back up. I lost weight drastically. By the time I was sixteen
years old I was extremely underweight. I looked at my bulimia as a friend in a way. A friend that I knew I shouldn't be hanging out with but always got me through whatever bad things were happening in my life at the time. 

Eventually my family got together and sent
me to a home for troubled girls. It was impossible for me to continue my bulimia there because I was
monitored CONSTANTLY. I also wasn't allowed to go to the bathroom for an allotted period of time after meals so usually by the time I was able to make it to the bathroom the food was already digested and unable to vomit back up. I also learned other coping skills to deal with my mental health issues besides throwing up. I finally was able to exit my program after two years at eighteen years old and I felt I was completely cured of my bulimia. 

I got pregnant shortly afterwards within an
abusive relationship, got pregnant a second time when my first born was a year old, and eventually a year after that I made it out of that abusive relationship with my kids father. All that time, I never threw up once.

 I have a new boyfriend now and he's wonderful. He tells me how beautiful I am and how much he loves me and loves my body. He treats my children as his own, and they even call him daddy. We are moving into our own place tomorrow after a year of dating. I have only told one of my best friends this but I have started throwing up again for the past two months. And it's not a control issue, it is because of my weight this time. I feel strange for restarting my bulimia over my weight when it was never about weight before. My body is no longer what it used to be. I look in the
mirror and am disgusted with my stomach and my
neck. I no longer look at my beach bikini pictures with pride of my body like I used to, but now shame and disgust at my cellulite and stomach rolls. I feel like my boyfriend deserves a thin beautiful toned woman, not a short chubby girl who doesn't have the time to work out because of raising a 4 year old and 2 year old. I am constantly comparing myself to other women, both mothers and those who aren't mothers. Everyone looks
better than me. 

I know I am slipping into a hole that will be impossible to climb out of without help. I keep telling myself I'Il stop when I'm back down to the weight I prefer. But I am afraid that I won't stop and I'll keep throwing up in order to maintain that weight. Please help me, anyone.",1675726541.0

I guess that isn‚Äôt exactly true, I do have quite a bit of insight into my situation and how it relates to the overall trajectory of my life and now what seems to be an ED.

As a child, I was heavy, definitely the heaviest in my class at school and despite being popular with lots of friends, was constantly teased because of my weight. I was the one kid wearing his shirt in the pool, or in the ocean, I never wanted to play in pickup games when skins v shirts was an option. I especially hated gym class when a multitude of uncomfortable situations were possible.

The summer before High School, I had a growth spurt and lost a ton of weight and obviously felt much better about myself. This was the first time I remember feeling the reward of controlling my weight and being accepted as a result.

Unfortunately, I developed a taste for illegal substances in my later teen years and started putting back on the weight I had lost. The end result was that I spent all of my 20s and the majority of my 30s as overweight, or obese. But I didn‚Äôt seem to care, ate whatever I wanted and had few instances where I even gave it a single thought.

Well, when Covid hit, I was trapped in one of the biggest cities in America, my routines were stopped and I blew up. I stayed that way until last March, when I had enough and decided I needed to make a change. 

What began as an honest attempt to correct my health, prevent diabetes, and feel better about myself somehow morphed into a full blown ED.

I don‚Äôt want to violate any rules of this sub, so I‚Äôm not sure how specific to be, but I used extreme dieting/restriction/exercise to lose a tremendous tremendous amount of weight. Every time I hit my goal, I moved the goal posts and told myself I was the healthiest I‚Äôve ever been, why not a bit more?

Well, now here I am, 12 months later, still employing these extreme measures, now classified as underweight, I look horrible and sick and I can‚Äôt stop. 

I have almost no education on EDs in general, but I vacillate between restriction, and then short periods where I indulge in whatever I want (binge) and then go back to severe restriction.

I am at a point where I don‚Äôt have any lower to go, I am at the floor, in the basement actually. But I still can‚Äôt allow myself stop because I‚Äôm terrified it will all come back.

She doesn't exercice she does nothing and yeah it's hard because I'm here struggling to lose weight even tho I'm starving all day ...

As a small kid, I was very picky and vomited without inducing various times each month. My teachers and relatives tried to make me eat, but I always refused or they forced me and I vomited. They tried it for YEARS without sucess, so they all just gave up so I could at least eat something.

In middle school (keep in mind I'm not from US). I've eat only noodles or bread daily. Yes, I had the condition to eat more than that, don't worry, I just didn't eat because I didn't felt like eating or was not hungry enough. In one part of middle school and high school I was in a school that I was 7 am but got there 6am and got out 5pm, got home almost 6pm. I didn't ate before going and I refused to eat all three meals they offered. In some days, almost never, can count in hands, brought a cookie to eat. Sometimes I gave it away, sometimes I ate only half. I got nausea and gagged when people ate around me, because of the smell of the food, because of the sight of someone eating, because of the vision of the fork moving in the disgusting food. It makes me sick. My mom didn't let me use the stove, so I couldn't make food for myself, either. However, I never wanted to cook, what would I make anyway?

I'm still very picky. I still gag and want to vomit when people eat or when there's food around me. I ate a bit more and not only noodles and bread, even though bread is still my ""main food"". 

Last year one of my teachers asked me about it, because pretty much all my school staff knows I have problems with food. I told her. She said that she is like that too. That she has an eating disorder. I have anxiety so that is stuck in my mind. 

I don't have problems with my body, weight, face, hair and/or clothes. Yeah, some very small insecurities that go away very fast, but I don't really care about it.

now i can't eat, literally. when i'm at my friends house they give me a plate with food but everything looks disgusting. i have to force myself to eat. and everyone has said i'm thinner and i like it, but i like that i can't eat too much. i have something to blame, that i'm a 'picky eater' because i am, but also because i don't wanna be big anymore but i also want to have a good relationship with food.
if anyone had or has the same problem i would be very happy if you could give me some tips on how i can have a good relationship with food and not overeat or not eat at all. much love to everyone.",1675610994.0

So I‚Äôm 30 now but I‚Äôve had a long history with eating disorders since my teens. I have other mental health conditions.

About 5 years ago, I stopped all my psych meds and started losing weight like crazy. I became very underweight. I even got scurvy. 
My psychiatrist put me on medications that would increase my appetite and cause weight gain.

5 years later, I was complaining to my psychiatrist about the weight gain and felt I was obese even though technically I was a healthy weight. 
I wanted to lose weight and the medication was making binge eat and feel out of control. My psych took me off of them. 

Fast forward a couple of months and I‚Äôve lost about half the weight that I gained. I have little to no appetite and fear I won‚Äôt be able to stop losing weight.
I‚Äôm scared because I started a new job and don‚Äôt want to lose it from being anorexic. 

Do you have any suggestions of what I can do? 

At the same time I know I‚Äôve been diagnosed with anorexia by doctors and I know I‚Äôve had past behaviors, but when I‚Äôm not on those psych meds that increase appetite, I‚Äôm just not hungry and lose weight without trying. So is this even anorexia?

All the junk you could imagine. even if i wasn‚Äôt necessarily hungry, if i know there is a pack of oreos in the pantry it wont last until tomorrow. i know that extreme hunger is normal and i‚Äôve gone through it a few times now and know what it feels like. my issue is that it just feels more like binging now. like i use ‚Äúextreme hunger‚Äù as an excuse to hust binge. i eat even though im not even really hungry. sometimes i just cant get food out of my head and cant sit still if i haven‚Äôt eaten it. i feel really gross about this. 
im scared i‚Äôll develop BED. 
is it normal for ‚Äúextreme hunger‚Äù to last this long even if i haven‚Äôt restricted too long. ?considering this was a pretty short denial period compared to when i first developed anorexia, where i restricted for over a year.

She could literally die, but her parents aren't suggesting that she maybe take some time off from college and go in-patient? Or receive therapy or any treatment? She has a good relationship with them too, so I think it would be helpful if they tried something.

I feel guilty about it too because maybe I could be doing something. I feel very conflicted when I see her eating tons of food and knowing exactly what she's going to do after. The fact that I just know about it and aren't helping her at all feels wrong. But what can I do? I've already expressed to her that I think she should get help.

One main issue I have is my impatience. When I decide that I need to get serious and just lose the weight already, I make unrealistic diet plans.

I would only have to control my eating for a couple months to get to my goal, but I feel like I won't be able to. I can barely control myself for a day.

I also have this internal battle of enjoying undereating but also fearing for my health. It's like the ED part of me wants me to eat less, but my rational side knows it's bad. So it really just prevents me from dieting at all, and I often overeat and feel bad about it.

of course, i've put it all back on now and am again very overweight. i want to lose the weight again and lose it for good, and i know its not likely to last if i lose it unhealthily again. but every effort i make at the moment to lose weight seems to push me closer and closer to those habits. it doesnt help that my mothers only input on the matter is always ""just stop eating"" 

i just really cant seem to get a healthy relationship with food. it's one extreme or the other. either i spend all day getting stoned and eating enough for a family of 4, or i just dont eat at all. maybe it's a self control thing? idk...

When I was younger, like 14, I struggled with disordered eating until I left home to go study. (The thoughts were still there often, but I never really acted on them.) I was never underweight or diagnosed and feel like I am making this up or at least worse than it is, because most people struggle with eating at some point, right? Essentially, I feel like an impostor. 

Half a year ago or so it slowly crept in again and a few months ago it all came back worse and when I went home for Christmas I could see my weight had dropped to slightly less than my weight at 14 (which is ten years ago). I fucked up the semester and ended up not taking any exams. My thoughts were all over the place. 

I kind of set myself an ultimatum. Either I would go seek help with my issues or I needed to actually work on them on my own. Surprisingly, after figuring out I don't want to afford therapy right now, I still stuck to the ultimatum (probably thanks to telling a number of friends a very watered down version). 

So in the week I had off I took everything very slowly and cleaned my appartment and stuff like that and realised that I really needed to want to get back to normal.

And damn, I thought I was in control and could start eating normally whenever I wanted. But even though I felt (and still feel) like I was not that far gone, I had to learn that that actually wasn't the case. Still, during the last two weeks I slowly reintroduced myself to more food than in the past months and am eating nearly normal now I think? Perhaps? I can't tell anymore. 

My thoughts are so much better and it feels like it actually might be worth it. (On a logical level, I know that it is indeed worth it). But then there is the extra amount of money and time you have to spend on food, preparation and eating. And thoughts questioning whether I deserve this today and so on. And the bloating and cramps. Urgh.

Now I have an upcoming doctor's appointment where she wants to do blood work and get my weight to make sure I can continue on my meds. On the one hand, I really fear she might find out and hope that in the two weeks until then I ate enough fruit stuff for vitamins and so on (does that even show up in blood work?) and for my weight to not drop even further so she does not get suspicious. 

But on the other hand a sick part of me hopes my weight goes down even further so that I am finally underweight. I feel like I can say that my struggle has been real then. Again, logically I know this is stupid because it doesn't matter whether I will be weighing one or two kgs less, the struggle will be the same either way. 

I want to live again. I am on a good way right now. I don't want to let the dark thoughts win.",1675423935.0

495,Seeking advice to start recovery journey,1,10s919c,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10s919c/seeking_advice_to_start_recovery_journey/,0,"Hello everyone, I'm a 25yo female and I'm pretty sure I have a binge-eating disorder. I've always struggled with my weight from a young age, been on diets since I was around 8 or 9 years old, which I know a lot of other people with EDs went through as well. I've always been a little overweight for my height, but I was still a fairly healthy weight all throughout high school, which I was able to maintain because of my parents supervision and being an athlete in high school. 

Once I moved to college, things started to get worse for me with my weight and food. It was the first time I was able to eat whatever I wanted with no one to stop me so I gained a lot of weight over the school year, then I would lose it all again when I got home once I was back under my parents supervision again. Even when I lived with my parents, there were times when I would sneak unhealthy foods and eat in secret. Anytime I was unsupervised, I would take the opportunity to eat junk food. I never really was able to get any good habits with eating food because I would always make excuses like 'oh I'll just starve myself for the last month of school and drop all the weight', or 'it's fine I'll start my diet tomorrow'. But living on my own, I haven't been able to get into good habits with self-care or just food in general. 

Now that I live on my own after college, things have taken a turn for the worse. I've gained a lot of weight to the point where now I can't play the sport I used to play in high school, I can barely walk around for longer than 20 minutes and I'm starting to get back pain just from walking. I know that I'm sick, I know I need to lose weight, but I can't get myself into the right mindset to want to get better. It just feels too overwhelming and pointless. My parents are really worried about me and I don't want to go see friends or anything because I'm so ashamed and embarrassed of how I look.

I know the general steps of getting better: start eating healthier and exercise more. But I get discouraged really easily and end up eating junk because it makes me feel better. After eating junk food I feel ashamed and I hate myself, which just makes me want to eat more to get rid of that feeling. 

This isn't a super unique story, I know there are probably more people with similar situations like mine. I want to get better, but it feels so impossible, I just need someone to tell me that there is hope. I've considered therapy but I can't afford it, having just graduated with my master's.

My (20F) best friend (20F) told me about a month ago that she is having trouble eating. I won't go into details here about her difficulties since it's not my place to share. Since we don't live in the same city, it is hard for me to support here and be physically there for her. At the time, I reassured her that I am always happy to talk/listen to her, and after we called I sent her a document I compiled with resources for EDs in her city/university, some self help workbooks, and some insights I found from others who have experienced similar difficulties. She thanked me and told me she'd look into these. 

Fast forward to now, I just saw a video of her where she is now looking worryingly thinner, so I suspect that what she is trying isn't working, or she hasn't sought out help yet. For context, her uni doesn't offer counselling for EDs, and I think she is reluctant to get therapy externally because of the cost. She wouldn't ask her parents for money for therapy since they're the ones who caused many of these body image issues, and would probably congratulate her on looking so thin... It seems that GPs or hospitals won't intervene or offer support unless they consider it to be severe enough. The situation feels so helpless. 

When we called last month, she mentioned that there was someone in her life who would ask if she had eaten, reminded her to eat etc. and that she appreciated it, but now they don't talk anymore. I am scared if I do the same I will come off as nagging or pushy. I don't know how to bring it up with her that I noticed she has lost weight, or if I should bring it up at all.

I started smoking a lot and then started adderall and got arguably very underweight, although I didn't see myself that way. I would weigh myself all the time and had a tape measure to keep measurements and got very upset when it wasn't what I wanted.

I recounted everything and she said that's still not even the normal person amount and that I need to see a dietician.

I know I need to do something. I'm a aged 50's male. I'm overweight. Have type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol. For the last 10 years I have struggled to maintain a regimen of eating healthy and regular exercise. My pattern for the last 10 years has been similar to what I went through overcoming addictions to cigarettes, drugs, and alcohol. I will start exercising, eat healthy food choices, feel good, see progress losing weight, and losing inches. Eventually progress stalls/plateaus, I get frustrated, nothing I try to over come the block works, and then feel like a failure. I then go back to eating whatever I want. 

When I do eat, I do tend to eat way too much, and I do this quite often. After eating I sometimes want more food less than an hour later, in spite of feeling really full. The compulsion is really strong. I do sometimes think it's either because it was ingrained in me during childhood to eat as much as I want, whenever I wanted to. But also, I have felt it's driven by feelings of low self esteem. I did go through numerous traumas as a child. But I wasn't always overweight and unhealthy.

 I was always told that I was ""big for my age"". I was also always encouraged to eat as much as I could. The adults in my life seemed to take delight in watching me eat. I wasn't very athletic or excelled in sports, but also wasn't totally horrible either. I was bigger than most kids my age but my doctors always said my weight was within proportions to my height. I even look back at old pictures and don't see an over weight kid. But I was harassed regularly by other kids and my weight was one of many things chosen as a form of mockery. I think these things did contribute to the additiction problems later in life. 

I've always been a little self conscious and untrusting. I recent incident at a work retreat was a catalyst for me to really want to get over this, for good. I am seeking the help of mental health specialists. However, The earliest I can get in to be evaluated is the end of March. So in the meanwhile I'm trying to checkout any other\\ sources I can find on my own. I don't want to wait. I want to be past this so bad. I don't know how to shake this demon.

512,Rant.,8,10r2ai1,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10r2ai1/rant/,2,"I don‚Äôt know how to feel about this and I feel like typing it out might help me understand? I just want to clarify that I‚Äôm quoting my mom directly here, I‚Äôm not trying to be offensive, I love her a lot. 

My mom (40‚Äôs F) has always struggled with weight. Ever since I (16F) can remember, she‚Äôs talked about her issues with it. She‚Äôs on the ‚Äúbigger side‚Äù (again, quoting her) and always has been. 

Due to health issues, she‚Äôs unable to lose weight via exercise/diets, so for the past year or so, she‚Äôs planned surgery. I‚Äôm not sure exactly what it is, but it‚Äôll take some weight off. 

I‚Äôve always had body image issues. I can remember being 7-8 years old and hating my stomach, hating how big my thighs were, always sucking in when wearing tight clothes, never wearing shorts or skirts, wearing my dad‚Äôs 2XL shirts to hide my body completely. This only got worse as I got older. 

A few years ago, it really escalated. This was further stemmed from a friend who was very open about their ED experience (she would tell me she could see her ribs, she hadn‚Äôt eaten in days, she had an account on Twitter dedicated to it, she became visibly skinnier, etc). 

My mom, as much as I love her, doesn‚Äôt exactly help this. She‚Äôs constantly making comments about how lucky I am, about how someday I‚Äôll gain tons of weight (since it 
‚Äòruns in the family‚Äô), how when she loses weight she can wear ‚Äúskinny people clothes‚Äù, she can wear my clothes, how I‚Äôll never understand her struggle, etc. We went out of town to go shopping and she made so many comments about it, it brought the whole mood down. 

I went to a doctor about my issues a couple months ago but nothing has come of it. My mom knows about it but doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an eating disorder. She thinks every girl my age experiences this, that it‚Äôll pass, that I need to just ignore the thoughts. When I told her, she said something like ‚ÄúI already have enough stress in my life, don‚Äôt start not eating.‚Äù (This was after I told her I wasn‚Äôt eating for days at a time.) 

Now to present day; she told me a few days ago that she had finally booked her surgery. I‚Äôm over the moon for her, it‚Äôs something she‚Äôs wanted for a long time and I know it‚Äôs going to make her so much happier. But that night, every bad thought I‚Äôve ever had about food and body image came back and I ended up barely eating. 

I don‚Äôt know if it triggered me? If it‚Äôs just a touchy subject? I have no idea, but I feel so many different things. Why am I upset when she‚Äôs doing something that‚Äôs going to make her life easier? Am I jealous? Am I triggered?

some backstory: been struggling with body image issues since the third grade. in seventh grade was the first time i tried to stop eating but eventually failed. i‚Äôve always thought i was fat, in reality i have been, at times, more overweight than i should have been, i know what it feels like to weigh more than the other girls. in my sophomore year of high school my best friend developed anorexia, it was quite traumatizing for the both of us but i saw it worked and i stopped eating. i lost a lot of weight and became textbook eating disorder but once i hit my lowest weight i eventually gained it all back, and i never told anyone. 

during covid i worked a desk job and was at my heaviest. i felt disgusting. i decided to start going to the gym and eating better, i lost a healthy amount of weight and gained muscle mass. but i started school and ran out of time for the gym so i just started eating less. i‚Äôve lost much more weight since then. i don‚Äôt know how little or how much i‚Äôm eating. i block that out, i think. but i don‚Äôt feel like i have an eating disorder. yes i stopped eating so much but now i just don‚Äôt have an appetite and don‚Äôt care for eating. i won‚Äôt eat when i‚Äôm hungry quite often because i just don‚Äôt feel like eating. but i still eat, often making full meals and having at least one meal a day. i don‚Äôt feel anxious when i eat. i don‚Äôt feel distressed when i eat. 

but i still take pictures of myself on days where i feel particularly skinny, to relish the moment. i weigh myself often, and still get excited when the number goes down. i often look at photos of me i took when i was at my heaviest with shock. i won‚Äôt delete them as i view them as progress pictures. i do avoid food every once and a while. i‚Äôm not hungry most of the time and don‚Äôt feel like i‚Äôm engaging in disordered eating. but at the same time i feel hungry all the time and am always thinking about how i‚Äôm going to get through the day running on nothing. consciously i‚Äôm not thinking about food but unconsciously i think i might always be thinking about it. i am obsessive over my image, spending hundreds of dollars on skincare, makeup, body care, hair care, clothes and products, and i need to be the best out of all my girlfriends and girls in general.  i need to be perfect, but at the same time i don‚Äôt feel like i‚Äôm doing anything unhealthy, and technically, i‚Äôm at a healthy weight.",1675286665.0

I have health complications so it's a result of that and it's in large part due to food intolerances, nutrient deficiencies, and wasted muscle that I desperately want back. 

Anyway, the dietician took my weight and I was turned away at my request. Then she wrote it on a sticky note, perfectly visible on the front of my printed notes for the doctor, puts me in a room with the intake nurse and says ""and I put her weight right here"" so obviously I look down and see it and it haunts me throughout the entire appointment. The way it affected me was surprising and scary and extra triggering because of the mixture of sick twisted pride I thought would never resurface, mixed with utter fear at the realization that I'm not getting better.

For example;
1. Yesterday at lunch one of my colleagues commented on my lunch. Joking I made them feel bad with how healthy it was, and they wish they could eat that little and feel full like I do. 

2. I have gotten so many comments over the past few months congratulating me on my weight loss. When a friend asked me how I did it, and I said illness and stress, she responded with ‚Äúnow I just need to catch that illness‚Ä¶‚Äù

Even listing my old clothes on Facebook marketplace (stating that I am selling them as they no longer fit), I get the odd comment from someone telling me they wish they could go down instead of up a size.


It is so hard in recovery to remind yourself that it isn‚Äôt healthy when the world keeps congratulating you.

Unlike my coworker, I don‚Äôt want to eat like I currently do. I wish I still fit into my beautiful clothes. And I thoroughly hope my friend doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúcatch‚Äù my eating disorder.

I‚Äôve been really struggling silently behind the scenes with my body and my relationship to food. I can‚Äôt stand being full. I get nauseous at the very thought of food. I can usually only get myself to eat something once every 24-36 hours. I‚Äôve been having dizzy spells and have been struggling to concentrate at work. 

I just really desperately want to lose weight and my brain is telling me to do whatever it takes. 

A couple of my coworkers have said something along the lines of, ‚Äúwow she is such a good little worker, she doesn‚Äôt even take her lunch break!‚Äù 

That only weirdly validates me‚Ä¶

Now, I am not officially diagnosed with an ED but some friends in my life have recently pointed out some things in my behaviors that are pointing to disordered eating at the very least. I didn‚Äôt even consider it before then. Now I‚Äôm doing my research I suppose. 

My anxiety is starting to get the best of me and work is getting harder and harder for me to focus on. My job demands perfection and the workload is overwhelming at times even when you are *not* starving. I just can‚Äôt seem to stop. But I don‚Äôt want to get fired, and I don‚Äôt want to cause a scene by maybe passing out in the office. I cannot eat when I‚Äôm stressed out and being at work is currently stressing me out but I need money. Haha the spiral of life.

She doesn't seem to eat very much and has implied she doesn't like eating out because she feels like she can't control her diet there. She is really into calorie and nutrient counting which I suppose makes sense - its harder to get all the necessary nutrients when you're a vegetarian. She is certainly slim but I don't get any sense that she is currently physically unhealthy.

I feel kind of out of my depth because I don't understand. I guess I don't want her to feel nervous about eating around me and I don't want to be insensitive.

Additional context:

I‚Äôve drastically dropped in weight, and I didn‚Äôt worry but feel more and more happy with myself, because the pounds dropping on the scale satisfied me with my success, it made me feel like I was winning and I had control. However, this weight was not only fat but muscle mass as well. I became something called ‚Äúskinny fat‚Äù. And, losing muscle slows down your metabolism, so I‚Äôve had enough of losing weight. 

I still wasn‚Äôt happy with myself, even after losing 2 stone and obtaining my dream weight, a weight that I labelled as ‚Äúperfect‚Äù and told myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be happy once I get there‚Äù. But I wasn‚Äôt happy, I wanted to lose more weight. People started noticing my skeletal hands, pale skin and weak-looking figure. My mum told me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre skinnier than a model‚Äù and ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing on you, you‚Äôre getting so skinny‚Äù. I hid the fact that those comments made me feel better about myself. I didn‚Äôt want to tell anyone about my ED. But it all became too obvious. It got so bad I couldn‚Äôt even eat with friends. I avoided going outside. I refused to eat or I would pick lettuce over pizza. 

After many motivational recovery stories I read online I felt convinced to stop.

My mum brought me to the doctor as I lost my period and look underweight. and they told me I need to eat more carbs and calories. Thanks to this sub, I‚Äôve taken my first steps into recovery. I‚Äôve now started eating carbs guilt-free, less caring about added calories in sauces, and weighing myself less. I‚Äôm going to put on weight!

I have depression and anxiety among other things, and 10 years ago I began to completely lose my appetite and be unable to eat whenever I was under extra stress or extreme distress. Once the extra stress was gone, my appetite would return. Then, 5 years ago, after a time of extended and prolonged trauma, in which my appetite vanished, it simply never came back.

My type of depression is anhedonia, meaning I can't feel pleasure, enjoyment or interest in things. I am always bored and empty. I sleep all day. I haven't eaten in the day for years and if I try, I feel sick and it goes right through me within 30 minutes. I resent people who need to eat lunch. It feels so foreign to me. I feel like a robot who never needs food. My stomach never rumbles, gurgles or feels anything. It's like it is switched off and numb, like my ability to feel interest in anything.

When I used to lose my appetite directly from stress, I'd drop lots of weight very quickly (and I was already slim) as I couldn't eat at all and just survived by sipping juice and iced tea, but nowadays, the only reason I'm not underweight is  because I binge eat chocolate, donuts, cookies, and everything sugary and sweet every night about midnight. It's the time I feel less anxious and can just zone out and watch Netflix or something, and stuff myself with sugar.

Looking back, I then realised I've never eaten much during the day, and as a kid, I had issues eating breakfast and also lunch at school, due to anxiety. I could never finish my dinner either, though I could eat chocolate and cakes as my snacks after dinner, as again, at night time I was more relaxed.

# 

i self diagnose with orthorexia, after not being able to go out with friends anymore, losing friends and losing relationships with all of my family, plus not going out to eat with my family anymore and just developing a very elitist view on diet.

I saw a lot of stuff as toxic poison and I started to become a bit unhinged. I never reached out for help with it but I have other things in my life I was in therapy for like depression and anxiety. Plus some schizophrenic stuff. Thought I'd share I guess and wanted to know what you think of orthorexia, I grew up in America and basically saw the commercials of a starving african kid, I thought that it was my fault he was so thin and that the food I ate was causing his country to be very poor or full of slavery.

I still cant really do any of the stuff above but I've isolated myself in my room and not ate for a day and my mom noticed last year then brought me some canned soup, which I ate right away because I haven't not eaten for an entire day since I was a kid. I know that fasting is pretty good for people too but I dont think I was even drinking water. I got really paranoid about tap water and I think that's also orthorexia based, since I thought it wasn't healthy water.

What makes me feel safe is that there is some good food out there, that I would not be directly damaging a whole entire village and children from another area for eating. For example, I used to go pick chicken of the woods nearby my apartment in a kind of woodsy area and I ate that on the stove with some butter. Chicken of the woods is pretty good for you.

I even tried having a romantic relationship with someone that I had probably shouldn't have because I thought maybe doing so (for the first time in my life) could somehow help me out of my predicament. I didn't follow through on that because it seemed a little illogical.

I used to be so ambitious and hardworking and felt like my life was in my hands but this issue has honestly stymied me on every front.

Recently she‚Äôs laid off being too restrictive in her eating which makes sense since she reached her medical goal. The thing is, while she was on the diet i felt uneasy about it because it felt weird eating so much when she was eating so consciously and i also didn‚Äôt like the idea of her feeling like she had to lose weight. but now that it‚Äôs changed, i‚Äôve found myself really anxious and overly aware of all her eating habits. Like, if she goes to get seconds or if she has a lot of treat food etc, i just notice. in my head i‚Äôm thinking ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do it, you don‚Äôt need it you want it‚Äù and all those dirty ed thoughts. i‚Äôm not sure what it is or what to do with it but it annoys me because i‚Äôd hate it if someone was thinking about my choices like that. I want to mention that i‚Äôm certain she has no idea about this, and i don‚Äôt want her to know because i would hate her to be self-conscious about it. It‚Äôs also worth noting that, sure sue has a bit of extra fat on her but i‚Äôm sure she wouldn‚Äôt even be classed as over weight. she eats very healthily 80% of the time so i‚Äôd say she actually has a very balanced diet. i think what pains me is the idea of her gaining the weight back and being disappointed? i feel like i might be projecting my own feelings onto her?

anyway, TLDR: my (overall healthy) mum has a sweet tooth and i can‚Äôt stop my intrusive thoughts about her eating when i see her pick up some treat food.",1674962379.0
592,Do I Need Help?,2,10npa1p,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10npa1p/do_i_need_help/,4,"Hello everyone! I have recently joined Reddit in the search for a community just like this one. 

Apologies on the length‚Ä¶I hope someone reads.

I am 23F and I am wondering if I‚Äôm am struggling with an ED or if this is just disordered eating.  

I used to be athletic and played all the sports in high school and even some of college, but COVID-19 hit, I had to drop college, and thus dropped my normal rigorous training. I piled on pounds and quick- ballooning up to completely overweight when I was a muscular athletic build before. I had no ‚Äòproblematic‚Äô body image issues outside of very normal, non ED behavioral thoughts before the weight gain.

I had held onto that overweight range for the next 2.5 years, seemingly unable to make it budge.

Then my life changed for the worse in the summer of 2022. My 2+ year relationship with my partner started crumbling due to confirmed infidelity. I also switched jobs right around the same time. 

Now, my partner and I have lived together essentially ever since we had met, we have pets together, everything. I decided to give him a chance. He however, had a job opportunity to work out of state, and has been working out of state Mon-Fri for over 6 months now, and has no intention of quitting even though I‚Äôve begged. He is only home on the weekends.

During my time alone, I began struggling with paying all of the bills (as when he moved out of state, he started getting paid in cash and let his bank account close, so all bills were in my name and he also could not even send me money electronically because he only ever had cash). 

My food intake started going down slowly, just needing to save money and spend what little I had on the necessities. My animals always eat first. 

Then, my loneliness manifested into depression and anxiety on top of the stress of this new job. It‚Äôs a financial business and pays well, but it‚Äôs stressful and demands perfection. I also have to commute 65 miles one direction to even get there- 5 days a week. (saving to move closer to work)

I started having very negative thoughts and emotions towards my body. Every time I ate food I felt guilty- but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to purge it back up. 

I was too busy to start working out, so I downloaded a fasting app to keep track of how often I was eating- trying hard to make a 16 hour fasting window daily. 

I was barely seeing any progress- so did some research and found out about the calorie deficit needed to guarantee weight loss. I began running 5 days a week, never shorter than 3 miles but on average 4-7 miles per day. 

When I first started running, I was extremely hungry. My body was not used to that exercise on that smaller amount of food, so I started eating smaller meals 2x per day instead of one bigger meal.

But the guilt slowly continued to creep in. 
Now I am losing weight at a pretty fast rate- fast enough that people are starting to notice. I‚Äôm probably very close to if not within a healthy range for my height now, but I‚Äôm not done losing.

All my clothes are baggy, I‚Äôm constantly thinking about food but not eating it- and even if I do, only 2 bites goes by before I get queasy. 

I am prescribed anti-depressants, and my boyfriend does not think I have any issues, I just need to , ‚Äúrelax.‚Äù Gee- if only I had thought of that?

I just am really in my head now, and have never felt worse about myself. Not a minute goes by where I‚Äôm not thinking how stupid I was for eating my last meal- I love feeling empty. 

My focus is decreasing at work and I‚Äôm finding it hard to complete tasks and stay on top of things. 

My fasts are stretching to 24 hours+ but usually not too much longer in between, and the meal I choose is always under what I need in a day maybe even closer to under 1/4 of what I need to be more accurate. 

I had to pick up a second job on my nights alone to help with overdue bills, and being alone, I know I should eat, but I don‚Äôt. And I‚Äôm an adult so no one is watching me and no one is holding me accountable. Also not being underweight makes me slip by pretty easily. 

I can just start seeing this as a very slippery slope that I‚Äôm practically already sliding down. Last week, I had a 6 inch subway sandwich, first food in 24 hours. I ate it all, but immediately had to go take a trip to the bathroom. I didn‚Äôt even have to use my fingers, my thoughts were plenty. I purged about half of it up before I stopped, my chest tight with anxiety, guilt, anger, and sadness. 

Am I supposed to feel this way? Is this an ED? Is it just a weird ploy to get my partner to care and come home again? I‚Äôm not really sure. 

Thanks for your time- I appreciate anything or any advice you give. I‚Äôll try to answer any questions.",1674939270.0

They get severe panic attacks sometimes from the sight of food. This isn't the first person I've met who gets this anxious around food either and I've never known what to do.

Basically, the physical act of eating feels like a chore that I need to make constant effort to perform. I could be mildly hungry, but I won‚Äôt eat something because I don‚Äôt feel like it. 

Growing up, I had asthma and was always underweight, and I wanted to grow up to be big and strong. In my late teens I realized that I both eat too slowly and too less, and have been making conscious effort since to eat more in order to gain weight. The efforts somewhat paid off and for the past two years my BMI is healthy, but I still feel skinny and weak. On top of that, I have some mild anxiety about not being able to finish my food in time / at all when I‚Äôm with people. Usually when I go out for food with people, I eat a little, stop eating even though I‚Äôm hungry because everyone else is done, and go home on a half hungry stomach. Once home, I rarely eat anything and just go to sleep. 

I‚Äôve recently observed that my 5yo nephew has a similar problem with eating, so could this be something genetic? In general, does anyone else feel like this?",1674907292.0

My best friend since childhood struggles with binge eating disorder. I don‚Äôt know how many people in her life know, but I do know that she‚Äôs said before I‚Äôm one of the only people she feels comfortable talking to about it. (She has regular visits with a therapist- this is more of a ‚Äúventing to a friend‚Äù type situation)

The thing is, I‚Äôve never struggled with an eating disorder. I definitely have self-image issues and have been on some diets I probably shouldn‚Äôt have been, but nothing I would classify as an eating disorder. 

My main question is: how do I help? I love that she looks to me for encouragement, but I‚Äôm so scared of accidentally saying something that makes her feel worse even if it‚Äôs completely unintentional.

She texted me this morning that she binged last night for the first time in weeks and that she just needed someone to talk to about it. It took me nearly 20 minutes of just staring at the message to come up with a response because while I want to help and be someone she can talk to, I have truly no idea what to say. 

I guess my main question is if you were in her position, what would you want/need to hear from a friend offering support and comfort? Any phases or specific wording to avoid?

A close friend of mine has been struggling with disordered eating for a few years now but denies it, and whenever I feel like she is starting to get better, she seems to relapse again. 

She seems to get a lot of satisfaction from mentioning when she's gone a whole day without eating, and when she's lost weight or dropped clothing sizes. I don't know what to say or do, it's so worrying, and I feel like whenever I have tried to address it in the past it's gone nowhere. It's worse that I have always been the smaller friend despite my huge appetite, and she seems to compare herself to me. 

She makes out she is obsessed with health and tries all these fads like intermittent fasting and substituting meals for coffee/tea and 'health elixirs', but then she talks about how she's deficient in all these nutrients and never has any energy. It's like she intentionally overlooks the fact that her symptoms are because she doesn't eat properly... She also now claims she can't eat all these things because of self-diagnosed digestive issues (which I think she has also given herself by living off black coffee on an empty stomach...) 

I'm worried about her health, and our friendship hasn't been the same since her disordered eating (we often bonded over cooking and eating together, but these days when we hang out, she tries to fill our time with store-hopping or whatever else so we miss meal times and I end up so hangry by the end of it, despite my attempts to ask for a snack or meal break). Recently, one of our friends had a picnic for their birthday and she didn't eat anything because she claimed to have had a big meal beforehand.

I'd starve myself. I'd go to practice at 4pm without eating anything beforehand. I thought it would make me skinny, and honestly it probably would have if I wouldn't resort to the same thing every night or every drive home. I'd binge. For a long time I didn't understand that binging was a thing at all, or that other people struggle with it. All I knew it as was eating so much that my stomach would hurt and I'd hate myself. I got good at hiding the wrappers and no one knew what I'd do. I attempt to eat less/nothing around other people, and I always would lie about what I eat. It was too embarrassing.

Whether you‚Äôre struggling or not, I think this is a really good read, because if you‚Äôre struggling, it may help you to give you a better grasp on what it‚Äôs like for family and friends, completely raw. If I would‚Äôve seen this, when I was struggling, things would‚Äôve changed. and even now, while I am so well in to recovery, if I slip up, this is what I think about now, because it‚Äôs said perfectly. So it may give you some motivation.



For the Loved ones of someone with an ED,
I think this will be super beneficial for you to read, because this may be very relatable for you, it‚Äôs so hard to watch someone you love so much, deal with an ED be completely absorbed in it, and watch them slowly become someone you don‚Äôt know. 



The Monster

A monster consumed my sister. It first tempted her, pulling back strands of curled hair to whisper, You aren‚Äôt beautiful. But her hazel-green eyes sparkled when she smiled. Freckles lined her fair skin that glowed a rosy pink in the summer. Even when I stood on my tippy toes, she was taller than me, reaching a height of 5‚Äô8‚Äù.

But the monster told her these features weren‚Äôt enough. It preached that although there were some qualities it couldn‚Äôt change, parts of her that should be fixed. The monster followed her, creating a darkness shadowing her every move. It hid in the kitchen cabinets, ensuring she didn‚Äôt consume anything too high in calories. At first, the monster was lenient. The monster tolerated sugar free items, but it encouraged a clear liquid diet.

What was first a whisper in my sister‚Äôs ear turned into a grotesque growl. Three meals turned into one. The monster snarled, Just a few bites. Day after day mom and dad would set the table, and we sat down to a family meal. However, my sister scraped even her favorite spaghetti into the white garbage bag, staining it with streaks of red marinara.

The monster then took my sister‚Äôs beauty. It picked out her clothes, telling her the baggy ones looked best. They were the only clothes that were able to keep her frail body warm. The monster reminded her that she didn‚Äôt need makeup because her caved in cheeks already looked great. Dark circles emerged under her eyes, dimming the hazel-green sparkle. Soon enough, the monster became more than a shadow.

Time passed, and the monster took her physical health. Heart monitors echoed around the house, sounding her abnormal heart rate. She needed a feeding tube up her nose because she could no longer process food in her damaged body. But the monster roared, You‚Äôre so healthy! You don‚Äôt need the tube! So, sometimes she ripped it out in a fit of rage. Daily tests became routine, blood rushing through glass tubes to ensure her body was still working. But her major organs were shutting down, and the sound of a flatlining monitor was approaching quickly.

Each day I recognized my sister less and less. It was then my family and I realized it finally had a full grasp on my sister. The monster, named anorexia nervosa, turned my beautiful sister into a sickly stranger. I ask myself why I didn‚Äôt see the signs sooner, and why I didn‚Äôt know how to help. I wondered why she couldn‚Äôt see how beautiful she was to everyone around her, and why she had let this monster consume her. My family decided it was time to get my big sister back, when we sent her to an inpatient eating disorder clinic halfway across the U.S.

This was one of the most difficult things I‚Äôve ever had to encounter. Watching my sister slowly fade away took pieces of me I may never get back. There were some points where I thought I would never get to hear my sister‚Äôs laugh again while we watched a corny movie, or have her arms wrapped around me while tears fell down my cheek. I was terrified she wouldn‚Äôt get to see her little sister graduate, build a family, and become a fantastic aunt to my children like I know she would be.

After years of treatment, I‚Äôm happy to say I‚Äôm still getting those hugs, and still get to hear her contagious laugh. She has made immense improvement, regulating health issues anorexia has brought as well as healing the distorted thinking that came with it. She is one of the strongest people I‚Äôve ever met in my life, because as many people know battling a mental illness is not easy. Although I don‚Äôt think the monster will ever completely go away, my big sister is out of the shadow, and back in the light. A healed body walks to college courses she has now restarted. Her smile is genuine, not hiding anyone or anything. And, her hazel-green eyes sparkle even brighter now, with a glimmer of hope for herself, and others.",1674831523.0

This is part of a research study which we hope will lead to an improved understanding about the use of the MHA in young people, and ultimately how to reduce the use of compulsory treatment.

Taking part would involve an online interview which would last about one hour. This would include questions about the experience of being under the MHA, and what was happening in the lead up to going into hospital. The questions are participant led so there is no need to talk about anything unwanted.

Each participant will receive a ¬£20 voucher as a thank you for their time. Please see link below for further information and contact details.

I think I'm just looking for reassurance/support?

I've had issues with a restrictive ED since I was a teenager, I've been self-recovered for a few years; I don't engage in the more severe disordered behaviours anymore, and I've got a handle on the more subtle ones most of the time. I'm a medically healthy weight, and I generally do my best to work through the negative self esteem stuff, but I would say that's probably the hardest part to shake off. I still have weeks here and there where I'm too ashamed of my appearance to leave the house. It's improved significantly this year, but I'm definitely not perfect.

I had deliberately avoided getting a doctor, dietician, or ED specialised therapist involved in my recoverg because I have some trauma stuff that makes me very afraid of medical/psych professionals, especially regarding ED/body image. But I did go to therapy during the first few years of recovery, just not to a specific ED treatment focused person. And that really helped me handle my thoughts and behaviour patterns, but of course a therapist can't really give nutrition advice, so I've been winging it as best as I can with the research available to me, but there's so much contradictory and questionable info out there.

This year in particular, I've been really wanting to get back into athletic hobbies (running and dance) because they used to bring me a lot of happiness and I really miss them. I know I'll need to give myself enough energy to handle the increase in activity but I feel honestly unequipped to navigate that on my own. So, I've started working with a dietician to get some outside support to make sure I won't burn myself out. She seems really grounded and knowledgeable, she knows about my ED history and is tailoring her approach with me to make sure she's not pushing me back into old habits. I think this is the right decision for me, but oh man am I ever nervous about it.

I'll be getting my first set of meal plans from her tomorrow and I'm really scared. It'll be a relief to have some structure and not have to stress over every decision myself, but I'm super nervous that I'm going to gain loads of weight and that it'll trigger a relapse. I know that she's not going to design a meal plan that would cause that, and I know I'm going to need to eat more if I want to increase my activity levels, but I'm having a lot of trouble shaking off the fear. I'm worried that every option (exercise, don't exercise, eat, don't eat) is going to somehow cause me to gain weight and be unhappy with myself forever. Obviously that's irrational but I'm struggling to get my brain to shut up.",1674772374.0

I have been dealing with stress eating / emotional eating from few years. I completely lost hold of myself over the years as I ended up taking stress alot (an abusive relationship, another failed relationship, job related stress, not so peaceful home life, Covid era and the likes).

I have always loved food however this also meant with even a minute feeling of stress I would reach over to the food that is available to me at the earliest or my comfort food which is usually junk. I did not realise how this was impacting me until my weight tremendously increased. The effect is visible on my face, my belly, my arms the most. It was too late by the time I realised and now I genuinely do not know how to stop. 

I work a stressful job and I have constant hunger pangs and I reach out to food. No matter how hard I am trying I am unable to recover.

I don't know how to be ok with having rolls when I bend or slouch, or pose myself in a sort of ""shrimp"" position. The sensation of light pressure the rolls give me makes me feel absolutely horrible. I know that the only reason I had basically no rolls before is that because I was severely underweight, but that doesn't stop me from feeling horrendous about having them now.

TW: <!binging, restricting, food aversion!>

I am just now actively learning more about my eating disorder. I binge and restrict fairly regularly, with binging being about 80%-90% of the time. Bulimia is sprinkled in there, but not enough to mention. I‚Äôm not good at it ü´†

I want to have a healthy relationship with food. I love it, but I have had some recent trauma in the last year that changed my body. My hormones are already wack, but this has given me a super sensitive stomach.

I‚Äôm sure most of it is psychosomatic. But I find most foods absolutely repulsive anymore. It‚Äôs been so sudden. I literally had to force myself to eat *pizza* the other day. It‚Äôs not consistent, except I‚Äôm becoming less and less of a fan of meat. Milk tastes rotten/spoiled to me unless it‚Äôs chocolate milk.

It might potentially be triggering though.

I‚Äôm recovered from anorexia-turned-bulimia (after 10 years) since 2010, then had three kids with various weight fluctuations, nothing major though. After my recovery I managed not to weigh myself at all and eat pretty much intuitively for almost another 10 years. That is until I had a complicated/high risk third pregnancy in 2020. Suddenly regular weigh-ins were required by my doctors and I wasn‚Äôt allowed to exercise or get my heart rate up at all. The postpartum period was tough as well. 

I ended up with chronic hypertension, messed up blood fat levels and a pretty high body fat percentage. I‚Äôm expressly not asking for advice on these medical issues, just mentioning them for context. The point is: my current doctor advised that I lose weight and I‚Äôm really unsure how to go about that.

I‚Äôve tried implementing more veggies in my diet and cutting back on fats and sugars without measuring anything, but the thought alone that I *have to* lose weight now is triggering binges and intense guilt whenever I eat something ‚Äûunhealthy‚Äú.

Like I can't even do anything right, no matter how badly I want to be skinny. But eating... my life revolves around it. I feel driven to eat by my love for food, but I then feel EXTREME sadness, guilt, and self hatred. It's gotten to the point where I just feel so trapped and worthless especially after big meals. I don't know what to do. I don't know what's wrong with me.

For background, I was always pretty skinny up until I turned 20. In the past year I've grown noticeably more fat especially in my stomach and arms. I absolutely hate myself when I put on my clothes, especially the jeans that used to fit me just over a year ago. When I see old pictures of myself, I feel nothing but self hatred. But I genuinely do wish I could just make it stop. I know that logically, I need to feed myself and give my body what it needs. I need to be kind to myself. But something about me just can't allow my brain to do that. Every time I see an old picture or video, every time I try on jeans that don't fit me anymore, I just feel so much hate. It's hard for me to feel happy even in social settings because I'm constantly conscious about what my stomach looks like and how it used to be easy for me to wear crop tops and low rise jeans. I used to feel so confident in my smaller clothes, and now I feel on the brink of breakdown every time something doesn't fit me.

I especially feel like I can't talk to my friends about it because I really still am on the skinnier side. I know my friends tell me that my size gain isn't noticeable, but to me it is. It's all I think about. Moving up 4 inches in waist size in less than one year is the most growth my body's ever faced in my life. I know that it's not reflective of how desirable or healthy I am, but it just feels emotionally and mentally painful. And my body just doesn't like it either.

Because of this I've been trying to find answers to my weight gain. High cortisol levels? Bad birth control prescription? Early diabetes? IBS? Stomach problems? Hormonal imbalance? etc. But I'm too scared to actually see a doctor in the case that my waist getting bigger has no explanation and I just let this happen to myself.

Is this an eating disorder? How do I stop these thoughts? How do I get myself to love/appreciate my body, no matter how much I eat? What other ways are there to get skinnier, and why have I not fallen into a more common eating disorder like anorexia or bulimia? Why do I have thoughts where I wish I did have those disorders?",1674630242.0

I fasted as much as I could and made sure to hit my steps a day, and if there were days I would eat I tried to keep it under a certain limit of cals. My hair was both long and had a bit of thickness that I didn't notice was slowly getting lower and lower. My mom was mainly the only one who ever commented on it but I never took what she said seriously, until I noticed that my hair was actually falling out. I didn't want to stop though. I kept fasting and doing low res. 
It was around December when I finally had that 'oh shit' moment and decided to up my daily intake in order to try and stop the shedding. I have hypothyroidism and take meds for it, also have a vitamin D deficiency and I have been taking meds for both for a few years now. I also started taking some pills for hair growth (one of those multi-pills that promise stronger thicker hair with lots of vitamins in them) in November, but honestly they might not be working to their full potential because I'm supposed to take them before breakfast and I don't usually eat then. I recently got some blood work done as I suspected I might have anemia, but the results came out great.

I have decided I will try recovery since this hair shedding is making me spiral into a really serious depression. I have been eating somewhat normally for almost a month now and terrifyingly enough, this is the time I feel like my hair is falling the most. I don't understand why and how this is the case since I've been looking out for it a lot more lately. 

Anyone have any suggestions? If you chose recovery and experienced hair loss before, how long did it take for it to stop? Is this one of those ""it gets worse before it gets better"" sort of situations?",1674627773.0

It quickly spiraled out of control and in the first two years i would have periods of rapid weightloss (i was borderline obese so it makes sense) but also had bingeing periods. It was probably ednos or some type of bulimia back then (i have never v*mited to purge). During covid it all got worse and i had a pretty severe exercise addiction, i lost weight fast and i was at my lowest point and in those two years attempted to unalive multiple times. 

I kinda lost contact with my old friends but after the first lockdown in my country i made new friends at my school. Both my best friends (18F and 18M) have struggled with disordered eating and one of them currently still does. We dont go to the same school anymore since we graduated last year, but were still close. Due to recent events i have deleted all my ed social media (edtwt and edblr lolol) and today i told my best friend (18m) i was finally ready to try recovery on my own terms. Im a little scared and dont know how long this will last. But most previous (semi) recovery attempts were forced or not serious. Im afraid to let him down but im also tired of this disorder.

This isn't binging. I sort of struggled with binging/purging years ago, but mostly because my mom said if I lost weight I wouldn't be trans. I stopped on my own.

I've no urge to puke or starve myself. I know I need food for energy. Instead I exercise at night. Not _overly,_ but I think some sit ups will help my stomach lose the excess fat.

Strangely I feel more focused than before. School work? Done. Laundry? Done. Brush my teeth? Let's do it. I still struggle to get going, but it doesn't feel impossible anymore. It feels like I have more self control now, and I like that.

First post here, looking for advice. Lately I noticed many tell tale clues of an eating disorder from the young student living in my home since September. I had a conversation with her about my concerns, she cried a lot and we decided to get her mom involved. Her mom is now staying with us to assess the situation. The daughter will start seeing a therapist and a dietician. But I wonder if this is enough for her to stay with us and continue her studies - or if she should go home with her parents and take the time to properly heal.
I want to give her a chance because she seems serious and relieved that steps have been taken to help her, but I also do not want to feel consumed with worries and I know she might struggle when the recovery process starts for real - with the weight gain, the higher caloric diet, etc‚Ä¶
Any advice? Thank you",1674564341.0

I'm honestly terrified. I don't know what to expect. I didn't really think I had an ED, I thought maybe I'm just at risk. Either way it's interfering with my life.

I didn't know it at the time, but I have POTS and restricting food can trigger dizzy and fainting episodes so I was very unhealthy at the time. (I wasn't diagnosed with POTS until I was 19ish). Through college, I struggled with extreme exercising despite my chronic illness, along with restricting and binging. In my mid-20s, I seemed to get things under control and had a pretty healthy relationship with food.

Now: I'm 33 and have gained weight over the last few years. I think I might have PCOS because I have other symptoms of it too and have a family history of it. Anyway, since the weight gain, I've started binging again because I'm depressed. I'm married now and don't want to disappoint my wife, which keeps my from restricting. But she goes to bed early and that's when I end up binging. I think about food all the time and the next meal I'll get. Money is tight, but we have enough to have good mostly nutritious meals.

I'm really worried that I'm going to fall into old habits again and that using my wife to hold myself accountable won't be enough. I want to go back to therapy but we don't have insurance at the moment and even with sliding scales will struggle to pay out of pocket (I'm in the US). It's also difficult to find a therapist because I'm only interested in an LGBT therapist after having a homophobic therapist in the past.

Since the day I was born, the only food my family has had in the house is unhealthy. It's cakes, sugars, pizzas, meat (and I'm vegetarian), just all kinds of crackers and snacks. My family isn't well off at all so all the money I make at my part-time job (I'm in high school) goes straight to our bills, I can't buy my own food. My parents buy us fast food every day. I watch TV shows where kids beg their parents for McDonald's and are so overjoyed when their parents buy it for them and I can't believe that's relatable for most kids. 

Everyone in my family is overweight except me.. because of my eating disorder. 

But it wasn't always like that, because up until I was about 11, I was overweight, too. Then I learned more about health and begged my parents to buy healthy food or make actual meals for us instead of just telling us to make microwave pancakes for dinner, or at least regulate what we eat and when, put a limit, anything, but they refused. I decided that I'd rather not eat anything than eat junk. 

As I got older and began to care about my looks more, the reasoning behind my starving turned more onto trying to avoid looking how the rest of my family looks - I do want to be thin. But it's been five or six years of this and I'm out of energy and I've lost my period and I have panic attacks and meltdowns over Cheez-Its and no one knows. I haven't told anyone. 

But I don't want this anymore. I want to be able to eat, because I don't want to die. 

But I don't want to eat unhealthily either, because again, I don't want to die. 

If I ever told my parents, they would just see it as ""oh, she needs to eat more"" and force me to eat their unhealthy snacks. I want to be healthy. I want to live normally. But no one can help me.

&#x200B;

When I first met my gf she was still with her ex-bf of 4 years, but they had had a lot of issues and were always fighting so she wanted to break up with him but she felt bad thinking he would be sad about it. So she didn't leave him until some time after.

&#x200B;

We started to get along and to meet more often, and eventually we showed attraction for each other and some night, probably drunk, we... did stuff. At that time I was really uncomfortable with my body already but knowing someone was attracted to me kinda helped to get through it.

&#x200B;

Time passed and she eventually broke up with her ex, she had always told me she really liked me and would like to have a relationship but she couldn't because she was still with the guy. At this point I knew she would need time to be alone, to heal from her past, toxic relationship before getting into another one so I did that, gave her time.

&#x200B;

Eventually it was her bday and she made a party where she invited some of her highschool friends, she told me she used to fancy this one girl who was coming but she hadn't seen in a long time, and I thought nothing of it. Little did I know, she (my now gf) ended up getting drunk and making out with the girl she fancied in front of me.

&#x200B;

A week went by and she stopped giving me any attention when we were together and she was even more distant now, she spent the time we were together texting the girl in question and sending her love messages and stuff. She was never very affectionate with me whatsoever.

&#x200B;

After that, I stopped talking to her at all. It made me feel extremely bad. I knew the other girl was hotter than me and prettier than I am and I was so jealous because of course she would rather be with her, I would too.

&#x200B;

Some time after she texted me saying that she didn't know what happened or why we weren't okay (as in our friendship) and I ended up meeting with her. I had got a girlfriend at this point but I really, deep down, loved her so, after more rounds of gin that I can count, I ended up cheating on my gf.

&#x200B;

So to finish this story, I broke up with my ex-gf and started dating her, and they lived happily ever after.

&#x200B;

FALSE, those things that happened still haunt me to the date and I spent last night crying and couldn't sleep at all thinking about it and it has grown a lot of anxiety in me. I also I'm at my worst with my ED right now so I feel really bad overall.

&#x200B;

Well, the reason to this post is she is meeting with the girl she changed me with next Wednesday and I can't shake the thought that she preferred her over me. This is really triggering to me and I refuse to eat anything until everything has passed. How can I get over what happened? Or how can I make it less triggering?

But last week I got into a big argument with one of our other friends. She (I'm gonna call her D) says that I'm hurting S just by being around her and I need to let more of the group be involved in her recovery.¬†¬†

I've always been a very thin girl and many times throughout my life I've been told I look like I have an eating disorder. It's not something I've ever personally dealt with though. On a few occasions, S has said she wants to look like me. I always tell her I would rather her look like herself.

So D and I got into this fight, and when I told my husband, he actually agreed.¬†I asked S and she said I'm not a problem, but I'm not sure I can trust her judgment about this.

I really really need advice. Am I actually making her fail her recovery? Do I need to take myself out of the picture? I just want what's best for her and getting better.¬†",1674370887.0

I suspect one of my siblings may have had an eating disorder for a while now, but I don't know how to help. Although we have mentioned how this said sibling has gotten thinner and skipped meals and such, my mom makes every excuse to stray away from the idea that her child might need help. She either points out the things he has eaten or just stays silent and changes the subject. I fear for my sibling because he did lose a lot of weight in comparison to last year, almost unrecognizable, but I guess he sees it as a good thing because he is a lot more talkative during school. From what I have seen, he drinks A LOT of water bottles, even one time mentioning to us that if we ever wanted to lose weight just drink water until your stomach hurts. I do not know why these talks seem so normal in our family.

I might suspect I have an eating disorder myself too but how can I help someone when I do not even know how to take care of myself? It is very stressful to see him need help but no help being given.

I definitely noticed a bit of disordered eating going on. It wasn‚Äôt normal, I looove food. I love eating!

Pretty often, probably like once a week or every two weeks this past year, I would throw up from being so hungry. Or, even if I wasn‚Äôt starving, just knowing that I‚Äôd have to go to a restaurant and eat something, even just imagining the smell or smelling it, made me sick and I‚Äôd have to go throw up in the bathroom mid-meal.

I‚Äôve been absolutely wonderful the last probably 2-3 months and have been eating healthy, good amounts and didn‚Äôt feel sick or weird once. Never even thought about it. It‚Äôs been great.

Now, I‚Äôve been really depressed for the entirety of the last week, and haven‚Äôt been eating. It got to a point where I was so hungry I threw up bile 2 days ago. I was sad again yesterday and only ate a few veggie sausages to start my day, and then was SO hungry later, and after I got and ate a few fries, I had to run to the bathroom to throw up.

Is there a label to out on this or? I‚Äôve had an extremely sensitive, queasy stomach since I had COVID, so maybe that‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt know.

I try to eat consistently (snacking) to avoid getting so starving, but I don‚Äôt want anything. I quit one of my jobs so I have a lot of time now and that always throws me off. I need routine.

A few days ago, I was on twitter when I saw two old tweets I had bookmarked last year. They were both from the same account, one was about something that had happened at my school last year, and the other was complaining about the weather in my state. I thought it was odd that the person lives in my state and had the same thing happen to them at their school. I figured we probably went to the same school, and when I clicked on the account I realized it was an eating disorder twitter account. I didn't recognize the girls name, and when I asked a few friends, neither did they, and I forgot all about it. 

Until a few days ago when I found the tweets again and went back on the account, and noticed the way she tweeted was very similar to the way my 15f friend types. But the account had her age on the account and said she was 16 in her bio, so I figured it was just coincidence. But then I scrolled down and saw tweets from a few days before, where she thanked everyone for all the birthday wishes, and that's when i remembered my friend had just turned 16. As soon as I realized they had the same birthday, I just knew it was her and my heart dropped. 

Right now I don't know what to do. I don't want to confront her, because I'm worried she might try to hurt herself out of panic. Should I tell my mom so she can tell her mom?

The whole account was about her anorexia, pictures of her body (She has visible bones everywhere) and starvation diet.

Some time ago she did told me she had anorexia but i was sure it was all in the past. So i started asking her about it and everytime she posted something I couldn't have a normal conversation with her without saying something about her ED. 

I started wondering if maybe i should message her parents about it (From what i know she has a good relationship with them and they had to deal with her ED before) but i was scared she might get upset about it, so i told her I'm considering talking to her parents. 

She was a bit upset and told me about her ex friend who actually told her parents about her ED and that when she found out about it she started to dislike that person. 

I really don't want to lose her but I just can't stop worrying about it. 

So what should i do? I heard that telling her parents is a good option only if it's really bad with her but when is it,, really bad""?

I shouldn't be surprised I guess that after almost a year of health problems that triggered a nearly year-long relapse is causing a similar effect. I am now at a weight I haven't been in 3 years since I was in the first two years of recovery and allowed myself to be overweight...this is a very scary thing for me and I'm trying to remain calm and not act drastically but I'm finding myself very triggered. I have a different mindset on recovery and my body after 5 years of recovery with various blips, i truly feel like i have learned...but you never know, ya know? I am tempted to ask my doctor to do some testing on me as I am concerned with the shear amount of weight in such a short amount of time with literally all that was done was just stop restricting, meaning i eat like a normal person (I have autoimmune gut disorders so not that normal but eat enough and can't eat inflammatory foods). The second qaundry is is there safe weight loss after recovery?

I‚Äôve been struggling with restrictive eating for a long time now.

I havent eaten anything in two days atp and while i always know i should, its almost paralysing bc i weirdly feel proud of myself for holding out for so long and also not feeling  hungry? I also feel like bc I haven‚Äôt had the motivation to workout I shouldnt eat much to make up for it which I KNOW logically is so wrong but when i tell myself i know i have to eat or get something in me, i just feel like i cant move, like my body is resisting it.

I struggle with eating. Usually i don't eat whole day and then i over eat at night.
It usually start with having no appetite in morning and when i skip breakfast im usually in not eating mood for rest of the day.

It just seems like nothing is appetizing. All i see are ingredients that need work to turn them into meals, but there is no motivation to do that. This post could also be titled as ""too lazy to eat"". I think that when i have some meals prepared from earlier i don't struggle that much to eat them. It also seems like the ""task"" of making decision of what to eat is just too hard for me to make so i rather starve.

But back to the mornings. Today was kind of exception because i actually got up early which is something i'm striving for, but since i got up early, I had to face the decision of what should i eat. 
As usual i opened fridge and realised that i don't feel like eating anything. I dint want to eat anything savory or sweet, so I decided to eat something ""neutral"" like oatmeal (boiled in water with pinch of salt). We didn't have oats at home so I went to store and when I got there and looked at all the different food I got appetite back and wanted to eat. 

It's usually like that... At home I struggle to decide but when I'm out it just get easier, maybe it's due to lack of decision making.

I'm 20 years old, and I just dropped out of college. I've struggled with an eating disorder for about 6 years, and I've gone through the same cycle over and over again. Overeat, gain, feel sorry for myself, hoard and hide food, fight with my family, promise to be better and get help, I get help, I don't try, then I just go back to eating again. 

It's just been a constant cycle of failure after failure, and that's all on me. I couldn't even make it through the first semester of college because I blew through my savings on food. 

I'm at the point where something has to change, or else I'll just be like this for the rest of my life. My parents have given me chance after chance after chance. They've put up with my false promises and failures and then I drag myself back pleading for forgiveness, and another chance, and they give it. This is my last shot. I'm living with them while I get help, but if it doesn't work, I need to find another place to live and find a way to live with this ED. 

I'm going to go to therapy (first session is next week). What would be the first steps after that? I understand that I need to find the root of the issue (hence a psychologist), but while I do that, what are some good practices to include in my life? Do I focus on weight loss? Do I focus on forming healthy eating habits? Both at once? 

I just don't know where to start, because I'm so worried it will end up being a waste.

Hi , I was looking for some advice really. My partner has had issues with eating , their body image and p*rging for as long as I've known them but in the last few months they're spiralling pretty badly and barely eating.

I'm struggling with how best to help them and like how best to be supportive without enabling them though. I don't have any first hand experience with having a restrictive eating disorder  although I am in the process of repairing my own relationship with diets and excercise and my body so that's about all I can really relate to and i know my journey in doing that has been hard but still 100x easier than it must be to recover from an ED. My partner keeps messaging me telling me that they've only eaten a worryingly tiny number of a certain unit of energy today , photos of  a certain app that tracks what youve eaten/excercise and things like that. I've said a few times that it would be best if they try and not focus so much on calories and that this app they're using is incredibly damaging especially to someone with an ED. I don't want to say anything too harsh as I know this is a safety blanket for them and they keep telling me they want to stop but can't. I can see they're trying and I know it must be so incredibly difficult for them but I'm genuinely terrified for them at this point and I just want to help them the best I can.",1674152447.0

I feel like this relationship results in unhealthy habits and behaviours. I have googled my ""symptoms"" extensively but haven't come up with anything yet so I thought I would take it to this group to see if anyone can relate and/or provide insights. 

My ""symptoms"" mostly revolve around an obsession with food portions which expresses itself in the following ways :
- A feeling of scarcity. I feel the need to cook enough food for the possibility of having seconds. If there is only enough food to provide a ""regular"" portion to everyone eating, I feel anxiety. Even if I have enough to eat, I feel satiated at the end of the meal and I have no intentions of grabbing seconds.
- A strong dislike for sharing food. My portions are MY portions. Unless we're at a restaurant and sharing is the only way I get to try different items on the menu. 
- In addition to the above, if I'm cooking and serving the food - the food has to be divided equally between me and my significant other. Even though his calorie requirements are much higher than mine. And I'm embarrassed to say this, but I struggle not to take more food or keep the best bits of the meal for myself when serving.
- If I share food someone, I must have the last bite.
- Some food hoarding 

I have absolutely no idea where this is all coming from and the weird thing too is that my sister seems to be sharing some of these issues. Growing up she also struggled with binge eating while I don't remember really suffering from that. We grew up in a lower middle household and we absolutely never went hungry. We grew up on non fancy, homemade meals and ate out sometimes as a family. We had access to fresh food and treats/sweets as well. Our parents did not restrict food intake.

I'd love to hear people's thoughts on this. Thank you in advance!

I sometimes find myself skipping that meal when that happens. Is anyone else have experienced this? 

Lately, I've been stressed and anxious : I jusf bought my first house and it was an intense and negative process. I'm getting used to living in my house but there is still a lot of things to get done to be able to enjoy it.

Hello, my name is Clare Marney and I am a PhD student at the University of Hull, UK. I am doing a research project on females with eating disorders and their mothers. More specifically I am investigating the early maladaptive schemas (EMS), a component of schema theory/therapy, in dyads of females living with disordered eating and those of their mothers. (A dyad is defined as a pair: two individuals, such as mother and daughter, maintaining a sociologically significant relationship). Investigating the dynamics of important relationships in a female‚Äôs with disordered eating life can only help to guide therapists to assess the most beneficial routes to recovery for the individual with ED and guide and help those in their support network.

**Therefore, I am looking for:**

¬∑ Females with eating disorders AND their mothers to participate

The study involves completing an online survey which will take approx. 30 mins of your time. You will first be asked demographic questions such as age, gender and education status. You will then be asked to complete 3 questionnaires that assess attitudes and behaviours towards food, to identify any Early Maladaptive Schemas, if any, are present for an individual and to assess perceptions of parenting.

This is completely confidential, no personal identifiers are asked nor shared. Please be assured that the other member of your dyad (your mother or your daughter) will NOT be able to see what answers you have provided. Each submission is completely confidential and anonymous. You can stop at any time if you feel triggered or uncomfortable. 

**Important:**

¬∑ It is important that we have matching data so BOTH members of the dyad would need to complete the questionnaires (please check with the other member of your pair before completing as any unmatched data will be excluded from data analysis)

¬∑ Please ensure you complete the study. You will receive a message at the end to confirm you have completed it and your data has been saved. Any unfinished surveys will be excluded from data analysis 

¬∑ You will be asked to make up a unique code for your dyad/pair. Please ensure that you have entered the exact codes for your data to be matched ‚Äì any unmatched data will be excluded from data analysis

Thank you for taking the time to read this post and I hope to shed more light on this subject. If you wish to participate in this research, please follow the link below where you will find full research study information and be required to give informed consent, you will then continue to the questionnaires.

It would also crave absolutely insane combinations, for example I ate half a pickle and then immediately consumed a biscuit. But basically the past few days have been this. A lot of the time I'm not even physically hungry but my mind is screaming for more food.

I know that this is a part of the process and logically I understand that it's probably good for me as well because I'm underweight as all hell, but boy does it feel bad. And boy does it *look* bad to others. I've told some of my family members about my ED and about me starting recovery and they seemed to acknowledge it until they saw me devour half a pan of chicken meat and eat several rice cakes only two hours afterwards. Then everyone suddenly became suspicious of me ever having had an ED. That doesn't really help me feel any better.

I'm pretty sure that I'm also bloated as hell all the time, which is also a part of the process, but it also feels hella bad.

I‚Äôve gone through several versions of myself over the years from toned and fit, to chubby, to closing in on obese. When I was very young (until around 10) I was pretty ‚Äúfit,‚Äù which in this case means  meaning active and no visible extra chub besides the regular baby fat. I was also too young to have a proper complex about it. After that age I had a belly and would get regular comments from someone about being chubby or ‚Äúfat.‚Äù I wore husky sizes into high school. By this point, I felt regularly uncomfortable at what I looked like to others. I got really shy and guarded, wouldn‚Äôt go swimming even though I loved it, you know the drill. 

Fast-forward to my senior year of college. I had finals, projects, the grad school application process (which, in my field, included traveling to each school for an in person audition,) and two solo recitals. I didn‚Äôt have time to think, let alone eat. I was also completely broke from traveling, so I lost a solid chunk of weight and suddenly just looked trim and muscular for the first time since I was a small child. And when I tell you that the world saw me differently, I mean it. Seriously. People I‚Äôd had a huge crush on the entire time I knew them suddenly wanted to hang out after wanting nothing to do with me for 4 years. Society en masse treated me better. I got more confident. 

Since that point, I‚Äôve been so careful about how much I‚Äôm eating and when. Cash flow in grad school was tight, so I‚Äôd often just elect not to eat for 3 or so days in a row. I told myself it was to save money, but in the back of my mind I was also excited about how I‚Äôd look after. I prioritize pretty much everything over eating. To this day I don‚Äôt eat breakfast and I rarely eat lunch. I just drinks lots of coffee in the morning and eat a medium-sized dinner at night. And that‚Äôs mostly because my wife does eat regularly and we obviously eat together, but if one of us is away I won‚Äôt eat. I‚Äôve been doing some variation of that off and on for the last 10 years or so. This current stretch has been for maybe 6 months of very minimal eating. The only reason I bring it up is that A. It‚Äôs obviously not healthy, and B. People I work with are starting to say things to me about it. There‚Äôs a couple people I‚Äôve worked with for the last 4 months who each came up to me separately to tell me that they never seen me eat and they‚Äôre concerned.

788,How to stop an ED before it starts?,11,10dpb7t,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10dpb7t/how_to_stop_an_ed_before_it_starts/,1,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I tried to post this a few months ago but never really plucked up the courage because I was in denial about having an issue, but I think I need some help - preferably from people who have some perspective on the issue.

For context, I used to be overweight and decided to go on a diet last year due to joint problems. Losing the weight felt great in terms of self confidence and general mobility but I realised once I hit my current, healthy weight, I got depressed about my results not being 'good enough'. I find myself hyper-analysing my body constantly and thinking I 'need' to fit into certain clothing sizes and taking huge blows to my self confidence if I don't. During my initial weight loss, counting calories wasn't a big deal to me but now I'm obsessed.

The thing that actually triggered me to post this is when tonight after dinner, I frantically rushed around the kitchen picking up all the food items I had eaten that day and tallied up how much everything was. I even picked a packet out of the trash to do it.

Nobody in my life knows I do this, not even my partner who I consider my closest friend. I hide it from everyone because I'm afraid that if I tell anybody then I'll be forced to eat too much and gain weight (I had an issue with my parents doing this to me in childhood). I know my current behaviour isn't normal but I haven't tipped fully into purging/restricting/etc. so I feel like I have some time to prevent what's going on if I know how to. The articles online are focused more so on people who are actively dealing with EDs, which is understandable.

Any help is really appreciated. I know a lot of people with mental health issues/addictions always wish they could've given their younger self some advice so if anybody has anything, please do tell.",1673898195.0

791,Need to help my sister,2,10e08al,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10e08al/need_to_help_my_sister/,0,"My sister was diagnosed 6 months ago after constantly passing out/lost tons of weight, and she started IOP. She still hasn‚Äôt gained weight or her period back after thousands of dollars spent on her nutritionist/therapist/psychiatrist. She has been caught putting food in her pocket instead of eating it. We haven‚Äôt caught her throwing up yet but idk how she‚Äôs not gaining weight. I live out of town and my mom manages her treatment. I told my mom to tell my sister that she needs to see her poop and take a picture of it everyday for two weeks per the doctor (obviously a lie) so we could tell if she was throwing up/taking laxatives or if she had a large normal BM. Her toilet is spotless but it‚Äôs always been like that but I am wondering if she‚Äôs doing something more than hiding food. 

I need advice from someone who has recovered from anorexia. 

How do we make sure she eats all of her meal? (Sit with her during and supervise after the meal?) 

How should we check if she hides food in her pockets without triggering her? (Check pockets before/after, go to bathroom w her etc?? My parents work schedules cause her to eat one meal per day alone, which is prepped and ready for her to eat. 

Are physical checks and accountability during and after meals absolutely necessary for her recovery, or can we continue letting her eat alone?? And if it is necessary, how strict should the supervision be??

How should we check if she‚Äôs throwing up after meals without triggering her? (Go to bathroom w her for up to 1.5 hours post meal?)

How do we motivate her to try to gain weight? (Bring up the fact she can‚Äôt go off to college next year unless she gets better? Tell her a time limit she has to gain weight before sending her to inpatient care? Scare tactic?) 

She is a senior in high school but does school at home. She needs to get better but it seems like maybe she‚Äôs not trying or thinking ‚Äúthis is just the way I am.‚Äù How do we warn her that if she doesn‚Äôt gain weight, she will go to a facility without her phone and without super healthy vegetarian meals and without a loving family? How do we motivate her without shaming her? How do we discuss her lack of improvement while reminding her that we care, and motivate her to try harder at the same time?? Or do we not discuss the worse case scenario at all (going to inpatient care/not going to college next fall). All of these thought cross our minds but we don‚Äôt address her non-compliance too harshly because we don‚Äôt want her to spiral out of control. When she hides food and doesn‚Äôt eat it, we just ask if she wants to get better and encourage her to not hide food, but that kind caring approach (asking self reflective questions) clearly isn‚Äôt working. 

Will she have to hit rock bottom to get better? When did you realize you wanted to get better and when did you start trying to eat more? What do you wish your family did or said to you during recovery that could have helped you eat more and feel better?? Help!!",1673922401.0

I'm pretty sure my best friend has an eating disorder, I can't really say what kind but all I know is that he thinks he's ""fat"" (he is definitely underweight and even if he was overweight, I'd fucking love him all the same) and that he doesn't really eat. It's difficult because I don't struggle with these kinds of body issues so I'm not sure what the appropriate way to confront/address this or if I even SHOULD address it. Plus, I know with men it's more complex because society really loves to emphasize eating disorders as a ""woman's mental illness"" even though sex/gender have nothing to do with body dismorphia and disordered eating.

I want to be a good friend. I want to try and help him but I know he doesn't really want help, and you can't force people to put the effort in when it comes to mental health. That just makes things so much worse.

But I can't sit back and let him kill himself like this, especially aftet last night. We were drinking pretty heavily, then he throws up all over himself and its literally just liquid then I jokingly scolded him for drinking on an empty stomach while helping him clean up, and he says a line that is becoming more and more frequent from him these days- ""I don't need to eat."" I'll admit at that point, I had to go into another room and cry for a moment because that completely confirmed all the suspicions I've had the last few months. I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. I really did.

I don't know what to do, I don't know where to start. I can't lose him, I can't just watch this silently but I dont want to deal more damage by wanting to help and going about it completely wrong.

I have had several bouts of severe restriction at different times in my life. Now I'm in my early 30s. I have been having what may be called a relapse? I've been restricting alot and struggling with appetite. I've lost a fair amount of weight but my bmi is at the lowest healthy number for my height and assigned sex. 
I'm nonbinary and feel so good in my gender at this size so on one hand the positive impact (no gender or body dysphoria) seem to outweigh the risks/side effects. Anyways I found out in my nutritionist appointment today that my primary care provider diagnosed me with anorexia nervosa restrictive. It doesn't feel true and I'm struggling to believe the diagnosis. I'm looking for support/reality checks and ideas.

When we first moved in together I noticed after eating a big meal she would go to the bathroom, run the bathtub faucet, and throw up. The apartment walls were paper thin so I could hear everything and it was very obvious what was going on. This was a pattern and and at first I wouldn't say anything, but as time went on I would start to ask her if she was OK and that I heard her getting sick. She would always just say she wasn't feeling well or make some other excuse. There was only one time ever that I really confronted her, and it was as gently as I could. I just asked her if she was making herself throw up and she said no. I tried to tell her it's OK if she does I just needed to know. And she still denied it. Honestly I felt a little hurt that she wouldn't open up to me, but I know this has to be a deep secret she doesn't tell anyone. I know that uring her high school years she was very self conscious about her weight and had lost a lot before I met her. I'm guessing this is when I started. 

Over the years she has slowed down or stopped throwing up, or at least she was hiding it much better. We had a kid together and I was very worried about hers and the babies health but I don't think she  was throwing up at all in that time. The baby was born healthy and mom was a healthy normal weight according to the doctors.  Now though she has been dealing with some major dental problems I'm guessing are from years of constantly throwing up.

I've done some (shallow) research on eating disorders, and it looks like most of them have to do with overeating or stress eating.
However, my problem is that I *don't* eat. If I don't literally force myself, I may go a long time without putting anything into my stomach. Eating just isn't a nice activity for me, no matter how much I to convince myself that ""I love eating, I love food"".

There are some times when I can eat just fine, and I have meals throughout the day, and other times where I go to bed starving but not eating anyway. Most days recently I understand that I absolutely must eat and therefore I drag myself over to bring AT LEAST a handful of granola bars to eat throughout the day just so that I don't accidentally starve myself.
I've been subsisting off of really quick and easy food like peanut butter sandwiches, granola bars, fruits, or anything that is pre-made and takes very little effort to get. I've also had a time where my entire diet was just smoothies and shakes that I blended up because I physically didn't feel like chewing.

Recently I've lost a lot of weight in just a few weeks by complete accident, and I feel horrible about myself because I'm getting so skinny but I just can't seem to fix my eating habits.

Is this an eating disorder? Or is there something else?",1673810416.0

Bit of a throwaway - I've been in and out of recovery for probably a decade now currently coming out of a bit of a restrictive relapse.

I have tickets for a ballet performance on Tuesday, I was very excited, I love the costumes, love the dancing, used to do ballet and I spent about $30 on the ticket which isn't refundable. I've never been to see a live performance, and it's my favourite ballet too.

However, as its getting closer, I'm becoming deeply deeply worried about it, and that I've just spent $30 to stare at beautiful skinny women doing things I can't for like 2 hours.

Does anyone have any ideas on how I can get the enjoyment back from it? And not focus too much on what the dancers all look like? I have a thing about legs so I know I'm going to be very focused on skinny legs. Maybe it'll be a challenge for me, I don't know.

It's a super difficult one because I was really looking forward to it and now I'm kind of dreading it!! And yes, absolutely I could skip it and take the hit or whatever but I don't know when I'll get a chance like this again as there aren't often these sorts of performances in my town.

I can‚Äôt remember what it was called but in simple terms, I had no appetite whatsoever. I was on a feeding tube for 8 years just to make sure I got something in me. I had grown out of it by the time I was 13 and finally had an appetite, but the problem was that because my relationship with food was already so bad I had developed a binge eating problem which I have also been able to recover from. Now onto the issue. 

Early last year I had really started to want to lose a little bit of weight. I had gained a lot during the pandemic and noticed my favorite pants had gotten pretty tight so I decided to go on a low restrictions diet. The goal was to mostly cut out a lot of my sugar intake because I have a bad sweet tooth and it had gotten to be a problem, cavities, constant sugar cravings, you get the gist. I was eating mostly healthy at this time but had my days where I just wanted to eat everything I saw because sometimes old habits show themselves every once in a while. 

I had actually cut my sugar intake down to nearly zero and really don‚Äôt have the cravings for it anymore except maybe a Dr. Pepper when I‚Äôm at a restaurant so I was probably dealing with a sugar addiction and didn‚Äôt realize it. But during this time period I had started noticing myself calorie counting. And I do mean everything I ate. If it had more than a certain amount I wouldn‚Äôt eat it and if I passed more than half my recommended  daily intake I wouldn‚Äôt eat anything else for the rest of the day. 

It had gotten bad for a couple of months until my boyfriend started noticing how much food was being wasted and pointed out that he thought I was starting to fall into another eating disorder. It terrified me so the first thing I did was take a sharpie and colored over all the numbers on food packages, had him do the grocery shopping alone for about a month and have him do the same thing as he was putting the food away. He was more than happy to do it btw because he was worried. I‚Äôve since been able to get back to mostly normal aside from not eating sweets much anymore, but the fact that I nearly relapsed over a pair of pants has me a bit worried. So what I want to know is what I can do to help prevent this from happening again? Any and all advice is welcome.",1673662749.0

So, I'm basically 14 years old. I've always been on the chubbier side and people have teased me for that. Well a year ago, I decided to lose weight through workouts and eating healthy. (without my parents knowing) and it held on for a while. Until I completely lost control and ate like a monster. At first it was just overeating, but as u can tell as I ate and ate I felt guilty and started restricting certain foods like oreos and such - and now I'm a big mess. I'm trying to fix the mess I made and just eat normally, balancing out my meals ( I usually cook for myself), however every time I finish my plate I always grab more. Like I know I'm full, but I think it's because of all the binging I did my stomach stretched out. So I grab more food. And more. Until I just eat a full day's worth of food and literally feel horrible. I told my parents about this but they just tell me to control myself. (which I don't know how to)


I've seen it all - don't restrict, eat intuitively, blah blah blah - it doesn't work. I've seen every tip online, I've watched every video, IT. DOESN'T. WORK. I feel so out of control with eating and it's terrible because when I look in the mirror I feel so uncomfortable in my own skin and I just want to hide. But none of my friends even have my problem(I mean yes, they're insecure like me but they don't have any eating probs) so I just scroll through posts about binge eating and see what I can do to help. But once I start eating, I don't stop. I mean, I don't know. It's like I rewired my brain to eat eat eat eat. But I'm not even restricting calories anymore, I'm eating, I'm at a healthy weight, I try to tell myself to just do better and do your best today for eating but I really don't know what to do. It's getting bad because it's affecting my grades too. I've dealt with a lot of mental breakdowns and honestly gone through a lot of things and I have to admit, I really want to go to therapy but I don't think my parents realize how these problems are affecting me. I try to tell them but I guess they lack the knowledge and don't really think about it (and they're busy with work too so they're stressed and I understand)

My parents are low key the reason why I kind of binge eat though. Or let's put it that way - they can't stop me. There's no one in the house. I mean I know u binge eat because u binge eat but sometimes I just feel lonely. I'm usually alone at home until 7 pm or 8 , so when I binge there's really no stopping me - I could go out and take a walk but that's usually after a binge.

I found my way to this sub recently because of some current struggles and read the pinned info, and I think it fits? I have trouble regulating how much I eat. Sometimes it's a lot, other times extremely little, but all of it is surrounded with huge guilt and shame for even eating. I used to have these episodes as a teen where my heart would start racing, and I'd feel extremely weak, but it wasn't anxiety. A few years ago, I had the same feeling again but would up being carted away in an ambulance and being admitted to the hospital with hypokalemia induced tachycardia. Now I'm back in sort of the same mental space I was in back then. Extreme shame and guilt around eating, calorie counting, reading every nutritional facts label/ ingredient list, and obsessively buying health foods all to manage my weight. I can't stand to look at myself in the mirror because what I see makes me feel gross. When I feel shame about what I've eaten after I've eaten it, I'll focus on it so intently that I feel nauseous and it helps curb the desire to eat. I have been diagnosed with CPTSD and it feels like a lot of what I'm experiencing intertwines with that, but I'm not sure if this is an independent issue and should be treated that way?

The doctors never found a cause for the hypokalemia and suggested I just ""eat better"". My parents told me to walk off the tachycardia episodes when I started having them as a teen, so that never went anywhere. I'm seeing a couple of therapists now, one for trauma the other for gender dysphoria. The prior is specially trained on EDs and I've brought up that I've been concerned a few times, but she doesn't seem concerned. Should I not be concerned because she isn't concerned? Do I *need* to come out with this info to her? I don't know how to handle this.",1673574042.0

I had an episode on last Wednesday where i experienced a hyperglycemic like episode. it has been 9 days now since it all started. I am now worried about refeeding and how long it will last, and if I'm doing something wrong.i know i am experiencing it.

I'm scared because a few days ago i woke up with both my arms numbs, heart pounding, sweaty and mouth dry/dehydrated and very disoriented. I felt so much dread, and generally believe i was going to have a heart attack. Each time i nearly drifted to sleep felt like i was falling and like i stopped breathing for a moment...which scared me and woke me up. I feel like i might have had a seizure or something honestly (i have had seizures before but due to blood being drawn). 

I have been feeling a little better compared to day 1 to 4...but i keep starting to feel bad again.... like dizzy and chest pain, heart palpitation, nauseous, tight chest, fatigue, etc.... 

I'm scared i am not doing all that i need to recover properly. I have been drinking 3 protein shake a day, snacking on something every 2 hours and trying to hold food down, but I'm scared i will overfeed too quickly and hurt myself more.

He also tends to avoid eating in front of others, and displays general obsessions/fantasies about food. Since this began, he has lost a considerable amount of fat and muscle mass.

Perhaps understandably, he becomes very defensive when questioned about these issues and responds with supposed scientific facts and statistics from YouTube doctors he watches.

873,Help needed regarding the relationship with food.,1,108ktfk,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/108ktfk/help_needed_regarding_the_relationship_with_food/,0,"Hello everyone :)

during the past two years I started realizing that the reason why my mood would crash intensely multiple times a day was caused by food.

A few minutes after having had a meal, I reach a mental mental state where I feel in the verge of having a panic attack. I reach extreme low moods, I'm emotionally very unstable and I'm unable to do any tasks that requires mental effort.

Not only am I physically exhausted, but mentally. This lasts for about two hours, and it progressively worsens over time until it reaches a peak. Then, the effect fades very quickly. And I'm not sure whether this is something other people have to go through every day, nor if this is considered an ED (as in, it's a problem that stems for a psychological factor).

This has led me to only have a small quantity of tofu for breakfast and then have a dinner at night, packed with lots of vegetables, carbs, protein and a bit of sugar from fruits or chocolatey-snacks. And this is already hard.

And what's more interesting. During the day, if I don't have any additional meals, my mood get better over time. Which is the polar opposite of what happens once I eat.

I'd really appreciate any kind of input, since within my social environment nobody is has faced such problems with eating. It makes me feel lost and not understood.

Thank you a lot in advance! :D",1673384395.0

I am not sure of an exact date of when it start but I do remember one day. I just remember it happening when one day I came home and hid a pizza from everyone, walked to my room and than ate the entire pizza to myself. Following this I just started crying feeling upset with myself and disgusted. This has really taken over a lot of my mental and it hurts me to say, but it makes me hate myself.

Since that day, I have noticed that I would eat lunch at work or I would eat dinner with my girlfriend and than on the way home I would get a random urge to stop by like McDonalds or Jack in the Box and I would order so much food and go home and eat it all and feel terrible mentally and physically afterwards. I know that I am already full but it‚Äôs like something I can‚Äôt resist and I will go buy more food until i‚Äôm stuffed. 

I really need help, it has taken a total on my weight and on my mental health and I have been trying to get better but I am really struggling. I want to look for help, but where I live there are not many options for help or many therapists that deal with eating disorder.

I would do it more at stressful times, sometimes daily, multiple times a day, especially when I was alone. I would go through periods of what I called ""healthiness"" where I would obsessively go to the gym and eat extremely restrictively for a month, but then crash and binge and purge over and over again. Sometimes I would sit in bed for a week and just binge and purge all evening. I would go to the grocery store late at night and buy things to binge and purge. I was at a point where I didn't think it was possible for me get out of that never ending loop

The thing is, I was never at an ""unhealthy"" body weight. Is that why I never received a diagnosis? My family doctor didn't let me look at my weight when checking me, and referred me to a psychotherapist. The psychotherapist I went to was incredibly expensive, and didn't help much.

I eventually learned to cope with my anxiety in healthier ways, though I still binge and purge from time to time, and struggle with the ""ED"" way of thinking about myself and food.

Is it okay if I say I had Bulimia nervosa? I'm not sure what to name this thing I struggled with. It seems to me that I wasn't ""sick enough"" for this term, especially because I feel like I got better by myself. I'm not sure how to properly describe what I went through and underline the seriousness of what I went through, but at the same time not disrespecting people who have been diagnosed.",1673288921.0

Everything changed in fall 2020. Since then, I have been struggling w what fits the description of night eating syndrome. I wake up EVERY night abt an hour and half after falling asleep feeling like I will DIE if I dont eat before going back to bed. I also feel the need to eat between dinner and bedtime. 

I have done literally everything I can think of to address this. Nutritionists, therapy, psychiatry, getting blood work to see if this is an endro issue, totally changing my sleep hygiene, totally changing my diet & the times i eat. Nothing works. 

This has been completely destroying my quality of life. I wake up every morning to crumbs or wrappers & feel triggered. I am struggling w extremely, extremely severe depression. To make matters worse, doctors are asking to lose weight as I am now ‚Äúobese.‚Äù 

I dont know what else to do. I would enter an ED program if NES was taken seriously. A day program wouldnt work, as I am only symptomatic after abt 8pm. 

For what its worth, I also have long covid & am curious if that might be partially responsible for this.

I know they get a lot of comments at home about from parents about their looks/body, it's not a happy home life. They've told me stuff like they just always feel like they've done something wrong. They get hungry but can't eat because they don't feel like they've ""earned it"". They had a rough break up recently and seeing that person unexpectedly (which happens because of work) can trigger them not to eat.

We've talked about a lot, but this is something I don't know how to talk about safely. Sometimes they're happy to tell me what they ate if it's a good day, and I try to be encouraging. Sometimes they reach out when it's a bad day too, and all I can think to say is that they deserve to treat themselves well, food doesn't have to be earned, and thank them for their honesty.

I've asked them how they're doing with it a couple times, but I don't know if that's the right thing to do. Should I talk to them more about it, find out what has helped in the past? Or just continue to be supportive when they feel like talking about it?",1673193953.0

I didn't see anything in the rules about not being allowed to ask this, but i do understand this is a tricky question and i will absolutely remove it if asked.

I would consider myself recovered or at the very least in remission from atypical ana. in the years since, i have steadily gained weight (as i had always been chubby before the worst of it), and while it was fine before, im approaching a weight that's hazardous to my health. 

I have been attempting safe weight loss with a personal trainer since september of 2021. I enjoy exercise and building muscle, but the dieting is where i struggle. As soon as i have to start tracking my food, i either start to get way too into it, or the feeling of being in a defecit makes me panic. She agrees that i shouldnt be doing it under these circumstances, but it looks like ill have to make it work somehow if i want to return to a healthy weight. 

i do have some medications that destabalize my hunger cues, but im unsure about trying new ones as i really, really need the stability right now. 

Maybe this is an impossible question to answer, but i would really appreciate some outside perspective on how to approach this. ill happily give additional details if asked! thank you for reading, please move on if this is hard for you to think about.",1673167547.0

I'm a psychology student and I'm currently working on a research paper for my Bachelor's degree. 

People of all ages are allowed to participate. After all, eating disorders can be developed at any time and I'm also interested in seeing and comparing the various ways it affects different age groups and how people manage to cope and interact with others while struggling with such a difficult and life-changing disorder. 

The reason why I chose this topic is that I am a recovered anorexic myself and I'm making it my goal now to raise awareness on this matter and delve deeper into it... but this can't happen without your help! 

As much as I need your answers though, I must admit this can be extremely triggering so please don't participate if you're in recovery or you simply feel this would be too much for you right now.

For anonymity sake I‚Äôm not going to get into what it is, but this lead to a horrible relationship with food I never knew how to even attempt to brooch without my family. Essentially it lead to a purging disorder. Food made me feel sick so I ate and purged, not only that but the bloating was horrible, this then ended up spiraling horribly into a full blown body dysmorphic disorder where I every time I looked into the mirror I just felt like I looked fat. I started restricting food severely and used an app to make sure I stayed at an unsustainable calorie intake while still purging, eventually I almost ended up hospitalized at 18 and luckily around the same time discovered my food allergy and ended up going to college and getting therapy. I never told my mom about my eating disorder, I knew it would just turn her even more obsessive and micromanaging than she already is and I wasn‚Äôt ready for that. I‚Äôm still not. That‚Äôs been a chapter of my life I fought hard to close and I look in the mirror now at my heaviest weight ever (still a healthy weight mind you) and I feel beautiful and healthy and happy. Problem is I was at college almost solidly for almost a year, coming home my mom suggested we go on a weight loss diet journey together to be ‚Äúhealthy again‚Äù. The thing is I am healthy and I know myself, I know if I go on the diet I‚Äôll stop eating, I‚Äôll purge everything I do eat when I inevitably binge again during it, I‚Äôll obsess to the extreme because that‚Äôs who I am. She keeps pushing it because she wants someone to do it with her, but every time she asks me what I weigh now and every time she says ‚Äúyou‚Äôll fit this when you lose the college weight‚Äù I feel like I‚Äôm breaking a bit more. I know this has turned into a rant, but I just feel like I‚Äôm spiraling again and I was so happy before I went home.

I want to tell you about MY success story for those of you feeling stuck.  
I struggled with eating disorders + disordered eating for 17 years.  That's more than half my life.  From age 11 when I was diagnosed with anorexia, through my teen years when I battled with diabetes and my eating and into my adulthood where binging and restricting took over my life.  It was an endless cycle.  


I had it bad.  I was constantly at war with my body.  I HATED everything I saw in the mirror.  
I tried to make meal plans, I researched programs the best diets  
I wrote everything out, I tried to keep the binge foods out of the house  
I was OBSESSED with food: what I ate, when I was going to eat next, how much I would get to eat, what I was craving, what I wanted but couldn't have  


It would get to the point where I couldn't take it any more.  The cookies were all I could think about.  They were calling my name.  I couldn't help it.  After having one - the floodgates were open and I would binge on anything I could find.  
Rinse and repeat  
For years  


I thought there was no hope. That I was just going to live this life forever.  Because I'd tried EVERYTHING I could think of to stop it.   


I was REALLY lucky that someone came to me with something different.  A new way to look at my body, myself, and my food that I'd never even thought of before.  


I am really lucky to, after 3 years, call myself fully recovered.  
I am lucky to be able to eat without guilt  
To be able to understand and listen to my hunger and fullness cues  
To enjoy foods that were once forbidden or trigger foods  
To exercise for pleasure and be able to take a day (or three) off  
To be able to enjoy travelling without worrying about food or how I look  
To focus on my hobbies or what makes me happy, and not think about food all day  
To be okay with eating a little more  
To having binging and food obsession be a thing of the past  


I am so AMAZED by my life now

Well, I guess sometimes I starved because I had a HORRIBLE sleep schedule, the worst you could think of, but it's gotten better recently.

The other day my mom commented that my cheeks were getting fat and that they used to look skinny before. That didn't make me feel good. Then I remembered a time when we were measuring our weights with a scale at school for records, when I went up my classmates said in a positive tone (rough translation) ""(name) is skinnyyy"" and then when I got on and it said [insert the number that comes up when you search normal weight for sixteen year old girl], there was a pause and someone said ""seriously??"" and I didn't think much of it at the time but now that it's happened twice in the same year it makes me feel bad. They probably reacted like that because my arms and legs are skinny but under the uniform, the fat went to my stomach. I always thought that I looked pregnant but now I look 2 months pregnant.

Some background, I am a 21F, less than a month away from 22 Female with PCOS. Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. With this my body is prone to gaining weight and resistant to losing weight... I haven't been at what most would consider a ""healthy weight"" for my height since middle school. I had a lot of bullying from school AND my father ever since. 

I dealt with Anorexia for a short period of time my Senior year. A friend caught me the day I was gonna go 24 hours without eating anything. I have always felt like I don't have the right to say I dealt with Anorexia because even then I felt maybe I was over exaggerating. Like it wasn't as bad as it was... because I still ate at least once or twice a day. 

Now it has been 2 years since then and... I thought I was able to recognize when it came back but... 2 days ago I went 24 hours without eating and I blamed it on, oh I was at work. Then I was sleeping. Then I didn't want to come out of my room because my dad was home and I didn't want to deal with him. But... I confessed to my counselor about that yesterday and she wants to meet this morning at 9am to talk more about this. 

The only problem is I have a 9am mandatory training meeting for work at the same time that I forgot about when I told her I could meet. I struggled with choosing which one but ultimately chose to go to my counseling meeting and I would go to a different house training meeting. I work in a group home for wards of the state btw. I told a coworker/old high school friend. They said and I quote, ""I'm sorry you‚Äôre going through a difficult time with your eating cycle, but it frustrates me that you‚Äôre completely ditching the meeting."" And I told her I'm not completely ditching. Just going to a different meeting and she just sent back, ""Whatever."" 

After that I felt guilty for choosing my mental and physical health over the meeting but... I don't know. I can't believe that she of all people would say that. It's not JUST an eating disorder. After I told my counselor and she said she wanted to meet again tomorrow rather than follow up in the weekly meeting it made me chuckle cause I thought, ""huh I worried her."" And I laughed it off.

My best friend (29) does and has had a restrictive ED for the majority of their life. They have been in and out of treatment all these years and as a result made a lot of friends through the treatment centers. Unfortunately, very recently, a friend of theirs from one of the treatment centers passed away as a result of her ED. 

I wouldn't say the reaction is solely grief based due to how my friend talked to me about it last night. They said in a way they felt envious of their friend who passed not because of wanting self harm but because ""she won"". It has triggered my friend into a possible relapse and I'm very worried. They admitted to me, that this happens every time someone from treatment has passed away, and this recent one marks five friends who have died. 

I have known my best friend for almost 2 years now, and this is the first time I am supporting them through this. I convinced them to have dinner last night even though they were upset and angry about it, and to not fall into the habit of only drinking ensures again or nothing at all.

In my childhood years, I think age 5, I developed a restrictive eating disorder. I finally began recovering when I was 16.
Growing up, I never really had any symptoms of like not eating 
 Like no lightheadedness, headaches, anything like that
However, now that I am eating more, I find that inbetween meals I get, what I assume to be low blood sugar
 I also generally wake up like this too. Like, at night, I'll wake up multiple times  and I'll need to eat something in order to fall back asleep. If I manage to fall asleep without eating, my symptoms in the morning are much worse. 

My symptoms aren't like dreadful, but when I am at work I find myself unable to go throughout my whole shift since near the middle to end I will get super lightheaded and faint, I'll have to sneak a little snack on something in order to feel better.

I was wondering if these things might be caused by my past eating disorder?
Is it possible it has harmed my body in some way ? Or is this just a hurtle to overcomr?

And also ! Since I grew up with an eating disorder, I am incredibly mal informed on good eating habits. Like, I work at a resturant and at the end we get to take home a meal. I always end up taking w a y more than I need.

i told her the last thing i‚Äôll do is pry on her to get help, and that all i‚Äôll be is a support in her life who she can talk to.

In my last post I mentioned how I'd been avoiding eating because thinking of food makes me feel sick. I cannot stop thinking about where I'm going, what food is there, what I'll eat and how much. 

This has gotten worse. If I eat too much or at the wrong time it feels like I'm going to puke or die. Probably both. Eating less eases my anxiety and makes me feel more in control.

On top of that, I've lost some weight in last 1-2 weeks and thoughts about weight have joined my obsession about food. I don't remember how good weight loss feels until it's gone, and now I'm afraid to gain it back. I'm terrified that I'm going to lose control and start binging again, and not be able to stop until my stomach is bursting.

I know I'm not eating much. Sometimes I forget I'm supposed to eat at all. I carry nutritional/meal replacement drinks and fruit yogurt packets on me. If I don't eat that I don't eat anything, except when I get lunch or dinner only to pick it apart until I'm ""full"". My breakfast is just coffee.

Is it as bad as it sounds? Even if I divide it up so I'm at least getting decent food during some part of the day?  Like if I miss breakfast I'll have fruit or yogurt for lunch and/or some real food for dinner. 

I'm not trying to starve or skip food groups, but I just can't eat anymore. I'm worried that I'm going to start binging again but tbh, I'm not getting any pleasure whatsoever from the food I do eat.

But there is no easy answer. It just, happened.

Ever since I can remember I‚Äôve been comparing myself to others, always thinking that I never measured up. Everyone else was always prettier, thinner, funnier and overall better than me. I let these ideas consume my head, and when I went to college, they only got worse. Let‚Äôs just say that joining a sorority was probably not the best idea for someone like me. Thrown into an environment where all of the sudden you have countless new ‚Äúsisters,‚Äù told which frats you should be seen at, going to parties where girls were throwing themselves on guys they didn‚Äôt even know, was not exactly my scene. My saving grace was that I actually made my own friends apart from that whom I love and cherish. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not blaming a sorority for my problems, but it definitely helped to perpetuate my feelings of inadequacy.

It started with constant exercise and watching what I ate. Then came the calorie counting. That became so obsessive to the point where I wouldn‚Äôt even put seasoning on my food, for fear of ‚Äúextra‚Äù calories in my body. Every little fold of skin became a nuisance. Soon enough, I was living a double life. I started lying to everyone, my parents, friends and even worse, myself.

Soon enough, my life came down to looking at the inside of a toilet bowl. The skinnier I became, the happier I was. Or at least that‚Äôs what I told myself. Every dinner out was the same. Eat, feel full, feel gross, then throw up. When I would visit my parents at home I would lie to them and say I had to call a friend. But really I was walking down the block so I could find a spot to throw up the dinner I had just consumed. That one is hard to admit.

Of course anxiety and depression eventually settled into my brain. Everything that I saw as right was in fact so twisted beyond belief. My life turned into an endless cycle of binging and purging, and binging and purging. Every thought was spent obsessing over food. I would dread every meal, then when the time came to eat, I ate so much I would feel sick, and you know what comes after that. At most I would binge and purge multiple times daily. It was a great day when it only happened once.

I still remember that look. The look on my friends faces who I hadn‚Äôt seen in a while, and they realized how skinny I had become. That was the look I tried to run away from because I didn‚Äôt want to face the truth. But one day as I looked into the mirror at my bony body, the truth reared its ugly head. I was disgusting. The perfection body I strived for and mutilated myself for so long was far from what I was seeing. I was a hollow shell of the person I once was. My thoughts, feelings and emotions weren‚Äôt even my own anymore. I was a ghost. It was in that moment I actually had the thought of completing the act...you know what that is. Thank heavens it was enough to scare me and jilt me out of that state. I immediately acted and reached out to my family.

What transpires next is the most arduous fight to become a person again. I had no idea who I was or who I wanted to be, as I had lost all sense of self. My next steps were to relearn who I was as a friend, daughter, sister and a person. The next few months were spent going to countless appointments each week, all while attending my classes in college. Every week I was examined by doctors and professionals. It was fucking annoying but I knew it‚Äôs what I had to do. I was approached by my therapist about medication and I immediately was turned off. Why would I need to take a pill to help myself feel better? I wanted to do that work all on my own. Later I did agree to take medication, and learned that the merriment between medicine and my own personal work can be a formula for success. For months there were ups and downs, trying to break my old habits and reform my relationship with food and my mind. The thing that sucks about an eating disorder is that you can‚Äôt just abstain from the thing you have a problem with. You unfortunately need food to survive and are surrounded by it at all times.

I told myself that on this journey it was okay be selfish. It was okay to turn down plans to spend time with myself. I often would go hiking and immerse myself in nature, making myself feel small. It was in those precious moments where I felt as if no one could judge me, not even the person I was before. I tried to regain the sense of beauty in the world again, the things that made me laugh and smile again.

Now that I‚Äôm at the point in my life where I‚Äôm considering having children, it pains me to look back on my experiences. My sister has a daughter and it would heartbreaking to see her go through something like that, any of her children for that matter. I can‚Äôt imagine what my parents must have felt to see their daughter repeatedly hurt herself and not love herself. With that being, as ugly as this experience was, it is mine. It is and forever will be a part of my story. Of course there are times where I wish it have never happened, but that‚Äôs not an option. I have accepted my eating disorder because it‚Äôs part of me and made me who I am today. I don‚Äôt regret anything because the perseverance and tenacity I acquired as a result from these struggles is something that no one can take away.

Every day is still a struggle. I still find myself laying in bed at night and going through everything I ate that day. I still look at myself in the mirror and sometimes wish I saw something different. I have the most loving and supportive friends and family. I am grateful for them, but true happiness stems from being comfortable and accepting of who you are, and I‚Äôm still working on that. Self love is a tricky thing. But at the end of the day we are all a work in progress.",1672843641.0

- i dont think i see my body correctly its weird and I dont know how to explain it but its like deformed but I know its not and its just uncomfortable
- i avoid eating foods that I know have a lot of carbohydrates
- i have started to do a lot more exercise than before
- my sister told me shes worried I might be developing an ed (mainly why i came here and the reasons I previously stated are some symptoms she told me about)
- there are certain food textures I avoid at all costs literally will never eat a food if i distlike the texture

Why i think i might not have an ed?
- after going through periods where i try to eat nothing every day I cant sleep and end up eating like a lot of food so I guess I like make up for the food I didnt eat during the week ( i end up feeling kinda bad about that but its more like anxiety idk)
- i dont wanna loose weight (i mean i sorta do but I wouldnt like starve myself for it,,,, my food thing is more of a control thing like it just gives me satisfaction to be able to control my eating in a way yk)
- i have depression ocd and extreme anxiety and my psychiatrist just changed some of my meds so it might be a side effect?
Or an ocd thing
Or just an anxiety thing
- i have picky eating habits so it mightve developed more 
Or im being paranoid

Im sorry if this is not the sub for this stuff if it isnt can anybody tell me where I can ask about this? im starting to get genuenly scared after my sister noticed it too
Are these signs of an ed???
Does anybody know how to stop it from happening if these are signs of developing an ed??
Am i just being paranoid?

English isnt my first lenguage sorry if this is confusing.

EDIT: thank you so much for the people who have commented I have now realised that the eating a lot og food at once is also a sign or something and its nice to see that I caught on early im not as scared as when I made this post thanks to that to all the people who told me to talk about it with someone I took your adviced and have scheduled a meeting with my psychologist on saturday thank everyone siriusly so much for commenting

EDIT 2: somebody dm me and ask me if I just started making myself puke or some of the other things like this week and I came to clear up that ive been puking and what you guys told me is restricting/binging for like 2 months now I cant exactly pinpoint when each happened but I know I started making myself puke before restricting/binging my sister brought it up to me on monday of this week and I guess ive been sorta denying what was happening and putting it aside but when my sister brought it up I got scared and posted here ( again sorry for my english and punctuation)",1672806093.0

I wasn‚Äôt necessarily a heavy child but my biological mom put it in my head that I was close to being obese as a young girl/tween/teenager. Body image issues have plaques me for as long as I can remember, and my mother was a big factor in that. As a shorter girl my weight fluctuated but I was always healthy looking. I was active having been involved in sports or yoga, Pilates, spin.  My mom was obsessed with my weight, always restricting foods, giving me sugary sodas on treat days, making me go to the gym for hours on end. When I was at my heaviest, thank you first year of university buffet meal halls, she absolutely lost it. Comparing me to others, making comments that no one could love someone so unhealthy looking, how could I be her daughter and be so overweight etc. One day I woke up and realized she was extremely toxic and cut her from my life. Literally packed my stuff, booked a flight for the same day and ghosted her forever. It‚Äôs been eleven years and I‚Äôm still recovering from the emotional and mental abuse I endured. My therapist is amazing. 

But that brings me to my current relationship with food.
I‚Äôm recovering from an episode of cyclic vomiting syndrome where I was hospitalized twice for it and lost a crazy amount of weight in a short time.  The problem is when I got to this weight I was finally happy looking in the mirror. For the first time I had a flat stomach, something I had always chased after, and something my mother always reinforced I would never have. I love how my body looks, how small I feel, all the compliments I‚Äôve received of people telling me I look great. 

I‚Äôve been slowly recovering since the summer when this happened but now I‚Äôm afraid to gain back weight. Im always hungry. I don‚Äôt eat breakfast as I get nauseous thinking of having solids before noon. I survive on coffee and multivitamins. I would probably be considered underweight for my age/height. My energy levels and muscle mass aren‚Äôt what they used to be. I know I need to change something but I‚Äôm struggling with where to start. I eat healthy by having to conform to a gluten free dairy free due to food allergies. I make most of my food, rarely go out to eat.  My therapist is helping me work through my food & mother related mental trauma but now I need ways or coping mechanisms to be truly healthy. I know I‚Äôm on a very slippery slope.",1672862315.0

The food I do eat is mostly not very healthy, I feel bad about it but pushing myself just made me feel more averse to more foods.

My dad's trying to lose weight (he's very overweight so in his case it's a health thing) but I'm pretty certain he's insecure about it. Because he'll like make me and my brother feel fat and stuff. In my case more indirectly, I feel bad for my brother though like dad's made a joke about it loudly in public ;-;
So anyways dad will do stuff like mention I'm eating a lot, depending on his mood he'll either laugh about it, make some sort of comment about it, or just give me a look. Not every time, just enough to bother me. I started sneaking small snacks upstairs after dinner so I could continue eating without him seeing, I still get hunger and an appetite but no will to do it, mostly just eating when it's expected or I'm directly told to (unless it's a snack like chips or a sweet in which case when I eat it it's kinda the opposite lol), even if I'm literally eating dinner I'll position my plate so he won't see/notice it, stuff like that.
Also something personal has been going on where my mom and brother have to leave for a couple of weeks at a time (sometimes an extra week) so it's just me and dad. He makes less comments but he'll complain more about his own weight which makes me uncomfortable and since I mostly eat just a couple of snacks before he calls from work to check on me so I don't have to lie about eating, I eat a lot during dinner, and when he's on the phone with mom and brother he'll laugh about how much I ate (for example I've loved chicken - I still like it a lot but at this point I keep going for it because that's like one of the traits some of my family uses to define my eating lol - and if he doesn't want it I'll have like the entire chicken but still be hungry, but that may be because I have a sensory disorder that might affect my feeling full so I only feel full when I'm too full and it hurts). I honestly didn't notice how I've been getting less interested in eating most foods until a little while after their last return home where me, mom, and grandma were in a store and we were getting bananas and mom said we should eat them soon if we want to because dad may eat the whole bunch in like a day (sounds like an exaggeration but it honestly isn't) and I joked that he'll do that but get upset if I get seconds when eating.  The joke did not go as I planned. Mom asked if that's why I didn't eat much while she was away, I didn't know it would be that noticeable, so I told her and she said I even lost weight by then (she checked and said I did. I'm still in the middle of a healthy weight for my age though) and basically now I realize how bad I've gotten, and because of that I feel both really big and really skinny at the same time. Like it feels like my stomach and thighs are huge while my arms and face are like bone-thin, I didn't even know I was insecure about my stomach and legs being big but here we are, I don't see it like that though so it's not like some kind of dysmorphia it's just how it feels. I also keep grabbing my wrists because my hand can wrap all the way around them but that's not really making me feel any better lol

Anyways mom's making me write dad a note - he does stupid things sometimes that he doesn't fully realize he's doing no matter how bad it is, and if he does he doesn't realize how it may affect others, and he has changed before when I asked him to, but I really hate bringing down the mood and he's been so happy these past few days, I really don't want to bring it up unless it gets too bad. I can't even remember him doing it now because I like gaslight myself or something everytime I tell someone about something bad and so now I feel like I spontaneously made it up when I know I have no commitment to things like this unless it's true but either way I like subconsciously trained myself to forget things that prove my point or something and idk what to do. I probably should've realized it was a problem a while ago when I started wanting to quit eating so I'd have to expand my diet but not doing it because it'd both get unwanted attention and also it may not even work, then just wanting to quit eating in general but still doing it because I didn't wanna get grumpy or anything.

I have been disordered since 4th grade and have been in recovery on and off since middle school. I‚Äôm 20 now and I‚Äôm doing pretty well all things considered. 
The issue is I just can‚Äôt stop either measuring myself or counting calories. I‚Äôve tried so many times. When I stop one I do the other constantly, and the idea of stopping both at the same time is terrifying to me.

My fear revolves around two things:
1. Fashion is important to me. I attribute my disorderedness partially to my passion for self expression. I don‚Äôt have enough money or time to buy a new wardrobe that I love, and I‚Äôm scared if I stop tracking my size I will stop fitting in my well-loved and painstakingly curated wardrobe.
Every item I‚Äôve outgrown has been one I‚Äôve mourned and kept as a memory. I don‚Äôt try to fit in them again, to clarify. I just love the art of clothing.
2. Metabolism. I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve done maybe irreparable damage to my metabolism. I still eat well below the recommended daily caloric intake for a person my height age and weight. I make sure I get enough nutrients, eat three meals daily, and I snack when I feel hungry, but I manage my calories at the number I do because I‚Äôm scared if I eat more I‚Äôll gain weight. 

I know I need to get more comfortable with weight gain, but I feel like in every other area of my life I‚Äôm finally coming into myself and beginning to express who I am, and I don‚Äôt know if I could emotionally endure losing most of my favorite clothes. I made all of my friends through fashion. It‚Äôs taken years to cultivate my taste and build a wardrobe I love. I just don‚Äôt think I could do it.

I also don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd even gain weight necessarily if I eat more, because I‚Äôve heard sometimes in recovery when you eat more you can speed up your metabolism again. Is that true?

I dunno. I‚Äôve lived the last few years like this comfortably but im so tired of late nights meal planning and denying myself things I want and comparing myself to everyone and crafting an identity around being small and delicate. I just notice how everyone compliments me on my worst weeks when I‚Äôve lost control and lost weight. All anyone has to say about me is how cute and little I am. I just am so scared to let go.
I think maybe I‚Äôm scared that who I am inside, like whoever I would be if I wasn‚Äôt disordered, the version of me who doesn‚Äôt rely on cuteness to get by socially‚Äî the me who is judged on her competence and merit, not her ability to morph into a conventionally beautiful shape‚Äî isn‚Äôt actually any good. I‚Äôm scared that in reality I am incompetent and not able to hold my own. 
And people can tell me I am competent, but I have to be able to prove it to myself and I don‚Äôt know if I can. I don‚Äôt know if I can put in that much work.",1672812226.0

I think i might have ARFID(Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder) ever since I was a kid I've always been deemed ""picky"" causing my grandparents to make me sit at the dinner table for hours until I ate everything on my plate i would bawl my eyes out until I finally finished my food but finally it was realized that I'm not just picky it's more than that. I have safe foods that I'll usually eat almost all the time. I also have ADHD and I've talked to friends that have ADHD and struggle justblike I do with eating. My issue also is that my grandparents don't have a microwave anymore and don't have ready to eat foods (ik it's not healthy but it's all I have the energy to make most of the time) we don't have my safe foods either and most of the time my grandma makes food that my brain won't let me eat these past two days I've had 2 half meals and I'm scared that it's getting really bad. I don't want to talk to a doctor about it because they will send me to a treatment center and the state I live in is horrible with mental health facilities.

I'm seventeen (f) and I'm overweight I've kind of been overweight my whole life. And it's so dehumanizing to be in society sometimes. Like why? At some point of covid lockdown I lost a lot of weight. At first it was healthy. Until it developed into an obsession. The more compliments I got the more obsessed I became. I've never had anyone say things to me about my body like this before. I felt intense guilt when I didn't fo it. I put myself through hard diets to keep up with(they were healthy but just a lot of work) I would keep pushing even though I was burnt out. But at some point I broke. No matter how skinny I became. I became sick and gained some weight. I hated myself. I tried to throw up. I tried to kill myself.

I've been trying to heal my relationship with exercise, activity and nutrition. But I sometimes go weeks without exercising and feel guilt. I feel like an exercise has to make me feel so tired to the point I fall for it to work. I eat whatever and alot of it in uncontrolled portions. Sometimes I don't eat at all.

I guess I‚Äôve always (or for a while) been a bit worried about if the food I‚Äôm eating is properly cooked and is safe to eat and that I won‚Äôt get ill from it . I would avoid ordering chicken at restaurants since I found out what salmonella is. I don‚Äôt like having bbq‚Äôs at other peoples house cause I don‚Äôt trust the cooking (I can just about trust my dads bbq cooking but I still don‚Äôt eat chicken). I hate hate hate eating anything that is out of date even just by a day. I get anxious if I see my mum/dad handling raw meat and worry the chopping boards weren‚Äôt properly washed before it‚Äôs used for something else I‚Äôll eat. I don‚Äôt trust my own cooking, and spend ridiculous amounts of time searching on the internet to see if I‚Äôve got food poisoning. I don‚Äôt trust the food at school that contains meat but that leaves me with little options about what to get which leads me onto the main problem I have now:

Since starting college in September I‚Äôve only eaten lunch at college a handful of times. I usually just bring in a snack bar or crisps and have that. My lack of eating started as I would get anxiety at college (I expected this at the beginning as I have a history of anxiety) so I would feel nauseous and didn‚Äôt want to eat. I didn‚Äôt plan on not eating for this long I thought I would only do it for a week. I do eat dinner at home. Now as I realised that I‚Äôve gotten skinnier I don‚Äôt care that I don‚Äôt eat lunch or breakfast. I keep going back and forth from the mindset of not wanting to eat to wanting to avoid the eating disorder route. 

Sorry this has gotten so long I‚Äôm currently a bit of a teary mess. I‚Äôm not sure if my eating habits are coming from my anxiety or something else. Any advice would be very appreciated as I‚Äôm feeling quite lost at the moment and with nobody to talk to about this. Thank you for reading all this or just part of it.",1672789874.0

I did the math yesterday and my brain finally processed just how much he wasn‚Äôt getting his daily caloric & nutrition needs. (not divulging more information). I knew he didn‚Äôt eat a lot already and have talked to him about it in the past, but it all just kind of clicked. I think his stomach hurts when he eats more because of an ED (I‚Äôm not a medical professional). He also gets really bad migraines, so I don‚Äôt know how I didn‚Äôt piece all this together sooner. 

I was talking to him about it and he‚Äôs open to trying to meet his daily food requirements in nutrients and calories. 

The only thing now is I don‚Äôt know how to go about it. I know he can get severe stomach aches (my guess is from under eating) and I worry if we just start trying to meet healthy amounts that it will trigger sever cramps and aches. Should we just try and power through if so? Or should be build up? I‚Äôm also worried he struggle to maintain the healthier- necessary to live- lifestyle. I also don‚Äôt know how this all would interact with trying to be more active in the new year considering he works in IT. (This is simply about muscle use, because he isn‚Äôt active throughout the day)

I just want a long, happy life together and I want his body to be well nourished. I also know use it or lose it and I want us to be running around till we‚Äôre 80. How do we up his food intake that not/upset in the least possible way, and possibly also doing all of this while increasing exercise?",1672641415.0

Cut to college, i had a glow up and i lost a lot of my weight and became what people conventionally call beautiful. I felt awesome.

But then covid hit,  and due to lack of exercise i gained a couple of kilos. I was a bit bothered by it because i hated when people told me ""what happened, you look fat"" etc etc. This made  a huge impact on my eating habits and i started eating less. But i would have way less energy to carry on throughout the day.

So while i lost all my covid weight, i stopped worrying about my weight and started eating healthy and stuff that actually gave me energy. I gained weight bc of it but at this point i stopped caring and was finally happy with how i looked. 

Today i was with a grp of friends. One guy takes one look at me and says ""did you gain weight? You look pregnant "". Shit like this never bothered me. But somehow it did today. Now I'm in distress and wanna start skipping meals again. I know that's not gonna help but i cant stand the thought of eating food anymore.
