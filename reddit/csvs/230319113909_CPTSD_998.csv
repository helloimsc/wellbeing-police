**BIPOC**

We recognize that healing communities such as [r/CPTSD](https://old.reddit.com/r/CPTSD) are not exempt from the insidious impacts of racism, whether overt or covert (for example, invalidating, minimizing, or microaggressive comments made by those with good intentions). In these cases, we encourage users to report the comments as Rule #3 violations. Because of the subreddit's high profile and open nature, this problem will continue to be with us, and we therefore can only promise a ""safe-ish"" environment for BIPOC. Racial trauma will always be on topic here at /r/CPTSD, but BIPOC users that want a more closed space can make use of /r/cptsd_bipoc. *Thank you to the mod team at* /r/cptsd_bipoc *for helping us write this verbiage.*

[This](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LBPP7u12VfE) video I just saw of someone telling off their cat and making them sleep and close their eyes, and all of the comments are praising them. I guarantee you that cat doesn't  even know what she's mad about. Someone even said that's exactly how they've treated their child, and all the replies are calling her a good, compassionate (????) parent.

These people jump to punishment and try to find any little thing they can find to exert their authority, completely ignoring their pets feelings in place for their own. The real dilemma for me isn't that this happens, but that it's so common. It's difficult to live in a world where you know for a fact that so many people around you do this to their pets and kids (kids for whom it is an equally big issue, I'm talking about pets because of the video).

For those unaware, purely 'positive reinforcement' training with dogs is scientifically supported and will work with every dog. In fact it's very very important when rehabilitating a dog who's been abused. My point is that it is a fact you do not need to punish over and over.

I feel crazy for believing it when the vast majority of people would say I'm too sensitive and that it's not a problem. I hope as more and more scientific publishing's come out about the importance of positive reinforcement (an increasing trend over the last few decades) that it will slowly seep into the public consciousness, and that the future generations will be baffled at how we ever treated our own kids and pets with such contempt.",1679189904.0
14,How many communities/friends have you left?,9,11v3bwr,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11v3bwr/how_many_communitiesfriends_have_you_left/,7,"[I wanna start out by saying I'm not very good at explaining myself, so this might be wordier than it needs to be or I might be leaving some details out - for anyone who bothers reading or even cares.]

I used to be part of a lot of different communities when covid hit (and had some friends before it), and although my living situation was bad, It didn't really hit me then. I put up a facade of happiness and such, commented a lot and participated in their community events. I never truly felt I belonged and I always felt out of place, but didn't really put much thought into it.

One day it just ""hit me"". I guess I reached a point where the stress was too much and had a breakdown to the point where I no longer knew who I was. I still don't, but that doesn't matter. I started to feel more alien than usual. Everyone just seemed so happy and their life so different. They had nothing but positive things to say about their families/friends, they had supportive people in their lives and it seemed foreign to me. I couldn't fake it anymore, it felt nauseating to.

Eventually, I started to distance myself. I felt like I didn't belong. Like I had no right to be there. Not because they were mean to me, but it was just this ""feeling"" that's hard to explain. The feeling that they weren't any different from the people I knew in real life. The ones who don't understand mental illness despite claiming to, the type who think depression is the same as sadness, the type who end up blaming you for not getting better, even though you're trying, the type who want you to fake happiness for the sake of their fragile egos.

I've been doing a lot of self reflecting to the point where it's probably damaging, just trying to find myself. Hating my family for having me (I don't feel comfortable explaining why I hate them, no one would care anyway and it's something I have to fix myself). Anyway I got off topic. 😅

Am I the only one who feels like they don't belong anywhere. I'm kind of just frequenting forums dealing with depression for now. I feel I can at least relate to some degree more. Not sure how healthy it is, but wholesome stuff makes me nauseous, though I haven't figured out why yet.",1679179507.0

Today im in a bad situation, after a horrendous therapy session last week, and mothers day coming up tomorrow here in the UK.

Im utterly terrified because I know in this headspace I'm likely to OD soon,  and that's horrifying, but also feels like I'm losing control.  

I've had severe depression symptoms, but my therapist said she doesn't believe in clinical depression and thinks its all just trauma. This makes me want to seek help even less. 

I am too afraid to be admitted to psych ward,  and I have been refused support from the crisis team,  so people keep repeating ""what help is it that you want?""

I'm terrified of the system but terrified to carry on like this,  I live on my own and my distress right now is severe.  

Every option seems to end in terror.  Asking for help is is horrifying,  not asking for help is horrifying, staying alive is horrifying, being dead is horrifying.    But in many ways being dead feels like the only option, and I'm resisting it.

If I was always hyperaroused, then breathing would help, so it helps only half the time.

I so wish I could react to things right away, appropriately, then let them go. But that's not my system does, despite taking pills and having gone through several years of therapy (CBT stuff, some exposure). Like if I do exposure therapy, I can have days when I do it and it feels just fine because Im' distant emotionally. Other days just leaving the apartment for a five minute walk totally stresses me out. In other words, I am not like a normal patient who is afraid of spiders and then you gradually expose them and they recover. For me it can be everything and anything that disgusts me, terrifies me, reminds me of past trauma, whatever. Worse yet, I'm not always afraid of those things, as I mentioned.

i'm so fucking done.  i have friends who are ride or die for me.  but everytime they speak, i only hear my abusers.  i can't even tolerate them disagreeing with my recovery plans without taking it as a sign they're secretly abusive and planning on something against me.

but it can be so hard not to feel like he doesnt understand.  because i will explain as clearly as i can, and i get another huge wall of text that's trying to give me a pep talk about what i could do to feel better.  and then i get frustrated, feeling like i'm too stupid to communicate.  i wish he could just admit he isn't as good as he thinks he is at comprehending me and stuff.  but he can't.  and i get frustrated.

i know he is a faithful friend.  but sometimes.  i just hate him.  and then i hate myself for not being perfect.

i feel like i cant share myself with anyone now.  i've already isolated myself enough as it is.  now i cant even keep up the good relationships i have.  i'm sorrounded by darkness.

i've been given good friends and can't even appreciate them.  what kind of idiotic person am i???  i'm trying so hard to have faith things will work out even if i dont understand anything.  that's the only thing i'm proud of.  i'm proud that i'm trying despite everything feeling confusing. But everything else feels like it's going to hell.

i just dont talk.  and it feels like confidjng into any of my friends yields bad results.

i just want to crawl into a cave and never come out.  i dont want to hurt anyone else.  and i want to stop getting ""boostrap"" related advice sometimes from people who claim to love me.

i've told my best friend i dont want to talk at all for a long time.  and i intend on sticking to it.  my codependency, freeze and fight responses are all coming out rigbt now and its too much.",1679180805.0

Reading through the description they've made it sound like I shared more in common with CPTSD than BPD. However several times they said that people with CPTSD did not feel extreme pain and could live normal lives unlike people with BPD.


I'm really not sure if I agree with those statements. CPTSD has affected me on and off in my life but still enough to give me a poor quality of life. I cannot function having trauma. 

I don't like this notion that extreme behavior only come from cluster B personality types.

I don't even know how to put it into words because I don't actually know what is wrong with me, but I've literally just been crying...like a lot. I know what triggered it, and even still, I don't really understand how to process it because I don't ever cry like this. 

Basically, my therapist assigned me homework last week to try to reach out to a few of my closest friends and tell them how much they mean to me. This is something I struggle with because I am terrified of rejection and being abandoned, but, I did it, and received so much love back. 

Today, I went to one of my closest friend's house. She's a bit older than me, and sort of like a mother figure. When my parents kicked me out last year, she took me in and let me live with her and her family for over six months. She is genuinely one of the best people I've ever met and seeing her interact with her children really solidified this for me. She's an amazing mother, the sort of mother I wish I had. 

She's even offered to pay for my cap and gown for my upcoming graduation from Grad School and I just can't wrap my head around that. Today was the first time I visited my friend and her family since I finally moved out and got my own place and being with them today was really jarring. I don't know how to explain it, aside from being around them feels home. 

I've known these people for literally less than two years and I truly don't know how I ever lived without them...which is what I'm pretty sure triggered all of these emotions in me because while I know that I can't rewind time, I can't help but feel as though I was robbed of this type of acceptance and love as a child and that sucks. 

idk I guess i'm just trying to process this and understand what's going on in my head. Its so overwhelming and sort of came on unexpectedly. Has anyone else experienced anything like this?",1679182043.0

I searched for answers here and on the internt about the question I have but I didn't find anything. For context, I was physically abused as a child. I'm 20 and have been living on my own for 2 years. I have repiratory and ""nasal"" problems that started  years ago but it never bothered me that much and for some reason I kept forgetting it when the opportunity came to tell a doctor (super wierd because I had problems daily). 1 month ago I finally went to a otolaryngologist and turns out I have pretty severe asthma and a nearly complete blockage of my nose. The meds have really changed my life but this made me realise that this isn't the only case when I either don't feel physical pain that much or I just block it mentally. There are other things like the fact I don't feel hunger unless I am very hungry. 

Is it possible that with the abuse I suffered from as a child I came to block any sort of physical discomfort and if so, how do I get this sensitivity back? 

It might seem a bit idiotic and not that big of a deal but to me its quite a handicap for everyday life because it prevents me from seeing the problems my body is facing so I can't fix them until they end up being so big that they're harder to fix.

Some of you may be able to relate to that empty feeling on the inside. It's a very particular feeling. It's sort of like a black hole where your heart is supposed to be.Maybe you can feel love and empathy and a connection with and for others, you can feel grateful for life and all its beauty (some days, at least), but no matter what, there's always this slight sense of ""something is missing from me, and no one will ever be able to fill that gap"".

Like some of you, I grew up in an abusive home. I won't go into details. But the point is that at a very early age, I formed the belief that I am not loved. It wasn't just some kind of ""idea"" I had in my head; to me, it was an actual fact. I'm 28 now, if that matters.

For years and years I wandered through life, grieving the fact that I constantly felt as if there was no such thing as being safe. Oh, I've felt safe here and there. Maybe in some ex-partner's arms, when everything was juuust right. But in general, it basically felt like ""if I fall, I fall. And I will hit the ground, hard. And there will be no one near, trying to catch me, or at least trying to soften the impact"".And ... Life is really, really scary when you feel like that all the time. It feels like riding a bicycle in the middle of a highway, with huge trucks speeding past you left and right, and you have no protection whatsoever. It feels like getting lost in a maze, but you're also blindfolded and so you have zero points of reference.

Above all, it feels lonely. I used to have a nightmare as a kid. Everything was pitch black, but from the sound I knew I was lost in the middle of the ocean. The waves were high and rough. And I was floating on a mere wooden plank. There was no hope of returning to safety. That's what most of my life has felt like. And all I craved for all these years was a sense of security, something to hold on to. Something stable. Something I can count on. But I never knew how or where to get it.

**TL;DR** Here comes the actual part.Unfortunately, a huge conflict happened between my brother and my parents. My mom's reaction to this was very emotional, and she made a decision that completely shattered me (and the rest of my family too). I actually can't cope with it, so my doctor is going to have me sent to a clinic.

But here's another thing that happened. For the first time ever, I started talking to my dad openly. He dropped me off at home with the car, and I just started talking. About how everything in my life is difficult, because I still struggle with the effects of their abuse. I told him that I couldn't go to work this week, because of the incident. I told him about the clinic. I told him that, even though they have apologized, I don't really care for the apology itself. Because it can't bring back all the time we missed, where we could have been a family but weren't. I told him that I'm struggling with my job. And every day normal things that other, ""healthy"" people don't struggle as much with. I told him about all the times I've reached out to my mom when I wasn't well, in an attempt to be comforted - and all the times she just completely shut down and got angry with me instead. All my life I've had to fend to myself. I never had anyone to go to. We talked for 3 hours. There were tears on both sides. We held hands. He comforted me. He told me how sorry he was that I was struggling like this. And when we said our goodbyes, we hugged. And he assured me that I can call him anytime. That he much, much prefers it if I tell him when I'm not well. Be it during the day or in the middle of the night. It doesn't matter. For the first time in my life, I got to experience what it feels like when a parent shows genuine concern. How it makes me feel when someone actually cares, from the *bottom of their heart.* And yeah, maybe this feeling is just temporary, but ... It's amazing. And I immediately felt like part of that hole in my heart just... isn't that empty anymore. There's something there now. This feeling, like I'm completely alone in the world... Defenseless, hopeless, aimless... It's not as strong now, anymore. I feel like there is actually a human I can go to, someone who will *always* care how I'm doing, no matter what...

I think this is what it feels like to be loved.

**Inb4** For those of you who might think that I should go NC with my parents: I've been there. Before all this, I kept my distance for a decade. It helped, to an extent. But then I started actively working on improving our relationship, and it actually worked pretty well. They reciprocated my efforts. They've been treating me well. I did this because I didn't want to wake up one day to the news of a parent passing away, and then regretting that I didn't give it a try. That's my only motive. I don't want to regret not trying to fix things. If I tried and failed, I could accept that - but I couldn't accept not trying. So, before all this happened (the recent incident), things have been going well for 2 years. It felt healing. It felt healthy. For everyone involved. And I'm hopeful that once the emotions have calmed down, it might get better again.",1679179971.0

I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety and my psychiatrist has been considering PTSD and ADHD as well. My anxiety has gotten worse as my depression has gotten better, and it’s a lot of health anxiety.

I went to my doctor on Friday for this weird symptom that I’m thinking might be derealization? I haven’t found the right word for it and struggle to articulate it.

&#x200B;

So, I know that I experienced trauma as a child from growing up around alcoholics. But I feel like my mind repressed something else; I have gaps in my memory and it's like when I try to analyze them my brain won't let me. Also, I apologize in advance if this seems scattered, I'm kind of tired and obviously a little bit shaken.

I started having rape fantasies when I was pretty young, probably around 11 or 12. (I always chalked that up to me getting exposed to a lot of non-con fanfiction at an early age, but now I'm not entirely sure.) 

I have a very hard time feeling comfortable around men (I'm AFAB, nonbinary). And even when I have had a male partner, and felt comfortable enough with him to have sex, penetrative sex just wasn't really possible because my body wouldn't let it happen. I can't just chalk it up to nerves because even when I'm not emotionally nervous, my body just won't allow penetration. Even in a non-sexual context. I can't even put in a tampon because my body ""closes up"" and I start having an anxiety attack. 

I thought it couldn't be a repressed memory, because that seemed too dramatic, but when I couldn't even put in a tampon without having an anxiety episode I couldn't help but wonder if maybe something had happened? Again, I have these gaps in my memory that I just can't seem to bring myself to remember. I just wasn't sure if anyone here had any similar experiences and maybe advice.",1679190671.0

I did (and still do) consistent, hard, true work to heal. I received my diagnosis with Complex PTSD in 2016 and have come a long, long way. 

I have absolutely crushed it in the career game. Highly successful career thus far and mostly in high stakes, high stress roles. For the most part, I have thrived and “performed”. Honestly I believe now in retrospect that I have been masking and overachieving for a sense of security that I never had growing up. 

Except….now…I hit my threshold. My company is performing at random layoffs over the last several months, even high performers are getting raises and getting axed in a 48 hour time period. Existing employees are on receiving end of inherited workloads of those less fortunate. All the while, management is preaching empathy, grit, and resilience but in the same breath doubling down on “performance culture”, or else it’ll be you next. Legit, I am not exaggerating. 

I am just wholeheartedly burned out. I have nothing left to give. I’ve been in a constant state of freeze, fight, flight…picking fights with my SO, becoming so distraught and lost in despair that an entire weekend goes by and I’m stuck in freeze. 

So I decided to give myself the grace and courage to take short term leave to get my emotions and body stabilized.

48,"Why do ridicule myself over past trauma and minimize everything I’ve been through. My therapist is telling me I went through severe neglect and abuse, but I don’t think what I endure was that bad.",9,11urxna,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11urxna/why_do_ridicule_myself_over_past_trauma_and/,7,"This is a long post so I’m going to try to keep it objective as possible. I have always struggled with self esteem and self worth issues so I decided to get help about 4 months ago. I have been sharing everything that I went through as a child and he is telling me that I went through severe neglect and abuse. 

Him telling me that I was severely neglected and abused doesn’t sit right with me, I don’t think my child hood was the best but I don’t think it was severely bad either. I don’t know if this is some kind of survival mechanism or what. 

My childhood didn’t start off great, I was 6 years old when my brother was hit by a car and I witnessed the whole thing. He was out in a coma and required tons of medical attention and rehab the next four years of his life.  A part of me feels that I was probably put on the back burner during this time while my parents took care of him. 

At around 11 years old my parents would go through a pretty nasty divorce. The household was already hostile before this, tons of verbal abuse towards each other.

The next three subjects are what 
I self shame myself for and minimize in my life. 

I think my mother was physically and emotionally abusive towards me. I was 9 or 10 the first time she hit me, and it wasn’t a whipping, it was a slap across the face as hard as she could. As I got to 11 or 12 she would literally beat the shit out of me by hitting and kicking me and I would never hit her back. These would be the result of me telling her to leave me alone and that I didn’t want to be with her, I had a lot of anger towards her for the way she treated me emotionally and divorcing my father at the time. 

^^^ on top of all this going on, I was being bullied at school for having big ears. My first day at middle school I was made fun of in front of the whole cafeteria for the way I looked. Kids on the school bus were constantly picking on me everyday on the way home. One day I got off the bus and I just lost it, I couldn’t take it anymore and I just broke down in tears hating my life and wanting it to end. 

I asked my parents to have my ears pinned back and this has resulted in extreme self shaming.  Now as a grown man, I am extremely insecure about the fact that I was bullied as a kid and had surgery to get away from it. I have been beating myself up for years, telling myself I should have been stronger and stood up for myself. For the life of me I don’t know why but it has made me so insecure and caused so much self hatred that I had to try to get away from the chaos.



On top of all this, my parents woke me up one day and sent 8 hours away to a military school which is probably the most fucked environment a middle schooler needs to be in. The physical abuse there was worthy of the school being shut down. 

These are just bigger events that happened in my life. My therapist tells me all of this was severe neglect and abuse, idk if I quite feel that way. Maybe it’s because I minimize all of this  to deal with it. 

Does anybody struggle with with self shaming ? For the life of me, I have zero compassion for myself. Especially about the whole bullying thing and having my ears pinned back. I still criticize  myself for not being stronger and ruminate on it everyday. I would like to leave this in the past and just move on with my life. 

My self worth is horrible, I don’t think I’m good enough for anybody and I’m pretty damn sure I’ll be alone forever. How in the hell do I become happy with myself and not have so much self hatred and shame with in me ?",1679154646.0

I grew up with ongoing extreme trauma in every direction of life, and yet when I was younger my body just responded by overachieving and seeking happiness. I always felt like if I used the pain as motivation, one day I’d be past all the hard stuff and be free to live the beautiful life I built myself. So all of the pain just fueled my inspiration to make beautiful things and see life as a gift. Masking came easy to me and I felt I could relate to most people and easily make friends.

In early 2020 I got long Covid that completely changed me. All of the pain suddenly hurt. I no longer felt inspired to achieve - the bare minimum feels impossible. Masking is no longer an option and some days I don’t know if I have a single friend. I used to take solice in my own mind; thinking deeply about the universe, and just my own company thrilled me - now I can hardly think in full sentences. In my free time, all I can do is sleep. Over the past 3 years I’ve seen every specialist, taken every test, went on an SSRI (which did help a small percent). I’ve been in “talk therapy” for years with no talk of goals or direction. 

I feel unrecognizable from who I was 5 years ago. Most days I feel like a vegetable or dementia patient, unable to think or function at baseline levels. I have no sense of self or confidence because this new me feels the opposite of what I identify with.

It seems like everyone around me is at the peak of their life, finally figuring it out and sharper than ever. I feel like I reached that at age 15 and am too burnt out to exist now. I’m way too young to just accept living like this, but I have no idea how to get back to a semblance of myself. Do I accept that this is me now? Do I fight for cognitive repair? Do I keep taking more antidepressants?

When we met, it was amazing, we had a super strong connection with lots in common (and separately too) and communication was consistent, I saw her regularly, she was reliable. I felt secure in that way (which is rare for me).

We both have CPTSD as it turns out (I am recently diagnosed).

The thing is, she has anger issues (that she self-admits). And a few weeks ago, we got into our first argument. I'm one who's worked really hard to move away from anger (my mum, while she did her best, was the prickly, emotionally invalidating type who had anger outbursts). And my partner became super defensive and then needed to take 3 days space (still texting though), to re-regulate. In my opinion, this argument could have been a conversation, and while I was teary, I was calm and emotionally expressive using NVC. Anyway, we talked about it and I thought it was resolved.

THEN we had another argument a week later. This was way worse and definitely a argument that could have ended as a conversation. But she became heightened and needed to leave again. This triggered my abandonment wound and I begged her to stay. My bad. But also, the defensiveness flew back in and again. I was confused at how it escalated so quickly and again I'd been calm and using NVC.

We discussed this argument later and tried to mend it. But I kept feeling insecure about her anger issues (I'd seen the intensity on her face and in her body as she was driving after her brother made a comment to her that others would be annoyed about but not disregulated) and they scared me. Especially with my past.

After the arguments, I needed more reassurance from her because of my abandonment fears. And I'd express my needs clearly e.g. 'could you please hug me right now' or something like that. I know I need to be able to self-regulate and that's on me, but she said the extra reassurance was too much to handle. I'd also ask questions based on the conversations we'd had, and she would have increasing impatience, seeing this as reassurance seeking when I was trying to understand because my mind blanks out a bit in conflict.

They reminded me of how my mum behaved (a big source of trauma) and a relationship I'd been in before that lasted for 5 years before I noticed abuse (he'd started hitting things out of anger and was a routine gaslighter) and I was experiencing emotional flashbacks.

I had to end the relationship. 

Now, I am second guessing. My partner said she'd stay and support me as I worked on my anxiety. But I still can't trust my perception of what's normal and not normal or reasonable and not reasonable in a relationship. 

After 7 ended relationships, I can't help but think I'm the problem. But I work on my stuff, I try to heal and become self-aware. Sometimes I stayed far too long in abusive situations, others, I feel I was too co-dependent and ruined a good thing. Others still I feel I was too picky.

I feel like I don't know up from down or wrong from right. I feel like I can never possibly be happy in love.

How do I trust that my perception is right? Are my needs too great?",1679196220.0
57,Has a job worsened your C-PTSD symptoms due to a toxic environment?,3,11v19mu,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11v19mu/has_a_job_worsened_your_cptsd_symptoms_due_to_a/,1,"tw toxic work environment, gaslighting, love bombing, suicidal ideation mention

I (21) just quit a job that I've been at for approximately 5 months. It was a job I got completely by luck and at first I was pretty happy with it. My boss seemed quite understanding and supportive, but I didn't realize that it was actually a toxic and unprofessional environment. 

I experienced near constant gaslighting and love bombing, where in a single day I could be told I was the best employee she had ever hired and then an hour later treated like I was the stupidest person on the planet and incapable of doing my job. For reference, I have been diagnosed with ADHD so there are times where I am forgetful or procrastinate, but I was selling products although I was not sales and provided excellent customer service. She promoted me without asking (and without additional pay) to be a social media coordinator, and when I tried to explain that I would not be able to handle both jobs (I worked 20 hours/week), she refused to have a conversation about it and insisted that it would be fine.

A few weeks ago, my boss (84) walked up to me in front of both of my coworkers (in their 60s) and threatened to fire me. She believes that it's necessary to call every customer, and that texts/emails are not acceptable as they aren't as personal. I REPLIED to a customers previous email, but my boss did not get the full story (she thought I started by emailing), and once I tried to explain she told me that there are ""no excuses"" for my behavior. I think it's also important to mention here that she had refused any accomodations for my ADHD (I was doing poorly so I couldn't get the motivation to fight that). Even though I wanted to walk out that day, I figured I should wait until I had another job lined up before I quit. At this point, I was suffering from almost daily suicidal ideation and I was barely functioning outside of work. At work I was almost constantly anxious about what she might say/do, if I might get fired, and if I was genuinely doing okay at my job. 

Since it's a small business, there was no HR department to go to with my complaints so I stayed quiet and tried to deal with everything. If you do try to have a conversation with her, she's incapable of admitting that she was in the wrong and so she tries her best to pin it on you. If you try to explain yourself to her, she sees it as you being ""defensive"" and ""refusing coaching"", so I didn't feel that having any kind of blunt/honest conversation would be productive. 

After that day, she started regularly making passive aggressive (and truly aggressive) comments to me vocally, through email, and on paper. My therapist and I decided she was trying to something along the lines of ""constructive dismissal"", where they force you to quit so they don't have to fire you to pay unemployment. I have actually been in a staff meeting where my boss said out loud that if she fired someone she would get out of paying unemployment and that she ""always does"". 

Wednesday of this week she interrupted me in the middle of a phone call with a prospective client (again, I'm not supposed to be sales), to chew me out about something. The second I got off of the phone, she made more aggressive comments, essentially leading to ""what have you been doing the last few days""? She requires that every staff member fill out a task sheet that shows every task you have worked on, every person you talked to, etc., and you have to turn it in at the end of every day. I have done this, so she has a copy of my forms. At this point, I was so frustrated that I could feel my entire body shaking. I am not generally an angry person, especially not this angry, so I knew then that it was time for me to quit even if I didn't have another job lined up. I told her ""I quit"", nothing else, turned in my keys and walked out. I have never quit on the spot like that before, as I'm typically a person to give a two weeks notice at a job, but I knew I couldn't stand it anymore.

Since then I have felt extremely relieved and the suicidal ideation has definitely decreased. However, I'm having flashbacks/dreams and a lot of general anxiety about the job and quitting. I don't regret quitting and honestly I should have done it a lot sooner. I feel like I can't stop thinking about it no matter how hard I try and I'm almost wondering if this, in a way, has made my C-PTSD worse. I was already insecure about myself from my previous trauma, so working already made me anxious and exhausted. 

I know that trauma from work/work environment is a real thing but has anyone else experienced this? Do you have any advice? How do you deal with the anxiety of a similar situation happening in the future? 

TLDR; I was in an extremely toxic work environment and quit but have been having flashbacks, nightmares, and increased anxiety since. Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice?

Academia is a small pond; word gets around, and the humanities in particular have backed themselves into a corner by preaching about their ""priorities and ethics"" without practicing it.

I recently met a girl who has c-ptsd.  I spent *a lot* of time with her in the first month after we met, she was going through a rough time and seemed like she just needed a bit of support in moving on to her next chapter.  It sounded like where she was headed was going to be a healthy environment for her, so I sat and listened while she processed things out loud in the hopes that she'd find the strength to go.  Initially it seemed like she wouldn't be coming back but gradually she started talking about plans to return.  I'm still not 100% sure if she will, but I'd like to talk her about the possibility of a relationship if she does.

My concern is that expressing my feelings will change the way she looks at the support I've given her so far, and how she percieves the place we met.   It started out sounding like she just wanted to get away and never come back, but I think she realised this could be a good place to heal and grow too.  So I don't want to fuck any of that up for her and leave her feeling confused and isolated if she suddenly feels like she can't come to me for support as a friend?

She spoke a lot about how much she values open and honest communication, even from people she ends up rejecting, so I wouldn't feel right if I didn't share how I felt with her. I'm unsure of how to do it in a way that minimises the potential for pain. 

Additionally, I'm interested in any videos/podcasts/books/etc that anyone here has felt helps supporting friends better understand what you're going through.  I've been looking into it myself but I figured you've probably all seen or listened to something and thought ""this is what my friend needs to watch if they want any hope of understanding what's going on inside"".

I'm told to ""Be Myself!!🌈🌈""

But then when I am myself and ask people to respect me and my feelings, they dismiss them and are condescending as fuck because I'm ""sensitive"". So? if I'm sensitive, so what? I dont at all see it as a bad thing that I am in touch with my emotions and able to communicate what I need from others concerning them, and to assert boundaries. I think in fact, it's been a long journey I've had to even get to to this point, because I used to just hold it all in and mentally suffocate from the people pleasing. 

So what, would people rather me lie and shut the fuck up so that I'm their submissive doll, rather than let me be myself?

I'm just so tired of it! I do not deserve disrespect and attitude just because I'm blunt and honest with myself and in touch with my feelings, and others are not. I'm tired of the attitude, i'm tired of being put down. I dont want to engage with humans much anymore, other than a few select folks, people just have chronically let me down. 

This struggle makes me beleive it is not *just* the PTSD but I think I may be on the autism spectrum too. I'm tired of it. I take solace in nature or with animals, every other living thing other than humans makes me feel at peace.

72,I don't have any desire to continue,4,11uszfg,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11uszfg/i_dont_have_any_desire_to_continue/,1,"Hey guys,

I don't know how to start because I have a lot to say but it feels so hard to do it. For background information I'm 23/M. I used to get bullied and left out from an early age throughout kindergarden, elementary and high-school. My whole youth was about me being infront of my PC.

I always hated the way everybody was looking at me with the same eyes as if I was an alien or sth. It went so far that I always wanted to thank the cashier or any worker at the shops for not trashing me. I even remember when some of them showed support for Amanda Todd when she committed suicide but none of them cared about my well being eventho they witnessed it everyday and kinda even were part of it. I'm bad at having normal conversations and I have a hard time with making friends. I don't how to improve my social skills as I don't have many people to socialise but I would for sure love to be more social yet I have no option. I never had a gf and was never close to a girl in my life and I even don't know how to talk to them in the first place. I remember when the pandemic happened and people started complaining about the fact that they can't meet with their friends or go to parties meanwhile it didn't change much for me.

That's another reason why I have a hard time relating to people around my age after all I don't know how it is having a friends group where you do sth together, meet new people and be invited to parties. One of my former only friends told me once that he can't help me out with my problems. I think I just wasted my childhood, teenage years and now even my early twenties. That's why I'm always stuck in my head and think about fake scenarios to cope with my loneliness. I think about people appreciating me, being happy, having fun, being loved by girls, being successfull and talented. All these things that I always wanted. I feel like I'm a good for nothing. Nothing really catches my interest. I'm bored out of everything so quick.

Not even games satisfy me anymore so I keep scrolling on reddit or twitter mindlessly for hours. I used to have couple mutuals on twitter but I stopped talking to them as I saw no point in that anymore after all they live far away from me. I don't seem to be accepted there either. There is no hobby nor sport that I want to do because I don't have the motivation for anything. I don't seem to get out of my head nor of my pessimistic mindset.

If I had the chance to return back in time I would do it because I would do so many things differently. I hate being invisible like no one is going out of their way to have me in their life nor did people I used to know before contact me once to check up on me if I'm still alive or if I'm ok. I don't know what I want in life and honestly I don't have any desire to continue pursuing anything because I'm not getting out of my current state.

I faced so many challenges yet I couldn't share them with anyone. I'm still alone and I still don't get excited in anything I do. All I want is a couple of people around me and someone who loves me because I know there is a whole world I haven't discovered yet. Everyday I wake up with the hopes of change but those are just empty thoughts because I live the same cycle everyday and I really have no encourage to keep going on. I don't know what I need to do. It's like I haven't been crying out for help the past few years but no one cares anyway. I'm sure that there are many people like me on here as I already read a lot of other threads about it and I could relate to many of them. I hope some of yall read this till here.",1679157186.0

If anyone has an idea, I’d really appreciate it.

I’m currently home on spring break and going through an IOP program, and I’ve realized that my college friendships are a little weird. I would like to specify that this might not be my friends being terrible, it is likely at least partially me imagining things like abandonment. 

Sometimes it feels like I’m just expected to do things with my friends. Me and the rest of my friends will text and be like “when does everyone want to eat dinner?”, while meanwhile, the other two friends will just be like “Dinner!” And expect that other people will be there. In their defense, it is the same time every day, but it still feels weird. It’s especially weird that they do that, and just expect that I’ll be there every time, when sometimes they won’t show up and won’t tell anyone. Like yeah, you’re totally allowed to go out to eat instead, but please tell me? (I would like to specify that I did talk to them about it, and asked if they could tell me, and then like 4 days later they did it again, so uh nope ig) 

I feel terrible saying no, and I’ll just do whatever they want to do. I feel like I don’t even want to share my opinions on things we do, cause I feel like they’ll hate them or judge me. I also feel terrible if I refuse to go hang out with them ever. I’m afraid that they’ll decide they don’t want to be my friend if I do that. 

Sometimes I genuinely forget that I’m allowed to make my own decisions. I’ll just exist in a neutral state and do whatever they want to do. I’ll have no goals, dreams, opinions. Just neutral. Literally all the time unless they’re both off campus. Idk why I do it. 

I’ve had situations where I’ll just sit there while one of my friends talks at me about their special interest. For like 20 minutes straight. And they’re disappointed when I space out after like 10 minutes of it. That or they’ll be watching violent videos (they don’t show me them) when we’re hanging out, and it’s super odd. 

Idk. I definitely need to fix this. I’ll be bringing it up in therapy this week, but if anyone has any suggestions or relates, I’d really appreciate it.",1679160903.0

They read my journal, and then threw in my face certain stuff I wrote while not even giving a damn I wrote in there the I was suicidal.  They took my phone away. They coerced me to quit a job that meant a lot to me and then told me how worthless my job was and how I didn't make a difference (yes, in ABA therapy progress is slow, but the appreciation those kids had for me is undeniable).  They retraumatizated me to an extent I can't get over and still I'm questioning whether I'm retraumatizated.

It was just filled with being in a space with older siblings who listened to sexually explicit stuff and being exposed to that... making it known I didn't want to listen to it and being ignored.

i now can't love, my parents say they love me and all i can say is ""love you too"" in such a unsure way because i don't even think i know how. i cant understand it, i don't even have cptsd, i don't even have trauma enough to even have such a bad response and yet my entire personality is either autism or trauma responses.

i don't even know what the result of a kid who's only ever been stonewalled since they learned to talk turns out to be. all i've ever seen is ""narcissist abuse"" etc. i don't know if my mums a narcissist, i don't even know if she's just toxic. i just know how badly being stonewalled has fucked me up. yeah, the silent treatment thats (fortunately) all i have as my abuse and that's something people laugh at. yeah, now i don't care. but back when i was 5 years old i would have done absolutely anything including hurting myself just for my mum to acknowledge my existence. and (again fortunately) all i have to be thankful for is that my mum fought for my grandma not to use corporal punishment on me. and you know whats worse? i would have been so much better off if i was hit, at least i wouldn't worship the absolute fuck out of a person who merely just acknowledges my existence. 

all i can think about is how, 1 its easier for me and everyone else and 2 how much better if i just died or if i never even existed. i wish i didn't exist but i'm too much of a pussy to do shit about it. i hate that nobody understands. i really wish i wasn't the one tadpole in whole pool that somehow managed to win the race, me? really? why? 

i don't get how i'm the only one who hates myself this fucking much. i haven't met someone who doesn't despise the literal oxygen they waste. not that i want to. my dad literally loves me and all i can say is id rather be dead because i'm incapable of loving him back. i feel stupid, its so hard to even pretend anymore.

I can see where they're coming from and in many ways it is my karma, but I genuinely thought I could contribute something useful.

In lots of ways I have a good life - I am in a good marriage, I am poly and have a good new relationship that is developing slowly. There are issues with the second relationship - but they are more me not trusting or worrying that I am about to be abandoned.

I spent 6 years of my childhood being told I wasn't enough, that i was disgusting for the things I wanted - that I had been taught to want - that no-one could ever possibly love someone as disgusting as me. My entire life I have lived with the knowledge that there is something dark and unloveable at my very centre - something that I have to hide.   


I did the work. I went to therapy - I know it wasn't my fault, I learned how to enjoy sex without guilt. But still I feel that part of me has to stay hidden. I feel that I exist rather than live. I want, and am desperate for, reassurance. My husband gives it readily but my new partner is more reserved emotionally...I feel at times that I am going insane as the need consumes my thoughts, 

I seem confident, good at my job, successful - but my world is so small. I work from home, I go to the office once a month when I have to, I go to do my hobby once a week....but I avoid days out, fun things with family or friends (I don't really have many)...I hate the thought of being out in the world on my own. I know it isn't normal - I know that I should be enjoying life...but I can't. It affects my family - they do things without me as i am always catching up on cleaning or work or some other excuse that means I can stay in all weekend. 

I am not depressed. I just feel unworthy of the world. I feel less than. I don't put effort into taking care of myself because I don't deserve it...it isn't even that I don't think I deserve it - I am embarrassed at the idea that I might feel I deserve it. Because what it someone found out that I thought I deserved more than I had....more than I was. That was one of the big tactics when I was young - make me believe nice things and then laugh at me for believing them. Make me ask for things I want and then make fun of me for asking. Wanting things is hard - I want to be a real person. But I am afraid of that want.",1679186113.0

I've known for a while that I have a lot of sleep anxiety and seem to dread the idea of ""wasting time sleeping"". I realized though that my desire to stay awake worked a lot like an addiction. I desire that constant state and even when I'm awake It's painfully to think of being asleep.

I then realized this also applies to happiness. After years of abuse and neglect I've been trained that my ultimate goal should be to be happy. And that anything other than perfect happiness is utter despair and just wanting to be happy again. 

Its not the sadness or anger that is unbearable. It's the lack of happiness. So what if I treat it like I don't need to be happy?

What I mean is this, once I remove the pressure I've put on myself to be happy, I'm at peace. And I don't need that constant happiness in order to function. I acknowledge how uncomfortable I am and choose not beat myself up over not liking it.

89,Intense Back/Neck Pain after Therapy Session,2,11uyjhk,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11uyjhk/intense_backneck_pain_after_therapy_session/,3,"TW: Eating disorders/Anorexia

TLDR: I had a therapy session yesterday where I finally discussed the beginning of my eating disorder, and since I've had sharp/intense pain in my lower neck/upper shoulder blades area.  Has anyone else experienced this?  How long did it last/was there anything that helped?  I am familiar with John Sarno's *Healing Back Pain*.

&#x200B;

I developed anorexia my freshman year of high school and it's been my life's main focus ever since.  I've been at a healthy weight and have had a great relationship with food for many years now, but I know a part of my brain has still been stuck in that time, particularly my time in college where I was a lot less intense with my ED than I was in high school, but still in it enough to feel attractive and therefore not unvaluable.  Logically, I know there were a lot of problems during this time, too - a lot of suicidal ideation, SAs, not truly feeling emotions, more family dysfunction, etc, but it still *felt* like I was ""safe"" compared to the bullying and family dysfunction I experienced beforehand.  I feel somewhere my brain/heart glorifies that time because everything *felt* good, even though logically I know it was far from.  So I've been spending years trying to figure out what's been keeping me stuck, and I've made great progress.  Special shoutouts to *Body Keeps the Score*, Neurofeedback, and now Somatic Experiencing, which have helped me immeasurably after years of confusing brain fog and fatigue, which popped up after graduating college and getting to a healthy weight.

*Body Keeps the Score* helped me a lot because, I think with my anorexia in particular, a lot of physical symptoms masked my emotional/psychological issues (I also self-harmed for a couple of years before my anorexia, so emotional suppression leading to self-destructiveness was my MO).  The book led me to Neurofeedback, and also to Somatic Experiencing, where I can focus on my physical symptoms - ie, tight chest, tight throat, numbness in arms, etc - and have the space and guidance to find what emotions/memories these responses are attached to and work through them.  I feel great shifts after sessions, so I really do believe in the physical/mental connection.

I've rewired so many things well, but overall still have that ""stuck in past"" sensation.  However, I feel like I've cleared enough of the other stuff to be able to see and focus on that ""stuckness"" and start communicating through it in therapy.  The line in my head is ""The belly of the beast"" - I feel like I'm ready to enter it, to revisit those years in college to remember how imperfect and human of a time it was (versus a fuzzy fantasyland, as my mind holds onto) and even revisit the onset of my anorexia in high school, which my mind actually doesn't remember very well - it doesn't really ""go there"".  I feel like taking the glory out of it and revisiting/healthfully working through the pain will stop it from being a safety response and will help me be present, because it's felt like I'm missing so much on life by being stuck in the past.  So I had a non-somatic therapy session yesterday finally broaching these times in my life and, again, I felt a really great shift inside of me after - like a lot more space in my chest filled with clean, clear air.

I don't know when I noticed the stiff neck, but by an hour after my session it felt like I had a pinched nerve where my lower neck meets my shoulder blades.  A part of me wondered if I slept weird, but my morning had no pain at all and I don't recall my morning feeling any different (my therapy was 11a-noon and I woke up around 8:30).  I'm used to feeling these physical shifts and know sometimes it takes a day or two for them to settle, so I was thinking ""okay I might be out of commission today, but tomorrow it will probably settle"".  Well I've woken up today and my pain is even worse, and is taking up more space in my back.  I've never had pain like this, and definitely never lasting so long.  No exercise or movement prompted this.

Post-*Body Keeps the Score* I bought other books that felt like they could help, one being John Sarno's *Healing Back Pain*, since my lower back would often feel weak  (not in pain, but just would give out when standing and such).  I've since lent it to a friend at the time who was struggling with a lot of arm pain that I believed to be psychosomatic, and he and I aren't speaking anymore (for many good reasons).  I looked it up on Amazon this morning and ordered it to be delivered tomorrow, but am hoping I can use some of my day today to hopefully get better.  I know the basis of the book is chronic back pain (or any pain) that doesn't seem to have a physical cause might actually be emotional.  I'm surprised I'm feeling such intense pain since I'm already a believer of this.  I'm trying to meditate to see if I can feel what emotion this pain is connected to, like in my SE sessions, but I can't find anything in particular.  I don't know if it's simply because I entered such an intense territory of my life finally, and so it's something I'll need to work through in therapy.  I fear this a bit because my sessions are once every two weeks, and I don't want to have this much pain for that long (especially since I work at an intense company) so I don't know if anyone's had an experience like this and knows of ways to help between therapy sessions/in general.

What a puzzle our healing is!  The good news is I feel a lot of benefit from the session, especially mentally - maybe it's such a huge shift that my body is creating pain to hold back such great change because it's scared.  I'm okay with that because it's been a long time coming, and it will be worth it, but seems like it will have its ""final boss mode"" struggle to get to the other side. Any input would be super appreciated - thank you!",1679169233.0

When I ask this I mean in pretty much any situation, I find it so hard to be angry I literally never am even though I feel it a lot. I almost feel embarrassed to show I’m angry and I don’t know why. 

I do be an adult now so I’m now nearly used to just saying ‘I feel angry’ but I never know what to do with the physical feeling. I don’t want to be my mum, screaming at the top of her lungs, throwing insults and items, hitting and pushing like a child but I can’t let go of wanting to physically hurt myself or break something when I’m angry.

92,DAE feel a trauma response when reminded of a former romantic partner?,4,11uu89x,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11uu89x/dae_feel_a_trauma_response_when_reminded_of_a/,1,"It's been 3 years since the relationship ended. My partner and I were 21/22 years old then. The relationship lasted for about a year. I was deeply in love with my partner but in 2020 he broke up with me. We were in different cities and the pandemic made it very difficult to be ok. We met once after 6 months to catch up and a year later I messaged to return a few things. He responded that he'd confirm the time with me and I didn't heard from him after. I felt abandoned all over again but again respected his decision. Two months later, he messaged me for catching up and didn't address the previous message. I was hurt and caught up, didn't feel safe to speak to him so I never got back. I felt I had moved on and wished him well until he messaged me while on shrooms. He told me how he wanted to say he was sorry, etc. How he feels bad that we don't talk...

I went in a trauma response. I couldn't breathe right. I felt like all I needed was to kill myself. That I couldn't live life. That there was no point in me. The only obvious thing was to die.  I wanted to get under the covers and not go out again. For two weeks I was obsessed with what he said, what he thinks of me. That I was being mean, that I'm a bad person for not being normal, for not being in touch, for being too much, for being a loser. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, I couldn't think cleary. 

Later I messaged him back but this feeling persisted. I thought it would go away if I was vulnerable and honest. But it didn't go away. All I got was a cold message of an apology and how we should be away from wach other. I was mortified. Felt like a ""crazy"" person everyone leaves. A crazy desperate person no one wants.

After my therapy session I found out this was a trauma response. Fawning. It's been a year and a half to this event. 3 years since the break up. I still feel my chest pound, get running obsessive thoughts and feel like I have no value if I hear of him, see his Instagram account, or see his photo through a friend's account. It still feels like he haunts me. Where I'm constantly thinking of when he'll pop up and preparing myself. 

&#x200B;

I've grown over the last year. I am a psychotherapist now and love connecting with people. I'm fairly good at it. I'm confident, outspoken, more authentic, loving, and present. These few weeks have been especially tough, and I feel more vulnerable to thoughts of him, feeling abandoned all over again, feeling shame over my trauma response, shame over not being able to connect with some friends from that part of my life, and not being able to have a healthy acquaintance with my former partner. 

The relationship wasn't particularly abusive. It was a little invalidating. But I was super anxious through much of the relationship. I would plan my way of helping myself if and when he abandons me. It would feel like a test. Overall, I'm so miserable because I spent so much time feeling unloved, unspoken for, unable to express myself through the last few months. At the same time, I felt unseen and deeply in love and attached to him. I have been single since because I'm miserable every date, and the people I like don't want to be with me.

I'm aware how I'm so attached and yearn for people who don't want to be with me. To a point, I feel that is what I deserve, This week, I've really been hating myself. But I'm so tired of reliving this again and again. feeling the shame, again and again. I'm aware this is rooted in the neglect I've faced throughout my life. Raised by a mother with depression and mania who threatened to kill herself if we wouldn't eat An angry, verbally abusive father. Sometimes this doesn't make a lot of sense. Have I conditioned myself further to feel this terror when I'm reminded of my ex?

97,"Yeah, turns out my abusive mom was hurting me financially in more ways than one, and that's actually caused her more trouble than me in the long run.

Basically, because that woman never once bothered to teach me how to do taxes, I was doing them wrong over and over again. Even while using Turbo Tax to do it.

Where I should have been getting thousands of dollars in tax refunds, I got none of that, and ended up owing the IRS about $140 when a real tax expert finally helped me do my taxes correctly.

The funny part though: that woman didn't know how to do taxes either! She was telling me to do her taxes for her, which means I was doing both her taxes and mine incorrectly for years because, like I said, I didn't know what I was doing, and apparently she didn't either.

It's hard to know how to feel about this. On one hand, I'm pissed cause she laid a very heavy burden on me, to do taxes for her without knowing how to do taxes myself. As if I somehow magically knew how to do taxes in an environment where she restricted and filtered any and all information I would ever get to see.

But on the other hand it's funny as fuck, cause for me, I only messed up for about 3 year's worth, and missed out on some refund money and have a small fee I need to pay now. She's been doing her taxes wrong for at least a decade before she started getting me to do it incorrectly. So she's probably got a massive time bomb waiting for her one day, all cause she didn't bother to actually learn how to do taxes and then shunted the responsibility off on somebody else equally as in the dark as she.

——————————————————

I was a planned pregnancy, born to two parents in their mid 30s with established careers and already had one brother and another soon on the way.

My first memory of this world was my mom smiling down at me while she bathed me as a baby, still too young to sit up on my own.

My new family seemed like the ideal little setup from the outside

but,

sometimes things just don’t work out.

——————————————————

**Part 1:** my father

——————————————————

My father is an ex-army veteran. He moved to working as security at a hospital where he met my mom, a physical therapist. Later he transferred his job to working in a prison as a corrections officer and then to a psychiatric hospital where he was chief? He also did police work with a police car and everything. (For all the years he’s worked there I never actually knew his actual job title, but he was in charge of a lot of people that I do know and people called him chief).

My father had ptsd and I believe cptsd from coming from a bad home environment himself and from being in the army and watching friends of his die. He hated his father for being a violent drunkard, passing out on the floor and abusing his mom, him, and his siblings. I find it ironic he turned out the same way.

The older we got the worse he got. He’d come back from bar fights bloodied. He only got one dui because he was usually able to flash his badge and the cop would let him go. The house reeked of alcohol and piss because he would pee in the kitchen sink on top of the dishes. Just like with his father, it was not an uncommon sight for me to come home from school to find him passed out on the kitchen floor.

My father was a violence loving narcissist. My brothers and I all agree on that. He could never be wrong, nothing he can do can ever be wrong. He always has to be the center of attention. He’d play his music on his giant stereo system at 1am on a school night in our tiny house with thin walls. Try to turn it down to sleep he’d shove you away cursing and threatening. He’d disappear for weeks without explanation or notice, not even a text, and then he would return again.

He’d punch holes in the walls and even broke two doors (one partially, just a long crack in the wood, one completely completely destroyed, along with the wall on the opposite side where he leaned into it to kick the door in). He’d threaten to bash our own head into the walls, not because we did anything wrong, he just wanted to.

My mom once came to me terrified that he’d try and murder us. She wanted to go to a shelter but I disagreed since I was told all the shelters near us sucked. Whenever she called the police they always took his side. She ended up getting a restraining order against him. That’s how it ended and how we found some peace. 

She didn’t tell us right away that she got a restraining order, I was having nightmares every night that he would come back until she told us he won’t.

Classic of my father, after he got kicked out his immediate response was to cancel all the credit cards and lock my mom out of as many bank accounts as possible. I remember sitting in the car with my younger brother next to bank while she was at the atm with a strained look on her face as card after card didn’t work. My mom was no longer working at this point due to disability (more on this later). Because of my father’s actions we couldn’t afford a lot of basic stuff like wifi, decent food (we relied heavily on free lunch and food banks), the trash bill (we’d travel around town to dump our trash instead), new clothes, car repairs, the list goes on.",1679164199.0
100,"Today, engage in some self-compassion",3,11usl56,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11usl56/today_engage_in_some_selfcompassion/,1,"Hi all, new to this community though I have been lurking on Reddit for a while and finally decided to create an account. 

I guess the title says it all really. I engaged in self compassion today during my therapy session. My therapist and I were doing “chair work”, basically having a conversation with yourself. Mine was between current me and 12 year old me. Speaking to my younger self, I told them they deserved someone who would look after them, listen to them; they didnt deserve to be alone. I wished I could reach back in time and give them a giant hug and a shoulder to cry on.

It works. Today, engage in some self compassion (specific to your own experiences of course). Let yourself now, or your old childhood self, know that they didnt deserve a single bad thing that happened to them. Whether you say it out loud or journal it, just let yourself know somehow. And don’t let anyone stand in the way of that self compassion. Don’t let anyone tell you that you’re just wallowing in self pity (as I’ve been told before); you’re not. You’re taking steps to heal and better yourself and if anyone wants to stand in the way of that, well they know exactly where they can stick their opinions.

STOP.

Don't do it to yourself. Cut that sentence short. It's not ""If I hadn't"" it's ""If they hadn't."" It was their lack of self control, their brokenness, that made them into what they are. 

I know it's easy to give them excuses or justifications, especially for abusers who also showed kindness at times. And those moments of kindness become a weapon in your own mind against the reality of what they are. But the truth is, humans are complex creatures, and one human is able to be both kind and abusive - and if they are both, their violence STILL wasn't your fault ❤️",1679096076.0

The purpose of this post is a vent. Since I'm female bodied but identify mostly as gender fluid, I still get the Instagram algorithm pushing stupid mom content (no offense to anyone who's a mother, but I think you know of what I speak). I'm child free by choice and because the pressure of raising a child without being fully healed makes me think I'm going to repeat cycles of abuse unknowingly so it's best not to have that happen. 

Anyway, in the video reel this mom has her 3 or 4 year old daughter with her and says something like ""I gave birth to my best friend, I tell her everything and she tells me like it is"". And all the comments were like ""omg me too my daughter is my bestie, I tell her everything"", ""she's my mini me"", ""my daughter is my clone"" etc. . Thousands of views/likes/comments. 

Now, as someone who's mother used me as a therapist before I understood what object permanence was and many years beyond, this triggered me. 

1. Your child is not your ""friend"", they're your child and your their parent. You parent them, you don't friend them. You can be nice and have a close relationship, but never would I consider a parent a friend just like a teacher shouldn't be a friend to a minor student . Have mature relationship boundaries ffs.
2. Your child needs to have friends their own age to learn and develop properly. As a parent one would expect you to have friends your own age (or adult aged) too. 
3. Your child is not your MINI ME CLONE. They are a unique individual who's inherited their own unique set of traits that makes them their own person separate from you. If you treat them like they're a clone they will lose sense of self. 
4. Have any of these people even heard of enmeshment? 😞

to circle back to the title of this post: i get anxious waiting for feedback on an assignment, and then when i get it i get so scared to see it even when i know it's not going to be bad, but i really really want to see it at the same time. and then. when the feedback is positive / filled with compliments i get like an intense high from it and i will read it multiple times over and over, days and even weeks after the fact. and then i also keep looking/reading my own assignment over and over, unable to believe that something i did could warrant this kind of positive feedback

and that honestly doesn't sound *too* far from normal. but. i also keep looking my professor up online and reading reviews other students write about them and their classes. and imagining us having more conversations. and i just keep replaying the conversations we have had and i almost get a high from recalling when they complimented me or it felt like we were bonding over something",1679176857.0
105,Just a curious thought about crying,1,11v25gi,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11v25gi/just_a_curious_thought_about_crying/,1,"I cry very often (compared to up until 3 yrs ago). Crying has a very social component (among other things) in that it is a signal of distress to other people. You are crying for help without actually having to approach someone and ask. And you are communicating your distress openly and sharing it.

I noticed that when I cry it's usually alone; I often cry when I'm outside, on the street or in the metro or in the woods, but if I think other people may notice I can stop almost immediately. I cry outside when I cannot hold my tears in, but as soon as another person comes too close I am able to stop immediately. 

I find that a very curious thing - something that sends such clear signals of distress (bc when we're crying we ARE distressed) to others I do not allow others to see.

Like I am not allowing myself to send out these signals. I know I've shut down my emotions when I was little bc when I showed them I was laughed at at best by my mother, so, yes, I understand how this can happen. But it still amazes me how damn strong this brainwashing is. No, other people must not see me crying, showing emotions is weakness, weakness will be punished.

Now, I have been having emotional flashbacks for roughly 2.5 years now and crying is the most prominent reaction that goes with an EF, and still whenever I cry outside, I am able to immediately stop crying whenever someone comes closer and I start again once that person has passed me. And even stranger still is the fact that most of my flashbacks revolve around ""There's no one there"" and ""I am rejected/abandoned and I need to do xyz on my own or I'll just die"" or ""I just want someone here with me, I want a hug"" and as soon as someone is closeby I turn my tears off like a faucet and turn them back on once that person is at a safe distance. 

Like, yeah, I understand how the mechanisms I developed as a kid work, but still?? They're so so strong! I want a hug but I shut off the signal that could get me that. This also happens with friends and close coworkers. Even with my T. It’s, like, wow. I get it, but then I don't. I mean, it's a real flashback, it's little me, it's heartbreaking emotions, but then, bam, I stop completely when I see ppl coming closer, and then, here it goes again, once they're gone. 

Anyone know how to change that? Anyone who has changed this? Change the childhood programming that's been in effect for decades. I just can’t seem to open up even with close friends, show them how I feel inside. And even though the EFs are so crazy wild, the presence of others, even though I am crying for this, is the thing that contains them but not in a good way. I'm baffled even though I can understand it.",1679176674.0

Okay so I’ve worked as a prison officer in a violent jail for 18 months before being accused by other staff of bringing in contraband and having inappropriate relationships with prisoners. I challenged all accusations and came out clean but the place was racist and I believe I was indirectly bullied the whole time. I really enjoyed working with prisoners but was paranoid the whole time that someone was always watching my actions ready to report me. I guess I never knew my perpetrators although I fought the system consistently.

At the time I had panic attacks, tearful, rage issues etc, but also slept stupid amount of hours. I used to have nightmares but today struggle with managing my emotions/expectations of myself/ low self esteem. 

In the UK I’ve just been given antidepressants and put on NHS counselling waitlists, but I feel like I’ve been struggling for years. My daily life is affected by it but I can’t seem to get a diagnosis. I’ve done a lot of CBT privately

I finally bit the bullet and decided to go for a paid private psychiatric assessment which is costing me a stupid amount but I have to know what’s going on with me.

110,Difficulty in reading books,13,11uhf6v,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11uhf6v/difficulty_in_reading_books/,6,"In childhood, I was actually ahead of my peers in development, including having a very good attention span. But then I went through prolonged trauma during the ages of 10 to 14, and during that time, I didn't develop, I actually regressed a damn lot. For example, my speech was just gone, every aspect of it, and people who did not know me for an extended period of time could not understand a word of what I was saying. 

I made it through school from the inertia of my childhood, but the qualities needed to do my homework from start to finish, and on a daily basis, were gone. I didn't get a year off after school to sort this mess out because my parents forced me straight into uni. I graduated, but only after a mental breakdown and a year off. And feeling like a fake, because I didn't have the capacity to fully take in the course materials, and to, well... Actually study.

So anyway, for the last 2-3 days, I have been trying full-time to read an engineering textbook related to my field. And in that time, I've managed about 20-30 pages **in total** .

It's not like the book is extremely challenging to read. It has new concepts that make me need to re-read some sentence or just stop for a few seconds to think about something sometimes, but it is manageable.

I feel like the aspects that make it difficult for me to read are, in no specific order:

* **Procastination:** the inability to actually start the reading, and come back to it after taking a break (which I need a lot of);
* **Lack of attention span:** I can sometimes manage no more than a paragraph before my brain comes up with something that sounds really exciting, like picking up my phone or googling something I wanted to google some time ago but forgot to;
* **Fear of potential problems encountered while reading the book?:** this one is weird, but it's like, my mind is racing forward and asking questions like, what if I encounter a problem at the end of the chapter that I can't solve? Or some sentence (usually half-handedly explaining something that isn't very important) that I can't understand no matter how hard I try?

I feel like the 3rd reason is actually really important, because I can deal with novels much better than with technical books, though I still usually just read them for a day or two in a row and then my brain blocks them out and I forget to continue, sort of like it's too stressful.

I'm 20 years old and have been suffering from multiple mental illnesses at different points in time from age 9 onwards (severe depression, (social) anxiety, and an eating disorder).

I've been in inpatient treatment twice last year because of severe depression, but I didn't really respond sufficiently to any of the seven antidepressants I tried that year. I left inpatient treatment still feeling broken and unable to lead a normal life. 

The psychiatrists suggested that antidepressants might not work for me generally (yet they still have a hard time believing me when I tell them that I don't notice a difference after trying a new medication).

They also said that I'll probably live with depressive episodes for the rest of my life and that I just have to get used to that, which scared me immensely after having lived with moderate/severe depression for the better half of a decade(without a complete remission in-between).

I really have a hard time believing that I just have to accept having depression for the rest of my life. Especially because everything started with me experiencing a couple of traumatic events in my childhood. Before that, I was a relatively content child. Some of my relatives could even confirm that my whole mood and outlook on life changed during that time period.

&#x200B;

**This is why I wanted to ask if you have experienced a reduction in depressive symptoms after dealing with your trauma (e.g. in trauma therapy)**.  I feel like my depression doesn't improve because treatment always focused on the symptoms rather than the cause.

There are people who deserve to be treated like humans. And people who don't, like you. You never fully knew why, it was just part of the fabric of things.

Imagine a tree being chopped then blamed because it gives no fruit. Instead of being watered and cared for to help it growing back faster, it has to pretend to be like all other trees.  It has to make fruits with its own blood and flowers with its own tears to keep the fiction going. The tree feels naked with no leaves, humiliated, because it comes so easy for the other trees, tall and intact and cared for, to give fruit. 

Everyone says that all of it is normal, you are just imaginining things and you should stop complaining, because you've been chopped years ago. But a tree takes years to grow. It needs to be respected. It needs to be watered. It needs sun and peace and innocent joy. Just like all the other trees.

And when it's back tall and strong, then yes, it happens. Overnight: it just...dares to bloom. Beautifully. Majestically. The other trees look in astonishment. And soon after, fruits will start hanging from its branches. Ripe, and sweet, amd well-earned after having to be born twice.

Does it matter that it is the first time our tree blooms in a very long time?  No, it does not. This tree had been chopped. And it grew back. Is it its fault that it was chopped? No, it is not. Is it its fault if the whole society is blind and trees are treated like machines? No, it is not. The tree is a tree. All it knows is growing.

Now the tree has nothing to envy to the other trees. In fact, quite the opposite. Now the other trees ask for advice. Whenever someone gets a branch chopped, they ask ""how do I water myself now to grow back strong like you?""
Everyone has huge respect. They say ""look, that tree was chopped all the way to the roots. And it grew back.""",1679104761.0

Discovering the diagnosis has been life changing. I was lucky enough to find a good-enough therapist and have been working on tamping down my inner critic, shedding my self-loathing, and stepping away from black and white thinking (go me!). So many positive changes in myself, and I'm feeling the hopelessness shed off of me after two steady years of hard work on this stuff.

And yet... it is bittersweet. It feels like I'm awaking up to the relationships around me and I'm able to see them more clearly. Before when I was stuck in black and white thinking - my marriage wasn't bad so it was good. I never questioned what I wanted, because I already had a good marriage, something I didn't really deserve. Now that I am exploring more grey thinking, and asking myself what I actually want... it is sort of breaking my heart to see my spouse isn't what I want. My marriage isn't good, and in terms of the grey scale, is closer to bad than good.

Married for 14 years. For most of those years, I was compliant, suppressing my reactions, my thoughts, my feelings like I'd done my whole life. It's what I had to do to be loved. I truly believed I deserved to be invisible, and co-created a marriage where I was invisible. While in the throws of CPTSD, it was comfortable. I kept slipping further into CPTSD, which was my clue to keep trying, to keep looking for help. Enter the good-enough therapist who - EVERY SINGLE TIME I talked bad about myself, he pointed it out, helped me thought-correct. I learned a bunch of other techniques that worked for me and discovered this subreddit, and listened to Pete Walker's book for the first time. (Again, go me!)

My spouse isn't a bad man. I care about him, but when I say 'I love you' back to him, it doesn't mean the same as it did before I starting my serious healing.

He struggles with mental illnesses of his own. His memory isn't great. He doesn't do it on purpose, and yet every time he forgets things, even small things, I have to fight falling into flashback. When he forgets something important to me, I go into flashback hard and have to fight the flashback and my own emotions to not over-react. It makes me feel like I deserve to be invisible, that I'm silly for thinking anyone would see me, really hear me. I know that's the inner critic talking - but several times a week his lack of memory triggers me into emotional flashback.

His memory is not likely to improve. I don't know how to cope with this. It is a lot. My good-enough therapist is not focused on CPTSD, and in these nitty gritty type questions he relies on his general knowledge. I can tell the language I've started using around CPTSD, the 4Fs, and emotional flashbacks just doesn't land with him.

The marriage has been not-great for a long time. Over the years I've tried, on occasion, to request changes. More listening, more affection, more foreplay, and sometimes there will be improvements for a week or two, and they fade back into me being invisible. We haven't had sex for roughly ten years, following an incident where he crossed a 'no' boundary and I've never been able to see him as safe in the sexual arena. (I have a history of sexual abuse as a child, and sexual assault with first spouse.) Even before that incident, we were struggling with intimacy and sex. Back then, we couldn't afford therapy, so we just sort of limped along. I acknowledge my side of the no sex between us. It is difficult on so many levels.

I'm in my late 40s, and discovering my own sexuality by reading AO3. I'm masturbating every night (for the first time in my life I have a consistent libido - direct consequence of asking myself what I wanted for the first time in my life.) Based on the sex spouse and I used to have, my current desires in this arena make me believe very strongly that we aren't compatible. I have discovered several lovely kinks, and he was boring vanilla (and not very generous or willing to learn.) For example, he has a hard time holding my hand. He has an aversion to touch, or being touched. Since the incident, he has been afraid of hurting me, so has been even more reserved. (This isn't limited to no sex, this marriage is no-physical-affection - a peck on the lips before bed. A weekly hug if I ask.)

Spouse and I are trying to work on our marriage. Ideally we would love to find a couples counselor, but after 6+ weeks of hunting and no one is available (we are limited by insurance) we are trying to work through Gottman's book 'The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work.' Every exercise makes me sadder, and spouse happier. It makes me see how far the gulf is between us, how much we don't know each other, how far into crisis our marriage really is. 

Spouse is trying, but... when we talk after the exercises, and I try to explain my feelings over the years - he isn't connecting to it. We are miscommunicating about our miscommunication. A third party, versed in my mental illnesses and his mental illnesses, would help us both navigate this. That's not a possibility atm.

He is trying to improve, and leaves a nice note (for example), my emotional reaction is resentment, and annoyance. Five years ago I would have been overjoyed. But it sorts of feels too little too late - especially after seeing how distant we really are.

My question to anyone who has been here or close to here : how do I separate out my true feelings about my marriage and spouse, versus the CPTSD reactions? Any insights on the triggering aspects of our dynamic? How do I value my sexual desires in all of this - since we've been affection free for so long?

Thanks for reading. The insights offered in here have helped me be brave enough to make this post. Sending safe internet hugs to any who want them.",1679153082.0

129,I wet the bed fairly consistently until my late teens,2,11uqplq,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11uqplq/i_wet_the_bed_fairly_consistently_until_my_late/,1,"I’m using a throwaway as this is something I’ve always been extremely self conscious about. 

Up until the ages of 16-18 I would uncontrollably wet the bed almost every night. I would go through phases where it would not happen for a couple months at a time, or would happen very sparingly. However, for the most part it would occur anywhere from 3-7 days of the week.

No one outside of my immediate family knows about this issue (to my knowledge) and I have never seen a doctor about it.

The issue has slowly gone away over the past 2-3 years and happens very sparingly now (a handful of times a year).

I have just turned 20 and have started to suspect / realise that I may have been subject to abuse primarily from my alcoholic dad during my childhood. I say suspected as I have only just started remembering events from my childhood that I realise were not normal amongst other families. A lot of my childhood memories up until around the age of 15-16 are a blur and I only really recall small flashes. 

Without going into too much deal, my parents had an extremely messy divorce when I was 16. Shortly following this I got heavily into drugs, consistently and occasionally excessively using everything except hard stuff - primarily weed, alcohol, mdma, lsd, shrooms, etc.

As of late I have begun slowly tapering off my drug usage and have slowly been realising and remembering the events of my childhood. I have started seeing a therapist and have yet to bring up the bed wetting. Could this be related to this at all?

The whole time they're there I'm looking at him and telling him you literally have everything you could ever want a full time job, a car, a girlfriend and still you antagonize me why? I don't do ANYTHING to you to deserve this. He just sits there like the smug bastard he is. I warned his girlfriend about him right before it happened.

He talks to her like she's beneath him. Anyway, my mom finally helped him move out today. I can't believe he's finally gone.

And then he turned it to how we lost my brother two years ago and they really need me back again. 

My response, as always, is to spiral down, wondering if I’m making everything up in my mind and actively hurting my parents. But I think my therapist would read it and respond with “wow that’s manipulative.” Unfortunately my sessions are on Fridays before I got this email, so I can’t know her response until next week.

140,Can parents split one of their children black?,3,11ukddu,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11ukddu/can_parents_split_one_of_their_children_black/,7,"TLDR: Can parents who think in black and white still take basic care of their children, but decide they are 'bad' aka split them black?

This might be a dumb question, but I'm really struggling to understand this one myself. My entire childhood and young adulthood, I always felt like different rules applied to me than to my older sister when it comes to my mother. I was quite an outgoing child when young, and always loved making friends, but as I grew older I became more reserved, quiet, and socially anxious. I basically went to school and then spent my time in my bedroom drawing or listening to music. However, I never got any trust from my mother and she always got angry about little things unexpectedly. She made me feel like I was a very problematic teenager, when I did literally nothing. Looking back I see myself as a vegetable version of a teen l, literally zero joy, and did not go through 'puberty' until my mid 20s. It was a very scary time. Even as a young adult, her fury would rain down on me for the most bizar things. For example, she got really angry with me because I started dating a boy in a neighbouring country, since that wasn't ideal that he lived abroad, or something?

I've never seen this type of constant anger and criticizing towards my sister, UNTIL RECENTLY! I moved abroad for years and came back, so I was out of her radar. I come back and she has all these bizar accusations towards my sister that make zero sense. Aka ""she didn't show me her wedding photos straight away, she waited for months! It must be because her husband is angry with me, because she would've called me asap to come see them in the past!"" (Her husband is not angry and wedding photos take months to be processed and developed by the photographer....) and then giving my sister the silent treatment whilst complaining to me.

Is this splitting? Does she always split one of us black for no reason? Or is this just a typical codependency dynamic? As in she always resents one of us because she puts all her energy into one child and then does not receive what she wants from them? The latter would also make sense, because I remember her being very claiming as well, inserting herself into my life when she wasn't invited. An example is her straight up breaking into tears when I got my highschool diploma and my boyfriend at the time wanted to take me out to dinner to celebrate, because how dare I celebrate with someone else after 'all she's done for me'.

Sorry for the long story, I just really want to make sense of this, and why she used to cling to me like that and moved on to my sister when I left. I'm happy to not be her main focus anymore, but seeing her act this way towards my sister, who was her perfect angel who she fully trusted growing up, is kind of wild. I don't blame my sister for any of this btw, she is also extremely traumatised by both of our parents.",1679134956.0

The science behind gratitude and how to practice gratitude. Dr. Huberman explained a lot of things. And I realised something while listening. 
We just don't become who we are because of our thoughts (as per the saying: You become what you think); what we receive also defines who we became. 
As child I never received gratitude or any sort of happy or positive emotion. So I find it hard to feel happy or appreciated or valued. 
During my college my friends they've said thank you so many times, like thank you for helping with assignment, you saved me today. Thank you for calling and waking me up otherwise I'd have missed lab today. And I was happy with them, I kind of forgot I was once happy but remembering the time makes me happy. I was able to do things, graphic designing, learning new language, managing my finance, managing myself. 
But after coming back home, I was rarely appreciated for any good thing I did. Instead I was told how I was worthless for not doing masters degree, I was a burden for not having a job, for not making money. For being skinny and what not. I barely recieved any good or kind word from my family. And it affected me way too much. I'm not able to do things I was naturally good at. From what I received I've just became a empty, hollow person.

When I thought about the time I received gratitude, I realised : Man!!! I was a good human. I was capable of doing good things, I was capable of giving someone a sense of comfort. 

I'm going to practice gratitude the way it was described in podcast. I'm going to live. 
With that I was really really disturbed because of my phobia and having a hard time, so I posted about it here and received a lot of kind messages, people telling how they're also afraid of something and they feel the same. That was first time in my life where I was able to calm myself not continuosly thinking about it and worsening things. I received tips from fellow people with phobias. Someone validated that it's not my fault for reacting the way I did. That one post and conversations in comments really helped me that day.

They often make a lot of jokes, and in general are light-hearted/funny/fun. I've worked at this job for 2+ years and for my first year of working here, I did not and would not engage in banter with this coworker:

1. I didn't trust myself to pick up on all the social cues and could easily misinterpret a joke or say something back that wasn't funny and in fact mean.
2. I didn't want to get myself in any kind of professional trouble so it was best to stay away from it

Eventually, over a long period of time I warmed up and have been able to crack jokes here & there with this coworker and to my knowledge it's always been fine.

Now, for context I walked into work today very grouchy. Wednesday night I realized I made a dumb mistake and had to redo a personal project and all day Thursday I had shooting pain and numbness down my left arm along with some mild arm weakness (I have spinal issues - not a heart attack) and I was very fatigued. I slept from 6:20 PM to 7:20 AM to be at work at 8 AM and I was still fatigued, grouchy, and my arm was definitely still hurting in the morning. Thankfully, it is better tonight.

Of course, no one at work knows any of this and this coworker who is usually a jokester is in the office. They haven't been around in awhile as they've been offsite doing work and they say something about having a really busy weekend or something to another coworker and how they're not happy about it. Off the cuff half asleep I respond with a sarcastic, ""sounds like a you problem,"" they didn't respond much to it- I didn't think anything of it. Totally missing the context cues. 

Then, later that morning they were at the copier as was I and their apple watch wasn't cooperating, so I simply said, ""Maybe Siri doesn't want to take orders from you today."" At which point they tell me they're not in a humorous mood today and would appreciate it if I didn't joke with them. 

I just said, ""Oh, sorry! Yea, no problem, you're good."" & that was the end of it. First thing that I thought was, wow what a well adjusted human setting good boundaries, wish I was better at that...at which point I realized I was the one pushing the limits and the reason why they needed to set a boundary in the first place and was the one being disrespectful & I went to bathroom and cried. Usually, when I cry at work its not for a work thing - this is the first time I ever cried over a work interaction. Granted I recognize it was a cry based on the build up of stress since Wednesday, but still. 

However, it's clearly still living in my head rent free now haunting me and I can't help but wonder, I don't like it when others have to set boundaries with me and it makes me feel icky, like I did something horribly wrong and I never want to make others feel like I did, but when I set similar boundaries with others they must be feeling like I do now and that doesn't make me feel good about myself. 

As for the joking with this coworker or at work in general goes, I'm going to back off of that. Simply because of how easy it is for me to make a tasteless joke and I don't need avoidable/unnecessary stress. Especially because I got so comfortable that I inserted myself into a conversation to make a tasteless joke that I wasn't even apart of to begin with. Ugh.

But, ya does anyone else struggle or feel guilty when someone has to set a boundary with you?",1679114167.0
148,I am addicted to spanking,14,11uam84,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11uam84/i_am_addicted_to_spanking/,16,"Trigger warning(s)- CSA, family trauma, physical abuse (spanking), child exploitation?

Hello. I have something that’s bothered me for my entire life. I have an addiction to spanking. It’s always on my mind from the time I wake up until the time I go to sleep. The addiction started from early childhood. I started getting spankings since I was a toddler, and by the time I was in pre-school I was spanking my dolls and even other children in daycare.

My caretakers praised me for ‘whooping’ another girl at my preschool. I remember being in timeout and I couldn’t understand why. Spanking was a regular topic that I heard of and experienced as a child. Older relatives would reminisce about their childhood beatings and not long after they would reminisce about mine.

My caregivers loved to talk about my spankings I got as a toddler, because I was ‘A bad little girl’ and my bad behavior was corrected by spanking. They would congratulate themselves on correcting my bad behavior and if I asked them to stop bringing it up I was told to shut up.

‘We’re adults, we can talk about whatever we want.” Is the response I would receive. I was left feeling violated and wrong. The worst part of it all was I could NEVER remember those punishments and hearing every little detail would cause fear in me.

The childhood punishments and exploitation would only get stronger for me. When I was around six, my grandma spanked my cousin and I for playing in the mud. Not only were we spanked in the backyard, but my grandfather was recording it on the cam recorder. I remember watching him with TERROR as he smiled and pointed the camera at us.

At the next family gathering, during the 4th of July, my grandfather showed this film to our entire family. I guess it’s not a big deal, we were fully clothed. Whenever I brought it up and asked my grandmother why she allowed this to happen, she simply told me that I was accusing her and would cry.

My own mother said that it’s not that bad and it was my fault for playing in the mud. When I type this, I feel like a whiny idiot begging for attention. Maybe it wasn’t that bad. 

Now that I’m a 26-year-old adult still living with my relatives (all alcoholics), I’ve come to realize that my caregivers have a sick obsession with spanking children in public. 

I have a whole list of spanking stories that fucked me up and contributed to my current perversion. I won’t list them all, but it is safe to say that I am addicted to spanking. Everything about it turns me on. I cannot get aroused unless spanking is involved. When it comes to watching porn, I cannot get excited about anything else but spanking. It gives me a high like no other. 

I’m a member of a spanking porn-site and I draw spanking related art. I love imagining myself as a little girl getting spanked by someone way older than me. It’s on my mind non-stop and I’m not sure if I’m doing this out of spite or if I truly like it.

I’m so confused and I’m wondering if there is anyone here who has developed a fetish due to trauma. 

Side note- I feel so much shame posting this. My mind is telling me ‘How dare you talk down about your religious and perfect relatives? You’re a sinner compared to them, they aren’t kinky YOU ARE.” Even though I’m in an adult body, I feel the need to submit to them as if I were a small, punishable girl.

I often find myself feeling surprised that he hasn't left me yet because he has told me that he feels hurt that he is constantly having to prove his love to me. before i call him to get that validation, the danger seems so imminent. 

&#x200B;

the source of this trauma could be from apostatizing after being a devout christian (aka finding out the thing i had convinced myself that loved me most wasn't real) or not having an emotionally available father or being in a relationship with a narcissist for a while. idk. my mom who is so loving and supportive always tells me whenever i don't accept certain help or things that i need or don't do something for myself like put sheets on my bed for a while or something, that she is afraid that i don't feel like i deserve love or good things. i know the church told me i deserved hell and not love all of my formative years so that's probably a part of it.    


bottom line though, i don't want to hurt him. I want to help him as much as he helps me. i feel indebted to him--not because of anything he's said but because i feel like i'm taking and taking and not giving. he says that i do things for him which i do, like cook or help him clean or buy him random presents and stuff. but during my panic attacks, it is so hard for me to feel like he loves me even though i'm the one making hurtful accusations and he is usually always patient, kind, and validating.

She would lose contact with other family members that are nice to us, she would lose contact with me, I would lose another family member. I want us to stick together, not to be torn apart.

I have a well paying job and am working towards moving out so that she can come live with me. We just have to hang in there a little longer. Or maybe she can go live with her boyfriend. But please stop suggesting CPS. I know it can be good, but in our current situation it wouldn't be.

Ironic, because my abuser is currently serving 30+ years for child rape and assault.

I’ve had slivers of memories about it surface throughout my life, but would always convince myself it wasn’t real; that I’d made it all up. Then shove them right back down for another decade. Almost like I knew it was there on some semi conscious level, but if I could maintain this delusion that I’d made it up, I could really let myself believe that.

I have diagnosed PTSD from a separate unrelated event in my 20s. It took me 5+ years to actually fully process that, the dissociation alone was 2-3 years. The only thing that got me though that, was micro-dosing psilocybin over the course of the last year. It was the hardest thing I’ve even done, but it did work. (Not for everyone, and not to be taken lightly WHATSOEVER)

Which brings me to my problem. Even though the doses were small and infrequent, I do believe this was partially responsible for me recovering those childhood abuse memories again now. I was wary of this prior to starting the shrooms, but at that point I was near suicidal so it was a risk I was willing to take.

So I’m at the point now where it’s either time to fully address and start healing my CSA trauma, or to take a beat and let the rest of my memories resurface in their own time. I told my doctor I was hesitant to try emdr for fear of remembering the full events. He suggested ketamine infusion therapy, intensive outpatient, or tms therapy - which sounds a bit terrifying. 

But the thing is, there’s another option. My abused made recordings of the abuse. They exist, in some evidence locker somewhere. And I can’t stop thinking that maybe if I could just know vague details without actually having to see it, that maybe I could finally have some sense of closure…although I suspect this idea of closure is wishful thinking.

Parents never gave presents on birthdays, we would give cards. They mostly ignored my birthday last year since I was on pretty low contact.

I don't want to ignore it but I also know it might not be taken well, and it might reopen contact in an unfavorable way where I have to be ready to stick to my boundaries when my mother wants to reopen contact.

Additionally, the healthcare system in this country is on the brink of collapse and can take years for neurodivergent people to get an assessment with ADHD/ASD. My family and people around me all think I certainly have some sort of neurodivergency aside from CPTSD and I have researched these issues for about 6 months now. 

For people with short attention spans especially, they need to hyper focus on their issues in order to actually get real support which is what I did with my CPTSD/ADHD/ASD and I am now further along in my mental health journey.

I keep thinking that if I just suffer a little more and carry on just a little more, if I don't speak up, If I say yes, if I am nice, if I laugh at disrespect, people will eventually see that I am worthy that I am a good person. Like I have to fill this suffering jar before I get to be happy. Because I haven't earned it. I lost so much of my childhood not being happy because I had to carry on the stresses of adults. I never got to make friends. How could I relate and just be a kid. I saw everyone as immature, when in reality I was the wirdo who was too much in my own head. Heck I probably thought I was better, but deep down I remember I wanted to so badly fit in and join in the fun and laughter. I'm such a lonely 23 year old even though I know so many faces. 

I can't even write a fucking email without questioning it 1000 times, and my family says I'm a loser because I don't want to go to college. I know I don't have the mental capacity to go but they wouldn't understand. They keep reminding me how much I waste my life and it kills me but they think it's supposed to be motivating. 

I want to stop fawning so badly, but even though I'm so aware of my behavior, I can't make it stop. I can't confront anyone, ab anything. I always go with the flow of everything to avoid conflict. And I mean everything. The worst part is that now I'm so aware of the way ppl have used me. Aware of how they manipulate me. All this time I thought I was being a decent being, I've just been a push over. The butt of a joke. Laughing at me instead of with me. And it bring tears to my eyes. Yet, my inner critic keeps telling me I'm a bad person every time I wanna do what I want to do. I feel like a narcissist looking for validation even when I post here. Even when you guys tell me I'm not, part of my brains says yes you are yes you are yes you are. I feel like even when I tell my own story, I'm twisting it in such a way that it makes me the good guy. I don't know, all my life I've been gaslight and berated by both parents I remember looking up if I was a psychopath when I was maybe 9 or 10, because my mother would tell me I was anytime I would get angry at the mistreatment. I've lost any ounce of anger. I don't know what I would do if anyone as much as raised their voice at me. I'd probably freeze like a rabbit. I hate it so much. They made it feel like I should be grateful for the beatings because of the lessons they were teaching me. Idfk what I'm rambling on about, but you all are the only people who ever hear anything I have to say. Thanks everyone and have a ncie day, I really hope it's good.",1679060548.0

I don't want to forgive her. She let this man abuse my brothers and I for years, my brothers were even abused before they were BORN. This man loves to beat pregnant women, and kids. She still hasn't left him, but I left her to stay with my uncle, and now she's regretting everything, attempting to rebuild a relationship but I can't bring myself to, I don't have any trust for her.

I was so used to her always nagging at me, putting me down and being negative (I still love and miss her - there were good times). Now I see some of her traits in my partner. 

My partner is a very grumpy individual.  He has a lot of complaints, everyday usually in a bad mood and will lecture me over small things. I am used to it but at the same time I am sick of it. It reminds me a little bit of my mom who I miss a lot, but I don't know if I'm doing this love stuff right. We agreed to be life partners, for the most part I enjoy him. I'm just sick of his negative attitude and lecturing everyday. 

Like, for example: my birthday is coming up and I'm planning a get together. I asked him to help me pay for the venue since it's my special day. He said sure, but only if people actually show up. he said he won't pay for anything if one or two people show up and he has a huge hunch that's what's going to happen. He feels like no one is going to show up and that he is going to spend an hour with me on my birthday. 

His video game is coming out the week of my birthday and he is stressing to me in a lecture how he will be spending most of his time playing it, and not to expect attention from him other than on my birthday. I smile and say okay. 

Why lecture me about it though? why lecture me that only a small amount of people will come to my get together? why lecture me and remind me that my birthday is just a day and not to expect more from it?

i try not to be bitter or think too much about who i “could” have been. but even though the trauma started really early for me, i have memories of having a pretty strong sense of self and a lot of confidence until age 11/12

by that age my mother had been tormenting me about my weight for a couple of years and then when i moved to a new school and lost my friends/support system, i finally developed an ED and then all the other manifestations of trauma just piled on from there 

but before then, i remember literally not caring about my weight at all no matter how cruelly she would speak to me. its not that i ‘loved’ my body, more that i was totally indifferent to it

another example is how i behaved at school - even though i was labelled a “problem child”, before age 12ish i remember genuinely being amused by the fact that a lot of people/teachers found me annoying because i was loud and talked a lot. i remember feeling kind of like “if they don’t like me then there’s literally nothing i can do about it.” no fight, no flight, no freeze. just that elusive sense of self assurance that i can’t grasp or emulate now no matter how hard i try 

it’s almost worse knowing how my brain used to work compared to how it works now, ie “if they don’t like me then i am worthless and inherently unlikeable and should hide away so as not to subject anyone else to Me.” now that i’m putting all this effort into healing myself back to a mental state that i actually had once, there’s an added frustration there that i can’t really describe. it’s like i’m looking something that i know for sure is *somewhere* in my house but i’ve torn the place apart several times already and still can’t find it",1679073523.0

I’m coming to the age of 22. I’ve been through 16 traumatic events. No. That isn’t an exaggeration or a joke. I was diagnosed with CPTSD at age 15, but could have easily been diagnosed even before then. I grew up in a *really* bad area. The town itself is super nice! It’s pretty. Is surrounded by water, and forestry! The people whom reside there… is another story. Lots and LOTS of crime. I have one word for you. ✨Bremerton✨.


Anyways. That town. Caused a good majority of my trauma. It pains me to physically go back. I’m in an abusive relationship though, and going back is going to be my only way out. What resonated with me the most/messed me up the most. Was nearly being stabbed/killed at school. I was only 15 when this happened. Two weeks later.. my grandmas house burnt down. She blamed me for years for it, when it wasn’t even my fault. Long story short, we went to a park to have a picnic, to destress from the whole school situation. I saw smoke, coming from across the bay. Where her house was. So I told her and my mom “hey Nanny’s house is on fire”. They didn’t believe me.. until they heard on the scanner that yes, her unit was indeed, on fire. 

My grandma blamed me for YEARS for that. The cause? A man had flicked a LIT CIGARETTE INTO A CARDBOARD BOX. (PS, fuck you, you ruined both our lives). My life was a living hell for 3 months while she lived with us. I wasn’t allowed to sleep in my BRAND. NEW. BED. That mind you, could fit BOTH OF US as it was a full size mattress. So. I slept on the floor with a single blanket and pillow for 3 months. God forbid I slept in the bed while she wasn’t sleeping. She threatened to off herself multiple times over that. I was just a kid. Still in school. Raising my autistic brother at the time, as well as my mom was lazy. She would sleep from 4AM-3/4PM every day. So it was on me, to take care of my brother. 

Flash forward to now.. I just feel so hopeless. It seems like I cant go a year, without a traumatic event coming up. Something out of my control. Always. 

Why am I a target for the universe? Why am I being made to endure so much, as someone so young? Does it ever get better? I just recently got a puppy, who was my SDiT for my CPTSD. I was diagnosed with CPTSD at age 15. As well as severe anxiety, and major depressive disorder. Recently, I was diagnosed as being on the ASD spectrum, and having BPD. So.. I got myself a dog. Who I was training to aid me with my disabilities. Mostly.. my panic attacks. I easily have between 2-5 a day. Usually, when I am alone. I cannot handle being alone due to some of the events I went through. In the end.. he had to be rehomed due to my abuse situation. My most recent… traumatic event, as I have been without a service dog for years. Since 2019, when my old SD, Batman, had to retire, and I had to move across the state. Without him. My life has been a living hell. My mental state is drastically declining every day. I wish that WASNT me being serious. 

I wish I never had any traumatic events. That I was NORMAL. I want to go thru day to day life, without worrying when my next traumatic event will be. Trying to shelter myself, so said events DON’T HAPPEN AGAIN. 

I just want to know… when it will end. When will the trauma end? Will it always be like this? Am I just… cursed?! I don’t want to keep living, if this is truly how life will be because oh my fucking god dude. Sometimes I wish they never diagnosed me. Sometimes… as selfish as it is.. I wish the trauma happened to someone else. Sometimes… I just wish the years and years of therapy, got me somewhere. Somewhere I felt safe. Somewhere I felt ok…",1679081936.0

I'm gonna listen to you and try and help the best I can."" They should NOT even be ALLOWED to say ""you're safe with us"" because it's not a fucking guarantee. All it does is set me up to be betrayed.

Like fuck. Just stop. I'm so tired. I'm on my last fucking leg.

I'm just so done. Why can't anybody just admit how untrustworthy and retraumatizing everything is? I'm tired of just hearing ""I'm sorry"" from everybody who works in that system. I want to— no, I NEED to hear *""that never should have happened to you. That is no way to treat a human being.""* That would encourage me to get help more than saying ""you can trust me"" ever would because I would at least know that somebody has my fucking back.

Admit how hard it is for me to trust you (a person working in the system) and help me feel safe. Don't make that fucking decision of ""you can trust me"" for yourself. I'm just so tired. I want support, but I cannot deal with another fucking person doing this to me. I don't want to die but I don't know how much fucking longer I can go. I want help but I'm at the point where I'm surviving an hour at a time. It's getting worse because of recent compounded trauma and disability taking forever and not being able to leave my abusive environment (again, PLEASE NO ADVICE).

I've been trying to give myself a ""break"" from it all but the feelings of being trapped keep coming back and every night I come so close to snapping at my abusers or hitting myself that I drive away so I can be alone and cry so that I don't explode.

I'm sobbing in my car as I'm writing this because I just want to be taken care of, not betrayed. I want the pain to stop. I can't imagine any other way for it to happen other than death. I want material help so that my life is EASIER. I don't want credit or praise about how ""strong"" I am. I want to be held and supported and have people go EASY on me. I want fucking help  Actual real help from the system.",1679106754.0
197,When your partner also has CPTSD and you realize it just can't work... anyone dealt with this? How did you deal with it? I'm going through this right now.,2,11uel4i,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11uel4i/when_your_partner_also_has_cptsd_and_you_realize/,14,"She has a kid who's 14 that was born shortly before I left home (we were 19). Then after I came back, my mom died, the friend that introduced us moved to another state, and we started dating...

I think it became pretty obvious after the first year at least that while we had a lot of the same things in our childhood, we simply were not compatible in the types of adults we were. The prime example... while she was running in the streets and smoking crack and getting pregnant as a teenager, I was at home alone doing homework for my honors classes and taking care of my little sister (while convincing my psychiatrists to give me adderall, lol). I don't look down on her for this... but she would downplay the importance of like, KNOWLEDGE (not formal education, like actual learning) and would accuse me of being pretentious like it was the worst crime. I've worked hard to be the least narcissistic person in my family, give me a break.

But this one in particular pisses me off. I basically grew up in the Shameless house. I've told her this. And I can't tell you the amount of times I would say something relating to the kid and she would tell me I ""don't know what it's like because I'm not a parent"". That pissed me off to no end. Half the time, I fucking WAS the parent. I can't imagine caring for anyone more than my little sister. And I wasn't legally required to! Believe it or not, some people take care of others not of obligation, but out of the goodness of their hearts!

So I texted her wishing her a happy St Patrick's Day (we are both Irish, but I more than her... like I said, the Shameless house). We got to talking a bit, but when I mentioned my plans for the small business I'm trying to start, she completely ignored it. Then an hour later it turned into her ranting about her problems with her psychiatrist... THEN telling me I had to get one ""it's important to take care of your mental health!""

I don't know if she just doesn't understand why having my strengths being respected is important to me, but that really hurt for some reason. It makes me feel narcissistic. But it's like... I don't need to be praised for having more education than her. I just need to be... heard? Or seen? I just wish she could see me for the guy I really am, not the guy she apparently wanted me to be. Which was different than *I* assumed.

I also realized I have a lot of problems she doesn't have. For one, I don't struggle with feeling powerless due to the abuse (I ALWAYS fought back, and I acknowledge as a 6'2 guy I'm lucky to be able to do this) as much as a fear of success. Because every time I did something that made me feel good about myself, one of my parents would say something nasty or (if it was my mom) orchestrate something behind my back to sabotage me. It's been six years since my mom died, but my dad still does this with these snide, passive aggressive remarks. I'm the one putting a roof over his head and he wants my business to fail?

Can anyone relate? I wanna hear your stories. I just feel so ""other"" right now and I don't want this shit to ruin my people's holiday, haha.",1679114562.0
198,Ongoing longterm therapy is sometimes counterproductive.,15,11txfai,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11txfai/ongoing_longterm_therapy_is_sometimes/,14,"I have been in therapy for probably about 6-7 years. In those years I have noticed that there often comes a point where Im in it too long and start to feel like I need to work on pretty much every aspect of myself. Almost everything you say/do is challenged or questioned. Although it is often with good intent I find myself needing a break sometimes. Which Im going to take now after a full year of therapy. It was a very fruitful year but I think at least for the next few months its enough. 

Sometimes therapy makes me feel so dysfunctional but then I see myself being functional in many areas of my life and its confusing. I guess in therapy all your trigger points come up and this is often the part of you that your therapist sees most. There is often a lack of focus in the things that do go well. Which makes sense, but it also creates a skewed image (in my case at least) of who you are as a person. 

Last session I got so frustrated because the whole conversation everything I said was challenged. ""How can you find a way to deal with the frustration you feel about the life you have been given?"" ""How can you come to terms with people not always responding how you want them to?"" ""How can you find a way to express your anger?"". Towards the end I got so frustrated that I exploded a bit and stormed out (my therapist and me are ok again tho). I dont have an answer to these questions and I dont think I will find them soon either. I think I just need to kind of.. go through the struggle? Allow myself to struggle with it instead of always looking for a way to feel better or make things less intense? Its exhausting honestly! 

I think taking a break can be a good thing sometimes. The nature of therapy is to look at yourself, who you are, how you function. But sometimes it makes you hyperaware of yourself which also kind of worsens things.. focusing a bit less inward can give some peace as well in my experience. 

Anyway, I already came a really long way in processing my trauma so this might not be applicable to everyone. The first 4 years of therapy was pretty non stop for me too. But maybe someone can relate and needs to hear this too.",1679073573.0

He yelled at me and got in my face about leaving it open, I escalated in return, he hit me so hard that his palm of his hand broke my collarbone.

After this happened he started threatening to kill me on a regular basis. I would be running as fast as I could to get the train to his house and he would call me screaming and tell me that if I miss the train he is going to ""drive down there and break my neck""

I flash back to this violence every day. 

When I have episodes about it, I feel terrified that I will be beaten for speaking about it. 

When I got home to my mom's house after it happened she told me he didn't mean to do it and I had to forgive him.

I feel like if I cry as hard as I want to about the decades of terror he put me through, I will literally feel the bone break again.

He spent the next 15 years gaslighting me about it. 

I wish he had been 8 inches to the right with his punch and collapsed my windpipe and killed me, at least then he'd be suffering the rest of his life in jail.

So I just discussed this part of my trauma with my therapist.  I was underfed in my first two years leading to lack of appropriate weight gain, and what would have been called failure to thrive.  When I was around 2 1/2 I was hospitalized for the flu and at that point my height was 90th percentile and my weight was 2nd percentile.  This was in the 1980s so I guess doctors back then were idiots because when I recovered they just sent me home with my parents.  No call to social services?  Did social services even exist back then?  IDK

Anyway, we started getting WIC, maybe the doctors pushed this as a solution?  I don't remember being hospitalized, but the WIC clinic was one of my earliest memories.  It was, I think, our first visit after I was discharged from the hospital.  I was with other kids and adult helpers in a room doing a craft while the moms were in another room (maybe getting a nutrition lesson?).

The craft finished, the moms came back and I went to show my mom what I made.  She completely ignored me like I wasn't even there, and I realized that maybe it wasn't my mom.  I had gone to the wrong person.  But then I realized that I don't know what my mom looks like and I don't know who she is.  I'm thinking I don't know how I got here, or why I'm here, or where I am.  I just stood there confused and in a daze.  

My therapist said a toddler would react to ""getting lost"" like that.  But I didn't react.  I didn't cry or try to go to anyone for help.  I think I was dissociated out of my mind.  My therapist said I must have been taught not to cry already, that crying wasn't safe, or was ignored so much that I knew it wouldn't summon help.  

So now, I'm newly thinking about how much I must have been laying around dissociated, starving in my first two years, with no energy to play, explore, or even cry.  I'm seeing myself in a new way.  Sometimes **still** when I dissociate hard, I stop protecting myself, like I don't care whatever happens to me.  And I see that's what I was doing as a baby, unable to do anything about hunger or other discomfort.  So I dissociated myself out of my body, perhaps waiting for death.

But I need to get this off my heart *somewhere*: 

\[TRIGGER: MENTION OF VIOLENCE, INFERTILITY, OBSESSION\]

Since I was little, I had an obsession with having kids. It started out as very normal; just a big mother instinct and a caring nature. However, as time went on, the idea of a ""happy family"" became a coping mechanism. I grew up in a heavily abusive household -mother, father, the entire family was broken. When I lay in bed, crying after my mentally unstable mother had beaten me up for ""not smiling on command"" or ""stealing a book"" (taking it without permission), I would often cry and imagine how I would act the opposite. How my partner would act different to my father. In general; how I would want a family to look like. How a family that *loved me,* would look like too.

As time went on, this simple fantasy took roots. Not ""noticably"" at first, but vividly. It grew stronger and stronger -till it was everything that held me from slaughtering my mother with a butcher knife in her bed. Which...yes, sounds extreme, but it's true. Because as much as I wanted justice & revenge, this little obsession reigned stronger than that. Not only because I would get time in prison/people would avoid me for being a killer, but also because I knew it would hurt my mother so much more. Call it irony, but my mother shared my obsession. She has untreated NPD & BPD and had/has regular fits/obsessions with how my father & I were supposed to act like. Including elevating herself as the ""holy, untouchable"" mother figure. 

So...what's with the title?

I'm not really sure how to explain it still. But...I think my obsession as grown into its own form of monster. A monster...I can't ever tell anyone about.

It's like a coin-toss, really: On one side, its positive impact is huge. It is one of the things that keep me optimistic and excited about my future. It helps me keep developing skills I normally wouldn't care about. Like cooking. Or ironing clothes. When I think about a potential partner, I not only judge potential red flags for me, but also how it would impact future children. Plus, it still keeps me from doing revenge shit on my mother. Just the daydream about becoming everything my mother wasn't -fullfillng *her* goal of having successfull children that love their parent - keeps me feeling like justice has already happened. On the other side...any form of potential drawback...I can't chose. Any even slight ""potential"" that my dream might fail gives me a nearly instant panic attack: Infertility. A baby swap at the hospital. My mother somehow stealing my children or turning them against me.

Due to this, my stand on many positions is already crooked. And hence it's why I can't tell anyone. For example; infertility. I'm not saying that it's a bad standard to call someone an asshole, when they leave their infertile partner. Infertility ain't sterility. Plus, too many don't consider alternative options, or treatments (Ironically, I share the opinion here). However...I'm going to confess that this scenario on paper alone is enough to make me go into a frenzy. Mostly because I knew that this would be a breakup/divorce reason for me. But again; not for the ""normal"" reasons I just mentioned. It's not because of my partner. It'd be me. I would go nuts. Trapped between societal/moral expectation to stay & my obsession, it would only take so long. Maybe I could calm myself until options are clear. But it'd still be noticable.

It's such a weird situation. On one side, I logically agree with all the things that are progressive. A family does not have to come from Ma and Pa. Adoption is an option. Etc. But this is the point. The monster/obsession...it has a mind of its own. Every idea going against it, gives me a physical reaction. For example; when I had an endometriosis-scare. I was internally dead for weeks. It was incomparable to any form of depression you might picture. It was not the idea that I wanted to die...but that there was no reason for me to live. Just meandering out the unchangeable.

I can't tell anyone about this. ""Coin-toss"" is both the most hidden and biggest trauma thing I have. People think it be just a stubborn, asshole choice if I would. But in truth; I don't *have* a choice. I lost any form of control long ago. Like, you think I *LIKE* this??! You think I *LIKE* to already *know* that I would potentially hurt someone I truly love, someone for something they have no control over, because of something I have no control over and could barely start to explain? 

 Even worse; I don't fucking know how to treat it. To cut it, would also cut one of my few consistent life-lines and throw me into despair. It's both pushing and forcing me to go on.

I envy people who don't feel that way.",1679110960.0

I am a massive foodie, with a catch: I don’t really like eating the actual food.

Isn’t that ironic? Well I do like eating actual food, but because I have an eating disorder, I hate it too. I swear, I’m CRAZY about cooking. Always watching cooking videos, cooking recipes to get better at the hobby, yet seldom actually eating. I’ve got quite a bit of knowledge about cooking techniques, secret ingredients, nutrition, and how to get quality food for a low price.

But… well, you know how EDs are. The tug of war, between the irrational ED voice trying to gaslight me into starvation, the actual reasonable voice who knows how destructive (potentially deadly) that is.

Often I cook/bake and give it to others, instead of eating it myself. Apparently this is a common ED behavior, it’s allegedly a way of vicariously eating? But I like doing that because food brings people joy (unless you have an ED duh). Combined with the negative self-view that people with depression/social anxiety/EDs/CPTSD have, feeding people and getting a positive response is one of the few positive traits I can even begin to find about myself. Oh and I‘m diagnosed with all 4 of the mental illnesses mentioned above, isn’t that nice 🤡 

When I was in the early stages of my ED, it was awful because I think I hadn’t adapted to it yet. The hunger, exhaustion, and nearly passing out when I stood up was all too much, and I thought I’d have to spend the rest of my life this way if I didn’t want to look ugly af. I was suicidal to start with, so this compounded that, and I thought, “Spending the rest of my life this way is horrible… I can’t eat, I struggle to sleep, I want to be dead, I’m suffering 24/7, nobody would even miss me if I died”.

It’s been some time now and I’ve gotten totally used to this starvation lifestyle, which seems nice on the surface, but is actually terrible. Oh and yes, I do have professional help.

I have little to no memories of childhood friends, just the “essence” of how it felt to be their friend, and maybe one or two tiny, brief moments. I don’t know if it’s due to therapy or getting older and living away from my parents that I’m remembering things. Up until now, since I was about 18, I’ve felt very disconnected from my life experiences. Almost as if I died when I turned 18 and was reborn into a new body and mind. Also, in the last six months have been dealing with an episode of DPDR and borderline psychotic paranoia triggered by a stressful conflict with my mom. 

One thing that is strange, however, is most of the memories flooding back to me are just movies or books I was into as a kid. I always got super absorbed into movies and books and basically used them to escape mentally. Not always due to trauma (I was just “fascinated” by things easily and was very sensitive.) It frustrates me that I’m not regaining memories of actual people, like former friends- just flashbacks memories of emotions felt while immersed in these stories.

NOT everyone has experienced difficulty that profoundly affected their development, or shattered their sense of basic safety in the world. This isn't 'gatekeeping suffering', it's maintaining a meaningfully useful semi-clinical definition of trauma

But in the absence of good, nuanced therapy and psycho-education being freely available, there's essentially a gap in the market. And we all know who and what tends to fill those.

The mental health issues I was suffering during this period of time was due to childhood trauma. Because I went undiagnosed, my time at this service only made me sicker because they treated me on the assumption I had emerging BPD (but I didn’t know this until I retained my records years later).

TW for specific examples of mistreatment and mention of a suicide attempt.

I’ve been stripped and searched by nurses, fed on the floor, had food thrown at me, had my NG tubes pulled on by staff, and stitched up without anesthetic (because I did it to myself and therefore didn’t deserve it). I was also constantly ignored, told I was attention seeking/not sick enough (including not thin enough)/wasting resources/never going to recover/faking my distress. My therapist fell asleep during one of my sessions but I felt like it was my fault, so I kept talking until she woke up because I didn’t want her to feel bad.
On one occasion, my case worker watched me attempt suicide after I “absconded” from my appointment. She didn’t intervene, she just watched with her arms crossed, inconvenienced. It really haunts me because I honestly felt like she wished I had died so she didn’t have to care for me anymore.

This has all followed me and as a result, I can’t recover from my eating disorder. It’s too entrenched in the trauma and I’ve come to believe I’m not sick enough for care. I see a psychologist every week (and I have done for four years), but I’m so, so stuck. I’m currently in a relapse (ED) and I cycle between trauma work and ED work, depending, but I haven’t “moved on”. Nor have I been able to give trauma therapy a proper attempt due to my constant ED relapses. My brain wants to be “sick enough” and it somehow feels that if I can go back (into the same cycle I was in when I was young, or the weight where people took me the most seriously), I can resolve the pain. I don’t think this is logical, but it feels like I want to relive it to resolve it. I haven’t even started work on my childhood trauma because this other experience has been so consuming/demanding on my mental health.

This is a huge post, but has anyone found anything useful or healing? Or can anyone relate? I want so badly to move on with my life and accept what’s happened.",1679118334.0
215,"I think I really was sexually abused as a kid, beyond what I can remember & I’m falling apart",3,11u7w3z,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11u7w3z/i_think_i_really_was_sexually_abused_as_a_kid/,1,"I feel so lost and like I’m actually going to lose my mind. 

I’ve had some realizations/experiences lately that point toward OSDD - but I don’t know. Maybe it’s just CPTSD since that can be a dissociative disorder in itself. I’m just so confused. I’ve heard voices lately, distinct from my own thought process, that sound like younger versions of me. I also was able to put words to this experience I’ve had as long as I can remember where I get this loud, deafening almost whisper/vibration sound in my head. I try to etch-a-sketch it by trying to sing a song but I can’t. It’s like another language I can’t decipher. It leaves me feeling sick. Whatever it is, I know I have heavy dissociation, derealization, and depersonalization issues. 

I got the loud whisper last week on Wednesday, and then Friday I heard a little (maybe) me voice. It felt disembodied but not like a stranger. She said “I’m so hungry” - which is funny considering one of my symptoms lately has been severe, extreme non-stop hunger no matter what I eat. My husband and I eat the same and he’s never hungry after. I thought maybe it was PMDD cravings or my thyroid, but it’s been nonstop and painful and overwhelming. I was like “yeah I get it I’m fucking starving” but I think it’s connected to the next thing. 

I’m starting to accept that I was probably sexually abused by my step-great-grandpa as a kid. I had a few other experiences as a child that would count as molestation but they were when I was older, and already had issues. This is something that seems like it should’ve been obvious based on the signs. Probably ages 3-5, possibly until 6 or 7. I have a really hard time saying it out-loud or even typing it. He is dead. So is my grandma. But I still feel so guilty essentially accusing someone of something I don’t have concrete evidence for. I don’t want to be wrong because it means I’m a bad person, I don’t want to be wrong because it means my childhood was even more so a lie. My therapist says it doesn’t really matter what happened, or the “facts”, because of the things I am and have been experiencing. 

But I know how my body reacts. I have many little bits of memory that scare me. I’ve had stuff come back in dreams too. I know it’s not normal to have your grandpa pop into your head during sex, or masturbation. After he died when I was 16, I went downhill very fast with my Anorexia and self-harm. I felt so much guilt, and I didn’t know why. I don’t have many memories before age 8. That’s when I moved to Florida temporarily, and therefore wasn’t around him anymore. I also know that’s the typical age most people start having memories, right? When I came back my grandma was sick, and my body had changed. I wasn’t little anymore, I had early puberty. 

When I was little, like up until age 7, I held my poop for very long periods of time. It stopped after Florida. I was really sick from it. My family tried everything. I thought it could’ve been from my Autism, but it could’ve been trauma too. I have a memory of my grandpa giving me an enema but I talked to my (other, still living) grandma, and she said she’s the only one who ever did it. So what is that memory? 

Why do I get flashes of their house? His room? Bathroom? When I close my eyes, and regress to a younger state. I can’t stand the smell of grape soda, his favorite. He always drank it in the middle of the night. I would get up with him. I hate the smell of anything that resembles his aftershave. It’s what his bed smelled like. I remember even as a kid it would make me sick and feel this gnawing pain in my guts. I remember when he gave anyone else attention I was jealous.

I was his “best friend.” According to everyone he loved me more than anything. He bought me everything I wanted, fed me everything I wanted, made me look pretty and got me photo shoots & took polaroids of me. When he died my dad asked if he did anything to me. He said he always thought he groomed me. I was so angry at him for saying that, and I denied it because I couldn’t believe that could be the case. Despite the fact that when I masturbated, I felt like he was watching me. Back then I didn’t know what grooming was. It wasn’t until after my rape when I was 22 that I started having weird blips of memory and sensory memories come back about my Grandpa, that I looked up grooming. I became angry then at my dad again. If he thought that, why did he wait until after he died to do something? Turns out my dad might have sexually abused my sister so maybe that’s my answer. 

I think whatever happened, I either dissociated from heavily, or happened before I could form proper memories. Or he framed it in a way that seemed normal and good, hence the grooming. I have a pattern of dissociating heavily in sexual situations. I’m currently in a healthy marriage with the most amazing human, but I feel like I am going to ruin it eventually because I can’t get better. He doesn’t feel that way. When I was with my ex, he was very abusive and sexually dominating of me. I let him to whatever he wanted and left my body. I don’t know how I learned this, I just didn’t know I could say no. Just like I don’t know how I learned to put things in my vagina, and I don’t know how I learned about sex and being sexy so young, before I even had internet access. 

The only other possibility is that I’m just experiencing the trauma my mom went through being sexually abused because she never dealt with it. I know that trauma can be passed down. But she wasn’t abused by this person, so that doesn’t fully make sense. Maybe it’s both. My dad was sexually abused too. I don’t know. 

I just needed to get this all out. Lately I feel like I’m losing touch with reality, I’m under a lot of stress, my PMDD/CPTSD are so severe and I’m in pain daily, trying to get disability for those things plus many more and my Autism, and I’m terrified I won’t get it and we won’t have anywhere to live. I can’t work and have no money. I have an immune deficiency also and can’t get Covid so I’m really isolated. I’m also terrified that I am just coming apart and can’t stop it.
 
I feel stupid and don’t even want to post this but also I do. That’s always the result ultimately - there are two distinct halves of me at war. One that doesn’t want to be right and doesn’t want to be wrong, one that thinks I should die and another that’s terrified to die, one that wants to post this and one that doesn’t. They are never in communication with one another and they make my life miserable. I make my life miserable.",1679096213.0

Symptoms of being emotionally neglected growing up and parents who were unable to emotionally differentiate from their kids and treated them as objects and extensions of themselves lead to the adult not being sure what they want in life, what they like/dislike, etc.

After moving from fight or flight survival mode to now thriving mode over the last few years, I've put a lot of time into figuring out who I am, and what I like. 

But it seems like most people, just know what they like. They've seen a bunch of movies and tv shows and can comment on them, while I have nothing to say about it. They know different foods and cultures and go visit aunts and uncles and have dinner with their neighbors and many culture, entertainment and social activities that I never was subject to. 

You say, ""oh just go and do those things now"" but it's different because I still had to navigate healing and maybe I don't fully enjoy all those cultural and entertainment stuff because I've moved on with life, saw what the past was, and am still healing. 

It makes me hesitant to share my true self, because honestly I never got those experiences like other people, my parents avoided other people and said negative things about them. We didn't have extended family nearby and we never had family bonding or talking to neighbors or all the social life many people take for granted. I feel like most everyone I talk to are very different from me in that aspect. They always have extended family nearby, like ""oh I'm visiting my grandma who lives nearby"" and unlike me *who when I went no-contact with my parents, there was no grandma/grandpa, aunt/uncle or cousins who I could go to.* That was it for me. They have their childhood friends, or that group from college. I was always trying to fit in and even through therapy and all that effort, now I am slowly starting to find out what I like and to eventually feel the same as others.",1679067209.0

Waiting with my moms sick dog who's had on-going ear and paw infections and mast cell cancer that leaves her itchy all over, on benadryl daily and risks for anaphylaxis and other issues. 

We've been dealing with this sometimes multiple vet trips every month because the infections weren't staying away when she was at my moms because my mom drinks and leaves the house a literal shit hole and won't even feed the dog some days. Its been over a year now.

I've gone into debt just getting a hotel for a few weeks bc my landlord flipped when she was in my room less than 20 minutes at 11 PM to get her asap to a vet the next morning when I first saw how bad her infections were a year ago.

She's had weeks of being better here and there but now I'm at my dads, he's post-stroke, cancer, covid and now with beginning dementia and always an abusive and misogynistic asshole before that, but between my own autoimmune issues and trying to not fail out of my last few classes of college again from family stress, housing instability, and my medical, its a nightmare. He won't let me keep her here without my mom there and he was sexually harassing her (divorced 10 yrs and he cheated and was abusive) and making her cook and clean while he just sat on his ass, sundowned  and flipped out about his checkbook he couldn't remember doing.

My mom finally came back after another relapse but she refuses to even shower or do anything, even though she's on probation for assaulting me last year and not following up.

And I'm just tired of it. My mom will probably pay for this vet visit but im here holding the bag as shes getting worse and we're months from getting to the right specialist and that dog is pretty much my last reason to not just drop her leash and walk into traffic right now.

I'm lucky if I get my minimum needed grades to pass this semester and my professors don't care about circumstances even with proof. Like I didn't ask for my dad to get covid and then vascular dementia while I was moving and still using a 529 thats tied with my childhood SSI in his name and needing housing and he suddenly thinks I'm the enemy. 

Now I'm at risk for homelessness again and the school is giving me shit about my ADA accommodations as I try for on campus single housing for my literal autoimmune conditions and other issues that had me dropping out in the first place and my SAS is in limbo.

I'm tired. I'm just so tired of being sick, and not being able to go out or even eat most food anymore and always asking whats in meals and not being able to eat it, and all my doctors and the visits and the meds and risks and the bad news and the less and less ability to get out of this cycle and live.

I dont have friends, my last old friend I tried to reconnect with has antisocial personality disorder and literally bragged about putting in her opinion to cause drama and thank God for emdr work bc I finally listened to the warning signs and shut down and didn't engage to just get away but fuck there has been so few good people that were around for more than a moment and I want to live and do something with my life and not be so disabled but I can't even get scholarships to help pay for my necessary medical and it feels like a sick joke that I can't get free at this point.

I see othe people like me online, people I wish I could reach out to, but then my mind screams they're like my family or my shitty old friends or worse and I just shut down and don't reach out even online.

I have value damn it. Regardless of the medical or the abuse or the fact that my life trajectory is not what I planned when my dad kicked me out at 17 for not liking my new friends all of 2 months to my alcoholic violent mom and it fucked everything up that I didn't bow down for once bc my brother never did but he did so much wrong to me and the family and my dad just gives him 15k for Christmas right in front of me.

Why. Why can't I find safety to just finish pushing out of here? Why am I paying for their shitty mistakes and their shitty lifestyle choices and why can't I at least just be healthy enough to know this won't be my only place in life and I'll actually have something good.

Why does it just keep getting worse and why aren't I good enough to get help when I ask and get out? 

I hate it here. I just want the dog and I healthy and somewhere safe without strings at every moment and abuse at every corner and memories that won't stop and a world that would let me and so many others just die in the street. I'm not lazy, im in pain and I don't know if I can get out.",1679073892.0

I have autism and believe a lot of bad things have happened because people can see my neurodiversity, I don't know how to mask. I've experienced poor treatment from neighbours. The neighbour's daughter stands outside my window and calls me crazy. The senior male neighbour beside me does the same thing and complains about everything I do, like the size of my garbage bag if I go outside to take trash to the dumpster, how miserable I look because I have a blank expression, that I don't greet him (Why the fck would I say hi to someone so terrible?) or how I should be ashamed that I need a ride from my parents due to my autism making driving impossible for me. I have been called slurs by medical workers at the hospital for my refusal to make eye contact and difficulty speaking. I have been asked insane questions like ""Did you rob a bank"" due to my inability to make eye contact and visible anxiety while speaking to them. I've experienced poor treatment from trades workers who came to install appliances at my condo despite the fact I was courteous to them. They did not install the appliances correctly, the washer and dryer only go on hot setting, not cold, also leak while washing. I can't help thinking they did this out of spite since they also said cruel remarks about me while I sat by quietly like how weird it was that I didn't speak, as well as complaints about my facial features. I do not have the money to call and get the appliances re-installed properly.

I'm Kris, I went through domestic and emotional abuse from my father and now my mother has absolutely lost it. My dad was violent and never harmed me physically, but would drag and hit my mom and older sister. Eventually one day when my dad was going ballistic, my mom called my grandma and my grandma heard everything, and my grandma called the cops. Cops called cps. Mom got restraining order but didn't stop dad from sending us gifts and letters and coming into our house when we were gone to give us stuff. My mom says my dad is on one year probation right now. I still have nightmares and thoughts about the things I went through. There's so much more it would be too much to talk about. Just a couple months ago, after my mom left my dad (not divorced yet but technically not together anymore), she got a boyfriend. She has BPD and has always been gaslighting and narcissistic. She constantly, every time, goes for the same abusive piece of crap guys. And never learns. She's had maybe 4 or 5 boyfriends. I'll call her current boyfriend Dick. Because of the constant harassment from my dad, I couldn't handle it and I get scared very easily and I could never look my dad in the eye and I would flinch at the sound of his voice. So my mom suggested I stay at Dicks house so my dad has no idea where I am and I don't have to worry about him trying to talk to me. I accepted, even tho I didn't really want too, cuz I already saw red flags in Dick and didn't really like him. Stayed at his house for about 2 months, more red flags came in, and I was scared shitless. My mom said he would move in with us when we bought a new house. I didn't know he and her were dating until I was at his house, because I thought they were just coworkers and he said he went through domestic abuse and wanted to help. They've only known each other for 4 months. One day, with my sisters over, (one is a teenager the other is a toddler), we heard them having naughty time in the room RIGHT NEXT TO US. My sister was absolutely horrified and I was angry, REALLY angry, but also very upset and wanted to cry, I banged on the wall and then texted my mom and Dick complaining about what they were doing and pointing out how bad and horrid manners it was, couple hours later, my mom comes in the room and screams at me. For 2 hours straight. It was exhausting. I was thinking of just running away or ending it all. I could not stand it. She told me things like ""you're liberal you shouldn't have a problem with it"" and that apparently gen z doesn't care about people having sex? Like, what? What in the world does that have to do with me not wanting to hear people have sex? Can't vent to my siblings because one is too young to understand and my other sister is a mini versions of my mom. As soon as my mom left the room I called.my grandpa to pick me up asap. He came and I've lived here ever since. The thing is, I'm still a minor. My mom could force me back any time. I made a document of screenshots of what her and her boyfriend said to me (her boyfriend threatened me over text and when my grandpa brought it up to her she waved it off), just in case something happens. I do not have the mental state to deal with going back there, to deal with abuse, the people that abused me, and the constant harassment from my father that still goes on to this day. Apparently my mom gave him my grandpa's address. Thanks a lot mom. My dad keeps sending me letters with these empty hearted ""I'm sorry""s and I have not responded.to a single one. I don't want to. I don't have to. He can burn in hell. But one of the letters concerned me, he wrote that my mother and sisters missed me and wanted me back. I don't want to believe what this really implies because it scares the living shit out of me. My mother said she was completely done with my dad but apparently my sisters are still seeing him. My mother and sisters may miss me but they also ignore the obvious red flags in Dick and I've talked about how much this shit has effected me and every, single, freaking, time, they ignored me. They want me back and that scares me. I'm a minor. My mom has full custody over me and my grandpa has nothing. She can force me back any time and there is absolutely no reasoning with her. She's out of her mind. She's crazy and toxic. And she's turned my sister into her. It makes me want to cry and throw up thinking about it. I don't know what the hell to do.",1679098673.0

I thought it was over. I'd survived, I was making it. I was in a good enough spot where I could handle trauma therapy, but my therapist just felt like schooling me on my life instead of doing EMDR or something.

The past 3 months have been absolutely horrible. I have never been so dysfunctional. I've always been high functioning, even at my work, but now I can barely shower and the only times I actually get in the shower is to try and calm down not actually to bathe. I don't have the energy to eat or drink water, I was in the psych ward recently and lost 13 lbs in a few days and they practically force fed me.

I can't sleep. I overdosed on my medications to try and calm down and I think i fucked something up because ever since then, the second I doze off I jerk like I'm being electrocuted. Normal every now and then, but this is every time I start sleeping. I literally can't sleep. If I manage to sleep, I have horrific nightmares. last night I would keep waking up and then going back into the nightmare but it would repeat and be worse. My chest kept being caved in and I could feel the pain from it then I'd restart again. In the worst of them it was time for my chest to be caved in again and I just started screaming ""(NAME) YOU NEED TO WAKE UP. WAKE UP RIGHT NOW (NAME). WAKE UP!""

I always know when I'm dreaming but it's always horrific and I can't help anything.

My therapist is done with me because I am too high needs. But offered no alternatives. I'm still working with my dietitian and she's encouraging me to use this opportunity to go into residential treatment.

I've been struggling with my temper, like I'm in a constant state of pissed off and my pissed off is literally trauma defcon 1 (as my dietitian puts it). Like I will literally set myself on fire to hurt someone. I don't care, in my head it's kill or be killed even if it's minor. I think I am stuck in the time I was nearly murdered and tried to kill someone first. It's always on my mind these days.

I feel like even a residential couldn't handle me. I have too many problems that no one can help with. No one is experienced enough to help the breadth of my trauma.

I found a residential that doubles as acute care that does ketamine treatment... Absolutely praying they accept my insurance.",1679084663.0

We were laying in bed and I asked him to close the bedroom door, and he acted like I was being annoying, rolled his eyes and huffed, but he got up and tried. But, the door didn't want to latch. We live in an old house and sometimes the hinges don't hold right or moisture makes the door threshold not fit right, etc. And this set him off. 

He started yelling, and swearing. He slammed the door over and over really hard. and when he still couldn't get it, he started throwing stuff around the room and at the door, yelling at me, because he was angry. I was still laying in bed and just shut down. I think I disassociated, I don't remember. I kinda of held my breath and moved over as far away from him on the bed when he crawled back in, still really mad and muttering to himself. I waited until he was fully settled back in and I got up and went into the bathroom, locked the door, and had a panic attack. I couldn't stop crying and I was trying to be really quiet, and I listened to him laughing at something on Youtube on his phone, like nothing had happened, from the bedroom. And I didn't go back to bed until he fell asleep. I didn't feel safe next to him. I couldn't shake the feeling that he could've really hurt me, if he wanted to. I felt like I was going to get hit. 

I grew up in a super abusive home, where I'd get beaten for the smallest things. And it was the exact same fear. He knows I have cptsd / ptsd. And he has anger issues, which he keeps promising he'll work on and for a while it'll seem like it's working, and he's getting better. He's in therapy, he's learning calming techniques, but every so often, like once a week, he'll blow up. Over something really tiny. I don't feel safe. I don't think he'd hit me, he never has, but I can't shake the thought that he \*could\*. If he got mad enough, he \*could\*. And I'm a lot smaller than him. I'm disabled. I wouldn't be able to defend myself. I feel helpless, like I was when I was a little kid and my parents or siblings were coming after me. 

Since his most recent blow-up, I haven't let him touch me. Anytime he so much as sets a hand on my arm to get my attention, I flinch him off, without even meaning to. The other night, he rolled over in his sleep and laid his arm over me. Normally, I love that and cuddle into him, but then it just made me feel sick and panicky, like I was being trapped, kinda claustrophobic, and I moved his arm off of me as slowly and gently as I could, because I was terrified of waking him up. He's apologized a couple times. And, like I said, this isn't his first blow-up, far from it. And I don't know why this one is affecting me worse than the others ones ever have. It's been almost 2 full days and I still feel shaky anytime he comes into the room. I'm making excuses not to let him touch me --- aka, saying my fibro is flaring and making touch painful, which isn't a lie, I'm just using it more often, now. I've been walking on eggshells, trying not to make him upset. I haven't asked him for anything, haven't asked for help with anything, have barely talked to him out of fear I'll say something wrong and make him upset. It feels awful. I really do feel the exact same way I did growing up, where I just shut myself down, kept quiet, kept my head down, and just made every choice on the basis on whether or not it would make someone upset. Going to illogical extremes, even, like eg. not asking him to grab the laundry out of the dryer even though I hurt, because what if I did it wrong, what if I forgot to start the dryer and he gets pissed? What if the dryer didn't dry everything fully and it's somehow my fault and I get hurt? What if I washed something he didn't want washed, yet, and he gets mad? All these fears, the same level I'd have to worry about as a kid, fears that make no logical sense, but they're all the kind of inane, ridiculous shit I'd had to tread carefully around, because even doing something like washing the dishes wrong--- aka, not rinsing them the way dad thought I should --- would (srs physical abuse warning) get me boiling water poured over my hands. 

I can't stop feeling triggered. I've been on high alert for days, now. Barely slept. Barely eaten. I feel sick to my stomach any time I see him, and can't look at his face. I'm terrified and none of my coping skills are working. Not really asking for advice, because I know most of it would be ""leave"", which is actually impossible for me, right now. I just need to vent and get this off my chest because, maybe putting it in words will help, I don't know.",1679070229.0

I've gone through some small ups and downs -- some problems at work, some successes, a dismissive psychiatrist, a bad therapist, some good therapy books, lots of social difficulties, a couple new people I'm proud to call friends, some new hobbies ... small steps and I've been hopeful for a while that I'm making progress.

But now, nothing big has happened in the last several months but I just feel exhausted. I'm not sure why or what, I'm confused more, it's nearly impossible to get myself to sit down and do work. Hobbies are ok to do, but it's affecting my job quite a bit now. I can rest for long times (days) and it doesn't help me have energy. Physically I'm fine but mentally I'm running low. It's not depression, I'm not crying, I don't feel overly stressed, and so I just don't know what to do to help myself.

I'm hoping for some insight from people why I feel this way? Is this normal to just hit a period where nothing feels quite right? I still don't have a whole ton of hope for my future, I can't really envision myself being happy but for the first time I can envision myself still going 5 years from now, but maybe only with a mediocre life that I don't enjoy. Part of it is that I feel like I'm too old (30F) to really accomplish anything with my life anymore, and a lot of options for making friends or joining groups or learning skills are just gone, though I do have some options. I have had an impossible time trying to find a romantic partner, and that's probably the worst. I feel like I'm trying to catch up and I just can't. I'm not sure if there are other things contributing to this feeling, but it's really heavy.

I want someone to tell me they're proud of me and happy to see me, but I don't have anyone I'm close to and I feel like people avoid me. I feel like if I tried to explain to my parents or my ancestors what I've gone through and how and why I've been trying to heal, none of them would understand and they'd call it a waste of time.

My name's Luke. I'm 25. I come from a moderately-sized town in the Tarheel state. Prior to June of last year my life was one of comfort. I had a good steady family and a great home, there was food on the table. All of that changed for me in June. My mom had went outside to relax on the couch that was outside on the front porch of our home and had fell asleep (she had been drinking slightly, so that contributed to her tiredness I can imagine and she didn't get much sleep due to having PTSD herself from a physical abusive).  


Someone who was riding by on a bicycle saw this and figured my mom would be easy to rob. I don't like to think about what happened (if they were assaulting my mom or something like this, I don't really want to think about it) and she woke up, she saw this person trying to rob her and she called me outside, telling me to grab something. I grabbed my hunting rifle, confused on what was going on. I ran as quickly as possible to the door. 

I opened it and I saw someone, they were on a bicycle. I ran to the side off the porch and before I knew it, there was pops. The pops of gunfire. I kept seeing muzzleflash after muzzleflash. The light illuminating the dark summer night. I remember that he was shooting at me too, the bullets were hitting so close to my feet I remember the dirt kicking up (if that makes sense). I remember the sound of being shot at. It was all so quick and before I knew it, a entire magazine was emptied. I didn't even have a chance to shoot, do anything myself. I was scared, I didn't want to truly harm anyone but this person did anyway.

I looked over to my mom who was on the ground.

I saw her laying on the ground and I shouted if she was ok. She was not. I'm not going to go over what happened in this part. It's still really too much for me and it's just awful. No son should ever have to see this, be through this situation. 

Since then, I've had difficulty maintaining relationships (dating) and I feel like most people hate me for not doing enough that night. I am distrustful of most people. I feel like most people are out to hurt me in some way. I'm trying to get counselling and help for this but it's been difficult.

Hi! I'm new to the board here basically trying to get some general info about what I'm dealing with.

I'm trying to learn more about CPTSD and can't find as much info about it as I wish I could(usually the search engine defaults to PTSD). I was told by a doctor that I have the symptoms of CPTSD. However the more I learn about it, the more questions I have? It's clear to me its the correct diagnosis but I don't seem to have the ""fight"" triggers in the way I keep reading about. My ""fight"" responses tend to put my anger inward towards myself, though I wonder if that would be more easily explained by ""flight"" or ""shame"" responses. My friends don't seem to think I lash out at others, or get angry at others in any way they felt was odd. But they do see the intense feelings of self loathing I have for myself that seems to come out when things get difficult for me.

 So is this something that happens to others? Can you get ""fight"" triggers that go ""inward"" instead of lashing out? Or is this explained by something else going on with CPTSD like ""flight"" or ""shame"" responses?",1679099887.0

A few things stood out: the amount of artwork that showed explicit signs of me struggling with the trauma of COCSA & CSA, and the schoolwork.

At 17, I had wrote a six page essay where, instead of focusing entirely on the topic, I was screaming for help, and that I was being abused from all directions. My heart broke as I read what my younger self was hoping someone would hear. What did my teacher write at the end?

""Aww, how sad. Great work! 12/12""

I'm literally so f$%king pissed off because this isn't the only assignment I found of this nature. Time and time again, I was failed by the same teachers who held the very same assemblies about child abuse and what signs to look out for.

I informed my work a year ago about my struggles as well so it is on record I've spoken with them to be accommodating. 

Dealing with CPTSD while upholding my current job has gotten to be overwhelming, to the point I'm considering applying for SSDI so I can truly focus on long term healing and then slowly implementing stressors back into my life. 

Does anyone have a lawyer they would recommend in the tri-state area they've worked with before? Or, do you have any advice on how to go about this? I would love to talk to a lawyer about my personal situation and see how best to go about this. 

If it helps, some of the abusers I've had have actually gone to jail (and been on the news) for other victims, so I do have documentation outside of my personal experience. 

Also, to clarify, are we able to work after approval for CPTSD SSDI? Does SSDI limit how much you can make as well? Eventually/in an ideal world I would like to implement some work as I continue to work on my long term mental and physical health.

247,Constant Childhood fear led fight-or-flight response.,1,11u83ye,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11u83ye/constant_childhood_fear_led_fightorflight_response/,1," 

Hi everyone, my family is very dysfunctional. My siblings are way older than me, and apparently, it was hard for them growing up, to be honest in their minds, and mine as well. My childhood was a happy one, but as I grew, I noticed I was different from my friends, and it wasn't a happy one, it was a very lonely one.

I don't have many childhood memories, so I assumed I had some deep trauma that made me forget as you see in movies. But through therapy, I discovered I had no specific trauma; nothing happened to me. However, it did happen to my mum and siblings. So what happened is that they transmitted that constant fear to me. That explains why I only have happy memories, but very few though (I can count my childhood memories with my hands until I was around 12 - 13 years old, and ironically I have a very good memory). The explanation is that I was in constant fear, and adult fear but being a child, I only understood the surface of the problems and pretended my family was doing a good job of hiding everything from me, playing my part. When you are in fear, you don't register memories. This also led to massive ADD, and according to my massage therapist, chiropractor, psychologist, and psychiatrist, it also led to a perpetual fight-or-flight response state (and other stuff), which explains why I am an athlete but also stiff as a table no matter what I try.

So my question is, what type of meditation can help me release the fight-or-flight response state? Please do not recommend yoga. My wife is a yoga teacher, and I practice every sport you can imagine. Ironically, the only thing that has helped my back is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, which my psychologist recommended for self-confidence and to remove some of the fears in me, and it worked (a little). So I do believe my stiffness is mental.

I would appreciate it if you could share some links or podcasts, preferably not on YouTube.

Thanks, and apologies for the long message.",1679096719.0

I don't expect anyone to read it, but it just kind of came out and I'm leaving it so I have a record of my thoughts, I guess. It helped to write things down a little. Maybe someone in a similar boat will see it and find some value in the similarities.

I've repressed a bunch of memories and feelings that were present throughout a huge number of years growing up (from 3 or 4 up to when I moved out of my parent's place). Those have come flooding back recently. I'm in my 30s now.

I'm still reeling, and trying to make sense of it all. I feel like CPTSD resonates with my experience, but I also feel like my situation is unique/different. There was no physical abuse, and my parents did definitely love me & my brother, and let us know that throughout our lives. But it was NOT the happy childhood I have been telling myself it was for many years. Parts of it were happy and good, but I've not given due credit to how bad the parts that hurt were.

I have already reached out for therapy for this.

I am pretty unsure if I actually have CPTSD, or something else... I haven't really looked into whether something else might fit better than CPTSD, or where to begin even looking. I know I need to talk to a therapist to get an answer, but I'm just trying to find some grounding with wrapping my head around this.

>Growing up...

My mom has always had love for me, an intense desire to be a good mother, major stress and anxiety, and immense self-doubt with a randomly-occurring persecution complex. She never stopped trying to be a ""good mother"". She would constantly try to praise me, validate that she loved me, validate that I was supported, but I found that very stressful to deal with - it always felt (and still feels) like she only loves a fake version of me she made up herself. Her anxiety and stress would flare up bad if she felt like she was being a bad mother, or if she felt like her kids (mostly me) didn't actively exhibit/express love back.

I remember crying in my room because she kept saying things like ""you're such a good boy"", ""you're such a smart boy"", ""you're such a nice boy"", ""you're such a handsome boy"" instead of actually getting to know who I really was. It took 10 years of telling her, multiple times a week, that I didn't like mayonnaise or salad dressing for her to even begin remembering. Or what my hobbies were (other than the few she 'decided' to attribute to me, even years after I dropped them). Or lots of other *real* likes and dislikes that I wanted her to see in me other than the facades she assigned to me through praise and assumption. I still recoil when praised by anyone.

She suffers from some serious mental health issue herself, but has never ""liked"" a therapist enough to last more than a few visits, as far as I am aware. I only know they told her some things she didn't like hearing, but there ARE bad therapists out there, especially back when my mom would have been looking. And she has suffered from legitimately bad interactions with doctors/health-professionals before.

Anytime I tried to tell her that I loved her, and I knew she loved me, and all the expressed validation just felt forced, and family love shouldn't feel forced - that she didn't have to *try* so hard to verify it, that it was OK... it was like I was talking to someone in a different language. At most she might say something like ""aw, you're so sweet"", then not acknowledge it in any way again. I remember at some point, I don't know when, realizing things wouldn't change with her and giving up trying.

My dad, meanwhile, also loved me (and my brother) a lot. He was and is extremely reserved and silent. We are and have always been on friendly terms, and I have never felt like I know him, other than that he does love us. It feels like a lot of his energy goes to managing my mom's moods, and he basically just 'checks out' other than that so he has space to pursue a small number of his own interests (reading, computers, a bit of sports).

Growing up, between the ages of around 4 to 7, my parents relationship was not good. They got close to a divorce, and I'm almost certain they stayed together because of me and my brother. They both loved us a lot, thought of themselves as nice and self-sacrificing, and I think they would have tried very hard to make things work - harder than they should have tried, I think. I remember exactly once (I would have been around 5 I think) walking in while they were fighting and saying ""please stop fighting"", or maybe ""why do you fight so much?"", but nothing changed and I never tried again. Things got a bit better after I was ~8, but far from perfect - their relationship never really felt like a loving one from then on.

My mom's anxiety would come and go. When it was bad, I had to be *constantly* on edge. I remember feeling the hairs on the back of my neck stand up when she would walk through the room if I was relaxing in it - I had to be always ready to make an escape to my bedroom to hide out, or to respond abruptly with doing a chore if she was angry about not enough getting done around the house (she had to carry the burden of cleaning almost 100% on her own - my dad did not help). She would yell at my dad over often extremely trivial stuff, or cry over very slight wrongs (or things that weren't wrong at all, like perceived persecution that didn't exist).

My dad never seemed able or willing to really help - at most he would put in a token effort only briefly after a fight. I remember my mom yelling at my dad, at least several times, about how he was poisoning their kids against her because he never helped with discipline, and she had to ""be the bad guy"" because of it. For example, grounding me if I played too much videogames - reasonable stuff, she never physically abused me. She only spanked my brother once (unjustly) and has regretted that her whole life. But it wasn't being disciplined that bothered me, it was the anxiety and stress that come from my mom that hurt. I resented my dad for not being willing to help alleviate that, and it made it feel like managing my mom's moods was all up to me.

>Anyway...

At a young age I learned I had to put on a very specific face for my mom, to manage myself around her stress/anxious persona, and to very very carefully manage her sad/depressed persona when it came to the surface. I remember hiding in my room playing videogames or reading to escape, only leaving my room to ""make an appearance"" around the house the bare minimum that would not lead my mom to fear I was avoiding her. Which involved being out of my room a lot more than I wanted - about as much as I could possibly stand. I remember psyching myself up to have the emotional energy to do that, and to put on a face that everything was perfect and I was a wonderful loving son and she was a wonderful loving mother.

I remember planning out when I went outside my room, with thoughts like ""I really wish I could just stay in my bedroom, but my mom's voice sounds relatively not-very-stressed right now, so maybe if I go outside my room for a couple hours then if things get bad later I can hide out then and excuse it as 'doing homework' or something. If I stay in now maybe I can stay in all evening, but if she gets angry later she will *expect* me to make an appearance to validate she isn't alone in the family, and it will be much harder to deal with then."" In retrospect I wonder if this is why I learned to always do my homework at the last minute - I wanted it to be a truthful excuse I could use to escape to my room if I needed it. If I finished my homework early, I wouldn't have that escape, and homework was one of the things she would relent to me hiding away for. Sometimes plans like that worked. Sometimes I would go out when she was in a 'good mood' to save up an excuse to hide away later, then she would have a downward spiral and would *still* expect me to not hide in my room... and I would just feel utterly defeated and in despair at how much of my life I had to sacrifice for her needs.

I had to be extremely attentive to her words, her tone, her body language, how her footsteps sounded (angry or not), and how things things changed moment to moment so I could figure out what ""mask"" I should put forward that would not aggravate her stress (or anger or sadness). I remember doing something similar to try to alleviate stresses between her and my dad. I remember finding it all deeply exhausting. I remember her (a few times) saying ""sometimes I feel like you don't like me"", then me feeling like 'oh god I've been letting my mask slip' and trying *extra* hard from then on out to put on a face that would convince her I did, making up excuses for why I was tired, or distracted, or whatever came to mind that I thought would work as a lie. I did love her, and still do - but I definitely did not like her, at least most of the time.

My mom has said multiple times that she would be very hurt if she is lied to, if her kids did not feel comfortable being honest with her. But by that time, I had been lying for years, and I knew I could never let her know how I felt or how much her actions pained me. My impression has always been that if she knew how I felt, it would utterly destroy her, so I carefully manage things when I do visit even now. Throughout my life my mom has sometimes used me as a sort of 'therapist' to unload her worries/stress on and get affirming ""it will be ok"" or ""I get how that could be hard"" or ""your pain makes sense, that was mean of them"" responses back. She's tried to limit how much that happens, but it did every once in a while. Still does.

There were times when things were good - when my mom actually seemed to enjoy life and relax. There were times we would laugh, or play games, or go out into nature which was a godsend. But they were unpredictable, became more rare as I got older, and I learned that they could go downhill very suddenly, so I stopped feeling relaxed even at those times. Plus I still had to maintain my mask even when things were good, to remain consistent with who I pretended to be when she *was* stressed. Most of the rest of the time my mom was doing her own thing, luckily, and I found a measure of peace in that regular distance.

>Since then...

My whole life I've been able to have low-key friends. Not many, but some I would consider very close. Not that we talk about emotions ever. Any time I'm faced with someone that I want a deeper connection with (especially romantically), I've *always* fallen into this mental mode where I try to express that love by just doing whatever the other person wants. By being willing to do *anything* - go to the restaurant the other person wants, do the activities the other person wants, do what the other person would find comfortable, find enjoyment in what the other person enjoys, move at a relationship pace the other person is comfortable with. I don't feel like I have any opinions of myself with those things, and I want the other person to be comfortable with me without wearing a mask. It feels like my heart is crying out ""please see how much I like you and want you to be happy, and let that be enough for once"". If I try to put on a mask so I can ""have opinions"" about where to go or what to do, it feels fake and manipulative, and my mind feels revulsion at that. Not surprisingly, that hasn't led to very good or deep connections.

I've only these past few days that I have connected the behavior when I want deeper connections to my response to my mom's behavior growing up. I had very much repressed how bad things were and how much it hurt as a kid. I remember crying in my room, thinking thoughts like ""you're killing who I am mom, my childhood is being ruined - I'm losing my grasp on just being myself - all I can be with you is the fake and superficial loving son you want me to be"".

Anyway I don't know who the hell I am anymore. When I was younger I had some vague thoughts like ""I'm going to flourish when I get on my own, I can finally live my life"", but, well, that has absolutely not happened. I almost feel like I treat my own sadness and loneliness inside with the same sort of masking I used to cope with my mom's negativity. Like my subconscious is going through life just barely putting in the bare minimum of effort needed to convince my conscious brain that everything is OK... and it's exhausting, so anything more than that is impossible, and I just float through life barely existing.

Is this classic CPTSD? Or distinctly different? Hard to tell? Does it sound like there may be other factors involved (ADHD, autism, etc)? My brother seems to be 90% well-adjusted, although he is older and my parent's relationship got bad during my formative years of ~4-6, when my brother was closer to 10.

Her advice was as follows : **making a list of 50 positive traits about oneself, then keeping a small promise to yourself every day.** 

I'm posting this here because the first part doesn't seem too tricky to me, however the second one, as someone with a lot of issues around memory, including obviously CPTSD but also ADHD, sounds incredibly difficult - I can't remember if I ate this morning, I won't remember a ""promise"" to keep to myself. Do you think this is sound advice ? Do you think it could apply to us ?

Also, if you happen to have any other content recommendation that breaks down the healing process in such small and easily achievable steps, please do so. A lot of the advice I see is still fairly broad and vague, like ""have self-compassion"" - but doesn't actually say how to do so and I'm left thinking I'm just not good enough to understand.

I'm  at my wits end with this, so need an opinion. English isn't my first  language, hopefully that won't create any confusion. Throwaway because  family knows my main.

I (F39) am  married to my husband (M42) and we have twins (M6, F6), also a house  with a big mortgage. We've been together for 8 years.

I'm  writing this because yesterday he yelled at me that ""it's enough that  we have one mental case in the house, we don't need two"" and then yelled  at the kids that ""mum is making me insane"", right hand balled into a fist as he was clearly thinking of hitting me, and once the kids were  out of sight he grabbed a couple of plates and said he wants to throw  them out of kitchen window. Didn't do it though.

All  of this is very unusual; he normally never yells, let alone behaves in a  threatening way. Now he's gone, said he wants to stay away from me and  the kids and needs to think what to do because he says I'm turning him  into a person he doesn't want to be.

The  same mechanism has been repeated many times over and I'll try to  describe it. I have CPTSD from severe emotional abuse as a child and  teenager by my parents (diagnosed), and I also have ADHD (diagnosed) and  am on the spectrum (undiagnosed). Due to this, I've suffered multiple  burnouts in my life and since the kids I've been permanently exhausted.  My husband knows all this and is somewhat sympathetic, though he also  sees all of our problems originating from my issues.

Yesterday  the argument started because I was so exhausted I started crying while  trying to remember what I needed to do (I was meant to take the kids to  their football practice, I couldn't find their gear, and in the middle I  realised I had lost my wallet because I lose things when I'm stressed  out). So as I'm fervently trying to find the stuff while getting the  kids dressed and trying to think what to do with my lost wallet while  crying, he starts telling me I need to calm down and questioning me in a  manner that I find aggressive and am scared of, and I feel he doesn't  care I'm on the verge of a breakdown, and also we were on the clock and  having to answer his questions was slowing me down.

But  he says this what feels to me as aggressive questioning when I'm  already running out of time comes from a good place and it's his attempt  at helping me/trying to understand things. For example he can demand me  to explain a particular sentence/words I used if my expression was  inaccurate/illogical to him which gets me stuck in long conversations  about my word choices, slowing me down from resolving the issue at hand,  or asks ""why haven't you"" type of questions of things already happened  which I feel does nothing to help the issue at hand either.

This  is a trauma trigger for me, my parents did the same in the sense that  whenever I had a problem or was crying, that made them anxious so they  got really aggressive/abusive and therefore whenever I had a problem  they created another problem on top of it - having to deal with them.

My  husband knows this but he feels I don't trust him enough/know him well  enough because I get scared and triggered when he does this questioning,  even though I know logically that it's coming from a good place. It's  true that sometimes where he's getting at is very helpful and makes  sense, but the delivery is so cold and aggressive (to me) that I don't  even register the content. (I would not call it abusive though in any  way.)

I've told him I'd just want a hug and/or some sympathy in these situations but it never happens.

Because  this pattern constantly repeats, my husband is slowly losing patience  in me and faith in our relationship. He's very sensitive to blame and  reacts with anger to it, and when I'm triggered I ask him to stop  harassing me while I'm just trying to survive and this drives him  absolutely furious because he feels he's genuinely trying to help and  I'm being unfair.

Now he's shaken  by the violent urge that struck him, and thus left, leaving me obviously  to deal with the kids and the household and work alone. But I am  relieved because I really need to think as well.

I  told him yesterday I'm extremely exhausted and he responded saying he's  tired too, which is probably true. When I'm less tired it's easier for  me to bear his questioning, I still hate it and it doesn't help me at  all, but I can keep my mouth shut and not cause an argument.

**My  question is: Am I being unreasonable hoping he would understand that if  I'm so exhausted, it's near impossible for me not to be trauma  triggered?** This is the core of it - he thinks I should feel  happy because he's trying to help, and not blame him for harassing me or  kicking me while I'm down, which is what I've told him he does.

For  the record, I am in therapy (for CPTSD), he's never needed therapy, and I've forced  him into counseling a couple of times but he hated it when I said how I  felt and forcing him again felt so stressful to me that I discontinued  it. He always says he didn't have any of these problems with previous  partners. I have not been in very long (over 2 years) relationships with  anyone before him because of trust issues, so he's been the authority  of what's normal and what isn't.",1679045681.0

I hear a lot of “Noooooo, no, you’re really smart, don’t say bad things about yourself!” 

I appreciate the sentiment, but it’s actually just _more_ invalidation. And it further feeds into self isolation, since I seem to be unable to articulate the problem in a way that leads to constructive discussion. 

I don’t equate learning disability with low intelligence. I feel like I _am_ intelligent, but I struggle to learn new things. 

In school, learning was effortless for me. I got bad grades later, in high school, but only because I rarely ever did homework, so if homework grades were averaged in with test scores, it came out to barely a passing grade. I always got A’s on tests, and scored high on the SAT standardized tests. 

My most recent job was in cybersecurity. I lost that job about 5 years ago. 

I had begun to learn programming while working there, so I decided that I would continue in that direction.

Since then, I dedicated myself 100% to learning programming. I did not work at all. All I did the whole time, with a few breaks here and there, was learn and practice. I completed a full stack course within the first couple of years, but then continued to pursue deeper understanding by applying the techniques to a whole bunch of different web applications, none of which I ever really finished. I have nothing to show for all that time and effort. 

Earlier this year, I decided to just stop. I’m not sure if I will ever continue. 

The problem is, every day was a wild roller coaster ride. If I would try, for example, using a certain technique in a different way that makes sense to me, and it doesn’t work, I would become obsessed with figuring out _why_ it’s not working, and I won’t give up until I either learn how it _does_ work, or find another technique that does work. 

But during that struggle, my emotions are off the charts. It doesn’t matter what my logic tells me, that I know I will figure it out eventually because I almost always do. My inner critic is screaming at me, and I _feel_ like the most stupid person ever to exist. I’ve been in tears of frustration so many times. 

It seems that the only way that I am able to learn is by following detailed step by step instructions. If I get past the first step or however many steps, and then a step doesn’t work, the inner screaming starts at full volume. I also express frustration by pounding the desk or wailing in agony, etc. My boyfriend ignores me, which is totally fine. But I think it bothered him, and he worried about me. 

This requirement - having step by step instructions - is not negotiable. I have been told by instructors and other students, and observed in discussion forums, that some people are able to “connect the dots” and do not require every little step spelled out explicitly. I’ve been told it’s expected. But I have learned from hard experience that I simply cannot connect dots if any steps are omitted. 

_Is this normal?_ Being unable to infer anything? I always feel like r/restoftheowl while everyone else seems to be skipping happily along, following the same instructions with missing steps. 


But then, if/when I solve the issue or learn a new thing, it’s joy and elation like I can’t get from anything else, not even drugs or alcohol. Accomplishment! 

It’s an infinite cycle. Stupidest person in the world, smartest person ever. Almost nothing in between. 

That’s why I decided to stop until I address some underlying trauma issues. 

So, now I don’t know what to do with my time every day. Even with the roller coaster ride, I always felt motivated to get other tasks done so I could program. I often sat down to program in the morning, and didn’t stop until 5pm, the time I set for myself to stop for the day. 

Also ,the idea of actually getting a programming job terrifies me. Not the getting part; the actual job part. I believe that every single person who ever hired me has regretted it. With very few exceptions. I have identified some specific things to not ever do again, but I’m still confident that I will still be unable to integrate with any group of colleagues.",1679065923.0

For starters I’ve always been outcast and abused and have rlly low self esteem. First time it happened via Snapchat when I was barely 13 with some Indian 20 year old and I got scared but didn’t understand what was even happening and blocked him after a week. Then it was on and off from 14 to 15 and a half. 

For about 8 months last year when I was in a very dark place older men and sometimes boys would message me and because I wasn’t getting affection anywhere else, I was willing to do what they wanted which was usually video calls and nudes and yeah…to get the slightest ounce of affection in the form of compliments. It made me feel sick and gave me nightmares but at the same time I was desperate to be shown kindness and love so it would keep happening over and over again and I would pretend I liked it.

I’d block them eventually but then another guy would come along and the cycle repeated. Sometimes I would refuse but then I would be forced to penetrate myself and masturbate (I didn’t enjoy it at all but my body would still react ig so I used that to tell myself I wasn’t being groomed it was my fault) via blackmail and doxxing on video call even if it hurt and I really couldn’t fit what they wanted me to use. I’d have bleeding and pain afterwards and get yeast infections from it. Since there was no one there irl I don’t know if it even counts as sexual assault/rape despite me being coerced/refusing and being hurt sexually bc like, ppl say “you could have just turned off the device” and there’s no laws in most places counting forced/coerced cybersex as such, but it’s not that simple. In the moment you feel trapped and alone like you have nowhere else to turn which really makes me feel like it was my fault even more and like I must’ve secretly wanted what happened.

I have a panic attack when I hear certain phrases now like “good girl” even if it’s a friend or coworker saying it with no ill intent and I go clammy and start shaking and can’t really breathe until I move away. 

Here’s one of the main grooming stories out of like my dozens ig:

——————————————

I met him on r./rape. I believe he has since deleted his account. I’d made a post about memories of childhood molestation and I couldn’t figure out if they were real or not. Romulus messaged me privately, telling me to take deep breaths and not to feel and that he was good at helping people work through sensitive memories and deal with them and to tell him everything I remembered and he’d help me report it. He acted so kind and understanding but also formal which somehow made me trust him more and for hours he listened to me open up about all my problems. How my friends talked behind my back and bullied me, how my mom was angry and distant, how I felt sad and insecure about my body, my SH issues and possible molestation. 

Around maybe the five hour mark instead of replying with the usual words of sympathy and helpful suggestions he replied like this:

R: can I tell you something?

M: yeah sure

R: on second thought, don’t worry. You’ll run away

M: I won’t 

R: promise? Ok then, truth is…your stories have been making me hard

M: oh

R: I’m sorry I know that makes me a bad person

For some reason I’d decided to comfort him bc he’d been so nice to me the past few hours and cared - or at least acted the part- when nobody else in my life did. Afterward, I asked him how old he was and he said 24. Then he asked if he could see me in underwear so I could help him out with his erection. I declined but he kept persisting until I gave in then he said I must be a catfish boy and he was leaving unless I sent photos of my lower half naked to prove I was a girl. I felt hurt so I did it. I felt gross and told him that but he said it would get easier the more I did it. It went on for about 2-3 weeks, this little routine where we’d make up code words and everything and he’d always tell me not to tell anybody about what he and I did.

He would message me with the code word and say what type of things he wanted me to film for him and send him, and he would command me to call him daddy and tell him about the things that made me upset to get him off, and describe how illegal and dangerous it was because for some reason that turned him on. I would have to exaggerate my past molestation for him to find it more interesting and recreate it for him. After he’d tell me how proud he was of me, how I was a good girl and deserved better, how pretty I was even with the scars, and he’d ask me if I still felt disgusted about my body and all the things he’d ask to send him. My answer would always be that I still felt gross then he’d say it were best if we didn’t talk anymore and block me. He’d also act distant and block me if I said I couldn’t sext with him because I was busy at times. Then he’d make a new account and message me saying he was sorry, rinse and repeat. That or I’d message him first begging him not leave because he was my only friend and I’d offer to do whatever sexual stuff he wanted for him to stay.

On our second last meeting he brought up my past grooming and acted really jealous telling me I didn’t need him if I have so many other men, then saying I didn’t satisfy him anymore and was boring and he was stringing me along then blocked me. It was a few hours later when he messaged me for the final time, telling me the real reason he kept pushing me away was because he couldn’t stop thinking about me and wanted to meet in person, but he acknowledged that was dangerous for me and impossible. The last messages were:

R: you’d do anything I told you to, right?

M: within reason yes

R: you’re such a good girl…you’ll do just fine in the world. You’re smart and beautiful and you can get so far without me. I want you to block me, and no matter what don’t unblock me.

M: so this is proper goodbye?

R: yes, now stop stalling, be a good girl and block me.

That was the end for the most part, he did message me once more on a new account asking me to unblock him several weeks later but I pretended I didn’t know who he was and ignored him. I did get attached to him for a short while and missed him, I don’t anymore but it took a while to see it as grooming bc he didn’t act like a typical one..",1679054831.0

i understand how schemas and self limiting beliefs function pretty well but im just wondering if anyone else had experienced like, adult experiences just reaffirming their schemas strongly? let me elaborate, i can understand how this can happen in the case of like, attracting emotionally available partners because that kind of treatment feels normal and safe and thus the pattern is affirmed. 

im a bit more baffled in my life when it comes to abandonment and emotional deprivation in friendships. it seems that no matter who i surround myself with, even when i actively seek out kind people with similar interests, i consistently get left out, not invited and  am not offered any help or support even when i ask. which all just affirms my belief that i just have to suck it up and do everything by myself. 

likely part of it is autism symptoms (which may just be from cptsd) leading to social difficulty and noticeable weirdness or awkwardness. but i really try so so hard to be a good, kind friend and to do nice things for people and just be decent.

Bit of context, I've (34F) been diagnosed CTPSD, GAD, Bipolar 1, and ADHD. My CPTSD was diagnosed due to a very abusive father, but ultimately, I was raped at 16 by an ex and that really sealed the deal for my provider to diagnose. 

So my work. I work at a front desk, my desk has one route into it. I have one door outside, a locked stairwell (I do have a badge), a very slow elevator, and a locked back section to the rest of the building that I have to be let in. Most the times I actually do fairly well. Every so often I have something that is triggering. 

One male patron wanted to shake my hand, okay no biggie, he didn't for it just asked. So I did, eventually it progressed to putting both his hands on me and holding for awhile. I got so uncomfortable, went to HR and she supported me to say no. Just full stop. I did and he stopped. 

We also have a lot of homeless walk in. One night, when no one was around, I was lone, a guy came in and was clearly high, started getting irritated with me and it escalated. Totally didn't feel safe after that. But I moved on and worked through it.

This week though, I've been struggling. Since I have BD, the daylight savings really messed with me. I was getting like 4/5 hours of sleep every day since last Fri, which can enduce hypo/mania. So I've been utterly fixated on preventing that and struggling. So Wed, I was pretty sad/completely drained. Since I sit at the front desk, everyone sees me. Generally about 100 people a day, most of them I know from a daily basis. Most people noticed, asked if I was okay, I told them yes, and they moved on and let me have my space. 

However, one lady, who I've had issues in the past telling me to ""smile!"" Whenever I'm resting. She's older and very much of the ""motherly grandma"" who feels she can butt in everyone's business. She's sweet, but invasive. Anyways, she saw me and I thought, oh shit, she's going to tell me to smile. Ioved to look like I was typing up something on the computer.

This is when it got tense. I saw her move around to behind my desk (it's a long L shape, so you could fit 3 chairs back there, but only one way out and only one person actually sits back there). I got instantly tense because I didn't know what was going to happen. She came towards me (cornering me) and said, I'm going to give you a hug. I know she meant well, and just wanted me to have a better day. But I said ""No, I don't want to be touched"" she then said it's okay, I'm just going to give you a hug, and I said again, no, I don't want to be touched. Then she put her arms around me. After she walked out of my desk she asked if I was mad at her (in regards to my attitude) I said this (indicating my face lol) has nothing to do with you. 

Now, the aftermath. Not only were my boundaries crossed, but I was also made to feel guilty that I have emotions. I don't know how many times by professionals I've been told that saying no is acceptable. Yet, it isn't always the case, clearly. What, because she's an older female that makes it okay? When I was raped, I told my assaulter no many times. I begged. He said all kinds of crap to make himself feel better about the situation, like he was just being persuasive. So although this situation isn't that, I definitely feel triggered and can't stop thinking about it now. I've had SI since that happened. I had it before she left the desk, it was the quickest, most intrusive thought I've had in a long time, just a simple thought of SI to escape. I felt all my power had been taken from me. 

I went to my boss and she gave me the rest of the day off. Came back yesterday, spoke with HR, who is also my boss as I work a few hours a day for her. She both were extremely supportive. They made arrangements to get me a different position, whether I want it permanent or just when I'm having a hard time. HR is going to talk to her today after her shift, and after a few weeks, is going to send out a trauma training. We also discussed accommodations. I have an appt with my therapist next Tues, and an appt appt Sat. 

But when I walked in today, all the other teachers (part of my work has a daycare, they were in the playground) were huddled in a circle around her and several looked at me as I was walking in. 

My anxiety is through the roof. I've already taken meds. I just don't want to be here. I like majority of the people I work with. It's just the position is not working for me. I don't want to lose my job. But I'm so drained and unhealthy. I want to run away.

Talking has become difficult over the years, as weird as that sounds, thanks to my cptsd (I believe). I generally have a hard time with speaking - stringing words together - and it's not necessarily due to social anxiety. I don't get nervous either I just buckle and my words get jumbled - frankly it being due to the fact that I don't really talk much. The most talking I'll ever do is at uni and participating in my classes at that - when it comes to friends I immediately go into listening mode and it's more a subconscious thing that makes up for my own \*perceived\* lack: my struggle with talking.

The ""talking muscle"" isn't exercised much. And my own cptsd makes it difficult TO exercise it I think.

But where it gets me these days is that I can't even articulate my introspection. I say this because I think I'm pretty introspective and reflective - I can have ""sophisticated"" thoughts on things - I'm pretty passionate about social issues and psychology/mental health - but I can't even articulate these passions beyond thoughts. And that makes me feel so sad and inadequate. Just wanna add something to the convo but when I open my mouth my words tangle together.

This just happened earlier with my mum. We were talking about how divorce is stigmatised in our community - and every time I had some introspection to share my words just jumbled then it shut me up and I just listened to my mum for the rest of it. My messy wording makes me sound ""unintelligent"" in a way - like it makes it seem like I don't actually know what I'm talking about..when I do..it makes my mum think I don't understand her level of introspection when I do. Sometimes she assumes I'll ""never understand this misogyny"" when I DO.

277,DAE have trouble going”home” bc of their trauma? How do you deal with it? TRIGGER WARNING: SA.,1,11twn5p,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11twn5p/dae_have_trouble_goinghome_bc_of_their_trauma_how/,2,"I left my country 7 years ago. I (25F) was sexually assaulted repeatedly by maternal grandfather. He died way before I moved away. My older sister (31) was sexually harassed by his son, who was (still is) married. Last year, he tried to harass our maid while she was picking fruit from our tree. The the only one in the house was my little sister (19) and they locked the house and left him outside. They told my mom.

My mom refuses to take any kind of measures against my uncle. She still talks to him normally, all because according to him “none of that stuff ever happened.” My sister whom he touched doesn’t “care at all,” she is married and currently pregnant. I think she is trying to avoid having to deal with my mom’s reaction, bc this affected her and she has talked to me endlessly about it before my mom found out. 

I saw my family in another state, they usually come to the US for summer vacation. We grew up that way because we temporarily lived in that state when me and my siblings were younger. 

My sister is about to give birth, and she is apparently devastated that I’m not going to be there. But she hasn’t spoken to me or texted me in over a year. It’s only when I call my mom that any of my siblings talk to me, excluding my oldest brother who is actually my everything. She wants me to go back to help her decorate the nursery in my parents house, bc in my culture people visit you after giving birth in your parents house, not your own. She also said she is ✨seriously ✨ not sending me any pictures of my nephew if I don’t go back bc that’s my responsibility since I’m the younger sister and she did this for my other sister when she gave birth. It honestly feels like blackmail.

I went home 3 times since I moved away, but the last time was 5 years ago when my parents took away my passport and kept me from coming back for 8 months after I finally told them about my grandfather, because I was “bringing shame to the family.”

I love my family, it’s not their fault what my grandfather or uncle did, but my mom continuously suggesting that “I’m lying” and mentioning her brother and father in front of me for no reason triggers me insanely. When I saw them last summer, I stayed with them for a month. My mom did the same thing and I had a panic attack worst than any other one I have had in YEARS. I know I can’t take it, and my grandfather’s pictures are everywhere in our house and she refuses to take them down. 

It’s not about whether she accepts it or not, I don’t care anymore, she made it clear that even if he did that she “has to pray for him so God forgives him.” We are Muslim, parents are a big deal for us. 

It’s about the fact that I can’t handle that kind of environment. It’s too toxic. Everyone still talks about him in my city bc he was a “religious, kind example.” He built mosques all over the city, so I hear his name every time I go to a mosque there. It will be Ramadan soon so there is no way that I won’t go to the mosque if I do visit. 

Point is, my sister is giving birth soon, Ramadan is coming up, and both are occasions where families celebrate together, but I can’t celebrate with mine. 

I’m tired. All my sisters are mad at me for not going back, my brother is disappointed that I’m not going back bc he misses me and I haven’t seen him in 4 years, but he is not mad at all. My dad stopped talking to me this past year after he saw my panic attack bc he feels helpless every time he hears my voice bc I’m sick and faraway from him.

So I’ve been out of full time work for coming up on 5 years now. In these 5 years I’ve attempted 4 different times to hold down full time jobs that I applied for and was hired for and failed at all of them. I believe 3 weeks was the longest I made it at any of the 4 before I had to quit or was fired for missing days due to panic attacks and all the rest exc.

I had my monthly facetime checkup with my psych aprn who scripts my meds the other day and told him how horrible I’m doing (I’m currently in therapy again as well have been for 4 months trying IFS therapy) and he said he thinks I should def apply that the attempts at working look good in my favor exc. 

It’s just based on everything I’ve researched and heard even ppl with great documentation and severe illnesses exc get denied and somes appeals even eventually get denied as well. I also worry that since I’ve gone though so many therapists I only have one long term mental health professional I’ve been with and that’s him…this aprn I see who does my meds and I’ve been seeing for 8-9 years now. 

I mean maybe that’s good enuff since he can provide all the diagnoses and records of the million meds I’ve tried exc. I guess I can list out all the shrinks I’ve seen including my current one altho as far as them being able to actually talk to them if that’s even needed idk I mean some of them are from way back. 

I’ve been diagnosed with Gad, SAD, cptsd, panic disorder, non specific depressive disorder and ocd so uhh ywah  I’m pretty Fkn bat shit lol and I’m def disabled I mean I’ve tried to work I want to work I don’t want a hand out but I’m desperate now. Savings are dwindling and while my older sister helps me out here and there knowing my situation with 100 bucks here 100 there which I feel so pathetic about but am grateful for but it’s just not enuff.

I don’t wanna be on disability forever but idk at the age of 33 after everything I’ve tried for so many goddamn years now I think I may be fooling myself holding on to any illusion of hope for a future for myself, and that includes ever being able to work a job again of any kind. I couldn’t even Fkn do a work from home job I was having panic attacks from being so overwhelmed logging on to my laptop in my own fucking living room for Christ sake.

Anyway I guess you didn’t need the whole life story sorry so basically just wondering if anybody here who is familar w the system or who has applied and been accepted or denied or whatever knows if it’s worth a shot. 

I know I said I’m a desperate so it would seem like duhhh of course irs worth it but at the same time I am so fucking exhausted mentally n physically 24/7 and have such little to nonexistent will and energy to do anything that I would feel like such a Fkn jerkoff if went through with all the paperwork and the gettint a lawyer possibly and the auto denial they basically do to everyone and then the hearing before a judge and just the massive headaches I know would lie ahead 

Tl;dr: familar with applying for mental health disability? With the system in general or you personally applied and we’re accepted or denied know if irs worth it or it’s rly just really low chance of approval even w a lawyer and good paperwork and diagnoses and doctors backing me up exc…

291,Stuck,1,11ts7o1,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11ts7o1/stuck/,1,"For background:
Non- binary AFAB 29year old

Hello, I had CPTSD suggested to me a few years back and then again a few times recently by medical professionals. But I haven’t been formally diagnosed, my mental health team think my symptoms are more to do with poorly managed ADHD and just want me to stick to a medication regimen of Ritalin…

Anyways, I had a really turbulent upbringing which led to homelessness from a young age and doing things I didn’t want to to get by. I got myself together and managed to appear normal for some time: going to uni, working away, long term partner… before covid hit I was working in the refugee camps in Greece and broke up with my partner of 5 years due to being away all the time. When I came back I got another tough job working with young people who’d been sexually exploited - got into another relationship but just kept freaking out and pushing her away. Essentially I got what I thought I wanted and became single, quit my job and then essentially made myself homeless. I put myself in all the exact same situations I was in when I was a teenager.. I start living in a van I did up and started travelling around planting trees and doing forestry work and trying to stay out of trouble. Then I met someone, I had red flags from the beginning but I felll for it. To cut that but short I had an absolute meltdown afterwards and couldn’t function panic attacks daily, unable to eat sleep or regulate myself.. I managed to get my shit together again and finally got a council flat, but then had a serious rock climbing accident and spent two weeks in hospital and had a bunch of operations on my mangled arm. I was starting my post grad in two weeks. Anyways, I start my postgrad still woozy on painkillers, I pull through do well, I even get a modelling contract and paid to work on a film with my pal by creative Scotland- so lucky with the opportunities, and go away with all my pals to Morocco and whilst there I suddenly can’t do anything. Finally my life is together and I’m so proveleged and I can’t do anything. I get back , it continues, I drop out of my postgrad thinking I might be able to focus on creative stuff/ modelling, but I can’t do it. I meet really nice people and every time we try to be intimate I just can’t.

I don’t understand it, it makes me feel sick I’m so so lucky and privileged right now, I have my own flat with my dog and I get disability and jobseekers- so I’m comfortable, but I can’t enjoy it or be productive with it. I just feel so guilty. And I can’t get the person who gave me red flags out of my head. I feel like people hate me over it, that she’s spreading lies (for context she’s v well known where I live and owns a studio a stones throw from my flat). But why should I care!? I know I try to do the best by people but I’m crippled with anxiety about what is said and if I try to put work out in spaces that they will put me down or make people not let me perform/ publish with certain organisations etc.

And yeah, I guess the main thing is not being able to be close to anyone now and having zero drive for anything.

Sorry this just turned into a moan. Poor me, the government give me money so I can live a comfortable life without doing anything…

But has anyone experienced anything similar? What’s wrong with me? Is it just really severe adhd or does it coincide with cptsd too?",1679062296.0

She was claiming it was to get our attention because we were distracted. I’m 18. I’m a college student (back here for spring break). I know how to get ready to leave the house. 

I got an emotional flashback. I froze. Started staring off into the distance. My mom ended up complaining about how grumpy I was being, while I’m just trying to manage my freeze response. I said something along the lines of, if you don’t want me to be upset, don’t yell at me. My dad, who abused my mom for their entire relationship up until about a month ago, started complaining about my mom again, and she was probably upset about that.

I’ve taken Ativan every day this week because my anxiety is so bad. I can’t sleep, I can’t function, I just feel my life is going to be over in a few days. The event in question is an ultrasound on my genital area which is incredibly triggering because I’ve dealt with so much medical abuse and neglect around it. I am an intersex man and they are looking for gonads, which ones and where they are. The results are also causing me a ton of anxiety because if they find ovaries then I’m straight up killing myself, if they find ovotestes I don’t know what I’d do, and if they find testes then that just means pursuing surgery which brings up even more anxiety even though it would be the best of the three outcomes. It’s also the most probable outcome but I can’t trust anything about my body anymore because of how much gaslighting I’ve experienced. They also could find a mix of gonads. I’m pretty certain I have testes, I mean I have a confirmed prostate, so I don’t see why I should be so upset by the what-ifs. I don’t have anyone who can come to support me so that’s not an option. And because my genitals are visibly ambiguous Im already feeling the shame and embarrassment of someone looking down there. I feel like I’m going to be seen as a freak or mistake.

TLDR the title from freeze response and shame I guess. 

I (young female) have been seeing my therapist for five years now. I went through many other mental health providers prior to him that I proved too difficult. He’s the only therapist who has had the patience and grace and endure my refusal to speak the majority of the time. The first three years of our sessions was just a constant crisis stabilization. I was in and out of the hospital and unable to cope with much else let alone begin to process the trauma causing my “hysteria”. 

However, the last two years I’ve been in a monumentally better place which is evidently and ironically the perfect time for everything I ever wanted to forget to suffocate me slowly right when I got a glimmer of hope 🙃 Our sessions have been the most trauma focused as they have ever been. There was one appointment years prior we tried to do EMDR but I went into a spiral. For the past two years I have not been able to look at him during our sessions. I shit you not. 

I can return eye contact when he comes to get me in the waiting room and I’ll keep my head up until he’s asked how the last few days have gone. After that, I deflate like a balloon. My head goes down and to the side and I will spend the rest of the time staring at the wall or floor. 

I can’t look at him during the session and can’t acknowledge his presence. The closest thing is I can sometimes look at his shoes but that just upsets me, especially if he has on the brown ones. I struggle immensely with disassociation and I’ll zone out in my head or the past for minutes. Sometimes I can hear him trying to move in his chair or he’ll wiggle or lightly tap his foot to get me back to where I’m at least aware I’m staring at the wall. 

He’s never commented on my inability to look at him. I guess if he did say something to me I would cease to exist on an atomic level and crumble from being exposed. I am aware and hate how difficult I am being but that serves to make me feel worse. Ahhhh the wonderful things trauma does to you. 

Even after our session is over and we are scheduling our next I can’t look at him.  And I won’t when I leave.  Not until the next appointment. I’m sorry for this long ramble I just am at a complete loss on how to address this shame and total shutdown.

I was going to start my architecture apprenticeship a couple years ago but I had my hands full with my abusive family and raising my daughter and couldn't do all of it at once.

We moved away and things are a lot better, I've since gone to therapy and have been diagnosed with PTSD and DID. I also have chronic body pain, joint inflammation and migraines that half a dozen doctors I've been to haven't found out the cause yet.

Doing my apprenticeship seems impossible now (loud noises, dealing with a lot of people, stressful deadlines and environment and a myriad of other factors) but I have found a different way to express my creativity and perhaps earn a little extra money. I paint and want to sell paper products featuring my artwork.

The problem is, although I am feeling better than I have in literal years, I still have all this pain whenever I do any amount of work.

I try to keep things light and don't do a lot of the chores anymore, my husband has taken on more responsibility as well and we intend to hire help soon.

But even with those I still have trouble working for more than 2 hours at a time.

Everytime I try to power through my body shuts down and I spasm with pain and am accosted by migraines and body pains for days after.

How does anyone cope with this?

I'm lucky in that we don't really need the extra money we're not rich or well off by any means but we get by, my husband earns enough to support us but I want to work and do something with my life that will help me feel a sense of accomplishment.

Does anyone here struggle with your illnesses and mental health getting in the way of work and hobbies?

I'd really love to hear from you.

How do I figure out what I’m doing wrong?",48,11sw0sx,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11sw0sx/experiencing_consistent_rejection_from_potential/,34,"Hey everyone. I’m seeking genuine feedback with this post and trying not to come off like a pity party. I’ve been feeling down lately because I’m single, unemployed, and feeling like my friendships aren’t reciprocal.

Since I’m having social issues in all the major areas of my life I’m questioning if it’s something about me or my behavior. I’m trying to look inward and figure out how I can improve but it’s difficult when I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong. Context below.

Jobs: I am constantly getting rejected or ghosted from jobs despite previously being successful in my career. The only offers I have received have been for temporary contract roles with no benefits. 

Dating: My ex-boyfriend broke up with me right before the holidays because he “wasn’t ready for a relationship”. We still talk but he’s constantly giving me mixed signals. Stuff like calling me on the phone and talking for hours but then rejecting any invitation to hang out. Telling me I’m hot and then gushing about other people he’s sleeping with. Etc. I am trying to date other people but nothing is clicking, I keep getting ghosted/stood up, and I’ve swiped through everyone in my area on multiple dating apps.

Friends: My friends are all settling down and getting married, buying homes, etc. so they have less time for me. I regularly reach out to people and try to initiate group events, but get shut down because there’s no time that works for everyone’s schedule. I have been trying to branch out and make more single friends and that goes well until they get into a new relationship and then disappear.

I tried to confide in my best friend about how lonely I’ve been feeling and she responded by getting angry with me and stonewalling. She said it upsets her that I feel lonely because she does so much for me. I apologized for making her feel unappreciated but she has remained cold and distant, barely speaking to me for weeks despite being constantly active on social media. 

I feel like I must be doing something wrong for so many people to be treating me like this. People regularly compliment me on how I’m thoughtful, fun, and a good communicator but then don’t treat me well. I exercise, have good hygiene, wear well-fitting clothes, etc. so I think it’s a deeper problem.

Am I expecting too much from others? Am I too negative? Is it bad luck or is my whole personality bad? I’d appreciate any guidance on how to figure this out.

I feel a lot more younger that what I am and it’s weird because suddenly I realized I’m in my late 20s and it’s like… how?

So, for some weird reason, my Facebook has been showing me reels about motherhood and when it is too old to have kids. Apparently I am in the “right” age for having kids and, while I don’t personally believe there is such a thing, it made me kinds realized that, even if I had the chance. I wouldn’t have kids at my age and I kinda felt surprised by all the comments of people saying that they married and had kids in early 20s and such. 

Like, I do know it existed in a disconnected way but it’s lately that I was like “oh it’s real” but it’s weird to me because, I personally feel a lot much younger and with a lot more things that I want to do and heal before being responsible of a human. 

It kinda makes me feel behind? But I mean I spent most of my life up to now feeling sort of away of myself. Trying to deal with tons of mental health issues and relearning what I should have known already that I don’t think I am at that level or if I’ll ever be at that level of being a mom… and I know what is to have a mentally unstable mom. I don’t want for my kids. 
But more than the remain childfree or not situation. Is the “grief” from my lost years what bothers me. 

I honestly feel like I’m anywhere between 17 and 21 not 30 lol and I didn’t enjoyed my life during all that time. I didn’t make what I wanted to do and what I wanted to be a reality. 

I did not live “adventures” outside of my head. 

I think I don’t even know my sexuality and personality completely, I even need to google many “basic” self care skills because I couldn’t learn that when my peers where learning it. 

And it’s not like I can take a Time Machine and go back to be 15 year old me do things different, actually I think even if I magically go back to 15 I couldn’t do anything… 

That’s so frustrating and yes I know rationally it is ok to have different times and whatnot but it’s not like I chose to have CPTSD…

Unfortunately the complications have made it difficult for me to focus on my goals and keep up with my daily routing and rituals, and that loss of control has spiked up my flight/fright/freeze response. It all came to a breaking point yesterday morning when I had a panic attack at work 😔 The panic attack was dreadful, but it did prove to me that I am not in fact making up “excuses” for myself but that I am actually physically sick. 

Anyways, today I was supposed to start EMDR therapy again but I told my therapist that I was not up for it because of my physical symptoms and that I was actually really disappointed that we couldn’t get started today.

So she taught me different ways that I could try tapping techniques today to regulate my nervous system and still prepare for EMDR next week, and to be honest my mind is completely blown! 

A few months ago I scoffed at tapping thinking to myself and even telling my therapist “no offense but I don’t think tapping it’s going to stop me from killing myself 😒🙄.” 

But I was wrong! This actually works and it even helped with my post op pain. I just had to get on here and share because I am mind blown! 

Basically the technique I went for was placing my hands on my knees and alternating tapping from left to right at a count of 1-2 while I focused on my breath. Every time my mind drifted and I started having negative thoughts I just brought it back to the 1-2 count and I did it for about 15 minutes and my mood shifted entirely. Don’t get me wrong I still feel shitty, but the irritability is gone and instead of running down my to do list I’m just relaxed and staying in the present.

I grew up in a dysfunctional family with some pretty traumatic events (I've treated some of them with EMDR), and yet I feel like the emotional cheating I experienced in high school is triggering me more than technically worse things that happened to me.

So, in the beginning of my relationship with my then-boyfriend, he was flirting with THE most popular girl in high school, to the point where all of his buddies were making jokes and asking when they were going to date. 
Everyone agreed that she was the prettiest girl in school, he would smile and text her when I was with him, I saw the conversations they had publicly on Twitter (and their private message lol), etc. Even back then, he was very good at gaslighting me and I felt bad for being jealous but also miserable because I wasn’t as perfect as her.
In the end he broke up multiple times with me, he got closer to her but they didn’t concrete it since she was moving in uni, and he got back together with me. 
He never really assumed what happened or apologized, he just denied it but for 2/3 years he sometimes still sent her nostalgic messages. 

In short, I always felt like a plan B. During the whole relationship I had nightmares of him cheating on me with this girl (or others), or I had nervous ""urges"" where I'd go through his cell phone to see if he was still talking to her, I'd get all worked up and he'd call me crazy. 

It was an abusive relationship that I stayed in for almost 10 years, he made me insecure and not just with this girl (I eventually found out he cheated on me several times lol). But even now that it's over and I'm feeling better without him, when I think back on that period with this girl I feel a lot of shame, anxiety, and I still have nightmares about it.

I'm hesitant to talk to my therapist about it because I'm afraid it will seem ridiculous compared to other things I've experienced. However, it is really something that creates a lot of discomfort for me. I also have related chronic illnesses that started shortly after this event and I'm wondering if this is really a coincidence.",1678999455.0

People have told me that this was not my fault  and that it was bad, but I worry that they're biased. I need to know if it really wasn't a big deal, I need an unbiased opinion. As a child, I was socially isolated. I was the youngest in my class, and didn't understand how to fit in. I had one close friend, A, who wasn't bullied like I was, but isolated due to her shyness. When I was 12 and my classmates were 13, A made a Friend, B, and we would often spend time together. B was nice to both of us, but also mean to me. She would put me into painful holds when I didn't do what she wanted and scratched me. She would belittle me and call me fat, although A was chubbier than me. We often had sleepovers, the 3 of us, and B would touch my breasts under my clothes, in front of A. I would tell her to stop and try to push her off, but she would hurt me until I stopped struggling. Over time, I kind of learned to try to ignore it in hopes of just getting it over with. Later, she touched my genitals under my pyjamas but over my underwear, too. A witnessed it all, but ignored it, and B never did any of this to A. B would call us both her best friends. We would lend each other comic books, share secrets, do friend things, and I spent time with her voluntarily, though usually only if A was involved. When I was 15, I got a boyfriend and when I told her that was why she had to stop, she did. Around the same time, circumstances made it easier for me to avoid her and I did so increasingly for some years before telling her I didn't want to speak with her.

Has anyone tried journalling, or something like it, for coping with cpstd? 

I journalled a lot as a teen, but I find it hard to get into it as a regular habit as an adult. 

I had limited, but positive experiences in the past (about 10 or so years ago) with blogging, but not specifically about mental health. Then, in the past 2-3 years, I thought maybe it would be good to blog again about how I am doing (specifically about my mental health), and also some things that happened to me, including the beravement of my dad and anonymously sharing about challenges I had at work. I did connect with some other people blogging who were like me. What I guess I mean is that I was also disheartened because I found blogging on a major site online (I won't specify which one) to be very spammy. I felt weird writing about my childhood, mental health symptoms, serious life events like a bereavement that happened to me, and people would ""like"" my post who were not real bloggers, but people or groups trying to bump up their SEO, or so it seemed, to promote themselves, or some products. I also found people, or people pretending to be real people, who were very thinly veiled scammers using sites they made themselves on the major blogging site. I then started to feel unsafe sharing online, although I took care not to share my location, job, first or last name. This most recent experience of blogging I had felt a bit like sending a message in a bottle in the ocean, except the ocean was the internet full of spam and scammers, with only a few ""real "" people here and there who were like me.

Has anyone found a way to share about their mental health, or a way of journalling privately, that has worked for you? Has anyone else tried to blog or share their ideas online in ways that were safe and positive?

Hes been hoping for a girl this whole time, I've told myself ill be happy either way but have spent a lot of time I guess trying to manifest a boy first. 

Referencing the baby as ""he"" and occasionally ""she"" but more often than not as male because neither of us wanted to dehumanize our baby by calling the baby ""it"". Just seemed so impersonal.

We had our 28 week ultrasound a few days ago and finally he agreed to just confirm the sex because he said it bothered him slightly hearing me reference our baby as a boy when he knew in his heart it was a girl. Even going so far as to having dreams about it. But it was playful teasing and he doesn't hold it against me that the secret is out.

Lately though I've been having strong waves of fear. I feel connected to our daughter and we've been picking out girl names and talking about all the things we get to teach her. But I'm scared. Terrified. Because I have no basis for relating to my daughter on a child level. I have no model for it. The only person I have to compare notes to for raising a child was my emotionally abusive mother who I am now No contact with and I feel she is a less than stellar example for obvious reasons. I'm terrified of not being able to handle her emotions, or be there for her the way I need to be. I'm afraid of defaulting to the way I was treated unconsciously and ruining her. I'm afraid of crushing her spirit without even meaning to, just by my presence alone. I don't know how to raise a girl. I don't know what to expect. I don't even remember what it was like to be a little girl like that, thats how damaged my mind is. What if she needs me as a mother and I don't end up being a mother she deserves.

But it's a field most get into in their teens and at my age (early 20s), it feels pointless to have ""dreams"". Isn't that something for children? Everyone around me is on a steady way to employment, they don't spend their time dreaming away.  
My therapist tried to familiarise me with the idea that my dream will end as just that, and it's crushing me. I feel like I never had a chance.

We've been in his house multiple times and it is a pretty typical home covered in artwork from his world travels. However, I was having difficulty catching his cat to take her with us and when I went under the bed to grab her, I found child sex abuse materials. We ended up finding a lot more of it in the closet. I will not describe it, because no one deserves to have that living in their heads, but it was not ambiguous and was very clearly children. 

We contacted the police and handed over what we found, then contacted the mental health facility and told them as well. We made sure the pets are taken care of and blocked him.

No one relates, no one replies. I *hate* that I desire acknowledgement and I know I'm being judged... why wouldn't they, wondering what it is that I could have to complain about? My parents certainly do, and I can barely look my father in the eye; I was the golden child who tried so hard to be the best first born but fell flat on my face and didn't get back up.

Looking back now I can see that when we met, she was in a very protective and overcompensating state which came across as kind of arrogant and prickish because she had left a very physically abusive relationship. I almost broke it off with her because of this but I could see something clawing under the surface to get out so I decided I would stick it out for a bit longer and boy was I glad I did. Under that hard protective exterior was the most kind, caring, genuine and loving person I had ever met in my entire life, and I knew at that point that this beautiful person was the one I wanted to live out my days with. I’m not going into the details of the issues that caused her CPTSD but let’s just say it was multiple instances (sexual and physical abuse as a child and adult) across many spectrums that I know this gentle being did not deserve to suffer through. Like all couples we have had our issues with communication both from her perspective of stuffing her CPTSD (initially misdiagnosed as BPD) deep down inside and ignoring it along with my own issues of being wound up inside my head (Getting tested for Asperger’s next week actually). So, as you can see, not a recipe for good comms between us!! I know I failed her in many ways as a husband because of my issues in showing her on the outside what I felt on the inside, that she was everything to me. I thought that my actions were enough, but I know they weren’t, and I know now after researching CPTSD for over a year exactly what I should have done to show this woman how she means the world to me. I have never and I never will do anything to intentionally hurt this woman no matter how much she chooses to hurt me in this stage.

                Fast forward to the last 2 years and things went downhill, we tried marriage counseling but the marriage counselor said there wasn’t really much we could do because of her BPD (which was actually CPTSD) keeping her closed off and not wanting to communicate. Which after all my research I can see clear as day now and understand why that would be so hard. We took a break from that, and she started seeing a therapist which is where they told her she has CPTSD instead of BPD and about a month after the start there things really went to shit. She said she had to get out of the house because she needed time to get her head right and moved in with her sister and left all her of pets with me and 99% of her stuff about 7 months ago. Now my personal opinion with this is not so good as her sister is diagnosed Bipolar and is just an overall manipulative and vindictive person whose only purpose is to serve her own goals and her brother-in-law is a hot-tempered ass most of the time. Both of those types of people are triggers for my wife, but nothing I could say would convince her that living there is not conducive to a healthy healing environment.

                The first few months weren’t too bad, but communication started slacking when she bought her motorcycle and started riding with groups of other people for “therapy” as she called it. Now to backtrack a little bit, when she was 17, she ran away from home to live with this same sister and did pretty much the exact same thing with the motorcycle “therapy”. Once that started she started lying to other people telling them she was divorced, going through a divorce and telling people about her life which included past things from her life, my life and our life but all mixed together which showed me that something wasn’t right inside her head and that she was most likely having some very hard struggles which I know therapy can cause by bringing up all the repressed emotions. I asked her to come home and watch the animals for a few days so I could get away and get some time for my own mental health and she refused, I’ve told her I need to schedule my colonoscopy because I have Ulcerative Colitis and was due over a year ago and she ignores me. Since then though it has just gotten progressively worse to where she is now emotionally abusive, manipulative and I am 100% sure has had at least one emotional affair and almost 95% sure of a physical affair as well. How far that went I don’t know.

                Now it may make me seem like a pushover, but once I found out I told her I could understand where all this was coming from and that I was willing to forgive and work past it, but she continues to just purposely ignore me and pretend like I don’t exist (no real direct comms since January). I’ve given up so much these past 2 years for this woman, no sex, no love, no support yet I have tried to be there for her and to learn and be better for her every step of the way. But at this point with the lies and the affair and the emotional abuse I am just dying. I have lost 21 pounds through all of this and suffer from severe depression to the point that my own therapists are putting me on Prozac and Xanax. I am just completely broken and lost and trying to keep it together just to type this. I love this woman so much and I can’t bring myself to admit that this “woman” is the same gentle, sweet, nurturing, and loving woman that I fell in love with and married. I know she is having a very hard time and I can’t help but feel that I if I divorce her that I am abandoning her in a time of need even if she doesn’t realize it. I feel like I’d be divorcing whoever this woman is and at the same time it would also take away the love of my life who is buried somewhere down deep inside of her in a protective vault which feels like I’m just putting a gun to my head.

                My logical side tells me that for my own sake I need to do this and suffer the heartbreak of losing her and abandoning her but to save myself in the long run. However, my heart tells me that this isn’t the person I married, and I need to be there for her and in the end this will all pass and will be a learning experience for all that will make things stronger moving forward. All the wonderful memories I have of her and the life we built together and the plans for our future are just completely foreign to me when I think of it in the perspective of whoever this “woman” is that she has become the last several months who tries to be “hard” and “strong” when I know for a fact the woman she really is fragile and deserves love and support.

                Sorry for the long post, I’m just rambling because I am extremely lost and confused and hurt and just need to vent a little. I’m just looking for perspectives from anybody else who has been on either side of a similar situation. Thank You for Reading.",1678974541.0

All I wanted to do was talk as a kid. It brought me so much unexplainable joy to share experiences. 

But now life has fucked me up. After multiple repeated horrible traumatic experiences and the realization that my childhood had actually entailed quite a lot of abuse, I have become isolated and secluded. All I want is to be left alone yet simultaneously I want someone else to stand by me in silence. I have no friends anymore. 

Battling through severe depression and CPTSD and social anxiety makes relationships so terrifying and exhausting. I don’t have the energy to even maintain eye contact.

And God… how I wish someone would even bother to try making me laugh. How I wish someone would sit by me and tell me stories of their life and I can just quietly listen and nod my head.

He did for a bit, and that made me trust him and I felt safe around him. I loved being around him. I stopped smoking. I looked forward to spending time with him. We communicated well.

There were several red flags that I brushed off because of this.

Then we moved in together. The month we did I found out he was sexting random people on discord, and was in a NSFW server. I found out he had taken a picture of my (clothed) feet and posted them to the server. When I confronted him, he seemed genuinely distraught and sobbed and told me how sorry he was, he’d never do it again, he felt so embarrassed and ashamed, etc. He got me gifts and I felt so..disconnected from everything immediately.

I forgave him despite this and proceeded to try and trust him again. He said I could check his phone whenever I wanted.

Then I found out, again, this time he sent more pictures (ones I had taken myself) and also sent them a video of us doing sexual acts that I consented to (I havent had a good history with sex. I was groomed). But obviously I didnt want him to send it and I told him how nervous I was that’d he would do that. 

I confronted him and he kept trying to convince me they were old, before I found out the first time, and he stopped, then doubled down and said that he DID do it again but it didnt satisfy him and he stopped. I told him this was illegal and creepy, he agreed but said he was just “showing me off”. I took him back again because I felt so confused and I still loved him. 

I’ve been trying so hard to trust him but I cant. 2 days ago my mom bought us a bedframe and while putting it together he got super frustrated and said “tell your mom not to buy this shit again” and kicked a bag of clothes. I didnt know how to react so I went in the bathroom and he knocked a few minutes later sounding incredibly guillty. But I feel so different towards him now. I am scared for our future.

I broke up with him and he told me he cant accept it but he wont deny it. That we can talk more after his therapy appt. But I already feel so hollow. He’s being so nice to me but I want to cry everytime he is.

In the car, he told me he cheated because it made him feel good, wnd he didnt care, he wanted to do what he wanted. And that scared him. I didnt know what to say.

 I still love him so much. Everytime he’s nice I wanted to hug him and cry. Please tell me I’m making the right decision.",1678999003.0

I realized I’ve been looking for that on vacation feeling. I’ve been out of abuse for a while now and I found life to be….not exciting. 
I realized that leaving my abusive home situation as a young teen / teen / young adult to spend time with my ex gave me something to look forward to- even if it was for a few hours. We dated for nearly a decade so that vacation feeling has had a lot of time to marinate in my brain. I was more present because I was so excited to leave. I was myself- or who I thought I was at the time. I made memories and life wasn’t so stagnant. 
I’ve been trying to get through this with therapy- I know it’ll be a process. I’ve Giving myself tasks / things to do that bring me joy. However, I’m feeling such a lack of joy, presence and energy because of that search. To the point where leaving the house is exciting due to that period of time currently. I’m much older, I’m in a healthy relationship and I want to be better. I want to feel better. 
I even noticed things being different with my partner. He and I are equal, I don’t rely on him for freedom, happiness or peace. He compliments my life and I’m so lucky. But this feels different- it feels like I don’t love him enough? because I’m not doing that. I do, this love is just nothing I’ve experienced in my life.

I’ve never had a real birthday party and I don’t get showered with wishes of blessings and love. 
Growing up forgotten and shamed for asking for anything I learned not to. And now at almost 38 I feel sick wanting to be important enough to anyone to be celebrated even a little. I’ll have no cake no presents nothing at all aside from another run of the mill Saturday. 
My boyfriend asked me what I wanted like 3 days ago. I said nothing. He persisted and I continued the nothing. He said “you get what you ask for” and for some reason that gutted me. (For context-he is not one who cares about birthdays or holidays and would rather not celebrate any of them. Somebody else usually buys for his kids for him) I don’t want to get what I ask for.

But today, I found a video I forgot I had of my narcissistic mother abusing me emotionally/physically. 
For the past few months, I’d say 4-5, I feel like I have been riding an awful, terrifying emotional roller coaster I didn’t even know I was getting on. I’m currently 19 and experience a lot of mental health issues that I don’t even know I have certain vocabulary for. A lot of depression, a lot of anxiety, a LOT of stress, a lot of all the grit between them all. All. of. the. time.
The whole reason a video was even brought up is because my girlfriend communicated to me she has been feeling disconnected from me. Apathetic even from her own trauma. Because of how, to be transparent, awful I have been navigating it all. 
I’m really quick to experience stuff black and white and in extremes lately, which never use to be me. It’s like things are popping up randomly in the mental illness aspect of my life. 
But basically, I apologized and broke down because of how much I don’t even recognize myself at this point. I hate that I’ve hurt her through hurting myself, and even though she did the same to me at 19 (she’s 21 now, we’ve been together 2+ years) its almost defeating to see how I affect her. 
ANYWAYS- the video triggered me so bad. I don’t even want to talk about what all she does in it. It’s unfathomable. But my girlfriend is so supportive of me. I don’t know exactly why I made this post. 
Just feeling lost in everything I suppose. Starting therapy again on the 28th.

We are both queer and considering being on the aromantic spectrum, as well as young and inexperienced so I think we are seeing it more as an opportunity to explore ourselves and our sexualities. I'm fairly certain I don't have any romantic feelings for him, I don't really see the appeal nor have the mental capacity to be in a romantic relationship and he doesn't want one either anyway. We dated a few years ago and I think what I thought back then were romantic feelings was instead just a crippling fear of being alone and feeling abandoned or rejected, I think the way I saw it was that if I was in a relationship with him, I wouldn't have to worry about losing him or doubt that he doesn't like me, which obviously I know now is a toxic mindset to have but I wasn't aware at the time lol. All I care about right now is that he's in my life in one way or another and I'm important to him, anything else we do is just a bonus perk, so we have sex because it's something we enjoy doing together.   
Recently though I've been struggling very much with being super on guard and hypervigilant around him, to a point where it's almost like I'm doubting everything he says and internalizing it to mean he doesn't like me or he's just with me out of pity. It's like I almost can't believe anything else and it makes me feel very guilty because he's done nothing but say and do things that disprove that, and yet I still can't believe him. I feel like I am projecting my own mindset very hard, like I'm assuming what I think he feels is the truth when in reality he's probably thinking nothing like it. I know its coming from a place of low self worth and feeling like I'm a burden and unlovable, but I don't know what steps to take to help let my guard down. I'm scared that at this rate I'm going to self sabotage this relationship do to my own fears. It's very upsetting because I want to be able to love and trust him, but I guess I'm just terrified to, and it's frustrating because it feels like it seemingly came out of no where. I have been very anxiously attached to him in the past, but that started to subside once I found out I had CPTSD. I feel like I was able to trust him before, but I'm also unsure because being anxiously attached often made me doubt if he truly cared about me, but in retrospect I think it was because I wasn't getting the affection I wanted from him which made me feel validated and whole. I was very emotionally dependent on him and sought reassurance a lot and I don't want to fall back into that territory. I'm scared internally maybe I'm still seeing sex as a way to make me feel better about myself, but I want to unlearn that, I want to do it because it's something I like.

They have suffered neglect, physical, and emotional abuse, and are struggling to cope. Our parents are making minor improvements, but it's not enough for my sibling (understandably so as my parents are bad in many ways), and my sibling is engaging in destructive behaviors.

Their current situation includes substance use (vaping, smoking, using weed and that is it as far as I know but they have not been telling the truth) , hanging out with problematic crowds, skipping school, dropping hobbies, and constantly talking about wanting to leave the house. They feel deeply let down by everyone, are unable to focus on anything constructive, and express that nothing has meaning.

They're in distress, worrying about their own death, our parents fighting, and the possibility of them harming each other. They believe no one cares, no one helps, and everyone wants something from them. They can't see our parents as safe people anymore and feel intense emotional distress. They are the same time also extremely angry, explosive, unwilling to try solutions like therapy or staying in school.

Therapy hasn't been successful, as they refuse to accept help or attend sessions. Due to their trauma, they struggle to open up to anyone or ask for help.

I have tried finding an alternative place for them to stay temporarily and to support emotionally but it is always hitting a wall as they are upset that I cant get them out of there, but we don't have a strong social support system, making leaving the house difficult. Social workers are involved, but they don't seem to be able to make much of a difference.

I'm looking for advice on how to:

1. Keep them from having an explosive relationship with our emotionally immature and unreliable parents.
2. Encourage them to stay in school and pass their classes.
3. Prevent them from imploding (I'd like them to engage in hobbies, hang out with good friends, and continue to have hope).

Since one of my parents had a lot of loss in their life their personality changed. They haven't screamed at me in years. But I'm still always waiting for it. They feel like a volcano to me. Dormant, but for how long?

I learned young that I can't rely on them at all for any kind of mental, emotional or health support.

368,My brother said he was proud of me and I'm not happy ( TRIGGER WARNINGS: Mention of child sexual abuse and emotional abuse),3,11t3vqu,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11t3vqu/my_brother_said_he_was_proud_of_me_and_im_not/,1,"To say I have a strained relationship with my family would be an understatement.

My ex parents (I refer to them as my ex parents because I don't see them as my parents anymore) abused me. My ex mom is a narcissist and she made my life miserable.

My ex uncle s*xually abused me, my former teacher s*xually abused me and my ex parents didn't protect me from any of it! I have a suspicion that Melody (ex mom) had something to do with the abuse from my uncle. The nature of the abuse from him was complicated. To make a long story short inappropriate pictures were taken of me and I don't know what he did with them, but I do wonder who was paid for them.

I don't know how much my brother knows about my uncle. I tried to tell him because he just had a little baby and I wanted to let him know that he needs to be careful around that particular family member with his little girl. And he just completely dismissed me. He acted like I didn't even say anything and when I pressed the matter he brushed it under the rug.

I wonder if what happened with him was an open secret. I tried to tell my ex dad about it because he had grandchildren and my ex dad's word for word response was, ""Well he only has one little one left."" (This was before my brother's daughter was born).

Anyways, I drunk texted my brother last night and we got to talking. We didn't talk about anything too deep. I sent him pictures of my and my husband's new house and I think he was really impressed.

Earlier today he and I were talking and he said he was proud of me. I feel conflicted about that. I didn't do anything to earn the house. That was all my husband's doing. I am disabled and I can't work a normal job. So my husband has been supporting me 100% and I am so lucky and thankful to him. He went into a very lucrative field which allows me to focus on writing.

He didn't say he was proud of me because I have nine published works out. He didn't say he was proud of me because I use my stories to try to expose my abusers and help other people who are going through something similar. My books aren't memoirs. A lot of people get confused when I try to explain. They are horror-romance fiction books with vampires, zombies and werewolves. I incorporated real life events that happened to me in the narrative. I wrote a dedication to one of my abusers saying that I'm not ashamed of what happened to me and he is the one at fault.

He didn't tell me he was proud of me for anything I did really. He told me he was proud of me because I have a house with my husband.

It just doesn't feel like I earned it. And it feels shallow. My ex family is always been wealthy and really values material things. I feel weird because I've wanted this for so long but it just feels empty.

I don't think it would feel as empty if he had read my books or seen reviews or how my books have impacted people and said he was proud of me for that. I don't think it would have felt as hollow if he told me he was proud of me for how much I was healing. But no. He's proud of me because I live in a nice house with an impressive backyard and pool because my husband has a good job.

I wish he was proud of something I actually did. I have a lot of mixed emotions about this.

The house isn't big but it's not small either. 3 bed, 2 bath and it's built in kind of a U shape around this really cool pool area. So I also feel like kind of a fraud because I don't know if he thinks I'm living in a huge mansion. Maybe I'm just being paranoid.",1678995247.0

SO WHY ARE ALL MY PRESCRIBERS STILL PUSHING ANTIPSYCHOTICS? ive had absolutely horrific results with antipsychotics and atypical antipsychotics. none of them work for me. it is dangerous mentally and in some cases physically. i was incredibly anemic, all my blood values out of wack, and had swelling in the membrane around my brain from risperdal. quetiapine made me even more suicidal on top of being so. so. SO fucking tired and confused, which led to anger and panic because i was overstimulated and so fatigued 24/7 that a loud TV commercial led to me hiding in the bathroom hyperventilating sobbing and about to kill myself. i was on haldol at 15 and lost two years to being asleep constantly. i never ate or showered. antidepressants are no better. cymbalta gave me a skin peeling bleeding rash. SSRIs have done something to my brain and i suffered constant brain zaps from zoloft and prozac for years even after tapering off them. i am just now getting an MRI. ive been on propranolol, depakote, hydroxizine, guanfacine. all of these arent even the whole list on my file. ive been cooperative and active in my care plans.

my fiance just started therapy and got a psychiatrist maybe last year. he has bad insomnia, and some ADHD and bipolar symptoms. he was a HUGE stoner until recently. he is a straight white traditionally masculine man. he already has a prescription for clonazepam and is going to get adderall soon. his first GP appointment, the doctor took his physical pain seriously and he is getting specialists and physical therapy and testing and meds. i dont understand.

i struggle so bad for so long, and its just more of the same. ive had so many diagnoses but the meds pushed never change. my psych doesnt want me on .5mg clonazepam once a day because ""the risk of drug abuse and early onset dementia"" when i just want to live long enough to even GET dementia! nevermind ever asking for a stimulant of any kind despite being diagnosed ADHD in 3rd grade. i was given wellbutrin. yes, benzos have a risk, but my own abuser gets to take 1mg of clonazepam FOUR TIMES A DAY and she's not even anxious, just legitimately batshit insane. this trend of never being taken seriously is pushing me to the edge. 

the physical and mental anguish, pain, and torture is wearing me down. nowadays, i get drunk twice a week to ""reset"" my brain so i dont get a fucking heart attack getting flashbacks to near-death instances. i cant even smoke weed, because the THC gives me panic attacks and psychosis symptoms. i dont pursue hard drugs because i am so dirt fucking poor and too disabled mentally and physically to make more money. i am honest and up front about suicidal ideation, alcohol use, how much i vape nicotine, any supplements and vitamins i take, what im doing to prevent health risks. and still, STILL, ""want to try abilify? latuda? seroquel?"" i am going to fucking kill myself.",1679002415.0

So I’m 35 years old and I’ve been diagnosed with severe depression (MDD) that is treatment resistant, I’ve tried multiple antidepressants (now at 200 mg Zoloft) but nothing works. I’m in pure agony every day and (TW) I’m suicidal and feel defeated. I don’t want to die, but I can’t continue like this, crying every day and basically suffering nonstop. 

I’m in weekly therapy (and I’m seeing a psych every two months) and my therapist talks a lot about my trauma, about how I’m traumatized… but I haven’t been diagnosed with CPTSD because it’s not something people in my country knows about, since it’s not in “official” in here. I always feel like it makes sense in my particular case, but yesterday I read that people with CPTSD don’t have abandonment issues, which is basically my “only” problem. Is this true? They say that it’s more common in borderline personality disorder, but I don’t fit the diagnosis, I believe. Or maybe?

Basically, I have childhood (and mostly adolescent) trauma, and also in the last 6 years I’ve been abandoned by all my friends and my partner. I’ve lost all my friends, and I can’t seem to overcome this. Every day I feel like it’s the first day after being left alone, and I can’t stop ruminating about it, even if it’s been years. I just cry and hope they come back. It makes no sense, I’ve tried it all, but it’s like my mind can’t process these losses, at all. I feel so crazy, so so so lonely and feel like it’s all my fault and I’m unlovable and toxic and a terrible person. It's been 6 years with my partner and I still want to vomit when someone says his same or tells me about him. I'm the craziest person alive. My childhood trauma is basically neglect, being abandoned/neglected by both my parents and watching (and sometimes experimenting) psychological and emotional violence. 

So… Can my experiences fit CPSTD or abandonment trauma is not compatible with CPSTD? I feel so crazy, is someone else not able to move on?? Why I am like this? I’m a lost cause? If someone experienced this, what helped? 

I’m so hopeless, nobody offers me any solution and I feel like my psych is very frustrated that I’m still the same after all those years. Therapy doesn’t seem to help much.",1678992616.0

I was under immense stress all the time, but I have been moved out of my parents house for about 6 years now. 

My relationship with my parents improved after I moved out, though I don't contact them much. It's funny because they are nice and kind people but that confuses me so much because of how utterly cruel they were to me when I lived at home. I feel like I almost gaslight myself into thinking Im just making it up in my head, but every time I go home and spend an evening, I am brought back to the same feelings of incredible distress. 

I don't know what came over me today, I was having a really good day and being grateful for all my progress in life. Under some impulse, I called my mom and decided I wanted to develop a close and healthy relationship with her. I told her I wanna get closer to her and treat her like a friend, and was feeling really good about the conversation.

However, I'm wondering if I did this out of fawning... I attract a lot of narcissistic people, due to my poor boundary setting. Having very recently cut off a super narcissistic abuser of a friend, now I'm wondering if I'm basically reestablishing an abusive relationship. I have memories of me as a child being extremely convinced my parents were narcissists, but I can't remember the exact instances that made me think this way with such conviction. I'm so confused. 

My mom has called me a few times and we talked about basic things, but I can't help but wonder if I'm making a big mistake; I feel like part of me wanted to get to know her is so she can understand and hear me out and somehow understand what she may have done wrong? I wanna make sure I don't get into another bad pattern of establishing an abusive relationship because I have gotten myself into so many in the past due to my lack of boundaries / fawning.

It’s like a punishment. And punishment is all I knew. I hate when I actually try or want to do good and I’m downvoted or someone tells me off. 

I’m now in my 30’s and it has been this way for decades. Started when I got online on deviant art and live journal. I panic and I mean panic. I shake like alcoholic withdrawal when someone is mean to me. It feels like the end of world.  Sometimes I will have a panic attack and that negative comment or downvote will haunt me all day, put me in a flight or fight response and I snap at family members and co workers all day. 

Either exposure hasn’t worked or I’m doing it wrong or is there a chance social media just isn’t for me? I don’t have anything except Reddit where I ask questions but Im wondering if its possible I’m just overly sensitive and it’s best I should l avoid things like that altogether since I cannot overcome/triumph my fear of rejection? 

I chose to ask this here rather than self improvement or no surf because I know this issue is from my abusive childhood. It’s not about “manning up” or “pull myself up by the bootstraps”. I have tried. I’m just not sure if I need a different type exposure therapy or I’m just the person who cannot handle the negatives of social media. 

I can tell myself all sorts of things like they’re no bodies, it won’t affect me directly, could be a troll, but I’ve been trying for over 20 years and nothing has worked. It’s like my brain will not listen to my soul; they’re two separate entities. 

Has anyone experienced this, overcame it or has to cut it off? 

I’m also going thru a bit of weed withdrawal - trying to get my life on track so I’m sorry if this was a bit aggravated. I’m definitely feeling more anxious than usual but any suggestions and support is appreciated.

I never learned healthy communication when faced with conflict, so I figured I'd ask here what in your experience would be an appropriate response.

Please only serious replies!

At work, I'm facing a technical issue, so I used our ticketing system to ask for help.

One person replied directly in our chat system and spent an hour with me yesterday to help diagnose this. He seemed to care. We did not fix it but track it down to a cause before we ran out of time.

Today, the same person referred me to their office hours (i.e. 1 hour out of the day once per week during which they will be available to anyone with questions).

So I basically need to wait a week before I can join this office hour and MAYBE get chosen to talk to this person (since there will likely be multiple people in chat) and MAYBE get a few more minutes of their time - when yesterday one hour wasn't enough.

I understand that a person in his position is bound to be busy, but this response seems both uncaring and in extreme conflict to the help they provided yesterday.

My ""automatic"" response is one of passive-aggressiveness, along the lines of ""Well, I guess I won't get any help and will have to do this on my own..."" - which is the truth when it comes down to it.

But I'm sure there HAVE to be better responses...

I could say ""You know, I feel a bit confused and hurt by this sudden change"" - but while this may be healthy for ME to express my feelings, I have yet to see anything useful come of doing this...

Can you provide with a few examples of what could be healthy responses to this situation and this person?

My parents really helped me and I opened up and tears of bottling up emotions came out and it took about a year, but I began to feel happy and relaxed, something I hadn’t felt since a young teenager.

I excelled in my career, found some ‘genuine’ friends, found a girl whom I thought was the love of my life, found respect from my family and colleagues.I felt amazing, untouchable, confident, carefree and above all else happy with life and myself.

This continued for about 8 months, until I got a new position in another company. Initially things went well, but my collègues were heavy drinkers and one night invited me to go out with them.

I initially said no, then yes and then my girlfriend rang telling me she wanted to spend the evening FaceTiming. So I told my collègues no.

One collègue in particular, the ‘ring leader’, became really irritated with me, shouted at me and slammed the door in my face. (We we’re in shared accommodation). Everyone followed her to go out.

From that moment I felt like my whole headspace collapsed. I felt my confidence drain away from me, I felt cold and I felt my world get very small.

I spent the evening in some sort of anxiety lockdown where I couldn’t think and my muscles started to tense up, it was like being back to how I was before addressing my anxiety and depression.

My relationship with my new colleagues deteriorated and I ended up quitting. My relationship with my girlfriend deteriorated and we finished it. My friends stopped calling. My confidence and happiness disappeared. 

The world seems cold now, I don’t feel a part of it, I don’t feel connected to anyone and feel like everyone is a threat.

I have no desire to make friends, although I know deep down that’s what I want.

I feel angry, dead inside, self loathing, bitter and frustrated and just want to wake up feeling stable, hopeful and with self love again.

I try everyday, I’m back at my old job where things were going well, yet my old friends/collègues don’t really interact with me anymore. I’m treated like an outsider, maybe because they can see how depressed I am, even though I try to hide it. 

I don’t know what else to do really,  I’m on antidepressants and exercise etc, but all I want to do is curl up and wake up 6 months ago when my mental health was good",1678995412.0

I'm experiencing really traumatic, fatal situations every night and it's making me super stressed and feeling not well rested during the day. For example, one night I was in a fatal car accident. Another night, I was in a high rise as it was actively imploding. As a lot of you probably relate, often, I feel sleep is my only reprieve from all the tough stuff I struggle with daily.

Long story short that may seem off subject at this point is that I really recommend the show LOST. I've always loved the show, but just rewatching it recently, since healing, it's been like an entire different experience, I'm recommending it for everybody here because the whole show is about suffering, and most of the characters are dealing with trauma, or possible assumed trauma and just deep life struggles. And it shows how they connect, heal, communicate with each other. I've just never seen a show that is so closely linked to healing trauma. it's like what the show is all about.

I'm tired a lot of the time. I have a lot of headaches and sometimes 'episodes' where I'm extremely nauseous and have a bad headache, short of breath. When that happens I usually lie down in bed and put on a podcast and try to fall asleep. I have a weighted blanket that helps. 

A lot of the time I feel immense physical restlessness, I think that's the worst. I can't do anything, I can't sit still, can't focus and can't relax. Recently those times have started to spiral into more like panic/anxiety attacks where I can't catch my breath. 

I really don't know how to cope with those moments.

I live in 'care', I have my own appartement but there is a small office with staff 24/7 in the building so I can reach out for support. But they can't help me much, they're trained to do things like help me plan my day, get groceries, practical things like that. But they don't really understand what goes om when I'm feeling so physically stressed and uncomfortable and I tend to have to explain what's going on because there's often new employees, and explaining everything ends up with me being asked about my life story which is obviously not going to help me feel better.

What also doesn't help is that I've been in 'therapy' since I was a young child and I've never had proper treatment. Always just conversations that lead to nothing. I'm 21 now and still haven't had any therapy with a plan, not even CBT or something like that. Recently just any time I feel really bad I also feel like I will never get better. I know the moment will pass but I also know I will feel awful again within a few hours, or tomorrow or next week. I know that's not a helpful thought but it's starting to feel really endless.

416,'Strategic Detachment' as a survival mechanism for heroic children who survive adverse childhoods,50,11s4i5m,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11s4i5m/strategic_detachment_as_a_survival_mechanism_for/,13,"I was reading ""The Six Pillars of Self Esteem"" by Nathaniel Branden. It's an older book but pretty good. I read this part of the book and it hit close to home. I was wondering if anyone else could relate with this, and if there is a different term for this ""Strategic Detachment.""

""Strategic Detachment: Many children undergo experiences that place enormous obstacles in the way of the development of self-esteem. Everyone knows this. A child may find the world of parents and other adults incomprehensible and threatening. The self is not nurtured but attacked. The will to be conscious and efficacious is assaulted. After a number of unsuccessful attempts to understand adult policies, statements, and behavior, many children give up—and take the blame for their feelings of helplessness.

Often they sense, miserably, desperately, and inarticulately, that something is terribly wrong—with their elders, or with themselves, or with something. What they often come to feel is: “I’ll never understand other people. I’ll never be able to do what they expect of me. I don’t know what’s right or wrong, and I’m never going to know.” To persevere with the will to understand in the face of obstacles is the heroism of consciousness.

The heroic child who continues to struggle to make sense out of the world and the people in it, however, is developing a powerful source of strength, no matter what the anguish or bewilderment experienced along the way. Caught in a particularly cruel, frustrating, and irrational environment, he or she will doubtless feel alienated from many of the people in the immediately surrounding world, and legitimately so. But the child will not feel alienated from reality, will not feel, at the deepest level, incompetent to live—or at least he or she has a decent chance to avoid that fate. To persevere with the will to understand in the face of obstacles is the heroism of consciousness.

Often children who survive extremely adverse childhoods have learned a particular survival strategy. I call it “strategic detachment.” This is not the withdrawal from reality that leads to psychological disturbance, but an intuitively calibrated disengagement from noxious aspects of their family life or other aspects of their world. They somehow know, This is not all there is. They hold the belief that a better alternative exists somewhere and that someday they will find their way to it. They persevere in that idea. They somehow know Mother is not all women, Father is not all men, this family does not exhaust the possibilities of human relationships—there is life beyond this neighborhood. This does not spare them suffering in the present, but it allows them not to be destroyed by it. Their strategic detachment does not guarantee that they will never know feelings of powerlessness, but it helps them not to be stuck there.

We admire such children. But as parents we would like to offer our own children happier options.―        Nathaniel Branden"" Full book: [https://www.booksfree.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/The-Six-Pillars-of-Self-Esteem-by-Nathaniel-Branden.pdf](https://www.booksfree.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/The-Six-Pillars-of-Self-Esteem-by-Nathaniel-Branden.pdf)

This really hit home for me, I relate with it on a very deep level. When I was 5-6 years old my father became very abusive. (there's actually a dateline episode on him that i was in!) He was doing all sorts of messed up stuff and my mom thought he was gonna kill her (he went on to kill a policeman in Montana). We had to leave my half-brothers with him which saddened me; my family was shattered. around the time i turned 7 i resolved that i would grow up to be a good father and husband and make my family my #1 priority, be loyal to them and contribute to society. I had friends who had that good life, and their parents told me I was smart and could go to college and would do well in the military if i joined. I knew that I was going to have a better life than the single parent section 8 housing we had to live in because my father refused to pay support. I went to Iraq, became the first to graduate college in my family line, went to Mexico to teach English, and I moved around the US to climb my career ladder.

People tell me often that I'm very brave, However, I'm pretty sure I suffer from arrested development. I've been on psych meds since i got home from iraq in 2005. I sometimes react to things as if I were a little kid. I also give off a child vibe to kids. Children I don't know will often speak to me like I'm a fellow child, and I enjoy playgrounds with my kids like I'm a child as well.

I guess I wanted to ask if anyone can relate with this and if they've found a way to overcome this arrested development. I'll be 40 this year and i'm just trying to be the best me I can be.

I used to stay at her house a lot and help her with her kids. Oftentimes sleeping over and in the same bed as her. One night we hit talking about things and it let to talk about things of a sexual nature. She initiated touch contact and we had sex. She took my virginity with a plastic dildo. I was 14 and she was in her 40’s I thought i was in love with this person. She was also in a relationship with a much older man and asked if I would be interested in having a threesome with them. I felt that if I didn’t that she would not want to be with me anymore so I agreed. He was a man in his 50’s.

Some people have offered me vital support in dark times, and I'm deeply grateful. But those same people tend to disappear sooner or later. I haven't found anyone who stuck around continuously and indefinitely.

I (25F) have been in a long distance relationship ship with my boyfriend (26M) for two years. We dated in person for 6 months before he had to move for work. I love this man so much. He has loved me at my absolute worst and I have loved him at his. We have open communication, the sex is great, and we are committed. 

Despite everything I have mentioned sometime I this nagging feeling to text my ex who wasn't the source of my ptsd but he definitely made it worse. I was in the beginning stages of my paranoia turning into psychosis (dissasociating episodes). I didn't realize it at the time but I let him degrade, gaslight, manipulate, and have complete control over me. I was basically his doormat. One day he made a comment about how he thought I would look good with a boob job and something finally clicked. I got upset with him and told him he was an asshole. This led down a rabbit hole and in the middle of the argument he ghosted me. It felt like the end of the world as my mental health  declined further. I lost my job, apartment, and quite literally, my sanity.

Eventually I started getting proffessional help and I thought I found some closure to move on. Getting back on my feet I met my boyfriend who I  steadily began to date and fell in love with. Since I started dating my new bf I have changed my phone number but my ex still finds ways to dm me from random accounts and somehow has my new number. When my ex ""pops up"" its like everything I have built to protect myself and heal withers away and I become engulfed in panic and rage. The worst part is I know somewhere deep down I feel like I want him to validate me even if it means he berates and belittles me.

I opened up about all of this with my now boyfriend. He understands as he had a similar relationship in the past and we mutually agreed the best course of action was to ignore his calls to get my attention. It's been about a year since this decision was made but from time to time I still get his messages. 

Recently I find myself picking fights with my boyfriend and I think it's because I want him to treat me like shit. I've opened up about this with him and we are going to therapy as a couple. What he doesn't know is when he doesn't respond like an asshole to me sometimes I find him unattractive and resent him. I'm not proud of harboring this feeling, especially since we have a very transparent relationship. I completely detach and when I can feel emotion again I feel very depressed and ashamed.

Today, at 32 years old, I made my first ever dental appointment. I actually cried at the end of my phone call with the dentists office. My mom was a teenage mom and had two infants by age 18. Me and my brother. My dad was murdered a few weeks after my brother was born so my mom was alone with two children. My life from there included my grandmother who was very involved in our lives- she lived with us. My mom was very young and she had a lot of growing up to do and was rarely there for us. She ended up in an abusive relationship that my brother and I also suffered the consequences of. She later had my sister with the abuser. I have significant childhood trauma and as a result of that I have struggled to do many things for myself in my life. My mom never had health insurance for us growing up and when she did finally get it for my sister and brother, I was already 18. She never took me to a dentist and I have had lots of problems with my teeth as a result. I do forgive her and know she was a kid herself, but it does bother me that she didn’t take care of me the way she should have especially now that I have my own child. I have never told anyone that I’ve never been to the dentist as it causes me extreme shame especially because I am an adult and have been for a while. I choked up today saying it out loud to the person over the phone. She told me she was proud of me for taking that step. I am very anxious about it because I know I will probably need a lot of work done but I also know that I have to do it. And, I CAN/WILL do it.

I worked in nonprofits, did a lot of community organizing and activism, started my own business as a healer that was doing really well, lived abroad a few times, won a lot of fancy academic accolades… and then I completely fell apart last year. And I’m still recovering. 

I’ll be 30 later this year. And I can’t believe how old and burnt out I feel. I feel so sad and fatigued. and totally overwhelmed. i don’t have a job right now, and I don’t think I have it in me to get back into my healing business after this sabbatical I’ve taken. Especially when I barely have the energy to do simple tasks like make coffee sometimes, let alone help someone else in their own healing.

I think I derived so much of my self worth through external accomplishments, because academics were the only thing I had control over in my turbulent home.

Now I feel this emptiness when I try to take steps professionally. Nothing is sticking or feels fulfilling. I’ve toyed with the idea of grad school, a course in coding, etc. nothing is really lighting me up (yet). I can’t even focus on my screen long enough to update my resume.

When I look at the state of the collective right now, I’m so overwhelmed. **how do people like us that fall apart survive financially in an increasingly capitalistic, dehumanizing world?** For those of us who had passion as our driving force out of impossible circumstances, what do we do when we can’t summon the fire?

He’s my biggest support in the world and I love him dearly. He’s always been so caring about my trauma responses especially when we’re intimate. No questions asked, always goes to my care plan and takes care of me and helps me navigate the situation. Not to get too detailed but I have only rather recently gotten confirmation about actually being traumatized in a specific way by my father if you catch my drift. My fiancé used to coincidentally wear the same boxers as my father and he threw them away and bought new ones when I got triggered by them without me even having to ask. Something that has come up again in our relationship is my fiancé wanting to shave his head. He’s a young man and has a receding hair line. It’s always bothered him and he gets a lot of hate for it. He wants to shave it to help with his confidence. I am a full believer in a person expressing their style,their body and hair the way they choose. I dress very alternative and he supports me in that which I appreciate. The issue lies in the fact that my father has a shaved head, and I don’t think I will be able to be intimate with my fiancé if I even slightly associate those two things. To make things more complicated, my fiancé is a marine. We see each other in person very rarely. I want him to shave his head and help with his confidence if that’s what he wants to do. Does anyone have any advice or wisdom on this situation. I will be consulting with my therapist of course, but I thought it might be good to hear from some peers to see if anyone had dealt with a partner innocently triggering them on accident. I love my fiancé and I want to support him. I told him that if he wants to shave his head I support him and will love him no matter what. But I’m not so secretly scared about what feelings might arise within me. I want to move on with my life and not let my father keep having power over me. But of course it’s not that simple.

I don't have any friends really aside from some online friends but they barely even talk to me anyways. Also one of them recently randomly invited themselves to my place. Like bought plane tickets without planning with me or even asking if it was ok and proceeded to SA me so that's one less friend.

I haven't had a boyfriend in a long time either and the last one was in another country and was a super fucked up situation all around. Stress from that triggered my first bipolar manic episode so yayyyyy. I have decided no more long distance relationships which severely limits my pool of possible bfs.

List of reasons I don't feel good enough:
I am 100+ lbs over a healthy weight. I constantly call myself fat and ugly but don't see it changing anytime soon. Last time I tried to diet it took 8 months to lose 25 lbs and I was miserable the whole time. I also have a type and am not attracted to fat guys. I struggle with sex as it is so I really need someone I am attracted to. I know it may be vain but it is what it is

I don't really clean and since I have been working from home due to COVID I have only been showering once a week so that at least I look clean for my therapist. I never go anywhere anyways. I also only brush my teeth when I shower so ya. I leave food and trash around and due to that have litteral clouds of fruit flies that you can hear swarming in my apartment.

I also don't cook. My microwave caught on fire and my oven won't heat up and due to the mess and bug infestation I haven't gotten maintenance up here to fix it. It's been this way for months and I'm just too ashamed and feel no amount of cleaning I do will ever be good enough. Even if my appliances were in working order though I still wouldn't cook cuz my abusive single dad I lived with never taught me shit and didn't let me do shit so I don't really know how. I just get all my meals delivered.

I also hate driving. I'm 29, going to be 30 in June and just got my license last year. Driving makes me extremely anxious. I actually haven't used my car in months cuz I'm WFH and didn't have anywhere I wanted to go bad enough.My car actually needs a new battery now. I used to Uber everywhere but now that I have my own car I find myself going places less than before because I'm afraid to drive but feel I have to if I want to go anywhere now because otherwise it defeats the purpose of having a car.

Only thing I have going for me really is my career as a game developer but I don't think that is enough for people to overlook these other issues.

I am a perfectionist and have a habit of putting men I like on pedestals and thinking they deserve  the very best and so could never like me/I could never be good enough for them.

I'm not sure if I want biological children because of my genetics and because I have 0 pain tolerance but I feel like the choice is quickly being taken away from me. One of my boyfriend's I dated for five years and he not once brought up marriage so how am I supposed to find someone who will accept me, date, get married, and have a kid before I can't?

I brought up the topic of not feeling good enough to my therapist at our last session and she just said to do something that makes me feel good enough. I told her nothing I can do will and she didn't really have anything to say.

TRIGGER WARNING ⚠️ Descibe some physical abuse. 

They say we're empath/empathetic, and some folks claim it is a gift and we must cherish it. To me, it is NOT a gift. The only reason I'm impacted by the mood of others is because of the household I grew up in, with a moody parent. When they were in a good mood, all of us should be in the same mood. When they were in a bad one, all of us should be too. If they were in an even worse mood, I knew I would have a heck of a day trying to survive without having their wrath unleashed on me, because when that happened, I knew what was coming. Either I was getting a beating, or one of my siblings, and that was horrifying enough because when they would scream and cry, none of us could have done anything to stop it. So NO! It is not a gift that I'm able to read people's moods, and it is even a curse that I'm that easily impacted by them. It is not fair to me, and it is not fair to them either. People around me, including my partner, should be able to be in whatever mood they're in, without having me come in into the picture and start feeling down too, and that only makes them feel bad about it, which makes me feel even worse because who the hell am I to tell them how to feel and what mood to be in? How is it that now they're comforting me when it is supposed to be the other way around, me comforting them or even just letting them be? 

Please help, because I can't handle this anymore. I can't be this easily influenced by the mood of those around me and start acting accordingly.

Or maybe they don't?

I overthink it because I don't want to upset people, or be alienating

One example: when I moved in with a friend and a new girl, me and her were getting along and watching shows together a lot and kind of talking through them. This was usually in the evenings. I'm more quiet within the first 30 min of waking up. I told her that. Also one day we were watching things and I felt like SHIT. I told her that earlier, and reiterated that on the couch (I was curled up with heating pad, etc.) And so I was much less talkative but wasn't bothered by her usual commentary, I was just less reactive because I was tired and a little grumpy from pain (at life, not her).

I overheard her telling our other roommate that ""she doesn't know what to expect with me"" and that ""I'm a different person everyday"".

It was hurtful, and this isn't the first time I've heard this.

Ik because of trauma I have a fawn response and can be people pleasing, however I felt like I've gotten so much better, and wasn't masking, was being real by saying ""I'm quiet when I first wake up"" or ""I'm not feeling well"".  Do people maintain being bubbly and happy when they are sick? Do I maybe have DID??? (ik no one on here can answer this lol) sometimes I can also mirror when I'm anxious, again, been way better woth that. Also sometimes my ""accent"" fluctuates, but I live somewhere not where I grew up with a very different way that people say things for about 8 years, and when I hear someone with my home accent, or I get a little passionate, my home accent gets stronger is this abnormal? 

I have no idea how my personality changes, but I do know my *mood* changes quickly some days. I try to be communicative as fuck when that happens, though I do tend to shut down sometimes and verbal communication becomes very difficult. In those situations I try to express that I need some time to decompress.  Sometimes the only thing I can do is open my mouth and make a hand gesture.    I hate that, but it is what it is. I've also gotten a lot better about that! 

So has anyone else been told they have multiple personalities? What is the difference of mood and personality? I've looked it up but am still confused.  Are people just being mean? I don't always pick up on bullying. And I do become more withdrawn when triggered but I've learned a lot of skills and have been able to utilize them pretty well over the last few years or so!  Are people just hypercritical because they dont/won't understand me or am ""HI, it's me, I'm the problem it's me""?

I can also be super duper shy when I meet someone for the first time, and open up at different paces depending on how much I start to trust someone i also feel like i tell people that ""im sometimes really shy at first, but ill warm up"". Like i FEEL like i spell things out for people but still get ostracized(maybe too dramatic but feels like it!!)

I was her FP most of my life and had a lot of shit with that and with her spiral into alcoholism. My dad also used to have some anger issues and their divorce was messy af. Ny mom passed when I was a teenager. I've always thought most of my trauma stemmed from that stuff, including the fact that as a kid I would go looking for validation from older men online and would show them things I shouldn't which has a lot of trauma and guilt attached to it. Recently though, I decided to have kinky sex with a guy I was getting to know. Anytime I've had sex previously I feel like I've gotten anxious and basically just dissociated, but with this it was worse. I started crying and went between feeling like I was out of my body and being very present just wishing it would end. The guy did nothing wrong, the second I used the agreed upon word he stopped, I just honestly had those awful anxious feelings before it even started and went through with it anyway because I felt like I had to (not his fault, totally on me).

It brought up a lot of feelings, mostly guilt. Guilt that my brother is feeling bad about being in the middle (even though I told him to let me handle it and refuse her, especially because she has a whole ass husband/ my dad who is not blocked to go through, who thankfully doesn't give enough of a shit to ever try to talk to me), and that familiar guilt that maybe I'm bad for cutting her off. 

As we on this sub know, NC is not a decision made lightly and a lot of my lifelong trauma is from her. I still cry about some of the things she did to me. She had infinite chances and proved to me every time she wouldn't change. I know I made the right choice...

... but the guilt is eating me. I have a support system who will tell me I'm right and it's okay, but they love me so much and my brain is interpreting it as bias.

466,I'm not doing well and need advice,2,11sjeck,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11sjeck/im_not_doing_well_and_need_advice/,1,"I got news of my paternal grandmother's passing last Sunday and I'm at a complete loss, before I was doing terribly, I was struggling a lot with depression anxiety cptsd and anger and now I have another light in my life snuffed out as if I haven't suffered enough. I'm just so tired, I've lost everything good in my life, usually whenever something like this happens I make another suicide attempt but every attempt I've made has failed so I stopped since all that would happen is I'd be in immeasurable pain but for some reason I just would not die no matter how hard I tried or what method I did, I'm so tired of living like this, I'm absolutely miserable but I know I can't use death as a way to escape, I don't have anyone I'm close to to talk to, I don't have any form of comfort, I've been thinking of buying a sword and cuddling it because the only time I ever feel safe is when I have a weapon with me because nobody was ever there for me nobody stood between me and my abusers fits of rage so I had to learn to defend myself and being smaller and weaker than others since I was a preterm baby weapons became an equalizer since it didn't matter how big and tough someone was compared to me weapons didn't care so weapons became a comfort object for me. And another thing is I have haphephobia or the fear of being touched, after my parents made me strip down ass naked as my father beat me to a pulp I eventually grew to loathe any kind of physical contact that came from others even if it was a high five or a handshake the thought of someone touching me made me feel a mixture of fear anger and disgust and I hate it, I see everyone with romantic partners and I both crave it but I'm also repulsed by it, I want to be loved by another and held but I'm afraid of being hurt by someone I thought I could trust and be open with and the only ""relationship"" I've ever been in was when I was being forced to date I girl because a guy who was a creep and a pervert shipped me and the girl for some reason and the guy even wrote fake letters to me pretending to be the girl but one of my friends who had the guy in his classes when he was in middle school told me that the hand writing was the guy's and not the girls, and after about 3 to 4 months of this I broke up with the girl saying that I didn't have any romantic feelings for her but had no problems with being friends if she doesn't mind and we could just put all the weirdness behind us which she agreed but for some reason after I broke up with her I started feeling like I was being an asshole despite both of us agreeing to just be friends, after everything was sorted out the guy still tried making me date the girl but I've already been through enough of his nonsense and I've already got out of the whole mess and I was in no mood to go back into it so I stopped interacting with the guy all together. Also in middle school there was a girl who was honestly very kind and caring towards me and even whenever I went into a depressive episode she stayed by my side through it even when I had no idea what depression was since nobody ever taught anything about mental health in school, she never asked anything out of me for her help, she never put her hands on me, she never verbally assaulted me or called me slurs because of my autism, and I think I might have developed a crush on her but I'm not sure since I've never been taught about feelings and would like someone's thoughts, these were the typical feelings that I had (I loved her smile, I loved hearing her laugh, I really enjoyed spending time with her even if it was just talking, I enjoyed that we had a lot in common, and when we were at the graduation ceremony I got dressed in some dress clothes that I wore to plenty of funerals and she was wearing a dress and all I could think about was how great she looked in the dress.) And ever since I went into high school it felt like something was missing or like there was a hole inside me and I didn't understand it. And now I feel so alone, I feel like I have nothing to live for or give myself to, I don't have any dreams because I was never allowed any form of individually and I had to do what my parents wanted me to do even if it made me miserable, I have no goals in life besides just survive, I don't know who I am beyond my trauma, I feel like I have no identity beyond angry bitter and broken, I just want to be fixed, I just want to be happy, I just want peace and quiet, I'm tired of being angry all the time, I don't know if I could go on like this because this isn't living this is is just torture, breaking someone down to nothing over and over again until there's nothing left to break.",1678938803.0

I've developed auditory sensitivity from the events, and barely remember anything about the child abuse one. When I think or feel like I'm in the same events again, I panic. This morning with my therapist she showed me a drawing I did of the abuser when I was 6 and I threw up in my mouth. Not only can I not hide from it during the day, I can't even hide at night! The nightmares are TERRIBLE. I get the memories just from being in bed since the abuse was there and at night.

But it's strange to me, I absolutely KNOW that I have PTSD from the incident when I was 4, but I also do with the other incidents. So when someone asks me ""Hey, which one gave you PTSD?"" I don't know if I go like ""uhhh, just all of them?"". It's annoying and confusing. 

The main reason why I don't want to bring it up with my therapist though is I don't want her to think that I'm faking it.

He came back and everyday he said he would always be there and I accepted him and was ready to move in with him. He said he never meant those things when he saw I was serious and I was having severe meltdown from medication (for multiple chemical sensitivities) he knew I was having bad side affects from and he new the doctors wanted me to continue it even though I begged them to take me off it (hallucinated I lost a husband and child while on it. I cried every night for them and a lot of other hallucinations). That's also when the none epilepic seizures started. He called me crazy, schizophrenic when I asked him if he would consider marrying me. I couldn't help it it help like I physically couldn't stop myself from asking and he immediately blocked me so I could never contact him. I believed it was my fault for thinking he was seriously interested in him that I made up all the times we were apart and he said he wished I was there with him. That while he were on break he dated someone but he said he wished it was me. That I encouraged him to go slow in our relationship. I thought I made it all up. I couldn't believe I got the wrong message when he said he never meant those things. I blamed myself for everything for years.

I hate how I posses things. It feels as if it's all happening again and I don't know how I should react to it until it hurts too much causing it to spill out, even if it's normal things.

My sister and I grew up in a strict, authoritative, deeply religious household where we were pitted against each other, and unfortunately, my sister took part in my abuse, and we no longer speak.

TW: S.A. AND POTENTIAL AB\*SE

This is not my main account. I’m just using it for privacy.

I never really lacked anything as a child. I went to school, lived with my family, and we went on vacations several times during my childhood. However, my family was incredibly dysfunctional.

My parents divorced when I was maybe 3. I can’t remember how old I was, and tbh, I can barely even remember them being together. However, I do have a few distant and faded memories of going places with both my parents, and even one of waking up in between both of them as they slept. But my father was an alcoholic, and physically abused my mother in front of me, to the point of her needing medical help. I don’t remember this happening, despite being there, but it did.

Around the same time--maybe some time later--I was seeing what I later in life realized was a therapist for children. I would go, and sit in the room full of toys, often accompanied by my mother, and the therapist would have me look at flash cards or ask about things. This continued for a little while, and I think I was four by the time I stopped seeing her.

We had moved, as well, around this time. My mom’s bf was living with us now. I was too young to really understand why. I don’t have a whole lot of clear memories from around this time, but I do remember, several times, being really really upset or angry and screaming, and then being locked in the bathroom, sometimes with the lights off. I’d of course scream and beat the door--I think most kids would. Later on I would be told about my “really bad tantrums”, and how I was so uncontrollable that my mom’s bf had locked me in the bathroom. My mother would also frequently spank me, sometimes even with my pants down.

I hated that man. I don’t know what triggered it but I didn’t like him. He was my first bully. He would call me the same names and say the same things as the mean kids at school would. It would of course make me freak out at him, being a kid. But he was always, always in the right, somehow. According to my mom I was just supposed to ignore him. In my view, my now stepdad had stolen her from me.

Life at school hadn’t been easy either. I was now in grade school, and I wasn’t understanding assignments. I would cry every day before school, say things about how I was stupid and couldn’t learn, until I was pulled out and sent to a different school. A smaller one.

I didn’t enjoy school. Every day, when I got into the car, I’d cry, or else be upset. I didn’t always know why at the time. This is important for later, I promise.

Over time, I developed extremely bad social anxiety. I would be completely unable to go in public--really, beyond my own front yard--and be comfortable with it. I was put in therapy for it, which my stepdad started to make fun of. Things were awful for me around that time--I didn’t even eat before leaving the house, because my anxiety would quite literally make me sick, and embarrass me, which in turn triggered more anxiety.

I was also being S-A’d by my mom’s husband around this point. He’d teach me how to do things, and I’d do them despite sometimes crying. This eventually led to him taking my virginity when I had just recently turned 15--I had sent photos to a boy, and mentioned to him that I had put a hair brush up myself. My parents found the texts and I got in huge trouble. My stepdad decided that would be the time, since in his words, the hair brush had already taken it. This continued for years.

During a fight with my mother in my late teens, she basically blurted out that I had Asperger’s syndrome. I was shocked. I think I cried but I don’t remember to be perfectly honest. It turns out, the therapist I had seen as a toddler diagnosed me. I felt betrayed and horrified. But both she and my stepdad insist that this was to “protect” me.

I wasn’t protected. I wasn’t made to “think less of myself” as they claimed they wanted me not to do. I lived with my bully and my abuser. I felt like something was wrong with me, even asking a few times if I was autistic and being told I wasn’t. Even typing all this out makes me want to punch my screen, I am so angry. The “horrible tantrums” that made me get locked in the bathroom. The fact that I was “weird”, or “annoying”, or “overreacted” to things, or “obsessed” with certain things, or the fact that I was always “screaming” in the car after school. How “spoiled” I was as a child--after all, why else would I have “tantrums”? I’ve been doing more research lately and I realize that all the supposed flaws I had as a child were autistic traits. It’s no wonder I have confidence issues. No wonder I developed anxiety and depression. No wonder I probably have PTSD.

I’m sorry. I am just so, so, so, angry. I’m grieving the fact that I grew up without a crucial piece of info about myself. I always thought something was off. Would things have been better if I knew? I really think so. But now I’m in my early 20s and I feel like I’m starting from scratch.",1678907018.0

My roommates cat loves me dearly and always either wants to be purring on my lap, or within 5 feet of me no matter what I’m doing. I love him dearly. I don’t want to sound ungrateful but especially on days where he’s been in my lap all day multiple days or i’ve had a long day and he won’t leave me alone, I find myself very briefly getting angry at him sometimes for how affectionate he is. I’d never hurt him and when I do find myself getting angry, I usually just let it pass (it passes quickly as it comes) and if i find i’m overstimulated I just take him off my lap and put him on his bed. 

But he’s revealed a weird trigger that id love others insight on; feeling that he loves me too much. 

I’ve had this issue before of getting a very brief but intense anger towards people that have had crushes on me in the past. I don’t think I feel the same way anymore, but I remember telling a friend that “they (the crushes) should have a better taste in people.” 

Idk what the point of this rant/question is. I’m getting into better relationships now where I feel respected and liked and there’s even the possibility of a romantic relationship soon. I have good chemistry with this person, we’ve both stated our boundaries and feel comfortable pursuing a relationship out of friendship,so literally the only thing that’s left is for me to initiate it, which I don’t know if I can do tbh. 

I have friends and loved ones who love me and openly express it. I’ve worked hard to make a community around me and it feels like the only part of it that refuses to budge or move or adapt or be open at this point is me.

I know it’s trauma related and I want to be able to meet the people that love me at the point their at and be willing to be vulnerable but I feel stuck (and sometimes mad). I don’t know where to go from here.

There were a lot of yellow flags with my older sister but I tried once again to voice what she was doing that was bothering me and getting in the way of us connecting. We’ve not been in contact for close to 2 years and I’ve been trying to recreate some kind of connection. It’s the same thing with my parents, I also had to go low to no contact. 
Now instead of getting back to me and trying to communicate: “oh i’m sorry you felt that way that wasn’t my intention, etc” she has decided to ignore me. I can only take this as she isn’t aware of what is going on, is aware and doesn’t know how to respond, or is aware and isn’t able to face it and respond. 
Either way there were also other yellow flags that means this relationship goes to rest too. 
Nobody seems to pull through so there goes my family. Just like that there is no family anymore. 
Every couple months can’t help but try again, you know, in hopes that connection with empathy and emotional awareness is possible. But each time is disappointed.

I'm chronically late. I talk without comma. When I talk, I jump between topics and my college papers make little sense. I overthink stuff and miss the forest for the trees. Just eccentric bad habits that need a little discipline. A little structure. Some boxes, some alarms and some routine...right?

It sounds like such an excuse. But I'm starting to realize that those ""bad quirks"" could be worse than imagined. 

*Why I come late?*: I have no concept of time, because I was only taught to do stuff to avoid direct pain and suffering. Hence I don't have a feeling of hurry until I am threatened by e.g. getting hurt, kicked, losing money. *Why I make little sense?:* I have executive dysfunction. Too often I literally can't ""see"" the structure until someone else points it out. It all makes somewhat sense in my own head.

As time goes by, I start to realize that I might need extra help. Tools & people to work as my crutches. Someone that regularly re-reads my papers, to point out inconsistencies/wrong citings. Something that ""tricks"" me into being on time. 

But no one believes me. My issue with structure nearly got me kicked from college. They thought I was cheating, because I didn't cite a very tricky source correctly. This was my first ever scientific paper -I only escaped due to that. When I asked for help afterwards, everyone just gave me theoretical seminars, and courses. Except: I KNOW how it's done in theory! I just have trouble putting it into practice! I'm getting lost in my own head! I can't ""practice"" my issues away! I try to practice it away since I was a kid!

They think I'm just making excuses. That I'm lazy. That I don't care about people's time, or just ""aren't made for college then"", even though I am smart and could tell you enough about the topic on hand.

And because I'm a ""low support needs"" autistic, I'm not going to get any official help, most likely.

Even my therapist said ""this is most likely something people just need to accept about you.""

So, my ex and I broke up about a year ago. We are still quite close, and he’s the only one I feel safe going to with my SH and suicidal ideation (besides my therapist).

Context: I am diagnosed with ADHD and cyclothymia and have a history of childhood emotional abandonment. My ex was with me and supported me when my mom died, when my childhood home was destroyed and when I was at my lowest and made an attempt. He represents so much to me, being the first person to really stand by my side through mood swings/grief/general unpleasantness and the only one I’ve been truly vulnerable with. When we were together I spent most of my time at his place because I couldn’t be alone and needed to have some nearby to talk to and hold me.

He has a new girlfriend now and I think she’s great (yes, I deal with feeling jealous, but that’s a me issue). They’re moving in together soon, which, cognitively, I think is great for him. But that also means he will no longer live in the apartment that became a safe space for me to heal. I feel like I’m losing a significant source of physical safety (the apartment) as well as officially losing emotional support from 
 my friend as he takes this next step.

Further, he recently told me he can’t continue to hang out with me if I’m so consistently emotionally charged. I feel him pulling away and sense that he’s tired of me and puts up with me now out of a sense of duty or something… He says that I am one of his closest friends, but whenever we see each other, he ends up ignoring me to text his girlfriend or invites her over and ignores me to talk with her. 

I just feel… so alone and confused. While my friendship with me ex is hard (and I know many people would say it’s not worth the emotional pain), he is also the only person I have nearby who is emotionally safe to me. 

I also feel so so so embarrassed and ashamed that I’m now essentially this ex girlfriend who can’t let go and is begging for scraps of affection. I feel sick about how I react when my abandonment issues are triggered. I hate what the past several years have caused me to become.

How do I let go? Is it even possible to maintain a friendship with my ex? We did no-contact at the beginning of the break up but eventually reconnected because I don’t have a consistent close-by support system. I’m just so tired :(",1678909410.0

Like I'm experiencing both at the same time, like I can almost see it out of the corner of my eye. 

It's really hard to explain. The who I was (and the socioeconomic situation I was in) vs the who I am are worlds apart. 

And my mom especially was extremely bitter toward anyone who was more privileged than us, but always couched it in morality. Like it was immoral to go out to eat or own a house or get clothes that weren't from Dollar Tree. And that poor people like us weren't allowed in nice spaces. She made it very clear I wasn't even to go into the restaurants across the street (at the time it was a local pizza place and a cafe) because we couldn't afford anything there and anyone who bought food there was selfish and wasteful.

In my extended family, there's a lot of people who go over the top. But the ones that were most adamant about this were huge narcissists and bullies. The rest were trying to avoid abuse, but there was a general lack of empathy a lot of the time.

Sorry if it's hard to read I'm on my phone and my mind is all over the place

About 8 months ago my ex broke up with me while I was visiting my family because I told him how I felt unappreciated. It was a tough break up because it was my longest relationship, even tho it was toxic as hell and I was relieved he dumped me, I was still crushed. Every few months he tries to message me and get back together under the guise of being friends but I know him and what he means. Every time he messages me I have a panic attack and get really scared that he will show up to my house. I never really knew why I got so worked up whenever he would try to reach out, I had some ideas but I thought they were irrational. 
Today in my therapy session I told her about him reaching out and how I react whenever it happens, she was confused because I never talked about him even while we were dating. After our break up I brought up bits of what our relationship was like but never went into details. Today I brought up the thing I thought was the reason I have panic attacks when he reaches out. He's made 4 different Facebook accounts to message me because I block him every time he messages me. After his recent attempt I went through every single account with his name and blocked it, even it had no pictures or it was old.
When we were together if he wanted to have sex he would touch me, rub against me and kiss me when I wasn't in the mood. If I'd say not now or no, he would ignore it and keep going until I'd give in to get him to stop. He'd try to guilt trip me by saying it's been so long since we had sex or please I'm so uncomfortable can you play with it. 
Sometimes I'd get really angry at him and sternly say no and ignore him for the rest of the day. Sometimes this worked, other times he'd keep going until I gave in. I didn't do this every time because I was scared of an argument happening, he has bad anger issues and I was worried he'd hit me. He raised his hand to me one time when he was drunk because he didn't like something I said, so I know that he would hit me if he was mad/drunk enough. He would ""playfully"" slap me to get me to hit him back and to wrestle, there were a few times he slapped me too hard and I'd full on smack him back. He knew about my trauma, attachment issues and how sensitive I am and he used it against me. He knew how lonely and desperate for love I was and love bombed me to trap me, making sure that I wouldn't leave. Abusing my caring nature and my instincts to protect for his own disgusting, greedy purposes.
After I told my therapist this she told me that what he did was assault. I don't know why but hearing someone else confirm what I was scared of being true was relieving but it also ruined my day. Now all I can think about is all of the times that I gave in and let him do whatever, how I'd just lay there letting my mind wander and hoping he'd be done soon. I feel like shit thinking back to how complacent I was and how I let him take advantage of me while I was in a vulnerable state. 
I haven't self harmed in months, almost a year, but this is the closest I've felt to relapsing. Thinking about all of the things he's done and I've put up with makes me want to shed my skin and rot in a hole. The only good thing that came from this was I now understand why I react the way I do with physical contact since the relationship and the panic I feel when he tries to contact me.",1678929237.0

I really thought I had my CPTSD symptoms under control. I was on and off Prozac for a while and it miraculously got rid of a lot of my flashbacks and intrusive thoughts. They used to be a constant, but they were exacerbated by both my ovulation and my period start. Recently, these symptoms have come back but first only when I ovulated. Now I have them again about 4 days leading up to ovulation and about 4 days before my period. So I’m struggling really badly for at least ~10 days a month. Around my ovulation I am more angry/ high energy and anxious and around my period I am more depressed/ low energy and anxious. 

My thing is that Prozac gave me terrible trembling and headaches even at low doses, and a lot of birth controls (especially depo) I have tried have actually made me feel even more unstable plus they have given me acne. Has anyone had this experience with their menstrual cycle and perhaps had some success with a certain medication specifically for PMDD?

She's 26 and married and her and her spouse make good money so I'm not really worried about that part. But I know just from myself talking about getting therapy for the abuse and my other mental health problems with her that she hasn't processed any of it yet for herself and still downplays the abuse our parents put us through.  

It also doesn't help that everyone else in our family either downplays the abuse or is in denial about it still and she spends more time around our family still than I do.  I am pretty much low contact with all of them except her and she still visits them on a regular basis.  

It also worries me that for a long time she didn't want children like me and she married her spouse knowing he wanted kids and she still got married to him knowing that.  I know people can change their minds on having kids but I don't know it just feels like her husband might have pressured her at least a little because before this year she felt very strongly about not having kids like me and it was something we bonded over together.  

 I am still baffled that wasn't a deal breaker for her but she's is her own person and can make decisions for herself. Our Mom died when we were both young teens and we didn't have any women role models to turn to after she died so this might have affected both of us differently when navigating adult life as a woman.  

I knew this was coming but I have ADHD and I guess tuned it out or forgot after she got married in 2021 and I wasn't on medication for it yet so when she texted me the pregnancy ultrasound pics I was surprised all over again. 

I feel extremely selfish for being so worried about her having a child but I think it all comes down to I just don't want her to repeat the abuse cycle our parents did and cause trauma to her future child.  I am afraid that I will not be able to sit back and freeze it out like I did as a child and might damage my relationship with my sister defending her child from potential abuse from either her or her spouse or anybody else really.

Does anyone relate?",3,11s0fn2,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11s0fn2/when_i_dissociate_alot_different_moods_almost/,4,"Hey. So I have childhood cptsd and adult retraumatization.

Since I started dissociating alot again, I noticed that I was living in very different ""moods"" throughout the day. I feel and act very differently depending on if I am scared, being silly or flirty or having fun, and just regular me trying to get things done.

I feel like there is one central me that is kind of neutral that wrangles all of my other moods. Like control center. When I get in other moods, I feel differently about things, and I sometimes communicate differently with people- I assume because each mood has its own needs that it is trying to meet. Sometimes I get lost in moods but they're generally an overarching feeling I get while command center is still cutting in, sternly in control. It is concerned with things that need done, completely removed from emotion. I noticed it can do positive or negative things depending on if I am working to meet my egos needs or my needs. This control center is what sticks around and fixes things when I have to dissociate out really hard. Also, i use weed and delta in high amounts 24/7 which I imagine is a huge contibutor..   I have to use such high amount that i am falling over before control center calms its sternness.

I get really afraid of my moods because the bad ones are just misery and agony and all encompassing. If I know I'm going to have a bad day, I'm not afraid of the thing I have to go through. I know I can dissociate enough to survive it. I worry about the moods I have afterward- hours of anger, fear, confusion, and urges to self delete.

I noticed this recently because I started communicating with a couple of people throughout all states, which is something I usually don't do- I only socialize in certain states. Since talking with people consistently, I realize how much of a goddamn mess I am and how quickly I switch between states. Sometimes I can be messaging someone and the tinent and tone of the message can change between sentences. 

I got really high a few nights ago and that stern control center voice was having me do some things I needed to. Then there was another part of me that was like begging against it that it didn't want to, but the other won out and I continued to do the thing, even though I genuinely didn't want to and was telling myself no. I was on ALOT of drugs that night but I assume it exacerbated the theme.

I use drugs to shift in and out of good states which makes the problem much worse and I'm working on that.

I understand I need to integrate my states and that this is likely fragmentation from disccoiating from my retraumatization. I was probably a few years off in early abuse from having DID because this almost sounds like alters. It's weird. 

Does anyone else relate? What does this sound like?

My friends and family get frustrated with Me because they don't understand I have so much going on within my head and when I am not functional enough they seem frustrated because they only see face value and not the literal hours it takes me to regulate bad moods daily and to shift out of them. They see it as me lazy, or not putting in much effort. I don't know how to verbalize to them what is happening inside me. How do you help your friends and family understand what is happening to you, and why you often act differently? Or alternatively what to do when you choose to instead isolate and then they are upset that you haven't been there for them.

Recently I was in an emotionally abusive marriage and was gaslight several times daily and it has fucked me so hard. I have just like different layers to my mind and on a daily basis I'm working within them and through them and they even sometimes seem to have different ideas or feelings about things so it's confusing.

Because of this, I just have an incredibly hard time understanding that I deserve \*anything\* good. I am constantly paranoid that my friends are only interacting with me out of pity, because I can't understand why anyone would choose to be my friend. 

Today, this was really triggered because I posted something on social media about how I am graduating in May with my Master's degree. That post resulted in several of my friends telling me how they want to crowdfund to help me pay for my Graduation Regalia and want to come support me at my graduation. I don't know how to deal with this. I am so grateful to have such generous and amazing people in my life, but I cannot help but feel like I do not deserve them. I love my friends so much. They are my chosen family and have been there for me through the hardest moments of my life, but I know that this shame I experience impacts my relationships. 

I know that it is probably incredibly annoying to have to keep assuring me that I am not annoying them, or deal with my anxiety and occasionally self-destructive behavior and I think that sucks because they shouldn't have to put up with that. I was to be a better friend to them and I don't know if that is something I can do if I continue to harbor this much shame and self-hatred.",1678838418.0

Around july time last year i started getting flashbacks to childhood trauma i'd surpressed the details of for 20 years. I was off work for 3 months while i was dealing with the flashbacks/dissociation. I've been panicky and jumping a lot at loud noises and being touched typical PTSD symptoms, i did get a diagnosis from the mental health team.

Towards the end of last year i also starting a dating profile because im 32 and want to find someone to share life with. I've had a few first dates, most recently one on sunday and i felt a bit like a lovesick teenager which scares me tbh. Am i even ready for this stuff? He was far more affectionate than i am. My body was confused because it was nice but also seemed not to want being touched. Its not that my body doesn't find him attractive because it did. Maybe i'm just over thinking things.

I do have a therapist which i will discuss this with aswell but how do you all deal with this?",1678877638.0
542,I had a thought about gender norms and expectations in romantic relationships yesterday,4,11rx18j,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11rx18j/i_had_a_thought_about_gender_norms_and/,1,"Maybe one of the reasons women are so known for demanding to be made to feel special (nice dates, extravagant proposals, expensive jewelry, Valentine’s Day treatment, etc.) is because girls are so commonly parentified that by the time they get older they are subconsciously desperate for the love they didn’t know they didn’t feel as a child.

I was going through some crap yesterday and this thought hit me hard and I was like ""woah."" What do you think? 

\_\_\_\_\_

(In case you're curious, context: My partner of 5 years and I are used to being together basically all the time, we were in college together and were both taking most classes from home, but we graduated last year and he got a ""real job"" in January and I am struggling with the transition into him being unavailable for so many hours every day. Then by the time he gets home from work, he's so tired that he doesn't remember any of the conversations we have during the evenings after work, so this keeps happening: I say something about something I already told him about. He says ""Oh that's the first I heard about it."" ""No, I sent you a message about it and I told you in person later."" His response is usually either ""I don't think you did"" or ""oh, I don't remember."" And it happens with important things: My first doctor appointment with my new doctor in our new city (we moved and I have a lot of unaddressed health problems), we JUST moved a second time like 2 weeks ago so stuff I've told him about like internet hookup, rules of the new community, etc. It's like his exhaustion from working has stolen my best friend from me. 

And now he is on his first work trip. I dropped him off at the airport yesterday, and he will be gone for 4 days. I am NOT handling it well. I feel like a child that needs a parent to take care of them. Now that he's gone, it's never felt so obvious that I have no idea how to love myself, and that when I'm NOT alone, I am totally disconnected from my own needs and desires because it's so much more important for me to be tuned into other people's desires and prioritize them over my own. I am AFAB but agender and I am very much not the type of person that wants a bunch of special treatment in relationships, but yesterday I found myself suddenly out of the blue wanting him to stay in his hotel room and talk to me instead of going out to dinner with his coworkers (which I didn't ask him to do because I know that's not good) and at the same time I want to just give him ""the silent treatment"" because I want him to bend over backwards to try to make me happy again (which I also am not going to do because I am not my mom). 

I know this isn't me, but it's just become so painfully obvious how much I'm hurting and I didn't even know it.)",1678888299.0

But we didn't. Under no circumstances did we deserve it. YOU didn't deserve it.

I was bullied throughout middle school and no one had my back. No one defended me as I was insulted, ridiculed, and harassed for years on end. 

I had friends, but I didn't have anyone I could depend on. I felt so alone throughout that time of my life. All I had was my music. I was fortunate enough to have been able to escape to home school and the Covid Pandemic.

Then, I had been sexually assaulted during my freshmen year by an older family member. At first, my mom cared, but now she's tired of my ""being depressed."" She said I have no reason to constantly feel the way I do. That it's over and I have no reason to feel like that.

I met a guy in my post-sophomore year and I thought he would understand. Nope. More pain. He used me sexually, ghosted me afterward, and would also ridicule me, making it very clear that I was not wanted, that I was an annoying, unfortunate burden that he wanted to be rid of. More pain there. Another wound opened, atop the old one of my bullying. I feel so much pressure. I thought I had someone who could understand me, but I was made to feel less than.

Now my junior year. I felt so alone. All I have is my schoolwork. I have friends, but I'm never invited anywhere. I spend most of my days in my room rotting on my phone while other people my age are bonding, having fun, and laughing. 

Now my senior year. Everything is largely the same. I'm a straight-A student, I'm taking hard classes, am in honors groups. I'm loud and confident, but deep down, all I feel is constant hatred and disgust for this facade that I'm placating. I feel so hurt deep down, all the time.",1678893863.0

It’s frustrating because I feel justified in being upset about the most recent things that happened. First thing: last week my coworker (J) yelled at me. Some context, one coworker (B) emailed me about a client he wanted paperwork for. I cant do the paperwork he was asking me about because 1) I don’t do those and 2) the client needed their intake done. J told me to direct him to another coworker of ours (A), who does them. I directed him to (A) who does them. A emailed me asking about scheduling the client for an intake session. And I emailed her back saying one was already scheduled and asked if she wanted it done sooner. J (who’d spent a lot of time getting the client scheduled), came to my office and proceeded to open my door and yell at me to not email A. I was on the phone with someone and in a meeting so not only was her response super rude but unprofessional and disrespectful. I respect why she was angry but that gives her no right to yell at me. Especially when I was on the phone with a client who fucking heard her yelling at me. I’ve since talked to my supervisor about it who said she would talk to J. I believe she has but I’ve never heard an apology from J, I don’t trust that I will, and I have to keep working like nothing happened. This is the second time she’s been disrespectful to me and when I tried to talk to her about the first time, before I even opened my mouth she immediately said that what she did wasn’t disrespectful. Which tells me she knows it was. Again, no apology. I’m mad at her because I know I don’t deserve to be talked to like that. I’m mad at myself for not being more assertive when that happens and I’m hurt because J and I are supposed to be friends. I normally get along with her and it hurts that she just does this and never thinks it’s wrong. 

Second thing, last night when I was at one of my game nights (I go to two), one of my friends tried to fucking make out with me. We were venting to each other because I’d been triggered that night. We were walking to our cars and normally when we greet each other or say good bye we do a side hug. I thought we were doing that but he fucking leaned in and kissed me on the mouth twice. One of which he tried to use tongue. It was super ducking uncomfortable. He was like “you know you’re my special girl”. I still cringe at that. I don’t like him that way. I’ve never liked him that way. He’s about 20 years older than I am and I know he has social delays but that’s no excuse. I had to sit in my car and cry because last month was shitty and I’m trying really hard to better myself and get my emotions under control. Game night is one of the few ways I’ve been trying to stay out of the house so I’m not isolated and now that’s awkward. Ive been SA’d before and it brought that back. I’ve at least been able to message him to never do that again and set a boundary. He messaged back an apology and said he got carried away but I’m not up for talking to him right now. I hate carrying all of this. I hate carrying shit from my past too. I don’t know how to let it go. My negative emotions cause me physical pain and discomfort. They’re difficult to ignore even when I want to and genuinely try.",1678901952.0

I went through the resource library this morning and many of the tools there have been familiar friends to me over the last two years. I wanted to share a couple more I've found in my travels that I can honestly say have REALLY helped me out of some of the worst trauma fogs.

[https://www.youtube.com/@TimFletcher](https://www.youtube.com/@TimFletcher)

Tim is a counselor at an addiction treatment facility in Ontario. He has literally an entire library documenting the complex trauma recovery process and how it plays in to the addiction model. All the pitfalls a recovering addict has to deal with during and post recovery. 

His video series is broken down into a deep dive into the individual components that make up trauma and he does a live stream very Friday night that I rarely miss and if I do I watch the repeat of it later. At the end of each session, he addresses the topic for the night from a ""christian/biblical"" perspective. Please, please, please don't let that element dissuade you from taking in his wisdom. His knowledge of the topic has been invaluable to me and has been a key component of my recovery process. My trauma informed therapist gave him a two thumbs up when I shared the site with her. In her words, ""he gets it"". My therapist doesn't suffer bullshit lightly. 

Another recommendation from my therapist was this book. A key component of trauma is shame and this book gets to the heart of that shame and how to move through it whilst being compassionate towards yourself

**Self Compassion, ""The proven power of being kind to yourself."" Kristen Neff**. I'd include the link to the book but its about a mile long. You can also find numerous talks of Kristen's on youtube. 

This audiobook changed my relationship with myself in ways I could go on about for days. Some may have heard of Brene Brown from her TED talks on vulnerability, something for which many of us as survivors long for. This has been a huge part of my recovery process and I've listened to it multiple times and I still go back to it regularly for it's wisdom.

I’ve had more time to work through mine, he’s fresh out of it.
My friends are pretty unsupportive, demonizing him for his trauma reactions while just brushing mine under the rug. It’s unfair and why would I leave someone for struggling with trauma when I have trauma myself? 

He fears intimacy and sometimes can act hot/cold, sometimes wants to push me away and run. 

Lately we went through a break because he cut off all contact with his toxic ex once and for all, and then he felt like he “couldn’t” be with me but we got to the root of it that he was afraid due to trauma, trauma that was freshly brought to the surface by his ex trying to re-insert herself into his life. The break is over and we are committed to working through it together (in terms of the relationship, he will still have to work on his personal trauma separately too)

He has been experiencing a lot of mixed feelings about being in a relationship, but also a lot of mixed feelings about not being with me. All the mixed feelings about being with me have boiled down to fear & trauma about the future because he simultaneously loves being with me and is happy, but is terrified of “what if” scenarios of our relationship becoming like his abusive one. I experienced the same fears in the beginning but pushed myself to face those fears, and now he’s doing the same. 

I have been patient with him and loving, while also not coddling him, and told him he has nothing to be afraid of and also told him I’m also afraid. 
I want to give him the space he needs when he needs it but also he wary of when it’s gotten to an unproductive point for us.
I haven’t wanted to coddle him but I also feel like I’m balancing a fine line of potentially making him feel worse about stuff and spiraling. 
I want to be sure I navigate this correctly/well for him as my partner, but also me as I have my own trauma so I have to retain my own boundaries. 

Any advice? I know reassurance personally helps me, and has seemed to help him, but I wonder if there’s other things I can do when he’s actively struggling with a trauma reaction that doesn’t equate to me doing all the processing for him.",1678899795.0

If you don’t want to read the below (my experience) I’d love to know if this is common with CPTSD and f you’ve found anything that helps.

I (26F) grew up in a childhood that was extremely chaotic due to my mom’s behavior (BPD) and my angry dad’s alcoholism and witnessed domestic violence a few times. When we got older she divorced him and then married someone else who was bad in different ways. A more secretive alcoholic, was very manipulative and of course became mildly physically abusive to my mom too. 

Anyway, I’ve always had this desire for someone to *change* for me to show me I’m worthy. I’m not sure if it’s because I’ve always so desperately wanted to have a healthy relationship with my mom, but I’ll never have it and she won’t ever change. If doesn’t help that my mom’s behavior hasn’t really changed while I’m an adult so it all has really compounded.

I know for a fact this  definitely influenced my relationships. I picked someone who ended up being a liar and cheated on me. I found out about a year ago. There was mild emotional abuse similar to the way my mom did, mostly gaslighting. Overall I have this huge sense of loneliness, being an outsider to all of my friends living their lives while they’re young. I isolate myself and busy myself excessively so I don’t think about how I’m not good enough for anyone. I feel like I have so much baggage that I constantly think “if one more thing happens…” The worst part is that I’ve been in therapy for almost 10 years and have tried many meds. I don’t actually know what to do but I feel very alone with this.

Just walking around carrying this sense of shame. It almost feels like I’m holding a sign saying “I’m worthless!” but hoping no one notices. The pretending to function well all while being passively suicidal and getting triggered at least once a day.

There is usually a spoon my partner uses to measure out ingredients that sits in a little mug. It isn't special, the same as all of our other spoons. He keeps it there so he doesn't have to wash a new spoon every time he makes coffee. He gets annoyed if I take it to clean and don't replace it, he also thinks I wash it too much (every two or three days).

It's such a stupid little thing, but I  my partner came out and saw me making coffee. I misplaced the spoon I was planning on using and was looking for it, then he said something sarcastically about it. It's frustrating that I can't remember now exactly, but it offended me a lot. Something like ""That's what happens when you don't do it right"". I can't recall now. I'm terrified I'm projecting.

I told him that I didn't like how the first thing out of his mouth to me in the morning was sarcastic and passive-aggressive. He seemed to think that what he said was fine, but apologized anyway since I was offended. I did too, in case I'm being overly sensitive. 

But am I wrong? Isn't hurtful when a partner is passive-aggressive? Is saying something like that supposed to be hurtful?  How do I tell if it's real or if I'm projecting some past thing onto them?",1678896159.0

But I'm so full of ennui. I've had it since I left my parents home. Just.... Chronic boredom. Every new job I start is exciting at first and I get bored and depressed within two months. I can't stand routine. I do my hobbies and I try to stimulate myself but the boredom is still there.

I'm a bit of a stimulation seeker, even watching TV with the husband I might have to fiddle or do some embroidery. I'm constantly tapping my feet or legs. I don't really know what this is all about - maybe I have zero natural dopamine (!). Basically I'm aware of my need for stimulation and I try to put change and new things into my life but it's never enough.

Doesn't help I don't have any irl friends at the moment.... I could do with a social event.

Idk man. I'm in the process of booking a solo getaway to my favourite country next year and I'm thinking while I'm there, I'll not be bored because I'll have new exciting things to do and see every single day.

I need support, please and advice. I feel my mind is not clear.

I started dating him since Nov 2021 and since January 2022 he started to press to bare myself on cam and have sexual activity like that. We hadn't met at that point. He said that I'm the one that's hurting him, because I don't trust him or something of the sort. He relented for a while on various occasions.  
We met several times.

He started to threaten to break up with me many times, when we'd have arguments, usually about me complaining about his behavior and he'd accuse me back, or because of the cam thing. I would stand up to him, but as time went on I felt more exhausted. My life circumstances were not helping me, as I was most of the time alone, working from home, in a small town where I didn't really have friends.

From Nov 2022 he entered officer school (Europe) and we spent less time together. He will graduate March 24th. I could still see making effort, while he seemed busy, to contact, talk. It fluctuated, but he'd tell me about his day in text, then give me some short calls or a few minutes during the day. In the evening, we'd spend half hour on cam, more or less. He told me to be patient because starting February he will go up one rank and he'll have more free time. He also started to press again for the cam thing, which he had stopped mostly since entering the army, or at least he didn't react negatively when I didn't. He started to become colder and colder as I was refusing him, not saying I love you, not contacting me, being short on reply. He started to complain about various things about me, one of them being that I am not sexual on cam and show all my private parts.

It was a very stressful period for me on New Year's Eve I lost my livelihood, a small business I had. I was in the middle of winter with bills to pay and a bit of savings. I'll start a new job on April 1st, in a different city and I don't have enough money to pay everything. He started to press me on Feb 9th and said he is breaking up with me, that I put him off about being closed, not being sexual on cam. Again I could not sleep for 48h, I was in shock and a wreck, could not function. The part about being closed is that he found on Holidays some antidepressants in my purse and I hadn't told him about those. I was prescribed those because he had threatened break up in October again over the cam thing and he was being very cold to me and I couldn't function, I was a wreck and hadn't slept in 48h. I begged him to not break up and eventually he agreed not to. I never told him about those, because I was afraid if I'd tell him his treatment was the main reason I was taking them that he'd get upset and he'd be angry and withholding again.

Back to Feb 9th, again I begged him not to dump me. I also told him I had been sexually ab\*sed in childhood so I would freeze over the cam thing. He said he is sorry I went through that and later that I should just get over it. I cracked and I did whatever he wanted sexually. He seemed very happy, attentive and affectionate, but it only lasted for some days, then slowly he started to talk less, prioritize me less. He had said us being sexual would bring us closer. If I was sexual I'd get a lot of anxiety and feel needy and scared. I would have been calm(er), but after the next day he'd be usually less attentive to me. I kept asking if he loves me, and he kept saying yes. He'd tell me that multiple times a day.

A few weeks ago I told him I felt he lost interest and if that's the case he should tell me because I can understand people's feelings change. He told me he loved me more than before. I said that he is saying the words every day, but he does not spend time with me and I feel neglected, plus other things. He thanked me I said this to him, and said he'll put more effort in the future, because he is just tired and stressed and that the same had happened to his previous relationship, the girl dumped him because he was not being attentive to her because of his stress and she thought he didn't love her. (This part is true, as I knew him even when they were together, we were platonic, before dating, and he suffered for her.).

Eventually he lost his temper because the discussion was dragging on. We both spoke but I can repeat myself when I'm anxious. He became cold and withholding and didn't contact me for 2 days. After, he said he loved me but has some anxieties about us.

The only thing that changed was him saying good morning every morning first. Less effort in texting and calls as before or less in some days. I told him again I felt alone and he said there's nothing he can do and I'm making him sad saying that. But the thing is now I see him on social media for 1-2 hours every day almost, he plays computer games 1-3 hours every day. So to me it feels like he is using excuses and could carve time from that. Also it takes a few minutes to check in and send little texts.

Yesterday he told me good morning and I love you, I said it back, then nothing from him until 6pm. I called him we spoke 6 min and said he'll call later. At 8 30 pm he called me, he was getting ready for a game and asked to see my breasts. I said no and that I need companionship and time together for that. He tried to stream the game for me, and when it was no possible he said he'll close and wants to play alone, cold, no I love yous, and he says that at the end of every call. He said he'll call later. He called at midnight, but I missed it and minutes later he was in bed and said he has to close. I said I don't like that he stops saying I love you when I don't show him my breast on request and that I need time, intimacy together to feel sexual, otherwise I'd do it for everyone on the street and I'm asking for things normal in a relationship. He equaled him not saying I love you because I won't show my b00bs with me not doing it because he won't spend time with me. And now he's also not wrote, as he does every morning.

He also said in one oh our last talks he is tired of me doubting his feelings and that he feels it is established he loves me, he is with me and will be with me. But how can that be established if be breaks up every few months, and reacts like this at sexual stuff?

**Am I being gaslit?**

Tl;dr: LDR boyfriend stops saying ILY and contact if I don't do what he wants se\*ually, last night he stopped saying ILY because I refused to show my b00bs. I told him I'm not in the mood because he doesn't spend time with me and I need intimacy to be sexual and i don't like his attitude. He said that me not being sexual is the same as him not saying ILY. In Feb he threatened break up for not being sexual on cam and show everything and other reasons, and took it back when I cracked. He said this will bring us closer, but I don't see more effort. Say he's busy in officer school (Europe) but he has time now for video games 1-3h every day and social media (1-2h). He'll say a good morning and I love you and text a couple sentences throughout the day or less, then call in the evening for some minutes (5-10), sometimes 30 min, but he's usually also gaming when he spends more time with me like that. I asked if he lost interest and he says he loves me more than ever. I told him before I could see words and actions, but now he doesn't spend time, with me, among others.",1678869797.0
568,Can't focus/remember things after I moved out of toxic household,1,11ry9v8,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11ry9v8/cant_focusremember_things_after_i_moved_out_of/,3," So, for starters, I was a bright kid. I was good with my memory. I could study pretty much effortlessly. As time went by, my mental health suffered a lot due to abuse. I wasn't nearly as good anymore.

But something weird happened after I moved out. I somehow feel like my mental processes have gotten so much worse from being already sub-par. Just to add a note - I'm actually pretty happy. Nothing crazy is happening in my life.

1. I **forget a lot**. And I mean a LOT. It has been a year and half since I moved out of my abusive household and I have forgotten almost 90% of my memories of being abused. It sometimes gets to the point where I start thinking my abusers weren't ever abusive. I also forget pretty much everything mundane as well like planning to do the laundry and forgetting it. Not once, not twice. Every. Time.

I also tend to forget things that have happened a month or so ago. Like things will be really blurry for some reason and I can't remember unless someone tells me every detail about it.

2. My **attention span seems to have gone down** significantly since I moved out. Another thing I wanted to mention is that **I zone out really, really frequently**. Over 50 times a day and that's just when I'm aware that I'm zoning out.

To put it simply, I feel like I'm no longer a person but rather just a space filled with white noise.

I have never felt like this before. I'm not able to focus on my education because of this. I'm not even able to focus on things that are important to me because I keep zoning out. I really need to study but I don't know what to do. Has someone else felt this way? How have you dealt with it?

**TLDR**: Memory and attention span have become worse since moving out from abusive household. Struggling to stop zoning out as well.

For 7 years I have been with various psychotherapists. The quality of most of them was quite dubious, which led me to drop out (for example, one questioned whether I was really bisexual because I had never dated a woman).
However, with my 6th and current therapist, I discovered something I never had become aware of. Yesterday during the session with her, I was saying that ever since I ended an abusive relationship of 1 year with a narcissistic guy (very possessive and jealous that made me feel bad for being a very sensitive person), I have been having some difficulties in dating. Whenever I went on dates, I knew I didn't want to touch, kiss or have sex on the first date, but I always ended up going along when they took the initiative.
We then explored why I accepted physical touch on the 1st date, even when I didn't want it yet and knowing I needed some confidence first to be comfortable with this kind of communication. And I understood that the moment guys touch me, I am not able to reject the touch for fear that they will be displeased, leave me or get angry with me. It was very freeing for me to realize that this is a limit for me, that I really have to respect myself and that it's okay to say no. However, I am scared by the possibility of never being able to have a committed love relationship. Rationally, I know that there will be someone who is compatible with my functioning and who respects me. But at the same time, the possibility of rejection scares me a lot.
I would like to know how people who have this type of need (not to be touched at an early stage) deal with this situation. What strategies do you use to be able to reject and say no, in addition to the obvious: working on self-love and self-acceptance in therapy. Thank you very much for your attention.",1678866100.0

when im in therapy and my therapist acknowledges that i have trauma or that something may be wrong with me, i find my body reacting in strange and upsetting ways. it feels too shameful to mention face to face with her but when i hint towards potential/possible trauma (i havent really opened up about many lived experiences yet, not that it would explain this reaction) or answer questions about myself, sometimes i get partially aroused down there. i dont feel sexual when it happens and i find it really repulsive of my body to react that way. its happened mostly while she's asked me about what i experience like symptoms wise. i dont know maybe its like my body feels like being open is wrong of me to do or its a bad thing and thats why it reacts that way, maybe its like a shame thing. and when my therapist says that i shows signs of blah blah blah trauma induced mental issues, it just happens. i hate it and it makes me feel like im a sicko who gets off to the concept/possibility of being fucked up or broken or something. and i cant help but feel like it isnt unprecedented for me either like when ive self harmed in the past ive gotten aroused to the point of dripping or like having wet spots in my underwear without even noticing. i didnt expect to but it just happened and the first times i remember ever getting aroused as a kid was when i was playing as a bad guy and when i would play/imagine being hurt. it really damages my sense of self and i just feel so... gross for these reactions. its followed me throughout my life and really influenced my sexual desires and hyper-sexuality, especially in the past. it just feels like im attracted to being bad or being hurt. and by bad/evil i dont mean abusing anyone else, i have never harmed anyone, never will, nor have i ever wanted to, its more just like stop being kind/taking care of myself i guess, like let myself go and be indulgent and get into bad habits like sleeping around, drugs or criminal stuff.... sorry for the non-sequitur... but yeah like its not something i like about myself and i feel like its attempting to infect something thats supposed to be good and normal and not sexual with therapy, i dont get it i just dont get it. i dont want it or even feel sexual it just happens and im cursed to feel all of the shame. my body just reacts to whatever it reacts to, honestly i dont really even get it with therapy like its not a surprise to me that ive gone through trauma and stuff and i havent even been super open with her except for the base work we're doing now. i just feel so disgusting and pathetic and depraved that things like that make my body react in that way.

if anyone can offer any support or advice or information about anything like this i would really appreciate it because im tired of having to deal with such a gross reaction.",1678862229.0

Recently my dad had attacked me in the past week which really switched me on.

I made it far, I've been accepted to a room and naturally I have doubts, fears as whether this was going to work, but again, I was reasonably considering everything and could feel like I was defending myself, until all of a sudden today, I gave into dissociation all over again. Now I feel like I just want to stay home and it has ruined everything for me, all my foresight, all my ability to understand and judge my reality, and I think it's put a crank in everything.

I recently started a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaIUEK5y2rruzQe2i-dHozQ) for my two Black boys, aged 5 and 7. My intention is far from vlogging or Youtubing as I am not an expert in either, but rather to document their childhood and create memories full of joy, play, adventure, and moments of love - something I didn’t have growing up.

I mean they are 7 now and looking back on all of their videos (*after all my cloud drives were getting extremely full and I needed to delete stuff to make space*) I realized how much intentionality I had put into capturing their childhood on video. I was talking this through with my therapist late last year while I was working through some of my childhood issues and I had the breakthrough of connecting it to ***trying so hard to have good memories for them to hold onto, something that I never had***.

Personally, I don’t have any good pictures showing something memorable from my childhood. And I’m not sure what part of my childhood my brain is protecting me from, but every time I try to remember something from an event or place in my childhood, my brain comes back empty or the memory is very fragmented. You know It’s like a case of infant amnesia or repressed memories.

You know that coping mechanism where the brain may unconsciously block a memory due to its association with a high level of stress or trauma? - to protect the individual from the emotional pain of recalling them - hiding the memories like a shadow in the brain. That’s what it feels like for me.

But for my boys, I want them to have joyful memories to look back on. That’s why I started this [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@PlayVentureBoys/featured).

I'm learning to inhabit my body again with the help of regular exercise. I'm learning that it's ok to grieve my losses and how to do that in a healthy way. I'm learning to trust my gut instincts again and to follow up on my curiosities. I've reinvested in some old hobbies and found several other new ones that are extremely rewarding. 

I've also come to the understanding that I'll never be ""cured"".

My parents would never admit it, but that's what they wanted. That's what made me obedient and controllable and quiet. If I had other people in my life I wouldn't have to rely on them so much. 

Everytime I tried creating new relationships I'd get punished for it in some form until I learned to stop. This dissonance of punishment for wanting connection and then getting belittled/punished in a different way once I stopped trying is just.. so bonkers.

It took me a long time to realize that this was happening (and even longer why) and so I only managed to escape a couple of years ago.

Today I'm not nearly as alone. I have some online friends that I play games with like once a week and another recently made real life friend that I have weekly cooking & tv evenings with.

Today at most I'll have to spent a weekend alone before being able to talk to another human.

Objectively that's a lot of progress. I know this sounds all sorts of wrong... but it's just not enough.

I still have to spend most evenings alone and in those moments a switch is flipped and I'm a little girl again, getting locked away and isolated against my will.

The child-me knows there is no hope finding a real family.

Since that first memory, I cannot recall a moment of peace or comfort in my childhood. Sexual abuse, suicide, constant arguments - it seemed never-ending. It *was* never-ending. All I ever wanted to do was survive. My one goal as a child was to make enough money to move out as soon as possible, because once I was out on my own it would be better, right? Well, sure. But it's not hard to get better than that, is it?

When I was 17 my Mother and I got evicted from our rental, as it was being sold. Since then I have been providing for myself (which was a better option than providing for me *and* my Mother). Meanwhile my Mum has remained homeless and unemployed, overstaying her welcome at friends' houses and spending much of her days sitting on my couch in my one-bedroom flat, watching conspiracy theory documentaries.

&#x200B;

I am very grateful for the life I lead, and for the people I have in my life who have shown me genuine care and support. Not everybody has that understanding. And yet, even with that, I fall apart. I get to catch a glimpse of who I'm sure I am - maybe who I was meant to be. She is happy, friendly, capable, healthy, busy, funny, and confident. But underneath it all she is so, so lost. And that bubbles up to the surface - or rather, it drags me down with it. It's bound to. I think I'm okay, and then three weeks later my counsellor (who always knows what I need to hear, thank god) is putting my shattered pieces back together until I think I'm okay again.

This whole cycle is exhausting, and it will continue to happen over and over again, because I was never prepared for this. I was never ready to be all alone in this world. The way I was raised, I was never prepared to be out in this world at all. And maybe I could fix this if I  had a foundation to build on. But I just keep nailing the pieces together, and they're all the wrong pieces, and they all fall apart, because I don't know how to build and I have nothing to build on in the first place. It seems futile, but there is no other option.

Other people make sense. I can see what makes them tick. I can see their wants and their needs. But when it comes to me, what *I* like,  who *I* am? I have no idea. Because there is no me. There is no me before all of this. This *is* me. Unstable, lost, confused, empty... this is all I am. How could I be anything else? I don't want a relationship, a career, consistent hobbies, or even a certain style of decor in my house. I just want to be in the position where I can even want for those things. But I don't know how to do that. I don't know if I will ever know anything other than this.

I suppose some would say it's a blessing. They'd say ""well, then you can become anything you want to be."" But I don't know what that is, although I have tried. It is so tiring, and so unnatural, and it slips right out of my grasp every time I think I might be on to something.

That's why I'm here to tell you my story of why I have secretly built resentment for my sister (who we'll call B for the time being). 

B and I live together, and have been for the past year now; and she's begun to notice that I've snapped recently after my stepfather came home drunk the other night at his and my mom's house and was trying to pick a fight with me. 

When I say snapped, I mean I go to the gym now and hit the weights hard, I go to the dojo to learn how to defend myself while also conditioning myself in order to be prepared for a fight (if a fight were to ever take place). I also have begun to ride my e-bike everywhere I need to go to toughen up for the streets which luckily there hasn't been any conflicts yet. 

I grew up in my mom's side of the family's household where emotional abuse took place, and if us kids weren't careful, could've easily turned into physical abuse. Living with that narcissistic stepfather of mine and my mom, who fell victim of him, the words that came out of his mouth towards me has made me despise him.

With my religion it has taught me not to hate anyone in this world, but the damage that has been done not only to me, but to others in my family from him has got to stop. I'm twenty-four now and I can't keep living like this, with all of my unresolved problems residing in me causing me to snap throughout the day on myself. It's miserable but I'm keeping on the best I can.

That's when B comes in. 

My friend came over after church to check out my e-bike and when he opened the door B's ping-pong table comes crashing down on his ankle causing him immense amount of pain making him holler out because it was behind the door. 

That triggered me on a whole 'nother level due to me being raised up in an emotional abusive household where if you didn't apologize something bad was bound to happen. 

When my friend left, after apologizing about a million times to him, I snapped on myself. I didn't know B was awake when all of this was going on and I went off, but not on her though. When she had enough she says out loud, ""Why are you so angsty?"" to which I replied ""Because my friend got hurt, B. That's why."" 

She then tells me that it isn't her fault that my friend got hurt. I responded that it's my fault that it was there because someone has to be responsible for it. That's when she comes in the kitchen where I'm at and tells me calm down.

Calm down?

Yes, because that's always worked in the history of never.

I then tell her I just simply can't because something snapped within me when that happened to my friend.

You know what she says next?

She had the audacity to tell me you can handle yourself better, that I'm choosing to be like this basically saying how I'm behaving is unacceptable.

This is AFTER I told her that my old therapist/psychiatrist believed that I have CPTSD. 

She then tells me that I can do better about how I handle myself.

The sleep restriction is to help me get into a deep sleep. I still have a bunch of vivid dreams and nightmares so it hasn’t helped yet.

But to combine being sleep deprived and mindfulness exercise just seems like a cruel joke and almost like punishment.",1678810098.0

I was in an abusive and violent relationship for many years. Eventually I got out, cut off contact, moved on with my life, and am now happily married with a family.
However, my abusive former partner has started to build a career as a journalist and media personality. They have a prominent weekly byline at a major newspaper and website. They are starting to appear frequently on TV and Radio.
When I see their face pop up, when I hear their voice, I feel like I am right back in the abusive relationship, afraid of their violence, walking on eggshells for fear of their reaction. I have to close the browser, turn off the TV. My heart is racing, I'm sweating, short of breath. 
My current partner, who is kind and loving gives me support, but doesn't seem to really understand what an abusive relationship does to you, how it crushes your self esteem, how you blame yourself for what is happening.
I don't know what to do other than to avoid anything where my abuser might appear.",1678792739.0

Particularly, I obsess over the first house I lived in with my parents. I always thought of it fondly, because I thought things were ""okay"" then. But then I realised that even then I was neglected, more than I originally thought, and this is backed up by documents I have found from that time. In most of my memories (not all), I'm alone, in a snapshot in time. The house was dirty, we were poor, I was barely fed or clothed, and spent most of my time playing alone or watching TV in my room. Granted, I am autistic so maybe I just wanted to be alone, but I have so many unanswered questions. I obsess over the media I used to watch, the toys I had, spent ages trying to look at the house in Google Earth, individual memories and little bits. We weren't there for very long, and my life has been different levels of traumatic ever since. I don't understand why I do this to myself, why does it feel so good to remember yet hurt so terribly at the same time? I guess maybe it's my attempt at trying to ""go home"" but fail every time, because it's a home based in a different time period and on the false feelings of security I had at the time. Sometimes I also feel like if I could go back to that house (which I obviously can't because other people live there now) and see that it's changed, that it's not actually my home in a time capsule, maybe it would break this ""spell"" but tbh I don't think it would.

I don't actually have a diagnosis of CPTSD, but I think I may have it (although I'm unsure). I don't know how to stop this feeling because together with other traumatic memories to do with one of my parents especially, it feels like the thoughts come to find me every waking moment I'm not distracted by something else. 

&#x200B;

So to be clear about my question, does anyone else feel like they're not quite able to live in the present but can't quite remember the past well enough to actually be living in it either? And does anyone have any suggestions about how I can stop feeling this way (other than therapy which I'm on a waiting list for the next few months)?

I feel like my life is standing on a shaky foundation and it'll fall apart any second. I feel like I can't talk about my traumas because it's too much for other people to hear. I feel desperate to be comforted like a child who just wants to be held and allowed to cry while she's hurting. I feel helpless to comfort myself, like... I know what's going on in my head and I know why, I'm not struggling to untangle it all because I've done that part already... I'm just in desperate need of feeling believed and heard and understood and accepted, and reassured that what happened to me doesn't make me some kind of freak.

Yet is also retraumatising to verbally talk about what happened and doesn't feel at all productive. I find it 100 times easier to write it than to say it verbally.

Talking to a counselor hasn't got me far, since the lesson I received from it was father-daughter SA = bad, but mother-daughter SA = ""that's just a control thing"". (As if control is ok and not abuse in and of itself already, and as if the gender of the abuser made any difference whatsoever to my suffering and humiliation.) So the absolute worst abuser I suffered in my life was cruelly dismissed because of the counselor's personal biases. In a facility that supposedly specializes in childhood trauma. So I retraumatised myself in the desperate hope that I'd be heard and validated, only to be severely invalidated and lose another bit of trust in people.

I'm a woman in my 30s. I need to not be so desperate to be coddled. It's a childhood void I can't seem to fill and the yearning won't go away. The pain of never satisfying that need is very intense. I don't know what to do.",1678798458.0

so, for a month basically I have been home from highschool due to my depression getting exponentially worse. school is the main trigger for my depression because the environment triggers me, and the structure/system itself makes me feel awful. it’s hard to fully pinpoint what about school makes me feel so awful, but I almost think it’s everything. I got to the point where i’ve been having intrusive suicidal ideation, and i started a new medication to try and help. it isn’t helping. 

anyway, my therapist had a meeting with the school when I had been out for about two weeks, and she came back next session with what felt like a lot of judgement. she told me that the school “wished I reached out earlier” despite me telling them i’m depressed and need help since November. she for some reason agreed with them and said she wished i told her about this sooner because she had to “answer for” me being out of school for two weeks. this felt very confrontational already, and this was basically the start of the session. the rest of the session was mostly being told that I need to go back to school, that I can’t keep “avoiding” it, and basically being told my feelings about school being oppressive and the environment genuinely harming me emotionally is just my emotional mind playing tricks on me. it feels that i’m being treated like my feelings aren’t rational and that I need to just suck it up.

the next day I texted her about this telling her that I felt really upset by how confrontational she was being, how she was oversimplifying my feelings (she said I “talked myself into” this) and that I generally felt invalidated. her response was pretty much saying she didn’t want to “feed the emotional brain” and enable me. I was upset by this further, because it almost felt like I was being gaslit. she never really took accountability or said anything other than “i’m sorry you feel that way”. 

next session was almost worse. I didn’t fully realize until afterwards because I have fawn/appeasing responses to her, (as I have since realized) but she was being incredibly snarky/sarcastic during the session. she said that she had a consult about my case to check if she was “handling it properly” and told me, “some things they said would have you running out of here screaming”, that they used the word “enabling” a lot, that they said she was being “too nice”. she said “if you think i’m not being fuzzy wuzzy then you should hear them”. it felt like she was using it against me, me feeling invalidated by her, and was trying to gaslight me into thinking I was just being too sensitive. she even said “maybe you just needed to be upset”. I was fawning a little less this session, I was voicing my disagreement more, saying how things didn’t feel accurate, but at the same time I was blaming myself for being invalidated.

At this point I don’t know what to do. I don’t feel like she is helping me, the DBT/CBT she uses is invalidating, but I don’t know if I can find another therapist who is even somewhat “trauma informed”, especially covered by my insurance.

the timing could be a coincidence but i find it very interesting that this started right when i started having the worst emotional turmoil i’ve ever felt. so i wonder if anyone else has had a similar experience or has any insight on whether this could be related to my cptsd or another mental health issue?

It’s like after years and years of silence she has found an exit strategy out of my body and into the world where she can finally be heard. So, here is what she has to say tonight.

I’m here. I’ve been here all along. You couldn’t see me, or hear me. But I was here. I know there is a part of you (or parts of you) that are scared of me. I’m not going to hurt you. But I have a lot to say. 

It’s been rough in here. I hold memories that the rest of you didn’t want to know. Couldn’t know. Your survival depended on it. These memories are in basements. At your grandparent’s house. At your neighbor’s house. 

I can see that your body has frozen. We’re getting too close together it seems. This has been forbidden since the day he first touched you in the green lofted bed.

It’s strange, I don’t seem to hold the rage that you often feel. Instead, I hold a coldness. And a tingling in my arms. A gaping hole in my chest.

I see the well that was in the front yard. It had a large stone over the opening. 

And then there was the old stone building next to the house that used to be a smokehouse. It had bars on the window. 

I’m frozen again. 

And then, I’m being choked. 

And I bring in the part of myself that reminds me that I’m safe. And the part that’s being choked meets the part that knows I’m safe and they converge for a moment like an atomic bomb and my eyebrows rise to the top of my head and my head opens up and it’s empty.

For starters, there's a video from our security cameras of my youngest brother (I think he was 11 at the time, now he's 12) getting scared that one of his older brothers was going to jump out and scare him. It's brought up pretty frequently. Today, he (stepdad) made a thing out of bringing everyone into the living room to watch it at full volume and said, 'whenever I'm sad, I just go watch that video/have this to go back to' and honestly? When you're sad you have to maliciously make fun of little children to make yourself feel better? Unbelievable.

 Like, I cannot believe how hard he was laughing over it. My brother sounded really scared. Sure, there was no one actually there, but the sound alone set off my fight or flight. I would've thought someone was hurting him from the audio.

 My stepdad also kept more than one video of the oldest (14 at the time) and the times he'd run out of his room having a night terror. Which, for the record, are fucking *terrifying* -- and I know because he used to ask to sleep over in my room at night to try to stop having nightmares. Would beg to sleep with me and my other brother. Like, I never thought those were funny. I was actually really concerned for a long time, and asked him about them, but he said that they were usually graphic and didn't want to talk about about them. 

   ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 

What pains me the most is that he's adamantly repelled by any affection from my brothers or giving it to them. He's able to be affectionate with my mom and I just fine (though I distanced myself because of some things), but when it comes to them? It's a chore that he can't be bothered to do. Like he would rather be doing *anything else* than show an ounce of love to my siblings when they need/want it. I don't think he really gives a shit about them. 
   ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 

I noticed my stepfather's asshole behavior early on, but I am upset that I got comfortable with it over time and stopped addressing it as much as I should have. I'd never had a real father who didn't fucking hate me, and I got carried away having someone who seemed to love and adore me as a daughter for the first time in my life. 

   ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 

The first time I watched the hostility come out was when the oldest boy asked about some group in the army. My stepdad said, 'All those people are douchebags, but that's where you're headed anyway in life, so..' I round the corner and ask, 'did you call [brother] a douchebag?' 

He lied through his teeth and said no. I said, 'yes you did, I heard you say it', and repeated word for word what he said. His excuse then was that he wasn't saying it to my brother, and I asked, 'who else would you have been saying it to, then?' He fumbled for an apology, but I said, 'don't apologize to me, apologize to *him*'. Honestly, I should've let out the crazy early on and done something to scare him away.

If the people around me, & society in general, could be brainwashed into thinking that me being gay made me different & possibly morally corrupt & worth damnation rather than an equal human being then individuals other than myself were dangerous & could not be trusted. I believe that I have cptsd & dpdr because of this, in addition to general anxiety & social anxiety. It first started when I was in 8th grade & I felt so detached from my self, my body, & my surroundings. I felt like I there was a barrier between me and everything else. The only escape I got from this then was through isolation & reading the Harry Potter books. This dpdr phase was the worst one as it was my first, & lasted about six months until I got to high school. During high school I was able to get more comfortable with my sexuality & learn to keep it as a secret to myself. It was like myself & I were in on a secret that only we know. Idk if that makes sense, but it made sense to me at the time. Fast forward to college & the dpdr came back full force. This led me to come out in 2016. I began to try to address the root issues of my anxiety to feel better. This led me to get together with my first real partner who I am engage now to & will be getting married to next year. However, that 2016 dpdr phase eventually went away as I moved out of my parents home & moved into an apartment with my now fiancé. My parents are okay now with my sexuality & have a good relationship with my fiancé. This is why I am very confused as to why I started a new dpdr phase last July. This third one is nothing compared to the last two. They are not as severe, but they still affect my quality of life. I feel disconnected from my self & life.

I quit my full time job back in November due to working for my family. (Hopefully that says enough) I ended up getting a part time job at a local retail store that I have grown to love. I really never had plans for my career path, was in banking for 3 years and have always been in customer service based jobs. 

I had two interviews last month which were busts. The first I missed due to someone having wayyy more experience than me. Which is TOTALLY fine. I understood. The second was actually at the bank I used to work at. I interviewed with three of my old managers and two ladies from HR. I BOMBED the interview. It was the hardest interview I’d ever had and even my managers weren’t happy with how the HR ladies handled it. I got to speak with my old managers after and they still want me to come back and interview again for a lower paying position than I originally applied for. But I don’t think I want to be back in banking at all. It just doesn’t feel right. The only reason I applied in the first place was for the money it was offering at $25/hr. 

Now I have been approached with what is called a coordinator position at my part time job and I’m tempted to take it. I would only be making $13/hr but I really enjoy the pace of this job and I would receive full benefits as well. I can only accept the position if I am not actively seeking other employment though. I’m tired of racking my brain trying to figure out my next steps and I’m leaning to this thinking it will give me a chance to breathe.

The thing literally would hit us with slippers (I FEARED this slipper), VERY hard sandals that my father would buy new ones of each year (it broke my skin and I have marks from it- she’d call me ugly and blame me for the marks, not understanding that she caused them…), my school belts (I can’t wear belts because of this), her hands, and my father apparently threw a cooking pan at me (my sister just remembers me running away an a Pan being thrown in the direction I was running).

There were times where she’d torment us for being to loud in the car and I remember one time she made us stand outside the door and make us listen to each other being spanked and we’d take turns. At one point she counted how many hits we’d get based off of each other’s crying. The more we cried, the more hits THE OTHER CHILD would get. Well, I caused my sister to get hit a bunch of times and had to listen to her get hit outside the door. I barged in and said, “she shouldn’t get punished for what I did!” And my mom drug me back out the room and started over the amount of times she’d get hit. And then we switched and she said, “it’s nice you stood up for your sister” or something like that, and then she barrated me and I accumulated 4 hits for barging in and she hit me four times and then it was over.

I’ve been so incredibly upset over this and my flashbacks have been terrible, along with my anger. It’s upsetting because I can’t beat her up…. She’s protected by the elderly person law…. It’s so frustrating because my abuser got away with hurting me and no one stepped in to help me. Any time I tried to get help, she’d tell my school that she did it out of love and they’d leave it alone. But, now she’s protected and no one cares that she’s a shitty mother. 

I poured water on her. I know that’s messed up and you’ll all call me abusive, but that’s the shit right there that pisses me off. My abuser hurts me, I try to get justice or fight back, but I’M THE ONE WHO GETS IN TROUBLE. Even when I’d go tell and not do anything back, I get told to just live with it. 

I’d also get in trouble for trying to see my school therapists. One time the school therapist was told I was cutting and she told my mom. I got in so much trouble. 

She’d also leave me with a babysitter who would beat the kids for no reason. She just kept taking me back. The babysitter would also lock us in her bathroom for hours if we pissed her off. Her husband molested me. I would literally cry when I had to go there. Her husband was so nice to me though. It just sucks. I think that’s why I have trouble with men and understanding that sexual actions aren’t love or safety. 

I just don’t understand how she’d “forget”

Everything is overwhelming to me because it feels like my mind is like this tiny box or narrow tunnel whereby whatever you perceive can only enter from a tiny hole i dont know..

This manifests as black and white thinking, as freezing, as avoidance, as resistance - and in extreme ways ig. I feel like things that I find hard to do rn are a piece of cake for others because they have more ""mental space"" than i do.

I'm not saying I'm not introspective. Frankly I am able to think more deeply about things thanks to my trauma but when it comes to simple tasks, executive function and operationalising, I buckle. My mind is like a walk in closet whilst others seem to have the mental space of a living room, in comparison.

And this has only worsened over the years. My friend over here is able to accomplish xyz and here I am struggling to complete task a because i just can't process it? Like, this basic function of ""processing"" died at some point a few years ago and since then it's almost like I've been senile, mentally. Like I'm in a vegetative state. In regards to my trauma, when I became depressed, I started giving up on life if you will I stopped processing as much as I used to, stopped trying etc. So I do understand WHY I am this way now, 4 years later. My brain wasn't as active as it used to be and I became so afraid of ""processing"" things in my brain so I just stopped.

But now it's like, okay, how do I activate/expand my mind now? I'm out here trying to ""unscrunch"" my brain while (it feels like) I'm watching everyone else do Level 32 origami with it...if that makes any sense at all..",1678782982.0

I'm not a parent and I am abysmal at providing material stuff for other people in my life, but I wonder if me being always stuck and always feeling like I'm trying so hard even when I have very little to show for it is just rooted in the same kind of neediness to always be seen as a good person doing all the right things even when it's clearly harming others......

I so desperately want to get out of this cycle, but I've been feeling this desperation for almost 2 decades now and it makes me wonder if that's not like a performance too like I'm just making myself stuck so I can get sympathy.

Or maybe I'm totally off-base and this is just another way I was fucked over where I can't feel anything negative anymore without wondering if it's an act to harm others, like how my parents acted like me having negative feelings was just to always upset them or make them uncomfortable.

It's incredibly clear I have triggers around money and material things, I've improved more in other areas of my life but not with this, after almost 2 decades of obsessing over this daily I'm still clueless how to improve.

They started to have serious mental health issues, completely changed, and traumatized the hell out of me in the process (it’s a lot to try and write but my precious posts go into more detail if anyone is interested). They had a number of diagnosis in the last few months including bipolar, ADHD, BPD and CPTSP. Contrary to what partners of people with BPD will say, they ARE genuinely remorseful. I had many good, healthy, emotionally safe years with my partner before their mental health took a sudden and sharp turn, and I know what their genuine remorse looks like (I did not see it when they were in crises, but it’s back). They acknowledge the mess they were and how much they hurt me and pushed me away. They recognize they caused havoc. They are extremely sad and apologetic for it and have been since they got on medication. 

The problem is, I have realized that regardless of their progress or awareness, I can’t be with them. At least not now… I need to work on myself and try to figure out if I can actually move on with them. 

I’ve told them this, and naturally they are fighting for me and don’t want to give up. They are telling me they want back the relationship we had in the beginning because when I tell you we genuinely had a perfect relationship for years, I mean it.  I tell them I want that back too but it not possible in the broken state we are in and that even if they went back to the way they were day one, I am not capable of it because of the damage. Again, I understand why they aren’t just giving in but what’s getting hard is how much they are pleading with me to give them a chance. That they know they messed up so bad I’ll never forgive them. I keep reiterating that’s not what I’m saying but it ends up being a back and forth of them being sad and desperate, a lot of self hate and self loathing and me saying the same things while struggling to not feel guilty. 

They really are a good person. So much better, much much more empathetic and more self aware than most of the people in the posts on this sub. I do see glimmers of the person I fell in love with. They also have so many more issues beyond BPD that I think a lot of the things they struggle with are the childhood trauma and CPTSD. They had a neglectful family and have major abandonment issues. 

My heart is broken that in order to take care of myself, I have to leave my partner at their lowest point. I’m also at my lowest point, but much more stable with a better job and a big support system. They don’t have any of that. I just don’t know how to handle feeling myself I am abandoning them, albeit for good reason. I get frustrated and angry when they plead with me because I feel it’s unfair of them to do it, while I also know exactly why they are and that I’d do the same. I’m the best and most stable and loving thing that’s ever happened to them and we both know it.

Secures - I don't know who they are or what they are, can't comment. 

Insecures - oh yes, our favorites. 

* Cluster Bs - Abused during childhood. Yes, narcissists and borderlines are severely abused too, I believe they were more abused than most people with CPTSD. 
* Cluster Cs - Avoidants, Fearful avoidants(most CPTSD folks lie here), Anxious(Love addicts). 

A narcissist dumps a CPTSD - Oh cruel narcissists, they are such bad people. They are such ""abusers"". 

A CPTSD(Fearful Avoidant) dumps a secure person - Oh cruel FA, I did everything for her(and they might have ACTUALLY done everything for her). She was such an ""abuser"" but I still stuck around. And the reason given is this - I feel smothered and trapped, I wanna explore(grass is greener syndrome). 

It's like there is a competition going on, who dumps whom first. A narcissist has a severe abandonment wound too, that's why he dumps first. 

If these ""insecures"" date the secures, they feel bored. If they date each other, they get hurt(both parties get hurt). It's like we are emotionally broken children, who has created a MONSTER to guard that broken child, and that monster DOES hurt people. Please take a look at the dead bodies you have left behind. Yes someone did hurt you, and you miss them/can't let them go/ hate them. But how about the people you have hurt? 

**Now I deeply believe that we are emotions driven people(which is pretty much clear). But we want the good stuff(the highs). How can we get the highs?  - Attention, Honeymoon period of relationships, CHASE(Fearful avoidants love this one), and many more things. A high from honeymoon period is considered an equivalent of cocaine. So most of us are just addicts then.** 

**But here's the problem, with the highs comes the lows(withdrawal). That loneliness, that anxiety, those flashbacks, that adrenaline, that insomnia, that edginess, that rage, it's all from the withdrawal of those feel good chemicals.** 

**Secure people call us ""roller coasters"", because it really is a roller coaster of emotions. Highs, then lows, then highs, then lows.**

need some support 

&#x200B;

last year i worked really hard to be able to move out of from my abusers house. i was working a lot to make money, i was trying to take care of my physical health, reading and journaling, spending a lot of time transportation to see friends. yes it was so hard and i was so scared. but i had a dream and goals. the thought of having my own space and feeling safe made me keep going. and i did move out.

&#x200B;

literally a few weeks after i moved out my friend's roommate sexually assaulted me. my best friend started to do hard drugs and we barely have connection now. he is dating my other close friend and he cheated on them and harmed them in many ways. my other best friend and i dont talk anymore. i am struggling financially. in this period, there was a time i was doing a lot of weed and sleeping with random people. i quit smoking and sleeping with random people 3 months ago and have been working with a great therapist since then.

&#x200B;

i still feel so much pain and dissappointment. i feel lonely even though i still have good and safe friendships. unfortunately i get flashbacks often about those random people i slept with. the flashbacks remind me of flashbacks i used to get when i was younger (about people who sexually abused me when i was a kid)

&#x200B;

i feel like all the hardwork i put to be able to move out is crushed. i feel disapppointed that i couldnt protect myself from being sexually assaulted (so i blame myself). i know the flashbacks will go away. but i feel so hopeless. i know im really young and i barely had people on my side to learn from. and i know life isnt going to be perfect. but i feel so sad. i wanna go back to journaling like i used to before i moved out (before i was sexually assaulted), but i dont have the motivation. i feel like even if i rebuild that skill, i will be crushed again. i feel so powerless. i need someone to tell me that i need to try anyways. i need to keep going. that journaling is worth it. that i should still dream of things. i feel too scared to tell those things to myself because im scared they will be crashed again.

&#x200B;

also right after i moved out i was trying to explore my gender identity and religion together as my body dysmorphia is mostly related to religious trauma but i had a job back then and all my coworkers were cis men and unfortunately i internalized a lot of things they said about me and other trans people. now i feel defeated and too scared to try again. even though my friends know im trans i feel like im back in the closet. i am very avoidant of thinking about my body or gender or religion. i feel powerless again, like i let them win. like if i was strong enough somehow i wouldnt have let them impact me. but thats not fair. 

&#x200B;

i just blame myself so much for what happened. like. yes it wasnt my fault. but if i was strong enough these things wouldnt have crushed me. which is not fair :( i wanna get up again. find motivation to get up again. to be compassionate to myself again. to feel like myself again. because all i feel now is empty lifeless and joyless.",1678852379.0

My ex abused me in a lot of ways, and recently I’ve met this guy I really like (I’m not dating, I’m not ready to date yet and won’t be for a while), but he got me thinking about how maybe I would like to date again someday in the future.

The problem is that I don’t know how to explain I’m an abuse survivor who has C-PTSD (and also probably ADHD), and also my ex nearly tried to end my life, I escaped right before he could do that, though, with a safety bag.

It’s sort of hard, because all of this happened in ‘high society’ at the time (as my horrible ex, mr.stalker, was corporate), and nobody thinks I ‘look’ like a survivor, I feel like (as we all know, though, abuse can happen to anyone.) So it seems like my life is pretty normal in some ways because of where I lived, but it was actually pretty bad, for example, my ex used prostitutes (I didn’t know about it at the time, he also cheated with the entire planet), and used to make me sleep on the floor sometimes, and deny me food sometimes, and scream at me and shake me, and hated that I’m an artist and not corporate like him, etc. 

So I don’t really know how to tell a potential future partner about this part of my past, or how even to bring it up. I’m doing my best to get better, but it’s hard. I go to therapy, I take medication, I write on Reddit to help my disassociation, I work on my art, I exercise in the morning, etc. But I can’t just make it  ‘get better and go away’ even though I was able to make it to safety, because as we know, C-PTSD is very serious.

I feel like my past is sort of a red flag parade and don’t really know how to explain how I am and what I’ve been through to a new partner.

TW: SA, child abuse, suicidal thoughts 

I'm a 22F. I've lived with my abusive dad 'till 16 and then I escaped (literally escaped) with my mom to save ourselves. 

He was a drug addict and a psychopathic scum who hated women - me included - and did everything to make sure I didn't enjoy even one day of my life. 

He used to beat us almost every week (sometimes everyday if he wasn't in the mood or didn't get his drugs) over the smallest things. 

Kicked the glass accidentally while walking and poured the water on the carpet? He would beat me until my mom intervened and then switch to beating her and then blame everything on me. 

Couldn't wake him up on time - even after trying so much? He would beat me and not let me sleep at night until mom intervened and then switch to beating her and then blame it on me. 

Got a call from a friend at night? He would beat me for not ending the call to answer him who's on the line but he himself wouldn't come home 'till morning most of the times.

Mom hit brother lightly because he swore? He would punch me in the face in retaliation because ""women bad"".

He made me drink alcohol at 11 (no I'm not an alcoholic now) and did drugs in front of us. He sometimes took me with him to his friend's place when I was five where they were doing drugs together to scare me and then laugh at me.

He also sexually abused me at around 8-9 when my mom wasn't around - held me in front of the mirror and assaulted me despite me telling him to let me go and then laughed at my cries. (Fuck you dad, you don't even deserve to be called dad, I hate you) 

My mom is good but she was also an abusive narcissist until recent years when she, changed and got better. 

I hoped - not *expected* - my brother would end up being different and understand things one day but he's an andrew tate fan so that hope too is dead now. Not surprised tho since he lives with my dad most of the time so it makes sense if he becomes just a modern version of my dad.

Now I'm 22, I managed to get into the university and study in a good field but I'm doing awful as I don't want to do anything literally. My friends count doesn't even reach to five, and they are all superficial. I don't have a deep bond with anyone, I get attached to people soon if I try to open up even a little about myself (it caused me heartbreaks so now I just avoid opening up to anyone). 

I don't have a proper relationship with any male in my life, I can't even have a casual conversation with them. Can't trust them or befriend them. If I meet just a guy who shows me simple human affection I will get attached because I haven't had any man/boy treat me normally in my life(Someone told me it's because I have daddy issues, idk) and I hate myself for it.

I've been bearing everything and controlling my emotions and studying hard because I thought it is the only way I can survive on my own and be independent but after managing to get into university I just realized how abnormal I am among my peers and how I cannot communicate with anyone without my anxiety rocketing and fearing that I may F up if I say something wrong. 

 I start shaking uncontrollably when I want to talk to a group of people - I just shut up most of the times I'm around people and don't talk. 

Many nights I stay awake thinking about all those memories when I was a child and how I couldn't have one normal day without it ending to be ruined by my dad and I can't help crying and feeling like someone is pulling my lungs and it's so painful and I mean physical pain.

I have no aim in my life. Nothing makes me happy. No one special in my life as I push away anyone I feel attracted to. I just live because I can't end myself. 

Every single inconvenience in life - no matter how insignificant - makes me cry and feeling useless and feeling like I should just die. Makes me want to scream while I'm in public but I have to control myself. 

I tried therapy, it didn't work, it made me worse due to my attachment issues and now I can't afford it anymore (no I'm not asking for financial help). I can't be fixed. 

I'm tired of everything. I want to die but at the same time I fear death, I fear turning into nothingness. But I feel like I shouldn't exist. I'm broken I just shouldn't exist.

First of all I don't know anything before my sixth birthday, I only know that I would be screamed at for everything I did. The floor boards in our small appartment often creek and they would scold and yell at me for ""walking loudly"". I always had an inner hatred and disgust in them even tough I was not ""aware  I got abused"" 

If I didn't do things exactly right even without knowing they work they would shame me and not even teach me how to properly do it.

I have memories of getting raped when I was 5 or 6 by someone in a bush. I have flashbacks to this every single day. It's just like this picture that gets held in front of me that extremely terrifies me. 

I never told anyone to this day, partially because I only remembered again when I was 10 or 11 or so. The times are really confusing It's hard to put together I'm sorry for miserably failing.

I couldn't even tie my shoes until someone at my ""Mother's"" work tought me.

I would always be put in empty rooms alone to ""wait"" my parents hated spending time with me and they just drank and watched TV while I was put away.

Schools would always expel me, I went to many different schools 6. I always excelled at the subjects but I would ALWAYS get bullied. When I fought back I got in trouble. One time on a cold winter we had PE and when we went to change they shoved me out of the little changing ""house"" while I was half naked, I then tried to kick the door open and succeded I went completely mad on the kid and his friends until a teacher came and grabbed me from behind I always HATED physical touch it just felt threatening. I tried to free me by kicking in the air and repelling myself from the ground. The same day I got expelled from that school and that was the last normal school I went to, also it turned out I somehow broke a rib of the teacher. Yeah I was 10 there

Well before I went to that school I was in the psychiatric ward twice because of ""aggression"" That was a horrible fucking place I felt so fucking bad there oh my god

I'm literally remembering things I never remembered before right now 

The first time I went there was when I was 7. The aforementioned ""aggression"" was me defending myself from my father who regularly beat me over ridiculous shit and bullies. But I STILL TOUGHT I WAS THE BAD ONE.

The Psych Ward was really bad the first time. It's very hard right now to think clear writing 

Kids would often just be attracted to antagonizing and bullying me and it always escalated and when it did i was the screaming furious one i always got so incredibly mad it was just like somehow pure animalistic anger took over I didnt give a shit anymore i just used anything to defend myself I don't know why nurses and caretakers always thought it was a good idea to fixate me with painful grips pushing my face on the ground just read the reviews yourself there even was a room with white cushions on all 6 walls.

the second time was little better I think but still horrible. There was a rule That if you threaten someone you must be 24 hours in your room and there was a person that made fun of me because of my heritage and destroyed my hot wheel car and I said ""If I was a allowed to, I would hurt you"" and for that I got the ""Auszeit"" I got so bored I started running around and tried to run the walls up and did fucking weird ass shit generelly I was always extremely easily bored

But god I wish this pain on no one - except maybe the behaviorists. My eyes are what frighten me the most as they are important to get deep rest.

I'm afraid to say but last time I took 3 muscles relaxers to sleep - was highly dissociated that it felt like I was in a coffin - and when I woke up? I was shocked by what I was experiencing...

My eyes were cramping. 

This was a year ago and ever since I have struggled to sleep properly and rest or relax. Instead my mind says, ""Were in so much pain at this point - you know what? Fuck it. Just keep going.""

But this makes the pain harder to recover from I know. Just hoping I can recover at all.

And here's an article I had to read yesterday that confirmed this to me about behaviorism and put it into words and explained why it's cruelty.

Now I am NOT asking for a diagnosis, only if you pals think it could possibly be a form of trauma. I should probably ask a doc about this, but rn I can't

To put it simply, I think I might have some type of injustice trauma caused by internalized mysoginy an preceive injustice in amab people let me explain: I remember even when I was little reçeiving the idea than society preceives man **>** woman. I also remember being under the impression than it was unfair than some people have different privates instead of eveyrone getting the same, but the fact than society sees women as inferior and than I was subconsiously seeing womanhood as weaker or not as good for this reason, was making my feeling of injustice even worse, which in turn made my internalized mysoginy even worse, which in turn made my perceived injustice even worse, and so on. The same happened with perceived injustice in the bodily functions of afabs, basically I tought it was unfair than afabs have periods but not amabs, and also I was under the impression than being afab had more cons than being amab until I ended learning than being female has more pros than I tought.

The reason why I am wondering if this could be trauma is because it still affects me today, I still have moments when I have ''dysphoria'' or ''euphoria'' and when it happens I will basically obsess about things related to sex and gender, until I start feeling/re-realizing than its cause by internalized mysoginy again, basically it feels like the trauma is making me doubt my gender and/or makes me euphoric about changing my gender or presentation, or just make me interested in wearing a packer

But ultimately I'm not sure if its just me overanalyzing things because first I'm not sure if what happened to me is ''bad enough'', because aside from this I never faced any type of abuse or traumatic event of any type, same for violence or assault. Also the fact than my experience wasn't cause by someone in particular, only by something abstract. And that my symptons could be explained by others conditions I have, mostly ASD, ADHD and OCD. And I'm not sure if trauma can make you think you want x but ultimately its just your trauma filtering your emotions. Last thing is that its more or less something than only affect my past, since society is still prejudiced against women and afab people, its not like society totally stopped being mysoginistic 15-20 years ago",1678842410.0

Boo hoo, cry me a fucking river. So I'm not allowed to reach out for help ever? I have to carry that burden alone?

I was in a really bad situation regarding my relationship some time ago and I posted on the mom for a minute sub hoping they could reality check me (I wanted to know if I'm being abused or not, because I genuinely couldn't tell). They removed my post and told me to seek real world help. It answered my question I guess, but it felt so disheartening. Relationship advice doesn't give advice to abused people too.

You're not supposed to reach out to friends to avoid trauma dumping and giving them secondary trauma. No psychologist would take on your case because your trauma is too severe and they aren't trained for that. When you reach out for support on the internet, you're told to shut up and that you're a burden on support sub's followers.

I handled it myself eventually, we sorted our relationship out without anyone's help. But I feel so incredibly alone being on my own with my troubles and fears. Am I really to damaged to help?

The title says it all essentially. I've got ADHD and a good helping of childhood trauma.

The issue, which my friends find funny, is that unless it hits a certain amount, I dont feel anything. Think of it like a titration in chemistry. It also only hits after a certain amount of time (i.e., exactly 2 hrs for edibles and around an hr for alcohol no matter how fast I drink). I have no desire to raise my tolerance or to make any of these a habit, so I won't be doing them often.

650,Never realised how unhealthy and manipulative my mum’s parenting was until now because she’s the anxious/fragile type,37,11qwtwx,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11qwtwx/never_realised_how_unhealthy_and_manipulative_my/,14,"EDIT: I read the chapter on overly enmeshed mothers in “mothers who can’t love” and I feel sick to my stomach because I’ve never felt more seen. The author even predicts all my rationalisations and excuses 😢


She wasn’t my abuser but her parenting has given me a lot of issues that I’ve learnt from her. It also explains why I experience all four/five trauma responses, because it was the opposite extreme to my other parent.

She is extremely overprotective, possessive and clingy and always has been (for example I’m 26 now and she expects me to answer all her messages on her time or she guilt-trips.)

I was her only child and she was a single mum when I was at her house. We had zero boundaries. No personal or emotional space. I wasn’t allowed to be in a bad mood. Every argument was taken personally even when I was a grumpy teenager and she still holds resentment towards me for that. She would say I was the only thing keeping her alive and still does. She would guilt trip me endlessly. Never once apologised for anything and still doesn’t. Cannot admit any faults. She’d tell her friends how horribly I behaved and tell me how disgusted those friends were with me (I was a straight-A student who never did drugs or drank until I was at least 16. I could be quite defiant about doing chores because when I did them it was always wrong. Most of my behaviour was being anxious and depressed and wanting to sit in my room writing fiction constantly as an escape). She makes lists in her head of every way I’ve wronged her and pulls them out frequently.

She had a horrible childhood where she was completely neglected by both parents and physically and emotionally bullied by her older sister constantly. She also had a still-birth before me at 8 months. So her behaviour makes complete sense, but because we’re enmeshed and she’s the only person who really understands my trauma (she was there throughout it all but unable to get me out of there) I don’t know how to tackle this. I didn’t even realise her parenting wasn’t normal until recently. I thought I was a bad daughter: selfish, lazy, inconsiderate (which I can be, we all can be at times), “full of rage”. She says I took out the abuse on her, by which she means we’d fight a lot when I was a teenager about stupid stuff (very convenient that it was “due to the abuse”). She even said I have “avoidant attachment” which is absolutely hilarious since even when we’re distanced we still talk weekly, and I tell her all my deepest thoughts and feelings (which I know I need to stop doing but it’s all I’ve ever known). 

So, both my parents were fucked (my dad enabled my abuse by my stepmum). 

Does anyone relate and know how to navigate this??? It’s so weird realising I’m probably not actually a bad person… especially when I was a child and teenager (who was being abused). It’s hard because people like this are so good at coming off like victims and making you feel so guilty and horrible for all your “bad” behaviour. 

As a side note, I recently went to get a niche blood test and the specialist looked at my records and saw that I’d had some really intense blood tests checking for rare cancers and stuff when I was 6 years old. That’s an example of her anxious parenting and happened all the time. It was normal for me.",1678769047.0

my issue with therapy historically has been that i dont feel the need to talk about the violence. i just dont necessarily see the use of revisiting my father's outbursts bc every time i do, the conclusion is always the same: ""yep, that was bad. yep, that hurt. yep, that was wrong, i was mistreated. so what?"" and... everything stays the same. i feel equally stuck and sad and lonely. knowing that something was wrong, doesn't make that wrong go away. 

so, today's session i revisited a random memory. i got agitated bc of the above paragraph and told t that i see no use in that. he understood but since its just the start of our relationship, he suggested we still try to work a lil bit more on this to see if my reaction is based on detachment/dissociation/unprocessed emotion or actual not needing to talk about this.

over the course of revisiting (thru emdr), the focus shifted completely from what my father did, to what my mother didn't do (protect me, soothe me, take care of me). and suddenly i felt like bawling my eyes out.

i cannot describe how revelatory this session was. suddenly i realize, i don't need to process what was there because what was there was so simple, so clear-cut, so straightforward that it just stands alone like a spear in the mud. in my case, what's important is what was missing.

what's important is nuance, complexity.

love that's not backed up by action. love that's backed up by action that hurts you. love that's shrouded in fear and danger. love that says it's love, but doesn't feel like love.

it makes sense now, why i can watch violent films without as much as batting an eye. but the moment the victim of violence receives support from friends and family, gets hugged and understood, im fully out of it. love is too much!!!!! it's unbearable and im a mess.

t and i concluded that (at least for now) my father is very much an afterthought even though he's been the main antagonist of my life. shit happened and it can happen to anyone, what i need to grieve and process was what didn't happen.

absences, negative space. it's funny because that's also my academic research focus (within visual culture) and has always been a point of intrigue for me.

Hi! I’ve been reading posts from this subreddit for a year and I’ve just gained enough courage to post. I just want to say preventively that English is not my first language. For context, I’m a 23 years old woman.
In the last five years my anxiety and depression has gotten very bad. I always suffered with low self esteem, having panic attacks, low motivation to do anything (even taking care of myself like showering) since I was little. The first time I actually planned to km I was 12. Luckily, I didn’t do it because I wasn’t confident I would succeed. Second time at 15, that time my ex boyfriend convinced me not to do it. Then, from age 16 to 18 I was more anxious than depressed, and I thought it was good.
The problem is that until five years ago I just thought that my brain was somehow faking it. I thought mental illness was something I faked to receive attention.
Something clicked in my brain months after I was SA by a guy after a party. A friend of mine made me realise that it wasn’t normal that a guy took me home with him, when I was drunk, to offer me a safe place to stay (he acted like he was different from his friends that were actually groping me while I was struggling to be stable) and immediately jumped on top of me when I was alone with him.
Now I’m starting to think I’ve always given myself the responsibility of my trauma, when in fact it was (for starters) my parents’s fault. And I think that maybe if I was brought up differently, I would have stood up for myself and not let myself be abused numerous times in my life.
Since November, I moved away from my mother’s house because I couldn’t stand her crazy behaviour anymore (she’s not diagnosed with anything but I think she has numerous mental issues) and I’m not getting better like I thought, if anything I’m more depressed than ever.
I skip meals, I struggle to shower, I fight with my boyfriend (verbally) because I go full rage if something triggers me, but I’m always a word or a sound away from being triggered and it always ends with me crying on my bed for hours on end. I can’t even gather the strength to talk to him about my issues.
The only medicine I was ever prescribed is Alprazolam, I take it occasionally when my anxiety gets too bad and I can’t function anymore. The issue is I couldn’t explain the entirety of my problems to my psychiatrist, because my mom was present during the visit. And I can’t afford to pay for therapy myself.
Advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",1678816776.0

I know that you aren't entitled to get one just because you asked but it sucks being told that you can't get a diagnosis because it wasn't ""bad enough"". So now I'm just back at square one after fighting to get some kind of help that isn't just medication for 5 years.

Is it weird for feeling guilty that I even brought it up? Like I'm just a disillusioned woman who thought that her situation was worse than it actually was. And it kind of wasn't from an objective point of view, most of you here has been through way worse things that I have. Just emotional neglect and ""abuse"" (I'm hesitant to call it abuse since they didn't mean to hurt me) and my dad being very close to dying of a stroke when I was a kid.

I'm kinda surprised I've actually been able to get anything done considering how bad the flashback I had last week was. Thankfully two of my favorite bands came out with new albums a week apart. 

Haken came out with a new album on the third, and it has really helped. Their last album Virus is all about abuse and trauma and all that. It came right before my parents got divorced and I began uncovering and processing my dad's abuse, so it was quite literally a life saver. The new album has a song called Elephants Never Forget. It's supposedly about Joseph Merrick ""The Elephant Man,"" and the abuse and trauma he went through. It's not as applicable to me as Virus, but it's still a great song and might be more relatable for someone else here.

Periphery came out with their new album on the tenth. It has a bunch of really relatable themes for me. Wildfire, Everything Is Fine! and Zagreus all deal with trauma, depression, anxiety, self loathing. Wax Wings, Silhouette, and Dying Star take a slightly more uplifting and validating approach, helping me remember I'm not the monster Everything Is Fine! suggests I am. That my trauma explains a lot of my suffering. That I can ""take space cause \[I'm\] not alone"" (Dying Star). That I am worth saving.

Both of those artists are progressive metal, so if it's not your thing, I get that. I love them dearly though, and they've both been there for me when I had no one else to turn to.

When he was gone, instead of getting ready for work I just sat staring out into space, feeling like an utter failure for losing control of my emotions like that, unattractive, unlovable. I wrote to him and  apologized and said I was feeling really bad about what happened and unhappy that he was gone.

When he came back, he could have gone straight to work and gotten some time in to be able to go home earlier but instead, he stayed home for as long as he could to hug me, comfort me, reassure me, talk about what happened, clip the dog's nails for distraction and a feeling of being productive and then some more hugs and making out before we both went to work.

And I love him for doing all that, of course, but I also feel like he shouldn't have had to. Like I should never have lost control of my emotions, never dumped them on him, never put him in a situation where he felt like he had to put time and energy into comforting me. Like even if he's willing to do that, every time has a price. Every time, some of his sympathy is spent and will not refill and once there is nothing left, he will no longer love me and he will leave me. And so, I should ideally never allow myself to be a burden like that and every time I do, it's a failure.

671,i just need to vent,10,11qy355,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11qy355/i_just_need_to_vent/,1,"because of my trauma, i (26F) feel like large parts of my brain (mainly the parts that process emotions) never developed past childhood.  i always feel partially like a terrified 5 year old in an adult body.  even though i can function relatively well as an adult , i still feel/process emotions in the way a young child would.  emotions (both good and bad) are all-encompassing, intense, full-body experiences for me, that can quickly become overwhelming if left unchecked.  
each emotion i feel is like experiencing that emotion for the first time.  imagine having to go through this constantly, every day of your life.  Anyway my point is there is still a large part of my psyche that’s basically a terrified 5 year old child.  This part of my consciousness is constantly in agonizing pain and is hopelessly confused as to why it’s so fucking painful to just be alive.  I constantly starve for that unconditional love and warmth i never truly felt as a child.  i’m so tired, i just want to be an infant and curl up in my mother’s arms (but not my REAL mother though, she’s horrible) and sleep forever in bliss and warmth and love.  i have this weird death fantasy that when i die, a magical angel mommy will be there waiting for me, to scoop me up and bring me to heaven where i can be safe and warm and loved.  i sometimes like to think that everyone who was traumatized during childhood has a magical angel mommy waiting for them on the other side, to comfort them and nurture them in death.  i know that’s weird and pathetic.  
it’s just comforting cause otherwise i feel so lost and alone.  i have two partners and we all live together, but the relationship is often toxic and exhausting; all three of us are severely traumatized from our childhoods and we basically just end up triggering each other constantly.. and i often find myself curled up in a ball, crying and begging for my magical angel mommy to come and take me away from all this, to somewhere safe.  
this “mommy” stuff isn’t sexual for me btw, im just a terrified child starved of affection and comfort.  i had an ex who took advantage of my “mommy” issues sexually and basically appointed herself my “mommy” and used it to manipulate me, and it really messed me up badly and this is gonna sound horrible but now whenever i imagine my magical angel mommy i just end up thinking of her,
 and i hate it and i hate myself and im so gross and pathetic and i’m in so much fucking pain every waking minute, im so exhausted and i just want the pain to stop.  i want to be an infant and be gently rocked back and forth and sung to, and just bask in the love and warmth and
comfort and safety.  and my heaven would just be that moment, stretched out for infinity… where i can go to sleep and rest peacefully in infinite and never-ending love, and i can have all the cuddles and kisses and affection and never have to feel cold or alone or sad or scared ever again.  that’s all i want.
i feel like i wasn’t meant for this world and that it’s unfair and cruel that i have to be an adult when so much of me is still a terrified child who was never loved enough.  im so tired and i fucking hate myself and im in so much fucking pain and i cant do this for much longer",1678773191.0

I’m at a very unstable place in life and a break down would cost me everything. I keep working on dealing with it and working on myself but I’m going backwards anyway.

I don’t know how long its been like this but every waking moment is miserable. I always have nightmares so even in my sleep I’m stressed in a way. 

I feel like not having a moment without the weight of the world on me or being able to make decisions with a clear mind is pushing me towards insanity. 

when I try to think how to deal with all this stress, all that comes to mind is ways I’ve seen others deal with their stress. which is extremely unhelpful because that leaves me with options like becoming an alcoholic, dumping my stress on someone else, ignoring problems and living in delusion, carrying everyones stress and mine till it kills me. 

I’ve been trying the typical things they say to do but I think cpstd symptoms make those things negligible. but I’m realizing besides “meditation, go for a run, call a friend, etc” I have NO IDEA what healthy stress management looks like.

I had to fly four hours to my home town for my nans funeral, after being here a few weeks ago to say goodbye sent me spiralling into eating and drinking binges I find myself back here again. My mother, she doesn't even ask a single question about me, she only engages in superficial shit where she tells me mundane crap she's doing, defrosting her soup etc, or she's having some judgmental rant about someone or something on tv. If I tell her anything about me she glazes over, or literally completely ignores me. I don't know if she's doing it on purpose. She might ask one half hearted question and then ignores the answer or just glazes over immediately or acts disinterested. She's extremely interested in my sister or cousins or anyone else, but it feels performative but it's like they think it's genuine and I'm the only one can see how fake it is, I feel like I'm mad. she is giving my sister extra jewelery of Nans worth hundreds of dollars in front of me, I'm at the back of the funeral procession and she literally said ""you'll be bringing up the rear."" I was actually the closest with nan and lived with her as a teenager because mum's house was too chaotic and abusive. When my cousin came over with her baby it was so nice playing and cuddling him and mum just completely ignored me, she knows I had a miscarriage last time I was here after three rounds of IVF funded by myself. When my aunty was over I was holding her hand and we cuddled for so long and we were talking so lovingly to each other and I could see my mum almost seething, I just wished someone else would notice. I can't stand her face, she's like a soulless zombie or something. She doesn't rage, so it's so hard to explain her behavior, I literally feel like I'm going crazy, I feel so upset and trapped and like I want to ripy skin off. Why do I feel this way when she's not actively doing anything outwardly abusive, like why is effecting me so much. She hasn't made a single space in the bathroom for me, it's literally every surface covered in her stuff, I know her mum has just died but I feel like if I had a daughter I would make effort to clear a space, my toothbrush is literally on the floor. I had to ask her if there was a towel for me. When I got here there was no food for me, the freezer was stocked full of her diet food, thats fine I guess but I mean the house is in the middle of the suburbs, there's not really Uber eats and I don't have a car here and I'm just expected to what...not eat? When I asked to use the car to go the shops she did the familiar huff of my entire life of like I'm such a bother, and she's like, you can have it this afternoon I need it to go to the funeral home and then her bottom lip dropped like I'm supposed to feel so sorry for someone that basically treats me with contempt and I'm just mine to her crying, it's like a deflection tactic. I said, well I need to eat, she just left the room without saying anything and I know her so well she would have been rolling her eyes and cursing me as a selfish bitch or whatever else in her head. It's so hard being around her, I can't even explain it, her presence is suffocating. I don't know how I'm going to make it through the next 7 nights. I've asked so many times about all my photos (they are in her house she's selling) and if they've been thrown out (she has a history of throwing my things out) and she just keeps acting like it's no big deal, my sister is the same. It's like I don't matter at all, or they actively erase anything important to me, it feels like they are also happy when I'm disempowered, I dont know how to explain it, but they keep trying to get me to move back to my home town and mum is like she will buy a house and I can live with her, like wtf, she has zero self awareness, she wants me there for what exactly, it feels like they just want a family punching bag to shit on and denigrate and just be a failure or less than them. They act like I'm so pitiful because I don't own a house etc but living in a major city is expensive, I went to university and am building a life doing what is meaningful for me. None of my three siblings even made it past grade ten, and work blue collar jobs. There's nothing wrong with that but I don't think they understand the sacrifices you have to make to pursue a career rather than just fall into something, especially if you don't have contacts or family support. It's snobby of me, but they are so ignorant, my mum is so racist and just watches a steady stream of propaganda tv and bitterly makes declarative statements about shit she has no idea about, I work as a policy researcher and developer, I am part of the art community, do you think they ask what I think or listen to me when I bother to say anything, even when I say it self deprecatingly just to join the conversation they just ignore me, 7 more days I feel like I'm suffocating.

I had made some big strides in getting healthier this year and I have some friends who enjoy spending time with me when things are good. But as soon as shit hits the fan (my lease unexpectedly ended... scrambling now for new jobs and new house) suddenly there's talk about ""emotional capacity"" ""therapist"" and talking to ""other friends.""

I feel like a lot of people enjoy being casual friends with me. They like when I joke around and when I'm fun and upbeat... but they're not open to being much more. I get that what I'm looking for is a role traditionally filled by family members (Something I'm so pissed off by is when people with healthy families cheerfully casually tell me, ""it's fine, you can just get a found family""' can I, really, karen?? How, pray tell, when my so-called found family turn down my invitations for holidays to go be with their actual family?) 

Something extremely painful is the idea that it's *good* and *healthy* for my friends to ""maintain boundaries."" I have to put on a mask and fake it with everyone... whether that's at work, with my roommates (well... I'm currently staying at abusive family.. I'll take roommates over this any day), with friends. There is no place where I belong, am loved and accepted, cared for and cherished. I have a sibling who I feel the closest to that with but they live across the country and have admitted they feel the pressure of being the only close person I have.

Everyone eventually tells me that. I have a friend I've known for years who has started growing into their own life (boyfriend, new apartment, good family) and now they won't even help me move (when I've helped them many times over the years) or really talk about anything important (we used to be pretty emotionally close but now I realize most people only have so much emotional capacity and that usually gets divided up to their actual family).

I'm sick of it. What's the point of reaching out if I get shamed for doing so? Over and over again the message in childhood from my parents was ""stop having so many needs! Ew gross! Put your ugly feelings away... no one wants to see all that. No one wants to be with someone who isn't happy and cheerful and positive"" and it killed me. But now it feels like the world says the same thing just with a few extra steps (there are certain acceptable ways to be sad/traumatized/need help but oh boy don't step out of line or else your ass will get kicked to the curb). 

In my healthier times with more stability, such as when I had safe housing, I can make peace with it. I can even understand why no one likes people who ""trauma dump,"" as painful as that is to admit and see from the other side. I'm not asking for anyone to save me, parent me or be my therapist. I'm not. I'm just asking for people to be there for all of me, the good and the ""bad"". I want real friends and I want a found family, desperately.  I want people who will be there with me when I say I need to leave my abusive family's house asap, instead of trying to pass me on to someone else. It just hurts. 

I feel like recovering from trauma has forced me to confront some painful and ugly truths about the world, that I was more naively optimistic when I was delusional and dissociated. No one is coming to help. If you can't work you can't get safe or any housing. Nothing will fall into your lap.. you have to search obsessively for housing and learn to filter out the crazies. No one wants to hear your trauma or be your friend, not beyond the superficial. You are alone, in a way people with good families (or who were less traumatized, like my sibling, who not only has a relationship with our parents, but also has the relationship skills to make good friends) will never, ever understand.",1678730441.0

I'm in a quite good relationship right now, I mean, there are some issues but there's no abuse like in my past relationships. I don't have friends with whom I can talk to though, so I started to actively search for them in a way or another, or at least connect to people in some way, in fact I got this app to find pen pals, text people from all around the world.

What I realized though is that when I think about talking to people on the regular, or even just messaging people (especially men for some reason) I get this fear that I will self-sabotage in some way and sabotage my relationship- like fear that I'll develop feelings for the other person, or fear that the person will flirt with me and disappear if they find out I have a partner, but also the feeling that communicating with another person every once in a while, or more and more, means cheating on my boyfriend in a way?

It's sort of like I fear I'll have no control over my actions which is scary to me, and I feel this comes from things that happened in the past, there's some shame for sure, but I wish I could know better how to face this. I also thought this has to do with trusting myself but I get confused, I thought I trusted myself enough to not fear that I could to these things.

Eventually, they stop talking to me without saying why. I guess I get a taste of my own medicine with that—but it makes me think I’m an abuser. I start spiraling.

I usually give people their space. But I think this year, I couldn’t handle it anymore. It’s not people’s responsibility to manage my trauma. But I don’t have to tolerate abandonment or emotional unavailability or stonewalling that makes me think of the trauma.

I know this is very negative but that voice needs to be heard too and I hope some of you could give me some understanding vibe because today I am unable to give it to myself.
I need to talk it out and my therapist is still in diagnosis phase
Yes you know, I have been ""healed"" from cptsd (ah ah)and they need to fit me in a box for further treatment. So right now I do not have anyone to talk to.
If any of you has enough energy to read me I am already thankful.

I am so exhausted with justice right now it's barely bearable.
I have been diagnosed with cptsd 5 years ago. I did 3 years of emdr and many years of therapy.
I am now back to my therapist and it sucks.
I have now a good life,  a house,  a good partner steady incomes...

But I can't keep my anxiety in check.
The thing is I have 2 children that are impacted by our parenting (my ex husband and I)
I can't manage their anxiety or respond according to their needs.

It makes me feel extremely guilty and builds up aton of fear for them, which I can't really control.

I really do my best but this has been so draining since so long I feel like I can't make a difference anymore.

I have been in acult for years and then went I finally got out went into a marriage that was toxic for both of us.
He was so anxious all the time, every little thing was scrutinized and I was blamed for his mental state.

Now I am having the kids full-time with my partner and they are teenagers so I can of have every problems on my plate. He still criticize if I forget an appointment or to inform him of something.

I fought so much for both of my kids, went through the difficult process of family therapy, social workers, hurdles with schools.
I really gave my all to be a beter person,  EMDR is no walk in the park...

I feel like a failure for not being perfect as the world outside would like to see me.
I feel like I can't meet the expectations of what a good mother should be.

Seeing my kids with the same anxiety as mine is devastating, to say the least.
I creeps under my skin and if I didn't know they need my love so much I would have end it already.

Only you guys can understand the inner war that that is. I do not think any other can understand how much effort it takes just to be ""in the norm"".

During these past years, my divorce, the problems at school for my kids, the dad repproaching any of Mt decisions, the psychologist,  I went through so much observation of my own behavior!

I just want to have a normal day, without that fucking crippling anxiety about all what's gonna/may happen. I need a fucking break !

I just want a normal life, fun, rest, good communication without having to cope with the fears of others on top of mine (my kids my ex partner). 

I am becoming obsessed with my appearance lately because that is maybe the only thing I can still control.
So I keep myself busy with that and that keeps me in check somehow.

But I do not know for how long and sometimes I would like an holiday without my kids to be able to breathe. I feel judged on every corner of my life:

""I didn't do that on time, I didn't say the right word, I didn't see the whole picture, I didn't give enough understanding, I wasn't structured enough, I should give them more discipline, I shouldn't do this or that, I should do this or that !""

Do people know I am just a mum trying desperately her best to manage the best life for my kids and still trying to have some room for myself in that ?
Because I still do have some issues too.
Now I have to fix my kids (because I love them and want the best  for them naturally) but I can't fix all and it makes me feel like I am trapped in the guilt and shame of bringing 2 innocent beings in a world that I can't deal with myself.

It's so fucking painful, it hurts me so deep and I so not have the luxury to stay in that pain because days go by like sand between my fingers.

I still fight for them but if they were my friends I'll pause that friendship for my own sanity.
Now it's my responsibility to make them somewhat functional as adults.
And their fears are also partially my responsibility.
I did that to them, I was living in fear of my husband daily and imprinted my kids with wrong coping mechanism.

Now I have healed partially,  but I am not there yet.
How do I give them what I do not have, how arethey going to reach adulthood.

When they were small I could just heal them with a warm sentence a hug, a positive attitude but now the stakes are high!

I mean if they screw up their school years a hug wouldn't help it, and I do not have enough money to keep them until 30!

So fear of their future basically leads my life 90% of the time and I want that to stop.

I do breathing techniques,  try to stay in the present but anytime a hurdle happens I feel broken, beaten, exhausted.
I keep going though,  I'll never give up for them, but the dread, the fear, it stays...

I wish I could be an hermit honestly,  I need time to find myself back, I need silence and some love.

I need someone to tell me how good I do, how much difference I make, I need some fucking gratitude for the inhumane efforts I have made through so many years.
For my own survival,  healing but foremost for my kids.
I wish they'll never hear that but if they weren't thereI would have end it.
Not that that is the case now, I have a good partner with whom life is fulfilling.

I really need my internal loving dialog to be back, I can't find it.

So I'll return to external prayers and ask my angels to give me some needed support, meanwhile if any of you can relate and give me a much needed different perspective or understanding I'll be very grateful.

Thanks",1678781600.0

I quietly and sadly said, yes, I know. I had that realization last year or so. 

How can a thing like that happen? How could I let myself get to this point? I mean, I did feel deep inside that what was happening would eventually kill me, but I always thought it will be over soon, just one more day, then the meds will help, the doc will be able to help.

Background: my husband had brain tumor, then developed PLMS, which everyone took as focal seizures that should be stopped before they would generalize, so I watched him at night, worked 40 hrs a week, did everything around the house, my appetite went out the window, I discontinued to eat, I lived in fear every day. This went on for months, and after 6 months I could barely walk straight any longer before one night at an epilepsy center they discovered that it wasn't epilepsy but PLMS, which isn't dangerous and doesn’t need to be watched. By then, I had collapsed, my insides screamed, I was crying every night and also during the day, my dysfunctional childhood had found its way into my present, in short: I was a mess, and I've been trying to heal for 2.5 yrs.

So how the hell did I let this happen to me? And when I sought help in 2020 because I couldn't think straight any longer, the docs only asked about my poor husband and didn't see that I was collapsing, and I thought it was my job to take care of my husband like that.

It's so ""interesting"" to see that a dysfunctional childhood would lead me to accept torture-like circumstances as normal, and to think my needs don't matter! Wow, bye boundaries, bye needs, bye self-care, bye self-compassion! Just wow, how a person can ignore oneself so completely!",1678776704.0

I really need help

I am 22f engaged to 25m, we met on tiktok and have been long distance for almost 2 years. We have been able to travel and visit each other nearly every 1–2 months. However, i feel my overall health and mental health has declined greatly, along with my happiness.

It started out very exciting, it was so new and so far away. We talk every day and share the same values and many interests. However after 3 months of knowing each other his exgf reached out and told me he was abusive. He had already told me about the difficult relationship prior. When I told him he didn't defend himself he just said it was up to me and he wasn’t going to try to convince me. So I decided to stay with him and brush it off.

A few months go by and we argue constantly about religion and I end up in tears most arguments. It seemed to get better and get worst constantly. Throughout our relationship there are peaceful times and really painful times, almost cyclically.

I also have sexual trauma from prior abuse and made it clear early on I did not want anything sexually until further into our relationship. However that did not happen and we ended up getting sexual much earlier. This plunged me into trauma responses and ptsd episodes. Which he doesn’t make an effort to understand.

anyways about 6 months ago he proposed, i was really startled and did say yes. But before I said yes my brain was screaming that I am not ready yet. Now we are three months away from our wedding and I have found videos of ex on tiktok talking about how abusive he was, along with other people online agreeing with her…

I don’t trust my intuition because of my ptsd and severe anxiety, maybe I am overthinking? Maybe he was the one abused? Maybe these people are lying?

I also wonder if these are just tough things that we just need to work through, however most times I bring up any worries or concerns he dismisses them and says I am not grateful enough and that is why I am sad. That I need to go to therapy and get help because I am hurting the relationship. I do need therapy I know that and I do try to fix the things about me that are not good.

He also has Chrons disease so I don’t know if i am being too hard on him and maybe because of his health he acts like this?

I have stopped voicing things to him because I feel so shut down. We have already paid so much of the wedding I am afraid and so scared. So many people will be mad at me. So many people will lose their money.

I don't know if I should go through with the wedding and am worried I am in an abusive relationship.

I am graduating college and moving across the country to marry him and I am so scared right now and have no one to talk to.

I feel really nauseous all the time but I don’t know what to do. I feel really lifeless and remember times when I was happier. I feel really hurt by him but try constantly to do things and show him love. I try to put away my own feelings and be the bigger person but it hurts again and again. I need help",1678723963.0

I have BPD, ADHD, anxiety, a history of eating disorders, etc. My dad died when I was 5 years old and my mom married an abusive man. He didnt physically abuse me, but it was emotional abuse and I watched him sometimes physically abuse my mom. Anyways, I thought the stem of all of my issues was from the abandonment of my dad dying and I was sooooo wrong.

My mom and I dont have the best relationship- she struggles to show love and her mom had the same problem. While I was on this trip, I was able to see myself as a 2-3 year old and I learned that I felt rejected by my mom, like she was disgusted by me. I cant explain it but it was SO CLEAR. This theme continued throughout my life; i was disgusting, unlovable, never good enough. And then after my dad died, I got fat and I was a fat kid until college when the ED's began. When I was a fat kid, my mom would shame me and then I knew for certain that I was disgusting. She also has self image problems and thinks fat people are disgusting. I realized that I became fat to protect myself, like I already thought I was disgusting to her, so I became physically disgusting that way I had a reason in my head for why I was never good enough for her.

It all makes sense and I never would have learned this without the trip.",1678743629.0

I'm studying at university and I have had to work so hard to get here. My class is really small since I'm in an adcanved class but we have been studying for about four years together now.   
I started theraphy lika a year ago and I have never feelt so out of touch with both my self and my social surrounding.

&#x200B;

But today is a good example for when its worse and I dont know how to not spiral down further. To add to the problem I have bad PMS right now as well so that's just the cerry on top...  


Well, we usually study at the library and sit at different single tables because its easier to focus. Today two of those I though I was a bit closer to decided to sit together whitout telling me, and we had already talked over messenger about other things and I had helped one of them earlier that day with a camera they had difficulties with.   
I went over to them and talked for a while, they feelt a bit dismissive and I asked if they had thought about when to eat lunch. Both of them answered that they had agreed on a late lunch together, not something they had told me about. And I can understand that they just didnt think about how feels because I know they would write to everyone in the chat once lunchtime would approach. But I cant help but feel left out, that they dont care, that they dont want to be with me and that its kind of unfair?

&#x200B;

They are really nice people and I know thats not what they think since this is kind of the behaviour all of us do. We just sit down where we find a table and the tables are usually taken or full. We write and invite eachother if we want to take a pause or walk and just generally invite/talk to eachother. But sometimes it just feels like I'm left out of the loop and when I talk to them I feel like I'm not really included in the cnversation even though they are activly including me.

I had extreme panick attacks when I felt ugly and would do anything and everything to feel “normal” or atleast somewhat pretty. I was completely delusional and indenial about how I actually looked. Later on I was diagnosed with BDD and through Tolles teachings, I learned that it was my primary source of form identity. 
Its just so odd that now being a young adult I still have flashbacks of those panick attack, anxiety filled thoughts that ran through my head just because I felt that I wasnt as pretty as other girls.

My second therapist also means well (he's still technically my therapist now) but he is not trauma informed. He claims to be, but dismisses my assertions of childhood trauma and doesn't seem to readily understand the concept of emotional neglect. He also basically disappeared for three months during the worst time of year for me (the whole winter) due to a technical oversight in regards to his license renewal process.

On the tail end of waiting for him to get his shit together, I decided to go for a psychiatrist instead. Technically a psychiatric nurse practitioner, by the end of the introductory hour I was about to start crying because I felt so validated. She told me none of this is my fault and that I did the best I could with the resources I had at every turn. She helped me validate the limitations of my success as a child, and to draw lines connecting failings I had self-blamed to the extremely emotionally unstable and unpredictable home life I endured.

I was so relieved I nearly started crying. I didn't know what to say. I kept thanking her.

She prescribed me a beta blocker to try, she said it will help make it so triggers don't derail my whole life like they sometimes do now.  And at the end she gave an unsolicited diagnosis of the DSM's equivalent to cptsd.

This is a huge turning point for me.

If you're not getting the kind of help you need from the people who are supposed to be helping, please don't be afraid to keep looking.

Right now I have hope in a way that I haven't had in years, maybe ever.

Addendum: I also had a very hard night afterward, wherein I was very sensitive and triggerable. It's like I let my guard down in anticipation of these new solutions. And I felt attacked by my partner's inconsiderate behavior, and nearly had a panic attack. I probably should have gone and got the medicine last night.

My entire youth has been unusually cruel and even in my 20s any active steps to improve my life fell flat on me. Maybe it sounds silly but I envisioned a glamorous, artistic life. But my reality was just misery, unfairness and pain. First best friends that lasted longer than just a few years, abandoned me in college when I became depressed and had to be hospitalized. I get out alive, get an ECT, made new best friend, thought I finally found light. Joined a DBt program as well. My family got me my first dog finally, something they denied me in childhood even though I was a lonely bullied child who could have used one. But I was grateful. I had to graduate college, with honors that I worked hard for, completely ALONE.
My mom just whined the whole day. 

Her roommate had a crush on me, agreed on a date, seemed like a nice chivalrous man, maybe I’ll finally have friendship AND love. Had my first kiss with him, then he proceeded to SA me. My friends? My birthday happened a month later, they ghosted and never protected me or stood up for me or did anything of the sort. 

I avoided socializing for a long time. Had never even been to a nightclub and I was already 25, but decided to go ONE night with a “friend”. That one and only night of any attempt to be a normal 20 something who should be allowed to have grown up fun, I get almost kidnapped by gangsters who cornered me. Nobody helped me so I had to call the police myself. Last night of any social life.

Oh btw I didn’t mention all the times I was sexually exploited and emotionally abused in hospital settings, but it was plenty. And car accidents? Many. Still I got back on the road now, but haven’t been able to go on a rosd trip even though I love them. Oh well.

I was again taken advantage of and SAd on a hospital. I tried to sue but pos dad wouldn’t support me and couldnt find a willing lawyer. My only remaining best “friend” slowly withers out of my life too and became addicted to drugs. Pretty much any friends I made withered out of my life with any crisis I had. I have only one close one left and she lives far. And my whole life is a fucking crisis. 

Every job I get us way lower paying than I deserve, especially cause I’m intellectually very smart, but my inability to function in any normal human way without a stupid breakdown has kept me very poor and stuck most of my life. My smarts are useless I guess. And I’ve been bullied and harassed by so many managers too because I interview well so I end up disappointing people and the meaner ones end up raging at me for letting them down with my PTSD flaws.

Oh and my family blamed me for all the abuse I incurred and took my dog from me. My dad grew close to him and just selfishly took him for himself. Now I have no pet.

Now I look back bleakly on what should have been my most love filled, beautiful best years like I have literally been plunged into hell and I am completely alone. I feel like a grandma or like one of those old people that’s left to die in a facility at the age of 28. 

Never attended weddings, baby showers, parties, girl trips, concerts, any of the things I was promised would be in my “best years as a girl”. Not even just brunches, lunch dates or just normal things on a regular basis to keep me grounded and connected in thus  dump of a world. Celebrations like graduations and birthdays are extremely depressing for me because I love them but nobody loved me enough to ever celebrate me. My dad literally said because I was a “bad child” when I WAS 5, he didn’t want me to have highschool graduation party like they threw for my younger brother. 

I have no good pictures or memories on my walls to look back on in the dark times. Everyone leaves me, no matter what, so what does it matter to try now. 

My whole life has been a dark time that any attempt at escaping and building normalcy is just futile. “Chosen family” and “soul tribe” just feels like something a snake oilsmen would say at this point because I was clearly denied mine even though I tried hard to build it. I’m not sure what to do anymore. I HAD dreams of being an artist, having loving fun friends and a romantic partner. I don’t anymore because clearly it’s not my right anymore in this life. 

I no longer want a normal life because it clearly hasn’t wanted me while I was younger and had energy to change, and now I’m exhausted and have no energy or desire left anymore to change. Any therapist attempting to get me to choose to go to social events, use coping skills and do a normal job just angers me. Why should I have to fit in to just normal society with all the hard work and torture and none of the benefits? That’s how I feel. I’ve worked and worked for ABSOLUTELY no reward like a slave and I don’t want that anymore. Started over AGAIN AND AGAIN AND IM FUCKING TIRED. I just want my dream life to either fall in my lap or just quit. And quitting is more realistic at this point. Because why would the world hand me my dreams anyway? So I give up. 

I’m gonna delete this later but I absolutely had to get my story out because it’s just bone crushingly unfair and I can’t bear it anymore. Not a single person in my life has truly loved me, and though was blessed to have the gift to see beauty in life and be loving despite the cruelty, it’s gone now. My soul has died. I don’t want to live but I’m not necessarily suicidal either.

I don't remember what the numbers are to call for the  crises regarding this stuff but I wouldn''t mind some... Idk.... pointers? from the people who've been in similar situations.

Background: I was originally with a guy I trusted for a couple years; he ended up *not* being who I thought he was - or trustworthy- and after several ~extreme~ fights, it resulted in abortion... Which ending our engagement (to marriage).

Present:  It's been years since then and STILL I can hardly sleep a wink knowing I killed my unborn child. My family is religious but I've (before since 
) gone no contact with them, so they don't know. My current partner does indeed know... and he mentions it every couple of years (out of 5yrs together - but he doesn't know I'm clearly not over it). I don't bring it up on my own. I don't talk about it because I can't stomach it.

When he brings it up asking questions, I know he's innocently curious.. and I try to answer honestly yet vaguely, then the topic is changed and dropped. He's incredibly respectful but I still can't breathe when he mentions ""it.""

My upbringing reminds me I'm a disgusting and unjust/untrustworthy woman... But my heart says I might be good still regardless. I don't know where to look from here; I've repented and prayed to be forgiven, but I don't know what else to do - or think.

My therapist straight up told me she doesn’t think i was abused, because abuse has to have a “discernable pattern” and “hurt” you. she said to my face i wasn’t abused because i wasn’t “hurt bad enough”. i’m actually so done. I finally have the courage to open up and talk to someone about the emotional and physical abuse i’ve been experiencing my whole life and i’m told it wasn’t real. 

My therapist said to me, if it makes me feel better to call it abuse, i can. 

She asked if i thought it was abuse. To that, I said, yes, I do think it was abuse. And I don’t think the intent mattered, whether it was meant to be cruel or not.

She said I can call it abuse if I want but she doesn’t think it would help. Apparently it wasn’t bad enough for me to go to the hospital or have CPS get involved.

This actually feels like my last straw. I’m so sick of all the fucking gaslighting. This is basically a follow up to my last post, called “my therapist isn’t sure if i’m being abused”. That post has some details about the abuse I’ve faced, for reference.",1678748679.0

Is it a proper excuse? Not really. But I never got to have those college years. Never  got to have those young adult experiences. So, I'd do anything to be  part of that 18 to 22 age group again. I would do so many things in fact  if I could magically be 18 again.

But  this is the life I have been given, but make no mistake to the people  that are my age in this subreddit. I fucking resent that I am in the  same age group as you. I resent that your my options for platonic  friends and romantic partners. Because I missed out on so much life, I'm  just closed off to making friends and finding a girlfriend at this  point. Cause reality is, people my age would realistically be my only  options. Lately, I have been trying to find acceptance that I missed out  on my window for a thriving social life.

To the people my age or older, I don't want you. Besides, you're probably too busy anyway for friends.

I think as time goes on, my goal is to stay out of people's way.

I  want to be 18 again. I still want the college experience. I still want  to live in the dorms. I still want to rush a fraternity. I still want  that tight knit free spirited young adult friend group that I'll never  get to have.

But, for example, i’m an identical twin, I have severe ADHD so i was more hyperactive, spacey, talkative, etc. because of this, a lot of the ‘discipline’ (re: abuse) was because i was too loud, too obnoxious, being annoying etc.

Additionally, the idea of being loved and accepted and seen is bringing up relentless shame. Like it just won’t stop.

If I have ASD, there's no way my family doesn't have it too. I think the diagnosis is often used by incompetent, invalidating families who offset all their bullshit onto others. Same with BPD.

My mom is very flat, lacks love and had shame and blamed me most of my life. My father was extremely verbally abusive (would threaten to shoot me at times), physically and emotionally. I also believe I have some repressed sexual abuse, unsure from who but I have become more and more aware of things. I would steal all the time as a child from my moms best friend, I’d steal at school, I’d run away, walk home from school, turned to drugs to cope and then was sent away to a boarding school for 4 years. I also even developed a medical condition and then was outcasted and embarrassed by my family, it resolved when I was sent away. 

I’m finding that this behavior is not because I was a bad kid but because of abuse. I’m also finding that unfortunately many of us had to deal with similar. 

So I’m 34 and it’s been harder and harder to just be ok. As I work with this person, I’m getting closer and things are becoming more challenging. The level of depression and feelings of isolation grow stronger. I have pretty much shut out my entire family. I work as a nurse but was recently fired. I also feel too tired and depressed to continue working or even want to find a job. I have a teenage son and our relationship is being impacted as well. We hardly talk anymore and I’m not sure what’s going on with me that I’m pushing him away. 

I’m really gotten into studying psychoanalysis and I’m not sure if it’s making me worse or better. I’m convinced I grew up without mirroring and am fragmenting and lack a self. I find that I also really align with Janina fishers work and have been watching that. But because I hate myself, I self harm.

CPTSD has robbed me of so much joy (particularly the last 40 years of my life). My wife says she loves me however she is ready to end our almost 30 years together as she’s had enough of the roller coaster that is my mental health.  

The lyrics are below reflect my thoughts when I was working and struggling with my mental health.  The was my life getting up and down the same thing until I couldn’t anymore.

DAE identify with the lyrics?

I'm going to rent myself a house
In the shade of the freeway
Gonna pack my lunch in the morning
And go to work each day
And when the evening rolls around
I'll go on home and lay my body down
And when the morning light comes streaming in
I'll get up and do it again, Amen
Say it again, Amen
I want to know what became of the changes
We waited for love to bring
Were they only the fitful dreams
Of some greater awakening?
I've been aware of the time going by
They say, in the end, it's the wink of an eye
When the morning light comes streaming in
You'll get up and do it again, Amen
Caught between the longing for love
And the struggle for the legal tender
Where the sirens sing and the church bells ring
And the junk man pounds his fender
Where the veterans dream of the fight
Fast asleep at the traffic light
And the children solemnly wait
For the ice cream vendor
Out into the cool of the evening
Strolls the pretender
He knows that all his hopes and dreams
Begin and end there
ah, the lovers as they run through the night
(Leaving nothing) leaving nothing but to choose off and fight
And tear at the world with all their might
While the ships bearing their dreams
Sail out of sight
I'm gonna find myself a girl
Who can show me what laughter means
And we'll fill in the missing colors
In each other's paint-by-number dreams
And then we'll put our dark glasses on
And we'll make love until our strength is gone
And when the morning light comes streaming in
We'll get up and do it again
Get it up again
I'm gonna be a happy idiot
And struggle for the legal tender
Where the ads take aim and lay their claim
To the heart and the soul of the spender
And believe in whatever may lie
In those things that money can buy
Where true love could have been a contender
Are you there? Say a prayer for the pretender
Who started out so young and strong only to surrender",1678746803.0

I struggled with suicidal ideation for years, I genuinely could not tell you how many years outside of it being somewhere around four, or how many attempts with how bad my mental state was and how uncontrolled my dissociative states, depressive episodes, and flashbacks were. It was torture. 

You want to know what I never realized because of how badly I was doing? My SI episodes would ease off for a week, or three, but then I would wake up and the day would already be wrong, or someone or something innocuous would send my mind off into that spiral again and I was back to battling against myself for my own survival for a few days or weeks. It never fuckin occurred to me that this was happening in a cycle. I was so far gone in my depression and dissociation I never noticed it. I was seeing a complex trauma specialist who has literally won awards for their work... and while she empathized with me when I had those episodes, she never noticed, either. We were all too focused on me having CPTSD and managing it's symptoms. It was all the CPTSD's fault I was so fucked up, after all. My ace score is too high for it to be anything else, right?

Nope. Turns out, fucking hormone disorder. 

Outside of this, I was starting to have really bad menstrual cramps, and they were getting worse each cycle. So much so that I got fed up with my typical gynecologist and her awful care and sought out an endometriosis specialist (sidenote, my ex-gyno said the specialists were only in the nearest city three hours away, Google found me one ten minutes closer to my house than the gyno lying to me :)) 

I immediately got diagnosed with both endometriosis and PMDD at the end of my first appointment with my specialist. I kinda knew what endometriosis was but had no fucking clue about PMDD. Y'all? Y'all. That shit is intense and I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD A FUCKING CLUE if I didn't have a completely separate and much more severe gynecological issue going on. 

So my specialist puts me on a combination birth control pill (much to my hatred with my experience with them, but desperate is desperate), not just a regular dose of three weeks on, one week off. She sets my refills high and instructs me to skip the placebo weeks entirely and move on to the next package as soon as I've run through the active pills. The first pill I was on really sucked, my stomach felt awful for a month, my sleep was wrecked, exhausted, joints popping all over the place(only a problem if you have  connective tissue disorder; hormones affect how stiff/loose our joints are) and a few other symptoms that weren't great but I knew I had to wait out. 

Unfortunately it takes up to six months to adjust to hormonal treatments, a lot of gynecologists won't be super clear about that but the endocrine system cannot change quickly, so you really do have to sit and deal with a handful of shitty side effects until your body acclimates. I switched to a different pill that ended up working better with my body at the six or nine month mark and didn't have any negative side effects from switching, so once you get through starting it's easier to try different prescriptions to find what works best for you. 

I don't remember the specific amount of time it took for me to notice, but somewhere between month three and six I was noticing I wasn't waking up and already interpreting the day as being awful. My irritability was leveling out. I was starting to sleep better (despite the pills causing insomnia at first) and while I was still having flashbacks and dissociative episodes and all of the other 'fun' stuff that comes with CPTSD it wasn't hitting as hard as it used to? The suicidal urges went from being weeks long events to short bursts of being upset and dysregulated for a few hours, or at most a day. Like... Fucking what? It felt stupid. It still feels stupid.

I'm not suicidal anymore. I haven't been for four years now! Not gonna lie, there have been bad days, like I had a big trigger that set me off into a strong SI episode, but i had my lease pulled out from under me so I was literally losing my home and I was out of that episode by the next day. So that seems like a pretty acceptable reason to be that bad off compared to, like, the butter being left out overnight, even though it doesn't spoil. 

Thousands of dollars in therapy did not do anywhere as much for my mental and physical health (though it did and does do a whole hell of a lot to help me) as getting on a dumb little $9/month hormone did for me. 

It's not fucking easy but if any of you also have it and don't know, or don't know that some treatments can work for it, it is absolutely worth the months of annoying side effects to *get the fuck out of your own mental hellscape.* I still encounter my CPTSD on a near daily basis to some degree, but it's a soft kitten when it used to be a pissed off tasmanian devil in comparison. This won't be a fix for everyone, but if this can help even one of you then this long personal ramble has been worth it.

I am wondering if anybody has ways of learning to trust others, especially in the context of romantic relationships. I was discussing with a friend of mine how I'm feeling a bit apprehensive in a new relationship I'm in. my partner is super supportive, extremely sweet, and there are some differences between us but none of which I've ever seen as deal breakers just a matter of liking different things and having different lifestyles. yet for some reason I cant shake I just feel apprehensive and cant see myself with this person long term and am debating calling it off, but also having hesitance in calling it off too. 

my trauma stems from a lot of emotional neglect and sexual abuse, often the two related because of how I was not taken seriously, and was taught I cant stand up for myself, and taught a very unhealthy view of people pleasing for an abusive partner by my mother. So, my friends suggested that maybe my current feelings of the relationship could be due to trust issues developed from my past. I think they're right because there is no logical explanation as to why I would not want to be with the guy I'm with other than trust issues. 

so I have 2 questions for you, 

1. how the fresh heck do I start trusting him, or just, people in general?

2. I also want to talk to him about these feelings but i dont want to break up with him, i want to work with him through it, but I am not even sure how to have that conversation because how do I tell somebody ""hey I'm emotionally feeling like I want to break up with you but logically I dont""?!

and for the record, my partner knows the general idea that I've experienced some bad trauma, I disclosed to him I suspect I have CPTSD/PTSD, and I havent gone into specifics but i told him I had a very bad upbringing and also struggle with physical intimacy, which he has seemed very supportive of so far. 

any advice or tips would be appreciated. love y'all.",1678767586.0

Here's what I wrote. 

Trigger warning!

>!Be me: I'm 10 yo and made friends with this kid that was 7 or 6 yo. He was being babysat next door. We LARP'ed resident evil stories and played video games. We had stupid kid fun. His dad (divorced from his mom and has little to no custody) accused me of being a pedo and a molester at 10! Heres the twists. The babysitters would actually have sex around him ( I don't know if it was in front of him, but i knew it was at least indecent exposure at the least), and he came over to get away from that. The second twist is at the time I was being abused by my brother and was r**ed. But somehow, I'm the bad guy for being a man who's like 4 years older than him?  Fuck that! Both me and him hated his dad for being so dumb. !<

It's the time I decided not to continue this cycle of abuse. The time I was probably the most responsible in my entire life. Taking care of him was a point of pride.

Most of the time it feels that all that’s left of me is a wisp, a thin and choking remnant of what I could have been.

I used to be a model in New York City. I had a beautiful smile and big, deep, brown eyes. She used to walk down the street with her headphones, her sensors up, feeling for the stares of strange men, this validation the only thing she knew to keep her going.
That girl didn’t know how to laugh. And even though I’m still empty, sometimes a real laugh breaks through the surface and catches me by surprise. It took 30 years for me to experience what a real laugh feels like.

I look out from behind my eyes and watch my thumbs typing away, my daughter next to me pointing out the Spider-Man toy she wants from an Amazon magazine. I do everything in my power to stay with her, to not dissolve into nothing.

I wonder if this thin wisp of a self that I am will ever find it’s way to it’s wisp friends so that they can unite and I can feel whole, or if they are disconnected forever, all the parts lost and floating in the abyss.",1678745712.0

I had been living since the beginning of 2020 in a family house in the middle of nowhere, with my bf, I was tired of having nothing to do so last summer I went back to my father's house to work so I would wait for my boyfriend to finish his job contract. I went to my fathers even though it triggered me a lot bcs that is where my traumas happened (controlling narcisist), but I managed to stay there using small pieces of fentanyl patches so that I could sleep at night. (I have insomnia and nightmares).  In september we met again to go move in a new house. what happened is that he screamed at me and behave superficially about my condition. so it led me to think  that once I stayed with someone that didn't love me the way I did, that i built up a relity in my head. so I stopped sleeping. I was trapped in my pain and started smoking heroin (1st time in my life). I only used it to self medicate, I am very disciplined due to my upbringing so my problem was not a potential addiction.

Anyway at the end of October visited a house to move there, it was supposed to be rented furnished but the estate agent showed it to us with no furniture nor appliances so I didn't proceed to rent it. so in november we moved to a residence and I had to give my dog away. my insomnia got worse, because I didn't have a place to stay. there are almost no houses to rent in this part of italy, they almost only rent if you have a permanent job contract, really hard to get in italy.

we stayed in the residence also in december, it was a terrible experience also with the owners.

In january we went to another region and started looking for a place there, I wanted a house with a temporary contract and I visited one, it was only a bit expensive but I wasn'y thinking straight due to heroin and I did not take this one either! because i found an agency online with many houses which later turned to be a scam.

So at the end of january I was so tired of staying in hotels that I went to my fathers house, but this time I started having vivid nightmares and would be terrified until mid day. In february I got us a house to rent from april, I was terrified from the nightmares and from losing these other houses so being in survival mode I took what I feel to be a wrong decision. I ended up in the city I grew up in which there is nothing to do and doesn't offer job opportunities. I hate this place. So know I have a very hard time forgiving myself, and I feel so weak that my trauma ruined my life so much. Also I feel that I don't love my bf as I did before because he didn't help me taking the right decisions when I was not ok with my mind.

775,Now I realize why it's so hard for me to indulge in my pleasures: because every pleasure comes with anger towards my parents,25,11q5fj5,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11q5fj5/now_i_realize_why_its_so_hard_for_me_to_indulge/,4,"I realize that why it's so hard for me to let myself indulge in pleasures, enjoy things, enjoy life, is because my parents since I was born forbid me to do what I wanted to do. What would bring me joy, pleasure and overall satisfaction in the long term.

Things like:

* my mother was very selective and strict with the kids I could spend time with, and with until how long I could stay outside unsupervised. She judged the friends I made, always wanted to make sure personally that they were ""good"". She didn't want me to be outside too late in the day, way earlier than other kids would
* She forbid me to consume lots of things that I desired: any videogame, movies and TV shows that ""weren't for my age"", food that I wanted but that ""wasn't healthy""
* She shamed me when she saw me touching myself in the car when I was starting puberty and I didn't understand what I was doing
* Basically, my mother was hyper controlling and shaming in all areas of my life

So, all of this makes that nowadays, whenever I indulge in a pleasure of mine and let myself enjoy myself and feel pleasure, no matter in what way, I feel very angry because ""Oh, so this is the enjoyment I could have had my whole life, but I didn't because you fucking stupid bitch limited and restricted me from doing anything at all I wanted to do and that my body craved???! Fuck"".
And then I have to deal with that anger.

So this is why it's so hard for me to let myself pursue pleasure, because every pleasure for me comes with an amount of anger that I have to deal with parallelly.  Basically for me there's no pleasure without its accompanying anger.

So it's very hard. Because pleasure for me takes hard work to handle. Actually every time I feel pleasure I get ""high"" or numb because I realize that my whole life is a lie and my inner worlds collide.",1678701203.0

Eventually he made me stand up and I automatically backed away till my foot hit a bin I didn't see, and that was it. I ran out.

I went to another empty room and I heard him coming and told him to stay away. It was all so irrational. I eventually went back but I was so terrified, of what, I'm not even sure, I asked if I could go home, I barely got inside the room, I just grabbed my stuff and left.

I'm currently looking into more ways to heal. i read that self hate is one of the core characteristics of CPTSD... 

I generally have very low self esteem regarding myself (I don't deserve to be heard, to have desires, to feel good, I am not smart, funny, interesting, I should not be alive etc.), but the last two years I have *really* struggled with a crushing case of BDD (body dysmorphic disorder). I can admit my view of myself is quite distorted (aesthetically), but I also sincerely believe my facial features are indeed very ugly, *objectively*. This makes me feel extremely self conscious to the point that I hate it when people look at my face, and I wear glasses when I don't need them to hide the centre of my face (I have eye bags and a big hook nose). 

Can this be a response to trauma? I mean I could find myself ugly and *not* base my entire worth and behaviour on that. Other people may not like themselves or find themselves nice looking either, but do they stop going outside or meeting with people or doing things because of that? Most of them don't, no. So I'm wondering if my BDD/my extreme obsession and problem with my appearance (the *extremeness* of it) could be a CPTSD trauma response? The BDD has cropped up in my journey of healing, as I was starting to get better bit by bit. It feels like an internalised self sabotage in some ways.

I have not explicitly been told I am ugly as child or teenager. I have been told I am disgusting, we have cockroaches in the house because of me, I am dirty, I stink etc. I have also experienced generic intense emotional neglect and verbal abuse. Since my appearance was *not* a particular target of that abuse I wonder why it manifests as such so crazily?

Sure, it does not help that SO knows my trigger and still drinks. Still, I hate that I have become this way. I really try to calm myself, distract myself, and stay in another room. Nothing works and often my panic is heightened which I know makes no sense. 
I feel like I have broken us. My previous partner was abusive, and I struggle to forgive him. I do not and cannot expect my partner to forgive me. I cannot forgive myself. It feels like I am holding SO at arms length when I know I love them. Maybe I am scared to remain close? I think a part of me thinks I should make him leave because maybe I think it would be better for us both: his having too much alcohol cannot bother me and I cannot hurt him.I do not know. Honestly I am just sad and sick of myself and what I have done and might do etc.

Its basicly just how a close family member lost herself to mental illness, and i was the scapegoat that could be punished for anything. 

Ptsd as a diagnosis never really fit me with the Icd-10 guidelines, yet it was allways a diagnosis any therapist wanted to put on me. It was only reciently i got the diagnosis c-ptsd, as with the revised diagnosis book (icd-11) i actually got a singular diagnosis. 

Over the years i've managed to grow tremendously, anxiety is no longer a diagnosis i fit, i have managed to controll my anger and fury to a degree i once thought was impossible. I thought i was going to die before i was 18, and now im in a successful job mid education and have a promising future. So why this question? 

I've frequently moved. I sought affection like a rabid dog in my teens. Most jobs have been a year or two at the most... but i got a gf in 2017. We moved several times, we had our problems. But we bought a house. We made the relationship better and better, learned how to handle eachothers problems better, and everything was looking up. I also worked at the local nursing home, and was very well liked. And i had this magical moment: looking out the window on an open field, grass and flowers, forrests and hills, distant mountains. I could smell the fresh coffee i've made, and dinner being cooked on the first floor. I was studying for an exam, and hearing my dog snore. And i just felt this amazing calmness... if 50 years had passed in the blink of an eye, but i had the memories and were still with my gf, i would have no regrets. I was where i wanted to be, with who i wanted to be with. I cried tears of relief. And for the next two months problems came and went, yet it didnt bother me as it normally does... and i felt i could let things finaly go.

This as everything else in my life, was temporary. Because unbenounced to me, my gf wanted to end things a year earlier, but didnt have the self confidence to think she could do it alone.. and as things got better, her confidence grew. And after 5 years together, she broke up with me.  And since then, the depression and suicidality has hit way harder than it normally does. It feels like the knowledge of the good life has made the familiar and safe pain so much worse. 

So fairly reciently, i heard some youtube video about belonging. And something just clicked. My unstable childhood. Chasing affection in my teens. Frequently moving. Unable to stay in a job for long. The feeling i so desperatly long for... i avoid people because i preffer being alone, and thats because of the pain they cause. Yet what i found in my small town, in my house, with my dog, my gf, the locals... i found a feeling of belonging. And i now understand thats what i need to find again.

So for the lot of you who have managed to find said belonging... how did you do it?",1678739993.0

I have also been told that I have of PTSD from a psychologist and a psychatrist. I have nightmares once, twice, or even three times a week. I struggle with my sense of identity, and I get triggered by a lot of things. I recently had an appointment with my psych where I explained traumas and how they have affected me.

When I was younger, I had two cousins that were victims of child sexual abuse. My grandmother and mother were also victims of CSA as well. I remember playing computer while my grandma bathed my cousin. My cousin would scream in pain because while my grandmother was gentle, she couldn't stand to be touched. I remember going with my grandmother to take my 4 year old cousin to the hospital for her herpes that her abuser gave her. I remember seeing my cousin go back to her abuser father, and knowing that I would never be seeing her again. I remember walking into my room, and seeing the toys I let her play with, and bawling my eyes out at the sight of the toys on the floor. I remember my grandmother telling me about her abuse from her dad, and how my mother (who left me at age 1) went through similar abuse at the hands of her stepfather. 

My grandmother surrounded me with child sexual abuse and with abusers, and while I was never sexually abused, being surrounded by it deeply hurt my trust in my father and grandfather.

This all comes to a head where I got triggered by incest fanfic of my favorite (adult) character and his 12 year old cousin. It triggered me so hard that I left for my uncle's. When I tried to explain why I was so upset, and what happened to me, they told me that since I was not sexually abused, that I should just get over my trauma. The thing that stuck out the most to me was when I told them about how much it hurt for my rapist uncle looked at me in a sexual manner at the age of 12. They said it wasn't a crime to look, and something like 'get over it'. I do not remember because I was so upset. They also told me it was partially my fault that my grandma left the family when I was 14. I went to my dad, who told me to go here on reddit for advice and support.

I already spoke with my psychatrist, and am working on my problems in therapy. I have also asked a veteran family member, who likely knows others with PTSD, about things like support groups and group therapy. What else can I do about my PTSD, and what resources can I use?",1678753321.0

I often imagine the fall, in my mind, it is slow and graceful. The impact bringing sweet relief. But I’m not going to do that. Because the part of me that wants to survive has made it this far.

Whenever my kids fall asleep in the car, I park in my driveway, sit in the front seat, and look at the trees against the pale blue sky. Their branches fragment and reach outwards, like veins, reaching for the sun. This is my mind, fragmented into parts. Some hold secrets that I may never know. I keep them in locked boxes, tucked away, gathering dust. For a long time I was desperate to know. I clawed around my brain, trying to force the boxes open. Kicking them and knocking them over. But they held fast. The owners of those boxes won’t give in to my demands. They take their job of protecting me very seriously.

Today, as I sit, the car running, the sun sinking, the rage seeps into me like poison and threatens to tear me to pieces. The part of me that is a naked creature, baring her teeth, doubled over, enduring the pain of grief, tries to claw her way out of me. She wants to rip my body in two and emerge, and make herself known. She’s wild eyed, frantic. She wields a knife, trying to defend herself. I watch her. Beneath her wildness is a frightened little girl. A little girl who needs to be protected. A little girl who is powerless. I fear the rage will rip me to shreds and there will be nothing left of me.

Both of my parents were severe alcoholics and drug addicts until I was 4 or 5 when my mom got sober and left my dad. Then later on, my older brother was arrested and put in jail for a year for possession of marijuana, and he hasn't talked to me since, which made my issues even worse. Because of all of this, I have extreme anxiety around substances of all kinds. Anytime I think about myself or a significant other doing drugs or drinking it triggers something in me and I get bad anxiety to the point where I've had panic attacks before. Eventually I was able to feel better with alcohol, which I think happened when I finally started drinking around 22. But I still get this feeling with other drugs, and I can't exactly go with the same strategy as with alcohol given that I'm in a career where I get regularly drug tested. Not to mention I also have bipolar so it's not like it'd be safe for me anyways.

I lose movement functionality, speech, sensory feelings and to a varying degree consciousness. Only last 20-40 min. And happens in varying severity from 1-5 times a week. 
Sometimes I just space out for some moments. Sometimes I fall to the ground unconscious.

1) How do you guys handle dissociative attacks? Especially if you walk around and travel in the city by foot.

I sort of knew I wasn't going to find a lot. We had tons of photo albums, but they're in storage. The photo albums pretty much end by the time I'm 6 or 7 years old. I was a late 90s, early 2000s baby, so before phones with good camera quality. I decided to look through my mom's Facebook, and I found all these family videos from when I was around 9 or 10 years old. This was about two years after my father gained full custody of my older siblings, and it was really when my role in the family sort of took a back seat. There was this often-remarked issue amongst my siblings and their mother that I always ""got more."" I was better off because I had my two parents together, and their lives were split down the middle. They really never let anyone forget that I was luckier, including me.

So, anything that went well for me was also met with a bad attitude. For Christmas one year, I got an American Girl doll and started screaming from excitement because I'd wanted one for years. And I remember my brother yelling at me to just shut up, even though he got to scream about his video games. It was always stuff like that. If we were given ten dollars each at the store, they bought candy and I either saved my money for next time or bought stuffed animals or makeup or something. Then, they'd cry about it and say that I got more money or something. My parents really gave into this a lot, especially my father. My mom was very annoyed with it but tried to give them grace because of the situation. It was to a point where this mixed with the other more physical abuse I was experiencing led me to ask my mother to leave my father so it could just be us basically every single time we were alone. 

Anyway, I found these home videos from that time, and I was just...so sad. In every video, you've got my dad basically forcing my sisters to be on camera, and you get so many interactions and memories. I can really see some of their personalities. There's a lot of my nephew. A lot of my brothers. But the camera is rarely pointed at me. At first, I was upset with my mom for this because she was so bad with cameras back then. But then I realized she was IN the videos. Almost all of these videos were recorded entirely by my father, and unless it was a day where it was just me, him and my mom, I was barely in a single one. Even the days where it was just us, you can see where he focuses the camera in other places like seconds after getting me in the shot, where he turns away from me, where the few times we interact, his finger is directly over my face in the entire shot. Sometimes, my mom and I are walking into the shot, and the video is over every time. 

It's really sad to think about for me. I remember once when I was really young, my niece and I (I was like 6 or 7, and she was probably 3 or 4) wanted to make a music video to a Hannah Montana song. My dad set up the camera, and we went full out. It was so cute. But I remember when it was over, I looked at the camera and saw that he hadn't even been filming it. He pretended to. I'm hoping I just misunderstood how cameras worked. But I'm certain that he laughed at me when I realized this and refused to ""record"" anymore.

The saddest part is that sometimes I really truly believe that maybe I was never neglected in any way. My siblings (even the ones that I have always liked) are adamant that I never was, that the abuse I experienced couldn't possibly be as bad as theirs, that I have no reason to be how I am today. But when I see things like this, and I think about my mental health issues and my medical issues that were routinely and intentionally ignored by my father specifically (despite MULTIPLE adults in my life begging him to get me help), I know that I was very much neglected, and then made to feel grateful for it. Like my parents actively got me less of everything so that my siblings wouldn't be mad, and then they still were and still treated me like shit. 

It makes a lot of sense when I think about my emotional flashbacks. Moments where I continuously get cut off during conversations, where I feel trapped in a social situation no one wants me around for, when I feel like a pet and not a person, I feel about the size of a pea just like I do watching these videos. 

The good thing is that I did find one video I really liked. My fifth-grade graduation. My mom was putting lei on me (we lived in Hawaii at the time), one after the other while I'm literally jumping with joy because she remembered and brought them like I asked. I was so little, and I was just so happy there. I'm trying to remember that even if there isn't a lot to show that I was ever loved the way I deserved to be, that little girl still lives inside of me, and *I* can give her that love. Maybe it's not what I always wanted, but it's a love that can't be taken away from me. And I'm trying to remind myself that it counts.",1678707558.0

I need to be honest. I am really struggling to support her right now because she is so resistant to it. Her self loathing is so extreme it's like an independent creature that I can't touch. She fundamentally believes that she is a worthless piece of shit, scum of the earth waste of air. When she's triggered, if I told her to go out in the garden to sleep in the dirt, she would. She will deny herself food she enjoys, hobbies, socializing, anything that would be doing something nice for herself. When she's panicking she cannot say soothing things to herself because she thinks it's a lie, she can't even do slow breathing. Basically anything at all that helps - when she is triggered, this thing in her head is like an invisible abuser that denies her it.

And I'm just at a loss for what to do right now, because it's unbearable to just watch her suffer. I try very hard to comfort her and distract her, but literally sometimes she'll be hyperventilating and I'll tell her to try and take a deep breath, and she'll just stop breathing instead because she perceives that as her bothering me with her panic.

So spring break is over.  I was leaving home to go back to my dorm this morning.  I wasn't expecting to get a little teary but I did (probably because I'm on my period).  My dad and I hugged.

It felt nice.  I wasn't sure what to expect of his reaction but he was receptive.  I felt held.

But I forgot to take my lunch which was in the fridge.  I realized in the car and I was so mad at myself.  

My dad texted me basically saying if I hadn't been ""crying about nothing"" before I left I wouldn't have forgotten it and how I need to learn my lesson (""about worrying over things I can't control"", as if he has any fraction of fucking clue about my feelings or why I was a bit emotional).

The only lesson I learned this morning is never to cry in front of my father ever again.  

I don't like to admit it but this has ruined my day today.  I felt held.  It felt like a good memory.  And now I hate that moment.  I resent it.  I resent him.  I resent myself.  I resent this whole fucking day.

I feel like I am starting to recognize a pattern of some kind of shamed-based discipline throughout my upbringing and it irks me to my core.

I had to be a cheerleader and friend for my mom because I saw that she was exhausted from work, depressed, feeling isolated. I would clean the house, pick out her clothes and do her hairs to make her feel good, listen to her rants and validated her feelings. 

When my dad was going through his own thing with employment and with angrr issue arguing with my sister or my mom both due to
mistakes he made and when he was unfairly treated. I sided with him and listened to him so he wont feel like his feelings are invalid.

When my big sister was acting out, I was making sure she wasnt doing outrageous although I couldnt control most of it, because my mom asked me to watch her and prevent her from doing mischievous things. My mom told me she I was the only one she didnt have to worry about and was thankful for me. 

I myself was depressed and going through my own mental health (bipolar2 apparently and possibly ADHD) but I kept it a secret because I didnt want to be burden to my family. I tried to keep okay grades, pretend like I was fine, I wasnt interested or didn't want anything, that I was independent although I cried myself to sleep every night 

Now that all my family in a good place, I am spiraling out of control. But asking for help makes me feel extreme shame and it frightens the hell out of me.

A sex toy for my moms friend’s daughter, and many strangers online. maybe some not from sexual interest, but curiosity. But that doesn’t change the fact that it really hurt physically and emotionally. It really hurt when my older sister dug her nails and fingers into places that hurt.

A stress relief toy for my ex, or a bottle of medicine they throw away when they finish. 

Now the best friend I liked and considered as a sister is using me to treat me badly the same way others did to her. 

I thought she wouldn’t do this because she knows how it feels. I thought she wouldn’t replace, abandon and treat me like nothing, yet also remain extremely jealous of my other relationships. I thought I could take her away from that, from being treated like nothing, from being ignored.

So why is she doing this to me now? Why do people always treat me like some object they can vent their anger onto; sexually, physically, verbally, emotionally, mentally?

What have I ever done against them? I haven’t fought back a single time, I’m so tired.

Am I not human? Why am I being treated as less than even a child’s toy? Am I just a blowup doll to them? A blowup doll they can use, beat, humiliate, torture, hurt, scream at?

Even remaining silent through their screaming gets them angrier.

What do I do? I can’t leave my best friend, I promised her I would stay with her. I promised I would stay with her if she wanted to drag me down. 

But why can’t two people ever be happy together? Why do I always have to suffer for the one I care and love to be happy?

I’m so tired, it hurts too much, I used to be able to bear with it to see them happy. But it hurts so much now it happened so much and I just recently left an abusive relationship and this is happening again. I’m so tired. I just want to be treated as human with emotions and the ability to feel sad and pain for once. It’s not that I don’t voice my discomfort, I do, they either laugh and mock me or ignore me, or turn around and gaslight me.

848,How do I help my former fiancée-now partner cope with my traumatizing past?,0,11qoqut,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11qoqut/how_do_i_help_my_former_fiancéenow_partner_cope/,22,"EDITED

I posted similar previously but have added many more details.

I used to be a COMPLETELY different person before my current relationship, I was gross, narcissistic, dishonest, manipulative, hypocritical, hypersexual, and misogynistic and everyone in my life let me be. No one at all pushed me to stop doing the things I did or to change as a person until I met my current partner. She made me aware of everything immoral and what was harmful to others in my past lifestyle and now after educating myself and seeing on my own how bad so many of the things I did were (and how normalized they are by people who don't bother to educate themselves on the true impact), it’s hard for me to comprehend what kind of person I was fully. I did so much because the predators and perverts (patriarchy) on the internet made it seem normal, and no parent or girl held me accountable.

I am 21M. I found porn at 13 and watched it until I met my partner when I turned 19y. I did the majority of the worst things I’ve done at 16. Just to put into perspective how recent my “past” is.

My partner is the first person I’ve ever told about everything I’ve done including what I’ve done behind closed doors, because she’s the first person to ever ask, and I was never forthcoming. She pieced a lot together just from learning how I spoke about girls to others and went from there. To get an idea of what she can’t stop getting flashbacks/intrusive thoughts about, here are some of the things I’ve done:

I dated and pursued many 14yo as a 16yo when I just wanted them for sex

I took advantage of a vulnerable 13yo and kissed them (without good intentions) while at a dance as a 16yo then dated that 13yo as a 16yo.

Masturbated to close friends’(minors) social media

Masturbated to girlfriends’ friends’ and SISTERS’ social media(minors)

Looked for masturbation material in a girl’s prom dress try-on YouTube video(that her bf was in)(a minor).

Masturbated to celebrity deepfakes and upskirts

Masturbated to actresses in shows I obsessed over for years and years and watched with girlfriends and my sister

Opened gay porn on 12yo sister’s laptop as a 14yo, exposing her to porn in a vindictive way and she has admitted to causing her trauma

Called celebrities(mostly skinny young blondes) “hot” to my sister, brother(7yrs younger than me), and girlfriends throughout my teens, sexualizing and objectifying so many teen girls

Had a type for petite teen blondes and outright said that was my favorite porn category while talking to a guy friend about a girl I ended up dating, and I only dated short skinny girls.

My current partner is a spiritual demisexual voluptuous curly haired brunette dancer, who’s thiccer & more athletic than my skinny self.

In the first month after we met, I showed her a TikTok of a young blonde skateboarding and said “Ooh, skate towards me” moments before we saw a movie where I said a blonde was hot both in such gross ways.

Within a week either right before or right after I started dating a girl I sa’d her identical sister. I also masturbated to them and their third identical sister’s posts on social media. I also cheated on them by kissing an ex, before I lost my virginity cheating with someone I barely knew. Did I mention the girl I cheated on told me she couldn’t have sex because of trauma from rape!?

My partner has her own betrayal trauma&CPTSD on top of all that I’ve given her. And I didn’t instantly become a good man. I was abusive in so many ways for like 9 months and even now, after a year and 7 months, I still need to improve in a lottt of important ways.

It's hard for her because she feels like she's trying to love a predator and my lack of talking/remembering triggers her because I hid SO much. She's dated men who said they would get help and it didn't work but they were older and she wants to work things out due to how much I have changed but I abused her and neglected her while she was hurting from my past, including taking advantage of her sexually with coercion, after yelling, aggression, stonewalling, changing stories, excusing actions, hiding big and small issues, and abandoning or shaming her for her tears and anger while I treated her this way.

I can’t comfort my partner when she’s suffering. I also can’t talk. Like I can’t make conversation, I can like never find the words for what I want to say, I can never explain why I’ve done the horrible things I’ve done and therefore can’t explain how I know I’ll never be that person again. I also am still trying to remember all the details of everything that I’ve done because I fucked my own memory up by blanking out what I did and can’t remember shit so she’s left to try to fill in the blanks and wonder.

There are a hundred things everywhere every day that trigger her and remind her of my past. She's doing a lot of work, trust me. But there isn't a whole lot of help when it comes to particular subjects like this, and that's where we both struggle. I want to help her in those moments either. It's very important for our present and possible future.

PLEASE don’t say ""get therapy"" or ""she needs to get over it"". I'm looking for a therapist and go to SAA meetings and if you think she ""just"" needs to ""get over it"" you must not understand and that's not helpful. Me looking for how to help her cope with trauma I've given her should not be seen as setting the bar high, it should be the basic standard for someone in this position in a relationship. If you traumatize someone and want to be in a relationship with them you kinda gotta make them comfortable enough to do so.

Also I want to reiterate and clarify that what really makes ALL this too much to deal with is the fact that I butchered the disclosure process. I hid so much and so many people making them seem like a bigger deal or more significant than they were. And I hid so many details from so much as well. My partner had to find out so much on her own and what I did tell her she had to PRY out of me for months.",1678748033.0

I’ve been so incredibly, deeply stuck in the freeze response for over a decade now. No therapy I’ve tried or medication has ever helped me with this. I don’t feel sad on a day to day basis but I literally have no energy for anything besides working or coming home and numbing/distracting myself into oblivion. 

No matter how hard I’ve tried, I cannot get myself to change my bad habits and create good ones. I can’t force myself to clean regularly, to exercise or eat right, to pick up productive hobbies, or to get things done. The only time I seem like I have my shit together is when I’m around other people because I’m terrified of them knowing what a mess my life is. 

The second I’m alone, it’s game over. I’m binge eating, not showering/sleeping in makeup/not brushing my teeth, my place is a mess and as long as the small little space on my bed is open for me to crawl into and no longer be a person, I’m placated. 

I don’t know if I just haven’t tried hard enough but it seems like the freeze response is so extremely difficult to break out of. After the death of my mother, I watched my dad fall into the freeze response as well. His therapy arrived in the form of the TV and food. He never once tried to process that trauma and actively would ridicule me for trying to process mine. 

I literally just don’t know what to do anymore. It’s so hard to watch the people around me take care of themselves and be productive. I so badly want to be a functioning adult. I try not to think about it but I don’t think I ever had a fighting chance.",1678647594.0

Think of how unfair and how much more that hurt being ignored by those who should know better.

Eventually my A-er became old and feeble and begin to weaken enough that I decided to reach out to my first ever MH therapist, I didn't know anything about MH or it's workers. But you know what I had done, I had no idea what I had accomplished by sheer dumb luck, but I had stumbled ass-backward into one of the nicest, kindest, most patient trauma therapist ever to exist, they have never once lashed out at me, they never change.

I don't know exactly how it happened, but others could never see me beyond my rugged facade and they would never ever help me, but with my limited and broken 7th grade vernacular, I proceeded to explain to my therapist some of what I had endured. Somehow she kind of believed things I were saying, but I think when I told her my main A-er was a cruel, controlling, cold, fucking horrible narcissist prude, it all clicked for them. Immediately they said you have been extremely, severely abused for 55 years of your life. They got on board immediately. They said ''what you have endured was the perfect storm of abuses, and that I Was lucky to have survived what I have been through, and my brain was severely broken, and that I dissociate a lot, and they have met all the parts I speak of and more'', why doesn't someone just love me, fucking why?

My grandmother once had us over for a ""thong party"" where my cousin and I would pull our panties in between our buttcheeks and my grandma would decide who made the best ""thong"". We would pretend to walk a runway and pose in front of her half naked. We were allowed to walk around her house in our underwear because we were ""all girls"". We would play stripper for my grandma and she would laugh and thought it was the funniest thing. My cousin and I thought this was okay because with my grandma being the adult, she said it was fine so no one had any issues. But as an adult I'm wondering if this was weird. It was always just me and this cousin who could spend the night for these types of things at my grandmas house.

A month ago Ive came to terms that my only option left was psychotherapy.

Best decision ever. In my 4 sessions so far I’ve realize that I am dissociating pretty much all the times I step outside my apartment.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I've had this beautiful girl since I was 14. She and my old dog Suzie (and then Zeb) were the only beings I could talk to and that loved me without siding with my abuser. 

&#x200B;

Suzie is gone, it left me with Molly. and that cat has been with me for every trauma in my life, recovering from an abusive household to dealing with endless amounts of abuse from family to now when I am sick and unable to do the things I used to.

&#x200B;

But she's become quite ill, she can hardly walk, she won't eat and she's not doing good. I'm three days away from brain surgery, and I'm more worried about my baby than I am of my surgery. Am I going to wake up to a dead cat? Will I wake up tomorrow and she won't?

&#x200B;

Will I come to in the hospital, survive and she won't? My heart is being torn to pieces. She kept me stable. She picked up on my panic attacks in a snap. Sat with me during every time I broke down and cried. Was there for me at every single turn. I know she's old, and I know that nothing lasts forever.

&#x200B;

But I guess my mind never saw my cat as something that would age, I don't know why. But watching her fade so quickly now, all I can think about is when I come home after my surgery, my house might be more empty than I am ready for.

&#x200B;

The rock I've been holding onto for 21 years is sinking and I feel like I am drowning with her. But I can't stand to see her suffer.

&#x200B;

My poor Molly, I'm so sorry baby. I am, if I could give you half of my lifespan I would but I don't even know how long I have at this point. My life has been a series of unfortunate events. I didn't have a loving family, I have people I call family now. I love my sisters. But, my memories from childhood, they are painful. I don't have parents, not really.

&#x200B;

I've watched my friends die, I've been betrayed by close friends. Stalked by one for years now. And now I am getting sicker and might end up with a bad prognosis and my best friend might not even be there.

&#x200B;

She needs me the most now, and I might not even be home to hold her when she goes. She's going to have the vet come out to her, she ate a little and is moving about. But I know it won't be long now. She's not suffering, she's on pain meds and anxiety pills. She's not showing signs of pain, but she is showing signs of just tiredness. It's hard to explain. But I know she's going to go and soon.

Thanks in advance to anyone who reads this.

 I was extremely isolated growing up. I'm not diagnosed, but I believe I have CPTSD from having so little socializing or any stimulation at all hardly. I don't know what was going through my parents' heads when they were raising me. They sometimes do or say things that seem to prove they do care a lot. They weren't actively mean to me in abnormal amounts I think (it was the normal way that a lot of parents talk down to their children like they're lesser things that I got). It's the sheer isolation that they put me through that's messed me up so badly. I'm afraid that because of it, I might not have properly mentally developed, and I'm still a child that's stuck in an adult's body.

I was homeschooled, and had no freedom to leave the house on my own. Really, I didn't get to walk around the neighborhood alone til I was 17. I only left the house to follow my parents grocery shopping or when we went out to eat. I obviously didn't have friends, and no online friends either. I've never been close to any of my family, and I still feel like we're strangers. I was given limited internet freedom, TV, and a few video games to keep me busy. I've spent a disgusting amount of my life staring at a wall or ceiling because there was just nothing I wanted to do. When I was 16 all of the isolation started to break my mind kinda seriously. I didn't get a diagnosis, but I had OCD-like, paranoid thoughts that at times were debilitating. 

 At the moment, I live in my own little bubble. I'm almost 24, I still have no friends, and I barely talk with family or coworkers. I've never been able to fit in, and I feel like a fake person. I work a stocking job, live in a little apartment, and just get by. Even when I work such an easy job, I still make really stupid mistakes for reasons I'm not sure why? I can only guess that I space out so badly that I lose track of what I need to be doing. I get panicky whenever I'm under any pressure AT ALL and I can act so embarrassingly stupid. My thoughts get all jumbled up whenever I try to talk to people in real life and it can sometimes take a very patient person to hear me out. I still have a lot of trouble trusting that my thoughts are rational and sane. Sometimes I still slip back into thinking crap that makes no sense. I frequently have trouble knowing what I'm feeling and when I need to walk away and calm down. I also haven't had a sex drive since I was a horny teenager. I've seen a couple of therapists before, but I quit seeing both of them because they just weren't helping. 

I need to get my crap together somehow, soon I'll need a full time job. But I just don't know how I'm going to be able to keep up with the stress of a proper job. I've thought about being a dental assistant or a tutor, they seem manageable. I'm still scared though that when I have more serious responsibilities, I'm really gonna mess it up and get fired.

Your job is to help and support the person. If trigger warnings make things better for people then use them.

It's like these people have no idea what it's like to actually be triggered. It's not like I'm taking offense to things, it's that I essentially disassociate and it takes hours to go back to normal. Whatever that word even means anyway.

It is not the job of a teacher or classroom to try to heal someone's PTSD.

This is the job of a therapist who knows what they're doing.

Healing hurts. Have you ever got into surgery? They cut you open and mess around with your guts. But thankfully you have anesthesia to numb the pain so you don't feel anything.

Mental healing is the same way. You sometimes have to be hurt even more in order to get better and that's why it's good to have a therapist who can help you and essentially catch you. There is no mental anesthesia. Sometimes you just got to feel certain things.

Recently I noticed that I forget a lot of the conversations I’ve had with people. For example, I would randomly remember that I’ve “had” a conversation with somebody about how I really like this one skin care product & discussed how its so hard to manage dry skin during winter. But then I would completely forget who I’ve had that conversation with. It almost feels like it happened in a dream and its so foggy. Another example is that I remember talking to someone and noticed multiple bruises on their arm, immediately got distracted by it, my brain starts spiraling wondering how she got those bruises/ I wonder if her partner is abusive and blah blah blah.

885,Is this a common theme for abuse survivors to have to deal with?,7,11pso3w,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11pso3w/is_this_a_common_theme_for_abuse_survivors_to/,5,"This has been eating away at me for years, partially because I've actually never known another abuse victim who has talked about experiencing this. So I'm wondering if it's just because I'm a ""bad person"" and therefore such an utterly unsympathetic victim or if it really is just that the majority of people I have been around happen to suck and be complete cowards.

Basically, I've had a lot of people refuse to help me and abandon me because of my proximity with my main abuser, who was my mom. With some of them, it feels almost like they saw me as being an extension of her and therefore I actually deserved to suffer by being assaulted by her regularly, and cutting contact with me was ""self care"" so they wouldn't have to witness my suffering or listen to my cries for help, or be threatened by her directly or indirectly.

My dad abandoned me when I was 11 after my mom threatened to kill him. I never saw or had contact with him ever again, he made 0 attempts to help me or have anybody check on me to make sure that I was okay. I've had people tell me ""well that's understandable he was just scared for his life uwu"" as if I wasn't literally being threatened with murder by my mom regularly at that time, and as if the physical abuse didn't just escalate to be even worse to the point where my mom was literally trying to break my fingers and threatening to kill me with sharp objects. Or when she almost killed me with neglect by refusing to take me to the ER when I was sick with an infection that should have killed me. But no, just leave an 11 year old to deal with that alone because you're \~\*scared for your life\*\~.

This pattern ended up repeating with partners and friends I've had. With my first ever boyfriend when I was 18, I ended up at his door crying one night because my mom had another one of her tantrums and kicked me out of the house after slapping me around, and he dumped me right then and there. He let me stay the night, but when I asked him why he broke up with me he gave me a lecture on how I was just too broken and draining and how he was worried that he'd eventually end up having to testify in court as a crime witness considering how violent and unstable my mom is.

Another ex I had he dumped me the same week that I was having to deal with even more violence then usual from my mom and he was just like ""well, I just really hate that I'm the only good thing/person in your life and I hate that you're so desperate and NEED me"". Like...am I crazy for thinking that's actually a really screwed up thing to say to someone? Like ""omfg you just need so much from me because you're literally being abused regularly and I'm the only person you have a close relationship with that you trust...I'm the real victim here :("" kind of vibes.

I've had numerous other instances occur with family members/friends similar to these but these are just the three that have screwed me up the most.

Whenever I've showed anger in some situations, I've had people lecture me as to how I'm becoming exactly like my abusive mother even though I'm not calling people slurs, breaking objects, or assaulting anyone. The irony with some of the people who have said that (who are also abuse survivors) is that I could point at ways they act similar to their abusers as well but I haven't because I just feel that it's cruel and low to do, especially if they aren't doing it at anywhere near the same severity or extreme as their abusers.

I'm going to end here with a disclaimer that I'm away from my abuser and that also my mom has actually changed for the better in many ways since all of these things happened, but I'm still kind of messed up about all that has happened. 

I keep swinging from blaming myself and thinking I deserved the treatment from family members/exes/friends for being too desperate and needy and expecting too much from other people to ""save"" me or at least give me some shelter from her, and thinking ""you know in some ways, people's reactions to the abuse I've gone through has been worse than the actual abuse"".",1678661791.0

I really like shows like Bizzare Foods and No Reservations. Where people travel around the world meeting people and trying new things. I remember being little and loving talking to people, but trauma after trauma wore me down and by the time I was 12 I was terrified of interacting with people. Strangers of course, but even friends and acquaintances. Every interaction feels like it has the potential for danger. It's hard not to assume people will be offensive even though I'm an adult and haven't been bullied or with an abuser for years. 

I want to be around people. I want to be a part of their lives. I see a massive lack of community in my society and I wish I could work to help the issue, but I can barely get outside more than a few times a week.

887,A venting of sorts.,2,11q0wms,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11q0wms/a_venting_of_sorts/,2," 

It  is hard to even talk about it; as much as I find myself constantly  ruminating upon it, it feels hard to discuss this at length. Even this  has taken me some time to get ready to sit down and write. As I write  this, I find myself rocking.

I  suppose part of what I need to confront is whether or not it was bad  enough, for me to still struggle like this. Whether or not I really want  to recover - someone who wanted to recover from this wouldn't have  taken so long to realize it. Someone who wanted to recover from this  wouldn't've shut down like they did when they found out what happened -  just pushed it away for a year. Someone who wanted to recover from this  wouldn't still be struggling this over two years after realizing what  happened.

I was groomed.

I  was fourteen, fifteen, at the time the bulk of it happened. Of course,  much more happened afterward; it wasn't until I was seventeen and  eighteen that I cut off the people that did these things to me.

By  more than one person - two people, at least. I feel so foolish saying  that, as if I'm indecisive - as if I'll decide, someone must be  thinking, that I was groomed by somebody else. It took me a long time to  realize that I'd been groomed by one person; the second one, I'd always  felt uncomfortable with, but it wasn't until then that I'd realized the  same dynamics were at play. I've been in so many unhealthy friendships,  I'm scared that it could be more than this. I'm scared to explore that.  I'm this battered, after all, and I don't want to get more hurt.

I  feel stupid, frankly. On one hand, online grooming is horrible - on the  other hand, I felt - at the time - like I was enjoying it. I was  complimented. I was perceptive, mature for my age - especially in my  faith, in my desire to learn and study - I was artistic, creative,  thoughtful, kind, they said. Did they really care? What they did to me -  how they used me - sent me to such depths that I'm still trying to  crawl out of. So many kinds of self-harm - kinds I wasn't aware were  self-harm. Things that still haunt me. I am asexual, but I feel like an  utter fake; no asexual would have been a part of that kind of thing, the  voice inside me - from wherever it comes - says. Would have reacted  that way.

Sex - intimacy -  frightens me. It was used to hurt me; it made me feel as if it is what I  deserved. As if that is what I was meant for.

The prospect of it happening - even safely - even kissing - is enough to make me shake, now.

I  want to be a kind person. It is an important thing to be kind, I feel  like. Forgiveness needn't be on everyone's radar in their recovery -  that's an individual choice. But I want - I desire - to orient myself  continually to forgiveness. I say it like that, because while I am sure  that for some who do opt for it, there are the grand, flourishing  bombshells of forgiveness, for me, it is not the same. It is like  bricklaying. The drudgery of daubing messy mortar, the scarring of  knuckles on terracotta. It is slow, but so is healing, as I have been  told.

My counselor keeps referring  to ""the hard work of healing,"" and it is rather hard work. There are  times when I simply want to drop it all - and yet, the prospect of what  would be otherwise - completely spiraling and falling to bits again - is  rather unattractive to me.

I have  had several friends - one of whom groomed others, incidentally - go  into suicidal spirals. Threaten suicide, lash out at me, manipulate - I  was 15 and 17-18 around the time of these friendships, respectively. It  was the latter friendship that, in part, made me begin seriously reflect  on grooming. It, and several other factors in my life, I think led to  that October of 2020 when I realized what happened to me.

Even then, it took a year for me to get counseling - a year of stagnation. Like an elephant sitting in the room.

I  am terrified, utterly, of being abusive, manipulative, causing trauma -  being in any way like the people that have hurt me, that have - I feel -  left me a shell of the person I once was, the person I hope to become. I  have a terror of being a narcissist, of any kind of person that is a  predator. I was diagnosed with OCD, and I wonder frequently if I have  PTSD; both, I feel, are linked back to this.

I  have longed hope to become a teacher in some capacity; I have also been  trying to discern as to whether or not I would be a good clergyperson.  My counselor and I did a test that indicated I would, in career work,  enjoy helping and service work - but I am terrified, frankly, of  entering either; I am scared that, in some way, afraid of it as I am, I  will perpetuate the same kind of hurt that my groomers did to me.

I  think back to 14 and 15 year old me - interested in drawing and trains,  for heaven's sake - and I try to put myself into the shoes of the  people that hurt me. What would draw them, 18, 19, 20 year olds, to  someone like me? What was the point? I am terrified, frankly, of  engaging with people more than two years younger than me because of this  - what did they want? Why would they want that?

I  return to school tomorrow. I have to go in, head held high, feeling  like glued-together china, and do my best to be kind. To talk to my  professors, determine where I ought to go when I graduate. To try and  pretend, in some capacity, not to be the broken, limping fool I am - to  pretend I'd have the stuff to educate or minister or heal, all the while  I am struggling, groping, thrashing as I try to heal, so slowly, so  frustratingly.

I feel crazy - I  half wonder if I am - if this is all fake, if I'm a professional victim  deluding myself - and sometimes, I wish it would all simply stop, for a  moment; that I could relax my guard for a moment. I wrote this jumbled,  venting screed in a hope to quiet some of these feelings. I hope none of  this is overwhelming or self-centered.",1678684517.0

Over the 6 months the officer said he does not talk to any of his cell mates and even when the officer speaks he doesn’t respond. He also refuses to eat. There has been 3 days straight of him not eating that they had to send him to the medical observation center  to be placed on drips. In a letter in December he told me that he has immense rage within him bottled up for the past 10 years and does not want to speak to anyone or else he will be triggered and will punch them. Thus he avoids any talking at all in prison. He also said he hates living such a controlled life and he rather die than be alive. He said he just want the freewill to be himself. 

I’m not sure why he does not want to eat. What do you think he could be going through?  What do you guys think about his behaviour? How to get his to be response to engage and talk? He does not even want to talk to me. I really want to help him.p",1678664810.0

The building I live in is pretty quiet and yet these rare occasional noises can evoke a lot of anger.

-x-

Lately, I’d say the past few months, there are instances where I’ll be listening to something or watching something and, if a distressing thing happens in the video, I’ll start crying?

Sympathy crying, maybe? I’m not sure.

I’m usually a very put-together person, and I don’t feel comfortable expressing such emotions or vulnerabilities like this. It’s really pissing me off, actually. Because, for example, today, I was watching a YouTube video from Dr. Mike about “Incredible Medical Rescue Videos”, and it showed just that: incredible rescues.

I almost cried multiple times.

Once when a woman was experiencing anaphylaxis and wasn’t able to communicate, clearly scared.

Once when a baby was on a changing bed and they almost rolled off and hurt themselves, but their older brother caught them just in time.

Once when a little boy got attacked by a loose dog, but someone saved him and got attacked instead and I almost cried because of the savior, not because of the kid that got attacked.

…A few other times. And that was just today with one video.

On the outside and in my head, I felt perfectly fine. But then something would suddenly build in my chest and I’d find myself tearing up automatically. And it almost felt like I needed to “release pressure” and ended up making this dry, sobbing …motion? Or something? Crying but not really and only for a singular, split second.?

It’s embarrassing. And completely uncontrollable. This wasn’t an issue a few months ago and I’m not sure why this change would happen… 

If this has happened to you, could you please tell me why it did?

How you fixed it?

Hi! Quick update here:

- I'm working real hard on fighting back my inner critic(with DBT technique, re-parenting and tapping meditation). It worked! Now I'm able to realize the flashbacks and handle them. (around 70% of the times, but I'm going to call it a progress anyways.)

- I also took a dive into my traumatic memories, and figured out why I'm triggered. The monster is a lot visible&understandable now(Doesn't make it any less scary. But hey, at least it's not Cuthulu anymore! ).

- I discovered that my father has ADHD(which explains the procrastination). Bullet journal and videos about executive function helped me tremendously.

When I was little, emotions were seen as weakness, showing / expressing them was not encouraged, to say the least, and as a consequence I shut them off, shoved them into some dark corner deep within myself. 

Last week I was in an emotional flashback and decided to write it all down. The emotions had already begun to calm down, when a thought hit me: my mom punished me for showing emotions, she ridiculed me for having them, we never spoke about them ... because she didn't want me to remind her of what it was like for her when she was little. She didn't want to be reminded of her own emotions, and me showing mine did so, so she tried her best to rid me of my emotions. 

Today, I went one step further: my husband and I were at a theater and just before it got dark, I was thinking about this and another realization hit me: if what I had been thinking last week was true, then all of her abuse wasn't directed at me. Well of course, it was, but I was not at fault. It didn't happen because I was a bad kid. It didn't happen because I didn't deserve any better. It wasn't because I was bad at all. It was all about her. 

This thought made me so happy, I had tears in my eyes. This means, little me wasn't bad! This means, little me is a good little one! This means, little me does deserve to be happy! This means, little me is ok the way little me is! This means, my mom was mean because she was unhappy and scared and felt unworthy and she didn't want to be reminded of her childhood, not because I was a bad, unworthy kid. 

Well, I am still battling with the effects, and even though my perspective might have shifted a bit today, this doesn't mean I am now all healed suddenly, but it still feels like some heavy weight was lifted from my chest. I feel lighter, more hopeful, even happier, stronger, more ""in the world"", even a bit relieved. 😄

I’ve been taking the last 2 years to prioritize my mental health and well-being, all while living under my fathers roof. he knows I have PTSD but he doesn’t understand what it *means*. 

I’ve taken the last two years to experiment with medications and TMS treatment, only to be disappointed with worsened depression, so after 9+ months of tapering off of antidepressants and anti anxiety meds, I’m finally free to be myself. I also cut out birth control for the first time in 15 years because I have no idea what i’m really “supposed to” feel like as a fully grown 29-almost 30 year old woman. i also have 100% support from my own doctor to be off of meds and to practice small lifestyle changes to better myself instead. 

now, the **misunderstood/unsafe** feeling solidified today when I saw a sticky note on my dads desk that says “partial hospitalization program” on it, and i asked “what’s this about? for me?” and he just says, “well i was just asking some questions and that’s what they told me”. (his doctor) 
he didn’t elaborate what his questions were, and I, in other words, just said ‘that is like taking 7 steps backwards for me after everything i have already been through.’ 

i just don’t understand why, as my father, he wouldn’t ask ME how i’m feeling in general and is just jumping to asking HIS own doctor who doesn’t even know my history.

What I have a problem with is that self help has become the new thing to profit off of vulnurable people. 

Where Self help works:
Self help can only help individuals who are the root cause of their problems like a person who struggles with organizing their calender can benefit from self help on how to be more organized or someone who struggles to pick a career self help could help them know themselves. Another example would be someone who wants to rewire their brain for a specific goal self help can help. Self help can also be helpful for people who want to learn basic social skills and what not.

Why self help wont cut it anywhere else:
Self help is meant to ""empower"" people and some self help contents can be good but they fail to address the elephant in the room and that is ""the others"". Self help implies that the problem of your hardships are you and thus you are the key to solving them which makes this help methof very appealing. It tells us we have absolute control if we're the problem then the solution is in us.

The ""others"": 
Most of the problems self help creator want to address boil down to mental health problems. Now knowing what I know I can confidently say that if a person in a certain setting is doing rly rly bad mentally chances are their environment is to blame and not the individual. 

How intelligent is a video on gardening where the gardener tells the viewers to take care of the flower and fix it while planting it in the middle of a desert? Is it the flower that needs fixing?

When a person is lonely and has low self esteem chances are they lack a support group and have family issues. This problem cannot be solved by the individual alone acting like it can is gaslighting. Or lets say
 someone hates their job but doesn't live in a developed counrty and comes from poverty and an unsupportive family. Whats self help going to do for this person? Is it the person fault for living in a caste system? Can the individual fix their familys debt and societys economy system? No this is a societal issue
Is it rly that the students need to love themselves more or is the school system just terrible?
What about abuse? I'm guilty of this myself as a kid I tried healing myself while in an abusive household. What was I trying to heal? My very rational emotions given what I was going through? Did I rly have ""anger issues"" or was I just controlled?

----------

*The nurses did a good job and were helpful and accommodating. The social workers were unhelpful and emotionally abusive (the nighttime social worker).*

*The night social worker, knowing she was working with a SUICIDAL PATIENT, very suddenly walked into my room, turned on the lights, and started telling me to wake up over and over (even though I was already awake) in a way that that startled me. She may have not known how easily started I was, but I had my covers over my head, I was shaking, hyperventilating, and telling her to turn off the lights and that she was making me panic. She refused to turn off the lights and kept loudly demanding that I speak to her.*

*I started to feel very trapped because she would continue to talk AT me in a very rude and judgemental way (""why do you have the covers over your head? YOU came here, right?"") and keep the lights on, so I called the nurse. The social worker told me that I was ""silly"" for calling the nurse and stormed out. Only until the nurse came did the lights turn off.*

You should not do anything for yourself.  You should only worry about others when others can solve their own issues.

I would say that honestly, I have had to force myself to move on.  

I have to realize that I don't have to justify anything to this person, who is a covert narcissist.  Who I have tried to mend things with.  When it is impossible.

I can't see how I can grow if this person stays in my life.  This person was someone I met as a teen who was someone where there was a professional boundary with them as a healthcare provider.  My Mom and I became close with this person.  This is one reason that I would say now that with social workers and health care providers, I make sure that the professional boundary is kept.

I honestly would tell this person that I don't need them to validate anything for me, that I see that they want to look good, that they beat someone down until they want to kill themselves.  They can stop, because the fact that they act like you can do anything you want to someone...but if someone says something it is the end of the world.

People will kill someone, and then say they are more moral than someone who has said things that may be awful.  But they didn't kill anyone.  So they are the best person ever, no matter what.

That's why I honestly don't care to help people and do kind things like I used to.  I don't go the extra mile.  Because it won't matter with this person, and they themselves will not go the extra mile.

Even when I asked completely innocent questions they would find it annoying. They neglected me and didn't even bother to teach me basic life skills, never even bothered to have the sex talk with me. They constantly tried to suppress me any time I tried to express myself - my mother in particular would force me to go on walks on the beach with her even when I didn't want to, and she'd force me to walk longer even when I was already tired. What's more, on those walks we would sometimes get into arguments, and when I raised my voice at her/got frustrated with her she would tell me that if I spoke like that she wouldn't give me a certain thing - which often resulted in me fawning in front of her in the hopes that she would forgive me.

At home I constantly got yelled at for small mistakes I made - even now, in my 20s, my mother yells at me for small stuff like making the kitchen towel too wet. She gets very easily annoyed with me and I just feel so unwanted in this household. I remember turning 18 and thinking that ""now that I'm an adult, my mom won't be allowed to tell me what to do anymore"", but from there I feel like her abuse just got worse. Oh yeah and she also constantly voices her very bigoted, biased opinions right in front of me, and she's been doing that since I was a kid.

Why do they do this? Why was I punished just for existing? All I wanted was a low stress life, to not be controlled constantly, to just be free to be me but my parents stole that from me and I am so angry and sad all at the same time. They stole my chances to just be a kid and live a normal life without having to worry about when the next emotional or physical attack would come from. Even worse, my parents could never get along so I feel like I was constantly caught in the middle of their personal conflict. I feel like they just kind of dumped their personal traumas onto me without really considering how it may have affected me.

And it feels like even among whatever happy memories I may have, there's always a layer of trauma laced into it. Many of my ""good memories"" happened within the context of trauma and I don't think there are many times where I truly felt free.

I was a stranger to myself, just as my boyfriend was a stranger to me when I met him. 

So, when people here say they have trouble with the idea of loving themselves, I deeply identify with it, and it breaks my heart because we're all worthy of love. 

When we've been treated with the polar opposite of love by the people around us, it makes a sick sort of sense that we learn to treat ourselves unlovingly. It really does. I might even go as far as to say it's normal to not know how to love yourself, when your own primary caregiver didn't love you. Because that's how we learn. But, well, normal doesn't mean healthy. Normal doesn't mean okay. 

You can learn how to love yourself by starting with how you treat yourself. Here's a thought: court yourself, romance yourself. I guarantee at first it will feel just as uncomfortable as if someone else was showing you that love, but that doesn't mean you should stop. Because, if you learn how to treat yourself well, then you can also learn how to accept it when others treat you well.

I saw a post in this subreddit a few days ago breaking down the diagnostic criteria of C-PTSD and I don’t know if I am simply invalidating my trauma or refusing to accept it goes beyond what my therapist calls “generic ptsd” (singular traumatic incident that messes with you but typically improves and didn’t alter your state of being for a prolonged time) if I don’t meet the criteria. My whole support network (most of whom work in the MH field) agree with my therapist and were shocked no one else has told I have it before. The criteria lists horrific acts and in the case of abuse during childhood for it to be sexual or physical in nature. 

I have spent most of my life in active trauma (7-19 and am 22 now). I didn’t find out until I got sober (and it explained a lot of things and I am beginning to regain bits and pieces of the memories) that when I was 7 I came to my parents to tell them about CSA done by my cousin. My parents were in the process of a divorce due to my mom’s mental health/addiction and my dad’s mental health/trauma not being compatible. My mom demanded my sister and I not go to my cousins house unsupervised as my dad was using his brother as childcare while the divorce was being finalized since they lived around the corner. It was in the first draft of their divorce agreement (my mom showed me it when I didn’t believe her) but my dad negotiated it out by telling my mom we couldn’t go to her brothers house since he is a drunk then and my mom couldn’t afford childcare and my dad could. From there on I have splotchy memories of being screamed at and told how emotions made me weak and I was too emotional and a few physical instances while my mom’s addiction was getting worse. I have witnessed my mom do drugs and at one point had to see if she was alive when she told my dad she wanted to off herself and we found her passed out after breaking in. Both parents were mentally and emotionally abusive. By 15 I was formally diagnosed with ptsd and had severe anxiety that the clinal report described as unusual even in clinical samples. 

Promptly at 17 right after my mother left my life to go to a different state to try to get sober for good I entered my first serious relationship. My only other experience was at 14 and had been a “boyfriend” who would hold me down since I didn’t want to do anything sexual in nature to force it to happen. The first serious relationship dude abused me in every way possible, and at point tried to SA me since I refused to lose my virginity to him but was too scared to leave. By the time we broke up (he dumped me to see if I would come running and my friends took me and my phone away to give me a chance to process I was free) I developed my own addiction with alcoholism because I couldn’t cope any longer which led to 2 years of demoralizing situations. 

I do emdr and have trauma nightmares and still cannot tolerate being around ginger men (especially with beards). I have constant emotional flashbacks to the point that I carry around my anxiety meds everywhere I go. I dissociate/have depersonalization the majority of the time to the level that my therapist will give me homework to try to check in with my body and feel whatever my body wants me to feel for a minute a few times a day. My first sober relationship would point out a multitude of behaviors I showed that highlighted my utter terror of being harmed again, and even my friends point out when they chide me I shut down until they help me process it. 

TLDR: I don’t know if the awful things that have happened to me are horrific enough to count as C-PTSD.",1678639811.0
939,one step forward two steps back with body memories/emotional flashbacks 🥲,5,11ph0m3,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11ph0m3/one_step_forward_two_steps_back_with_body/,1,"i put an ***emotional abuse*** tw but also BIG TRIGGER WARNING for ***physical abuse/neglect/false imprisonment/suicidal thoughts*** etc. (and a reminder if you still read/feel triggered that you are safe and i am too because these experiences are in the past!) cus sadly the roots of my cptsd include the whole shebang 🙂 

i am also part of a DID system so this kind of goes double lol. i just needed to vent about how it feels like no matter how much healing and processing/distancing myself (from being the child who knew nothing but being beaten and locked in small spaces and shown 0 kindness ever) i do, every time certain triggers occur i am suddenly that child all over again, i entirely forget how to do anything except fawn or freeze (and in more severe responses, switching with an alter who doesn't move or speak). and this is in situations where flight isn't necessary per se (and obviously also 100% possible with no pushback if i wanted to, anyway) so you'd think it's fine but it's not just exhibiting traumatised responses, it's entirely forgetting to advocate for myself anymore or understand that unhealthy behaviour like raising voices is... well. unhealthy.

and ofc people who aren't abusive never mean to make me have these responses but the more it happens, the more my mind is in danger of flipping to believing i'm restrained/trapped in the space i'm in and there will be consequences if i try to leave because someone put me there, even when i'm almost 100 miles away from my abuser, because i've only lived consistently away from him since the end of april 2021. i thought when i left it would get better because fundamentally, legally since then i've been safe and free to roam, so deep down i know that when i get triggered in this way that there's no way that i'm imprisoned again. however if anyone yells at me or is even just passive agrressive/gives me the silent treatment for a while in any setting (but especially partners or friends i'm living with) i sit in my room stuck in the mindset that i could suddenly once again get locked in for any amount of time, powerless if the person mad/upset with me wants to come in and take it out on me in any physical or verbal way they might want to.

sometimes it just feels like i start to feel like my own individual and i'm shedding the self that was moulded by my abuser. given, it's difficult with the DID because my entire personality was formed around the trauma (brain quite literally fragmented and scattered while learning to fawn/comply to survive) but there are so many systems out there making amazing progress learning to feel safe and understand that they only belong to themselves, much like all the successfully healed and healing individuals with cptsd from trauma similar to and even more severe than mine. but with the healing possible outside of the trauma environment that i've done, it feels like such minuscule actual progress, and more that i now just get to realise what happens in the triggered states where i revert to thinking i'm in that situation.

it's baffling starting to realise that my default mindset is to feel that i am not only powerless but quite literally owned, and figuratively as well as physically under someone's lock and key. in these states it seems like i lose the progress of learning to think for myself and view any kind of toxicity or unkindness as anything but normal. no doubt it comes from the childhood of learning to simply agree with the logic that i should be punished (physically or otherwise), be restricted from accessing the outside world/isolated from every other person and dynamic to exist, and live in nothing but strict obedience and an absence of agency just because... i'm 'bad'? (i mean... do any abuse survivors ever truly get to know why the fuck it happened? 🙃) but either way it's such a shitty, dehumanising, and debilitating way to feel.

i can't stop it when it happens or find the groundedness to be like 'hey dude, doing \[insert minor unintentional action that is probably a coping mechanism because it's unrealistic to be constantly surrounded by completely healed/untraumatised people\] actually throws me into an emotional flashback and my subconscious thinks you're about to absolutely annihilate my sense of freedom and safety. could you be a gem and just not even ever breathe slightly similarly to this one guy who kind of destroyed all chances of my brain developing remotely healthily, probably like, before i could even walk? yeah i know it might be kinda impossible but all i'm asking is just for you to avoid even moving in a certain way, let alone falling out with me or getting angry. alright, good to clear that up, looks like i'm about to miraculously snap out of it too.' (my bad, the sarcastic emotional response bone in me activated.) but it doesn't work like that and most of the time i can barely remember my triggers and trauma anyway so i have no idea what to avoid until i'm frenzied or catatonic, not to mention the risk of part of falling into this emotional flashback being regaining the feeling that i'm in such a hostile and inescapable environment that the only way out is ending things.

not only is this exhausting for me but when you're not in someone's brain, it's impossible to know why they're responding in the way that they are. many people have felt a lot of guilt and what i can honestly only imagine to be something like horror at the knowledge that their actions have driven me into such states. so obviously it fucks with every connection i might have with anyone at all and it's hard to sort out those relationships because the issue isn't them being human and naturally having unhealthy moments, it's the fact that my cptsd symptoms won't subside for a pretty long time, regardless of the professional care i'm in and how bady i want to heal.

this was pretty long and presumably a hard read so i really appreciate if you did, just wanted to go on for a bit because progress with therapy and my mental health services is slow and inconsistent so i had nowhere else to put this. peace and love from a recently triggered cptsd-haver.",1678634384.0

Then I’d get sad and depressed about it, but then at times when I had the motivation I’d look my best as If that would change the person’s mind about me and when it didn’t,  depression hit again. 

I also realized that I’ve turned into a disorganized person. I’m sure this is because of ocd, but I used to take hour long showers in elementary school. When middle school started that remained but I lost my sense of style, puberty hit and I didn’t know how to take care of myself outside of showering (despite binge watching yt vids on hygiene all the time), being clean and healthy frequently always felt unattainable to me. And I started skipping breakfast all 3 years, cuz I used to be a chubby kid in elementary.

Preface: I have a toxic family system, I believe I’m invalidated by everyone in the family even when I’m being reasonable about sth. Normal behaviors of mine were criticized to a point where I thought everything was wrong w/me. There are ppl I know who lived in more physically abusive homes, that are more normal than me. 

Threats of physical punishment were used. I was hit occasionally, but emotional abuse and having a support system abandon me is what I think caused me to lose it.

On top of that I had a friend who played who would play “whose poorer than who” comments and make racially insensitive remarks about me all the time. I get it, some kids aren’t educated on it, but what was weird is that we were both immigrants. (I am black)

One thing bothering me lately is I adopt bad habits that I used to do or that I hear other people do. Like on tiktok I would get all this self-diagnosed autism content, and all of sudden I start losing social skills to the point it’s hampered relationships. When I heard about dissociation I would start zoning out more in class. And when I learned about blunted affect and selective mutism all of a sudden I don’t want to talk to anyone, make new friends, or have any facial expressions. 

Idk, maybe it’s Health anxiety, but I also know there are several things wrong with me. My life is always in confusion now.",1678638331.0

Parents, teachers and guide leaders, usually on the emotional or physical abuse and neglect spectrum.

It's honestly to the point I've been debating striking out on my own as a consultant once I get a bit more experience because if I am my own boss I don't have to deal with having a boss. 

My review is coming up, and that's a situation I find triggering for several reasons. Takes me right back to being scapegoated for things and penalized for stuff that wasn't my fault. Especially since this year my work instituted a new report card style evaluation (lots of my trauma is around school, and this makes work feel like school in all the worst ways). 

Add in that in the past year I *have* felt scapegoated on several occasions (stuff that would probably roll off the back of someone who isn't kind of hypersensitive to this sort of thing), and it's just a huge wall of awful that I am totally dreading.

I’m very confused and hoping to hear from other people who might have experienced something similar.

I am seeing a therapist and we started talking about physical and emotional abuse that happened throughout my childhood about two years ago. For the past year, we’ve been working on inner child work, and talking about the possibility of some dissociative coping mechanisms I might have developed as a very young kid.

I’ve met my inner child, but they haven’t talked to me or looked at me yet. They’ve had their back to me for the past year. Sleeping in a field of snow… something that I actually did when I was very young. I realize now that it may have been an early attempt at self harm in order to get the abuse to stop. 

For the past month, I believe they have started listening to me, and maybe giving me a chance to prove that I can take care of us … that they can stop hurting and living in fear and chaos. Currently, they are living in my attic, very tired, and cautiously watching me try to put my life together. I’m not positive if I’m doing things right, but I’m earnestly trying. He won’t let me make much progress on my hoarding, but I think we will get there in time. Soon. (It’s not a filthy living situation by any means, just very very cluttered with lots of office supplies, art supplies, computers, clothes…)

So, yesterday, I went to help shovel a friend’s icy sidewalk and clean their house. I parked about 100 feet away, I remember the minute I parked. I remember locking my car door because I had to do it twice. I remember the drivers and the make and colors of the two cars that waited for me as I crossed the street. After a couple hours of cleaning, I went to another friends and we took their car for lunch. I asked them to drop me off back at the icy sidewalk house so I could continue my work.

Three hours later, I was ready to leave. But I couldn’t find my car. I remember every single detail of the entire day, and I was absolutely 100% positive my car was stolen. I called the police, filed a police report, signed the affidavit, and scoured the neighborhood for buildings that might have security cameras. I checked on my insurance policy to see if I was covered for theft, I went through all the things in my car mentally to see if there was anything really important that I had left in there. There wasn’t. 

I felt dizzy and disoriented - like you feel when you come home and realized your house has been broken into. But I wasn’t panicked. I was thinking clearly, and I was surprised how many details I remembered so clearly from the day. I remembered the exact minute I left my car, and the exact minute I arrived at my friends house to help shovel and clean.

You might see where this is going. After filing the police report and leaving messages for a couple businesses about looking at their camera footage, I went back to my second friend’s house to rest – the one I walked to for lunch. I realized my car was parked out front. It’s only about three blocks away. I would never normally drive three blocks. I walk anywhere nearby.

Once again, I was completely disoriented. I have absolutely no recollection of getting into the car or driving it over. I don’t remember locking It. I had my keys with me all day. I hadn’t been listening to music or podcasts at the time I would have driven the car. I haven’t been on the phone call. I was beyond emotional, I was numb and stunned … I really think I was officially in shock.

I called the police to tell them I had actually forgot I moved it. They sent the original officer over to talk to me. He could tell I hadn’t been making anything up. He was concerned about my state of mind and asked me a bunch of questions. He made me feel a bit better. At least he made me feel better that I wasn’t going to get arrested for filing a false report.

Anyway, I am still feeling … incredibly numb this morning. Maybe a little scared. I didn’t just forget where I parked my car, I completely and totally lost time out of my day. I don’t remember this ever happening before, but I wonder if it has and this time I only realized it because my car was missing. My first thought this morning was that I need to quit therapy, but the adult in me knows I shouldn’t. I won’t.

Does anybody else recognize this kind of thing happening to them? Is it common to dissociate while you’re in the middle of making progress with CPTSD and childhood dissociation?

For the record, my therapist specializes in child trauma, and is well-established in the community. I trust them. Unfortunately, it’s going to be several days till I see them again, and I just couldn’t wait to talk to somebody.

Thank you for any friendly insight about your own experiences that you might be able to share. I think I just need to feel a little support until I get to see my therapist.

I’ve never posted but I appreciate what an amazing community you’ve created here and I hope you don’t mind that I took up space on your feed.",1678637980.0

I have attachment problems.  I don't want to go into details.

I also have Dissociative Amnesia.  I basically feel like I am already dead inside due to what happened in my childhood.  I died in childhood inside (not literally).    

I understand that people who remember have different issues.  That is why honestly, I don't discuss this with people who do remember.  I am the kind of person to tell those people to get away most of the time.

I am in a place where I am moving forward.  Not thinking about what other people who used to be in my life want for me.  I am going to be going back to college.  

Honestly, I have had to look at the people I allow into my life.  The way I allow them to interact with me.  I also have to make sure I don't get caught up in trying to help people.  

I also have made peace with the place that I am in what I call, ""imaginary space.""  Which can be a hard space to be in.  It is a space where I am dead but ok with it.  Even if it would be a place that most people would flip out about.

I have basically made choices, I have decided that maybe my childhood...if I don't remember what was done then yea.  However, I've read that people with Dissociative Amnesia have a lot of issues with their bodies.  Also, sometimes people with that disorder can freak out, and not understand or know why.

I’m writing on here out of desperation for some advice or help. I feel like this has been eating me from the inside for years now. Me and my younger sister used to be very close but our relationship got gradually strained to the point it’s terrible now. I recently offered going to therapy together which we now do. I pay for it because I’m older, earn more… and frankly I care more. That’s not the issue though, I’m happy to pay for it and that’s fine. Even though we go to the therapy, nothing is improving. My sister and brother hate each other but I keep in touch with both of them. Every time we discuss holidays, problems arise because my sister doesn’t want to see my brother but me and my grandma do. I offered spending one day with my sister and one day with my brother but my sister isn’t happy with that because she lives in the house he would be visiting for holidays and she doesn’t want him there. Today my sister yet again said she wishes she cut me off. This is because I refused to uninvite our brother to mutual Easter celebration at our grandma’s house where my sister and grandma both live. My brother and sister absolutely hate each other and every time they argue my sister says she wishes she cut off the entire family because the stress is not worth it. We barely have any family left, our parents passed when we were young and we only have each other and our grandma. I never take my brothers side (I remain neutral) but she still says such hurtful things. 
Even though I’ve said in therapy I don’t want my sister to keep saying she would cut me off, she did it yet again. Therapist advised separating my sisters and mine relationship from me and my brothers relationship but my sister always turns against me when we talk about holidays and arrangements (even though I offer spending it separately so they don’t have to see each other). 
My sister has a best friend who always does anything she wants and my sister prefers her over everyone else. 
I’m always the one making all the effort with my sister - calling; texting, visiting, and everything else. Every time there is some inconvenience she threatens she would cut me off. I asked her many times if she cares about our relationship and she confirmed she does but I don’t see it. I really don’t know what to do anymore, in spite all my efforts and therapy she always ends up saying the most hurtful things such as she wishes she would cut me off.

But it’s so hard. I feel like for months now I asked my partner to atleast be considerate during nights when we have arguments about having a really hard time to sleep and being really triggered due to my trauma. I need him to atleast mention it so I don’t feel like he doesn’t care and how I have felt a lot of times during my childhood which is abandoned I guess and alone and sad. 

I much rather try and talk the same day/night when we have a fight but that’s something he doesn’t want to/can a lot of times which I find really hard to deal with but ok then I atleast would like the consideration about that part from him. But so far that didn’t happen. And it’s not all to blame him, I mean if I’m honest, I think I only recently communicated it this clearly and specific but I feel hurt and ignored that he didn’t do it before which I feel isn’t too unreasonable.

So I yelled during our argument “I have trauma!! Severe trauma and I have to ask my partner for months to get atleast a text to be considerated!!” 

Of course it’s a mixture of shit that got me losing my cool.

I feel like I weaponize my trauma against him, more often than this and act like a victim a lot of times while I totally don’t mean to. I just feel hurt so many times. And now I feel like a horrible person.

My psychotic break came after I connected more and more to myself through being aware of certain shallow behaviours and results of my cPTSD and it felt great I'm not going to lie, but the more it went and the more I kept going the more and more I felt stressed out or some weird kind of pressure just building up on me and then BAM, I decided to start blaming myself for my trauma and that was the thing that kind of let the whole ceiling fall that day and my mind went nuts, I had a trauma overload and my mind was racing. I came to a realisation I was having a psychotic episode and calmed myself and reflected a bit more after and it got me thinking that what if dissociation is actually a good thing for some of us cPTSD people?

DPDR is a natural defence mechanism for us that protects our brain until danger has passed. For us with trauma, the danger never really passes since it's still with us so me trying so much to connect so strongly might have actually been my own undoing since technically speaking my danger hasn't passed my brain and body yet. I hadn't actually healed any traumas of my own and just dealt with surface level stuff, thus my body and mind were still in danger or still inundated with all those horrible feelings (or at least it's in a state of danger).

I guess my dad attacking me was a nice reminder that I was not in fact in safety as I had assumed I was whilst I was still living with my parents, and it may have dropped all my progress in some way because of it and brought all my traumas back to the forefront.

Jokes aside, I fucking hate it. I know that it is not my fault, but I can't help it. Every time there's a new questioned diagnosis, I break a little. I feel broken. Crooked. *Done*.

BPD...with no offense to the good people who have it...was always the ONE shit I was always happy of ""not having"". Not just because of its social infamity. My mother was a bright example of unstable BPD, which influenced my attachement style severly. She -again, to fill the irony - was the medical textbook example of the diagnosis: Rapid mood swings, heavy depression & mania, paranoia, engaging in dangerous or risky things out of impulse etc. -Too often I lived through her tantrums of her tearing up my room in anger, and then 5min later to return with the most happy laughter in the world

A few days ago, I was at my therapist. It was a seemingly normal discussion, until I brought up a comic I've been reading atm. The comic included fairly good representation about mental health issues, including a mentioned side-character who has depression. The character is described as often having depressive fits, but afterwards simply switching to the opposite: Happy, optimistic and life-loving. I explained to my therapist how accurate the depiction was. Very often I would feel the same after a depressive meltdown. I never really questioned it, because I always experienced it as fairly cathartic, maybe chucking it up to a hormonal thing (my brain ""balancing itself out"").

Weeelp.

Apparently that's not very ""normal"" depression. It's a symptom of bipolar depression. The cathartic ""second phase"" is the manic phase.

And it's just...no.

I'm done.

I now I sound childish. But it's over. I don't want to hear it. I don't want to have another fucking diagnosis. You know what all this shit ALREADY means to me?

It means struggling to find a new therapy position, because my case is too complicated for many. 

It means having to deal with having to ""conviently leave out"" certain details in my applications, because certain places might want me to be treated stationary instead of freely. Even if I'm not even harming anyone and can live alone. Their suggestions alone make me feel like shit

It means having to potentially LIE to future partners. Or at least ""conviently leave out"" my range of diagnosis. Not because I *want* to be a secretive POS, but because I already have enough experience of how much people can take in information. Not just the assholes who call us ""damaged goods"" -just general. This also includes people with good, but damaging intentions suggest I should ""stay away from people"" just by my diagnosis alone (Seriously though: I know how you mean it. But the way you tell it, you are basically just telling me I'm damaged ""infected"" scum, and should not mingle as a ""social pariah"").

But somehow worst of all...it always makes me feel like I'm lying.

Like I'm nothing but one of those stupid TikTok kids. Those who fake all their disorders. It makes me feel like I'm exaggerating. That all of those things I lived through, are nothing more but colourful delusions I lived through. Nightmares I had. And now I'm just dramatizing them to feel like a victim.

My father who has Asperger's and PTSD was emotionally abusive and absent my whole life. I don't have any other positive male role models as all the other men in my family are narcissistic, unreliable, patriarchal men who run themselves to the ground at the expense of their loved ones, had affairs, egostical and I could name more.

I have healed through multiple online interactions with men since I was 16 which started on tumblr at its peak in the early 2010s to dating apps. I approached these interactions with the understanding that everyone is just casting their net and not necessarily looking for a long-term commitment which allows me to adjust my expectations early on. I'd say a good 80% of those interactions had closed some of the wounds my father had left. Despite some initial positive indications that the relationship could develop into something more meaningful, ultimately, it ended in disappointment.

To give more insight into my physical preferences, I am typically drawn to men who prioritize fitness and have a masculine build.
Despite having an ideal type, I'm willing to be flexible on certain physical attributes like height and build to a certain extent. As someone who feels like I lack masculine energy, being with a partner who exudes that energy would be healing for the emotional scars left by my father. While I am open to some flexibility in terms of height and build, as a curvaceous person who also prioritizes fitness, I wouldn't consider pursuing someone who appears too skinny or  significantly shorter than I am- I'm 5'8.5. The men in my family don't embody society's standards of physical attractiveness so I feel like there's a lot of pressure I put on myself to find someone like that.

I also admit that I have internalized feelings of being ostracized due to not fitting conventional beauty standards and being bullied for it. I'm mixed although I haven't dated within either of my ethnicities because I don't fully identify with either one. Also, my perception of everyone else from those cultures has been influenced by emotional scars from both sides of my family.

A few months ago, I met a guy while he was traveling and he seemed perfect - financially stable and independent. We had a brief but intimate relationship. The spark gradually fizzled out once he was on the road. I would only hear from him during the day and on his work breaks and he went MIA for 3 weeks. I reached out to him after not hearing from him for a while, only to find out that he had a new interest and gave me the option to remain friends or end things. I took some time to respond, and in the meantime, he unfollowed and removed me. I later received a message from an anonymous account claiming that he cheated on his girlfriend back home. I checked out her profile and saw that they were still together. It turns out that the anonymous account had messaged other girls he had met while traveling as well. While I was disappointed that things didn't work out between us, I was relieved to know that I wasn't the other woman and that I had avoided a potentially messy situation.",1678634342.0

There are a few that concern me because they point to possible SA but I have no reliable sources to figure out what actually happened. I've been working on setting boundaries and feeling safe in my body for other reasons anyway though so I feel like I'm healing regardless of what the ""real truth"" is and I need to make peace with never knowing for sure. 

But the real thing that kinda blindsided me is how many childhood memories have resurfaced after meeting an old friend from elementary school. She still remembers me fondly and talked about how we'd hang out in school. I remember that vaguely but when I learned that some of my classmates were being pretend-nice I assumed everybody else was too so I didn't bother keeping in touch after I transferred schools. Turns out she genuinely enjoyed spending time with me. 

Now memories are cropping up that are more neutral or even positive. Little things like exploring the woods near my house and working on group projects. 

For a long time I believed I dissociated throughout my childhood and just didn't have any experiences, that I didn't start living life until the past few years. Now I'm starting to realize that I did have a life. I was still sheltered and still struggled with severe anxiety, depression, dissociation, etc. but I still was able to carve out small moments of normality. 

I'm not sure how many of these are ""true memories"" but based on what others have told me, what I wrote in my diaries from that time, and pictures I've found, they all track. Besides, human memory is rarely a perfect representation of reality even at the best of times. 

Realizing all these little details about my childhood is really helping me connect with my inner child and see them as a whole person, not just a personified trauma response. I feel like some of my/our wounds are starting to heal. 

My relatives like to use ""your childhood wasn't all bad"" to shut me up when I try to talk to them about my trauma, so this realization did piss me off at first. But these memories don't cancel out the bad things that happened to me. They exist alongside them. If anything they make the abuse even worse because I'm reminded of how truly young I was and how few of those positive memories involve my family. 

I think maybe these memories are coming back because I left my hometown so I don't have the constant reminders of my family and That House. I had to devote so much mental effort to family drama that I had a Severance-level disconnect between who I was outside vs inside. 

I think the mental compartmentalization led to a divide between some of my parts and something happened subconsciously to bridge that divide. I've been having vivid and complex dreams lately and have been more fatigued almost like I'm doing EMDR again although I haven't done EMDR in a year. This coincided with me making more of an effort to reach out to my friends and pick up some projects I had dropped when the quarantine hit.",1678602699.0

I have ADHD and was put in therapy as a child because I had huge emotional meltdowns.

I was spanked often as a child and I remember begging my dad not to hit me and my parents saying how hard it was on my dad to have to spank me/how much it hurt him.

I am realizing that my child-self understood that I went to therapy to fix my behaviour and intense emotions so I could be better for my family and stop having meltdowns that were scary for my siblings. I understood that I was bad and therapy was a punishment because I was bad.

i asked for this boundary because in the past, she has gotten angry at me. she claims to be giving from the heart but then always fucking ends up holding it against me and its lowkey traumatized me. There seems to have been these hidden contracts. And when ive tried to point out that shes centering herself and not me, she dismisses what i say. so i ask that boundary of most people now. ""get my consent before offering me unsolicited advice/help"".

&#x200B;

and im especially angry because

*because*\--she made promises to me **over** and **over** that she cares about me, that she loves me, that shes here for me, but *is* she? That she wants me to recover, but DOES she???

because when she shuts me down and invalidates me anytime im ANYTHING other than what my mom abused me into being-*silent, complacent, polite, demure, obedient*\- she gets all manipulative and makes it about her. when i voice a boundary about a need, its disregarded. its about how SHE feels, how SHES *hurt*. what about fucking me??? you dont actually want me to be a recovered person. fuck you. anytime you helped me it was about you.

when you bought me shoes, you didnt even ask if  i wanted any, you didnt even ASK me to pick a pair out. You just forced a pair on me. that just really encapsulates how i feel with you. the kind of person who says ""oh i want to help you"" yet somehow never wants to do it when consent is involved, or my actual opinion and perspective is involved.

If you dont want the perspective and guidance of someone youre helping, if you cant even listen to them and defer to them, or at LEAST involve them in the conversation, you dont *actually* want to help them. whatever bullshit youre doing, its for your own self and satisfaction. can ANY fucking person in this family actually show me they want to see a re-claimed me? or will they cower and/or retaliate in anger, take out their shame on me the moment the one dubbed a ""pushover"" says the softest possible fucking ""no."" make me a scapegoat, AGAIN. so much for being there for me. so much for wanting me to recover.

\--and get this, one of my other family members is a fucking life coach, whos tagline is ""you make sense"" but when she out of the blue texted me on my bday ""im here for you !"" and i expressed i was angry at her, i never heard from her again. and she didnt text me again on my next birthday. ffs. ffs.!! dont *I* make sense? i thought you cared about me, you said youd always love me. but the moment im anything other than pleased with you, you fucking bolt. wow. WOW.

Every time I've gone to a therapist I've been misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed, and I believe part of that is due to the fact that I can be very good at masking my struggles. I can appear relatively normal when I open up to a therapist, and might even subconsciously try to hide my symptoms. One of the reasons I do these things is due to fear of being judged, but also I think it's a defense mechanism.

I actually have a hard time opening up to begin with, though that might be an understatement. I'm just emotionally numb a lot of the time while I explain my difficulties and it doesn't seem like I'm struggling that much. One time I dissociated while answering a questionnaire that was meant to determine whether I was depressed, and how depressed I was. I ended up underreporting how bad I felt, and the diagnosis was I was ""moderately depressed"". Again, quite the understatement.

Another reason why I can mask my symptoms relatively effectively is because I have a tendency to push myself past my limits at times. That means that if I have a lot of social anxiety I might force myself to talk to someone I need to anyway. I can come across a lot more capable and composed than I actually am for this reason.

I don't know where I'm going with this. It's just I don't think these coping mechanisms will change any time soon. I hope I can make things better for myself to the point I won't need them, but so far that's not been the case.",1678605787.0

I once met a girl who was a victim of different kinds of abuse during her childhood and life as well. We met at a party and were both very far from sober and when we started talking we figured out we had that thing in common. We left the party and went bar hopping and then ended up sitting on a park bench with a pack of smokes in the freezing cold telling each other the shit our families did to us and laughing our asses off. 

It was the best thing ever. The entire night went something like ""Hey, guess what, my abusive parent used to do this thing."" - ""OMG YESSS they always do this, and then THAT happens, hahahaha"" It was hilarious, and not just because we were really off our faces. Just talking to someone who knows what it's like and who isn't all shocked and awkward about it, and being able to honestly laugh and joke about those horrible things and the mental issues we have because of them. It was one of the most wholesome experiences ever for me.

Sadly we didn't exchange numbers and never saw each other again. I'm so bummed out about this in retrospect. I want a friend like that.

993,Were/are you in a cult without realising it? They mass produce cptsd.,80,11onufb,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11onufb/wereare_you_in_a_cult_without_realising_it_they/,103,"Totalist groups (cults) can range in size from one person to any number you can imagine. They can be religious, political, MLM, yoga, influencer, anything you can think of, the narrative of the group is usually not the motive of the group which is to control you and abuse you whether emotionally, psychologically, physically, sexually, monetarily through processes that always create long-term trauma you can’t escape from.

As a kid I used to refer to my childhood as like living in a fundamentalist bible-belt enclave (but without the religion); and people used to nod wisely, and then change the subject.

As an adult when ISIS came along I told people that same kind of set-up and nonsense had been my group’s goal. More nods.

But it was only this last Christmas at the age of 50 that when other members of my family witnessed the edges of the abusive behaviour from my main cult abuser (my mother) someone said: “Well yeah your problems are obviously because your mum and xxx took you off with that political cult and gave them all your money etc that you ended up in that terrible state.”

That was the first time anyone ever mentioned that word “cult”, and it’s the wrong word for what these groups really are, but a handy one, as now after years of processing all this cptsd trauma I have something tangible to work with and tangible issues to explore to do with my specific group (dispersed, normal looking, underground) and their specific abuse techniques.

Finally! And what a can of worms, but a good one to open. Anyhoo, I just thought I’d post this for anyone who has always had a funny feeling about their family and not been able to explain their childhood to others. 

You see, most people don’t even realise they’re in a cultic situation until it’s too late.

994,Struggling with high-intensity sibling dynamic,6,11p71kv,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/11p71kv/struggling_with_highintensity_sibling_dynamic/,2,"Content warning: multiple - violence, substance abuse, codependency, probably more 

I'm male and 16 years old. I have two sisters – a 14 year old sister, and an 18 year old sister. There is also a 12 year old little brother in the picture, but my relationship is more normal sibling wise with him & he is quite well adjusted. He is the exception to everything I'll describe in this post. All full siblings that grew up together in a very dysfunctional family environment. Very volatile parents, more directed at each other than us but still. Generally I took the brunt physically from my dad when it did get to that point. Financially we grew up straddling the poverty line. Rather close proximity to inner city violence but our neighborhood itself is safe. Substance abuse among parents. Father is diagnosed schizoaffective. Mom is diagnosed borderline personality disorder. 

I'll note that when we were younger, my sisters and I didn't get along. They both were pretty cruel to me especially my younger sister, escalating to violence including with weapons. Lots of them threatening & brandishing weapons. I was stabbed with a kitchen knife in the abdomen by my younger sister when I was 11, requiring an ambulance & blood transfusions & emergency surgery with a segment of intestine being removed. Older one was just verbally/emotionally abusive. Thankfully things have changed, I'm very close with both of my sisters now. They continue to have a strained relationship among themselves. 

I find myself playing caretaker to both of them, listening to them when they're emotionally upset & deescalating tense situations. Tons of peacemaking etc. While I love helping and don't really mind some emotional labor, it's been hard to say no when I needed. Boundaries have been really hard for me... I'm doing better now with boundaries, but there have been periods of transiently being codependent & enmeshed among us. We've also all had serious substance issues – some pretty typical teenager stuff like LSD, MDMA, mushrooms, etoh, weed... but also harder stuff like ketamine, spice, and cocaine. 

While they've had the most mental health services, they are distrusting of the system. All of us have had multiple involuntary admits and off-and-on therapy from toddler age. I don't have access to a therapist anymore. They simply just refuse to go. I feel like I've gotten the most benefit, am currently the most stable by far. I've been 100% sober for several months without help... but also had the least frequent/intense use. I've assumed the role of trying to model interpersonal effectiveness and good distress tolerance skills for them... to no avail, lol. I'm also the affectionate one which positive attention from me is generally well recieved. 

Right now I'm struggling seeing them how they are. Little self awareness, virtually no anger management, little self control, no accountability, completely external locuses of control, downright awful to each other, very high conflict, very manipulative behavior, awful communication... totally uncontrolled addiction, victim mentality, some medically unexplained persistent illness which I believe is psychogenic... older sis does in-fact have a PNES diagnosis. Quite a bit of self injury both overt and covert. Definite eating disorder symptoms...

Like I said, they are not compliant in any way with therapy. They usually listen to me at least a little, I've tried to get them to participate in their therapy. They will not. They seem to be responding a little to me working with them and gently calling them out. At this point I'm doing it partly for them yes, but partly for myself just so the household is calmer. We're mainly working on accountability, developing internal locus of control, communication/interpersonal effectiveness, and anger management. There's been some (but not much) progress. 

I've also been getting twinges of resentment, especially at my older sister. I love her too much to express it out loud. But it is so frustrating that she gets to have volatile reactions to conflict which everyone excuses due to her diagnoses... but even though I have similar emotions to similar triggers, I have to keep my shit under wraps. Also simultaneously so happy but also so frustrated my little brother isn't experiencing any of this.",1678601167.0

That we did a lot of normal family things, like going to the zoo and on holiday. Joking around, playing and hugging. It makes me question everything, I'm really unsure what's even considered normal.

I mean my mom is overly affectionate and says i love you SO often, writes little nice messages, spends lots of time on us, did a lot of things for me etc. I love her and we're really close.

Then suddenly everything collapses? Like she explodes with anger and screaming and threats, name calling or with fear, anxiety, panic and sobbing. She says her life is awful, we ruined it/her and she's gonna abandon us or hit us. Send us away or die. Even leaving the house, performing fake abandonment, but then returning the next day. Arguing with dad to extreme levels and SCREAMING so loud. Like... you said the opposite 5 mins ago lol.

Well my dad is just emotionally unavailable and passive aggressive. Always traveling. Always harsh on me especially, which he has admitted to. It's bc I'm so similar to him he says. He expects more of me. We were never close but he feels safer than my mom cause I know he's not gonna be so volatile and he wouldn't lose it like my mom. He wouldn't do something really bad, but my mom might. He also wouldn't do something really affectionate and caring, which my mom might.

Im thinking my mom is anxious and my dad is avoidant. Which would make sense considering their objectively obviously awful childhoods.

A little background: mentally and emotionally abusive marriage (very rarely physical and then only small things). DH sees every conflict or disagreement as a huge fight. I can’t even say ‘I’m hurt by the lack of support when I told you B hurt my feelings and you responded with “I have nothing to say’.’ I did tonight while standing with knees slightly bent, hands in my pockets, one foot slightly behind the other etc to show calm and relaxed with an even tone of voice. It turned into talking about a short argument from last week where he twisted my words and it seems is now angry because I just shut up and gave him the space he has asked for when angry. It went from there to screaming at me, calling me names, saying he will take everything etc. Through all that I kept saying ‘can you please not yell at me?’ ‘Please be more respectful’ and ‘I’m not going to be treated this way’ and I walked away. (At one point he was telling me to get the F out and I responded ‘you get out’ and that’s when I realized I needed to say the last and walked away because I escalated that time). 

For myself I go to another room or my own separate bedroom and do positive affirmation meditation, deep breathing, listen to music, vent to a friend, journal etc. Tonight it was body check, relax, breathing, journal and music. Within a few minutes he was banging on the locked door and screaming at me again. I responded that I’d talk only if it was calm and respectful. Otherwise I was staying in my safe space and calming myself. That was the wrong thing to say because the threats started, more beating on the door, texting etc and at one point he even shook the door hard enough for it to open while locked. 

Any better ways to de-escalate myself? The situation? Any ideas on how I can de-escalate him? 

He’s admitted his anger is a problem but thinks his drinking and threats are fine because I ‘push him to it by being a bitch’ or wrong tone, or wrong look, wrong phrasing, not enough sex etc. 

And no I can’t leave. It’s not an option for several reasons. I’ve looked into it. Maybe in 1-2 years if everything works out right. Until then I just need advice on de-escalation.
