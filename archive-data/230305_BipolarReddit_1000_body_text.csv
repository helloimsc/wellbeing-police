"Welcome! This is a community focused on supporting people diagnosed with bipolar disorder. If you are bipolar, we’re glad you’re here. We are a judgement-free community that wants to see all people diagnosed with bipolar disorder achieve enduring health and balance. 

As you explore the discussions, here is a primer on how this community works.

* Most people who post and comment on r/BipolarReddit have already received a medical diagnosis, including bipolar type 1, type 2, schizoaffective or cyclothymia. If you have not yet sought a diagnosis, we encourage you to meet with a doctor, discuss your concerns and solicit their diagnosis. However, you are welcome to read and ask general questions in your pursuit of health.  
* A medical diagnosis can only be given by a medical professional. If you are concerned enough about your mental health to ask if you are bipolar, that is sufficient reason for you to seek a medical opinion. None of us participate here in a medical capacity, and no one here can or will tell you if you are bipolar. Those kinds of questions are not for this subreddit.
* We like to be precise. Terms like mania, hypomania and major depression have specific definitions, and we ask you to familiarize yourself with the medical terminology. We have created a wiki for (and authored by) people with bipolar disorder, based on the DSM-V. Please [review the definitions](https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/wiki/index/definitions). **Important Note:** The terms mania and hypomania are often conflated, inaccurately. Please be exact in your use of these terms when posting and commenting because it helps the community understand the severity of what you are experiencing, which helps us give you the best support. Mania is a medical emergency that typically requires hospitalization. We understand that it can be hard to know exactly what is going on in the moment. Just do your best so we can better understand you. 
* We invite you to [explore the rest of our subreddit’s wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/wiki/index), which has valuable information and resources this community has compiled. There are some common questions for people with bipolar disorder. Before posting a question, please look through the wiki to see if your question has already been answered.  
* Harassment is not tolerated, and this subreddit is actively moderated. Do not post anything that is hateful or hurtful to others’ path to health. Robust discussion and strong opinions are most welcome, but keep it kind. If you see harassment, report the post or comment and use the “Message the Mods” button with any background information, if you have it. Please do not engage. We will get to it as quickly as we can. 
* If you are not bipolar, you may want to visit r/BipolarSOs or related subreddits. This is not a place to discuss bipolar on behalf of someone else or seek opinions on whether someone else is bipolar. The one exception is if you have an urgent help question and need a fast answer (e.g., “My SO is diagnosed bipolar and is currently psychotic, what do I do?”). 
* We don’t do memes, art or other popular media. Such posts will be removed. We are purely focused on support through discussion."
"This happened a year ago, it felt like taking edibles in addition to colors being more vibrant. It scared me so much I thought I was schizophrenic. Risperidone stopped the feeling within a week."
"Sooo I’ve been off my bipolar meds lamotrigine & latuda  for about 4 months .I see my psychiatrist every month and I act as if I’m taking my bipolar meds when in reality I’m only taking my anxiety meds. This past session she could see I’m losing weight ( I’ve lost 30 pounds) since I stopped my bipolar meds. Even tho I’m skinner I’m more emotional, impulsive, angry , depressed, wanting sex & attention so much hating myself for being single at 28 . But I’m scared if I get back on my bipolar meds I’ll get fat and no man will want me and I top of that I found out I have HSV2 so I want to be as thin & hot as possible so men can look past my herpes & bipolar. But I’m miserable , emotional, switching from mania to depression and feel guilty for lying to my psychiatrist about still being on my meds should I confess when I see her next week?"
Im deperste to talk to someone with this same problem
"Seroquel is working for me in every way except two. Firstly, my joints and chest hurt a lot. But that's something I should bring up with my doctor. Though my doctor doesn't really understand most things I bring up to him.

I'm feeling really lazy on seroquel. Like I am not doing anything. I'm eating way too much. I have no self control. I just don't have any will power. It's like my brain won't listen to me. I did notice a flicker of responsibility today where I almost started doing a class assignment but usually I can't even do the first step because the laziness is so bad and the task feels daunting.

The reason I know this has to do with the medication is cause on my last medication I wasn't as lazy. I had some serious agitation on Latuda but I was more motivated and organized, and was able to keep up in my academics. 

I was so close to my degree and now I am dropping out of school because I can't do a single assignment. I can't even leave my bedroom honestly. But I really don't want to stop seroquel because my mind feels really calm."
"I have not really found others who feel this way except Emerson, and he is dead   


When I go hiking, I feel I am transported to another world. I wouldn’t say it’s any particular world, just one of intense beauty. I can look into the canopies of trees in wonder—actually I can do that in any slightly tree’d area, even a parking lot. But when I am actually IN nature, as in hiking or the like, it feels transcendental.   


It doesn’t matter if I’m depressed, manic (well, then it’s a much more intense trip), stable. Nature always makes me feel intensley connected, and so joyful that I often cry.   


This does wear off, for instance if I’ve been hiking for several hours, but each time I go hiking it is about an hour’s worth of pure euphoria. 

I am not trying to act like “I am so special and others aren’t”—it’s just that others often seem quite confused, amused, or disturbed by my behavior. I assume others walk into a forest, for instance, and think it is quite nice and absorbs the landscape all at once. Wheras I seem to take in every light and shadow as if it’s a cinematic masterpiece. Every bird song, god forbid there is running water nearby because I will just about break down in tears. I also tend to focus on the minutae more than others. I think I feel the same exhuberance seeing the leaves sway in the wind and the light flicker in and out as others see at the peak of a mountain.   


Wondering if this is a common bipolar thing. I am pretty positive it is, but would like to feel less alone."
"Due to my psychiatrist having diagnosed me as bipolar, I’ve been on Lithium, Effexor and Propranolol for over 6 months and my psychiatrist told me it was time to visit a psychotherapist. I visited a trusted one today and I was shook when they told me I’d better come off my meds gradually with the supervision of a psychiatrist and they didn’t diagnose me with any disorder. (A part of me thinks I’ve been more stable and also more forgetful so I may have explained everything like it was about someone else because I really have been better with my meds)
I’ve been confused all day thinking what I should do. My own psychiatrist is a very knowledgeable person too. What would you do if you were in my situation?"

"I’m being followed, i know i’m not. But I swear i am! I know i am because i read license plates. I believe my cars suspension has been tampered with…Obviously this make’s driving terrible. I think i hear people talk about me…it goes on and on. I’m self aware to admit that they are delusions but i know they are real and no one believes me…i hate this disease…"
"My therapist told me that I can try focusing on self-compassion when I feel like I’ve fallen short. Which is often when I have overwhelming anxiety about a short social interaction. 

I can be very self-critical and I also experience auditory hallucinations which can be in the form of me believing I’m hearing someone talk about me behind my back. What’s difficult is that I don’t know if it’s a hallucination or not. 

So I have to choose to discredit whatever I think I’ve heard in order to stay calm. But sometimes I can’t, and my heart races and my breath stops and tears well in my eyes all because I think that some random stranger was talking about me being displeasing after interacting with them. 

I’m getting better at regulating. I’ll practice breathing exercises, sensory grounding etc. But I want to ask,

What would you tell yourself or do to give yourself compassion?"
"Mental health been on the decline for about a month now.

Energy super low and fatigued all the time.

Took a sleep study and have severe sleep apnea.

Got a cpap machine and started treatment. Energy is better, but my mood is off the walls since I started upping my caffeine.

Suspect its my increased caffeine intake for sure.

Been taking the Mio energy drops and just realized today it says light squeeze for a serving.. I’ve been doing full squeezes and multiple drinks a day with coffees.

I feel like a mess.. Had to take extra klonopin to calm me down.

What are my options for energy when this is clearly doing a number on my mental states?"
"I've been to a psychiatrist recently and they informed me I have a unidentified mood disorder, when in reality I know it is bipolar, I have all the symptoms but when she went over the symptoms I lied to her, so now I'm in a mess. My father was a known bipolar,  who also was Manic Depressive, which leads me to believe the increased chance that I am bipolar. Here is what I'm going through right now
Anger, not just like a tiny bit but like terrible terrible episodes (that's what I think they are) this is the description of a normal episode for Me- screaming, crying, swearing, hitting anything I can, hurting myself hurting anything around me (mostly inanimate objects) I don't feel in control, anything I want to say just comes out, I have no filter and control is lost. 
Irresponsible behaviors (keep in mind I am 15)- I have started smoking marijuana, sneaking out, drinking alcohol, honestly doing anything I can do without the thought of risk in mind.
Unusual appetite - idk if that's a symptom- but I usually eat very little during the day and binge at night
Unable to show emotions when I want too - the only time I can cry is during a episode other than that I can't cry and I'm starting to not be able to feel happy either, something happy happens and I smile but something inside of me like a rock in my stomach reminds me that I'm still sad and mentally unstable
I can't go a day without having an episode and recently they are getting worse, I've had increased drive of (TW: SH MENTIONS) self harm which I told my parents and psychiatrist, neither took concern.
I am on medication: Seroquel
Does anyone have tips or anything I just need an answer because I don't know how long I can keep doing this it's unbearable.."
I’ve been acting out these last couple of weeks in terms of alcohol and drug use and feel like I just can’t stop. People are constantly worried that I might do stupid shit but I feel suffocated with their constant worries and it makes me act out even more. I just want it to stop because I’m litteraly drowning in my own chaos and I can’t take it anymore.
"I started taking 20mg of Latuda in June 2020. Prior to that I had been on 100mg of Seroquel until I had a mini episode which lead to the Latuda. I've noticed since then that my weight has increased and I am having a hard time taking it off. I was always in the 160s prior to latuda, now I am consistently around 180. At first I thought it was the pandemic weight, but now that life is back to normal and I work out a lot, the weight doesn't seem to budge and I have to think the Latuda is causing it? Has anyone switched from or come off Latuda? I am hoping my pdoc lets me ditch the Latuda and maybe double up on the seroquel. I am frustrated bc I like my sanity but don't like this excess weight and high blood pressure that I now have. Any suggestions or ideas?"
"hi all i’m in grad school while managing bipolar disorder. admittedly the stress gets intense sometimes. during my winter break along w the help of my therapist i got into a nice self-care routine. now i find that i’m losing that sense of routine, with grad school compounding everything. how do you protect your time, and stay as on top of self-care as much as possible or emphasize the importance of self-care? like what do you say to yourselves to pep talk? the things i’m starting to lose are staying on top of chores (organizing my room), brushing teeth (unless i have to talk in an in-person meeting), exercise, and healthy eating/cooking.

the things im doing well still are taking meds daily, and breathing meditations 2x/day. does anyone else experience this falling out of routine sometimes?"
"I was good for a while. Then my MIL had a heart attack and then several big falls and now she’s in the hospital with basically no short term memory until she has like 3 different procedures done. Which will take months to get and then she will need rehab afterwards. 

I had to make a complaint to HR at my job about my supervisor and ask to be transferred to another job inside the company because I can’t deal with him. He is a licensed therapist but decides what parts of his job to do and not do and I want nothing to do with that. 

My husband got told at his job Friday that they need to talk to him since he’s been there 6 years and still hasn’t passed his licensing exam. He thinks he’s going to get fired. 

I’m terrified my husband is going to have a heart attack if his mom dies and I’ll be a widow at 40. I don’t know what happens if she does with her house which we live in with her. 

I feel like nothing is stable right now and I’m mad and sad and I feel like I have no outlet to talk about it because of how social media is. I don’t have a therapist anymore because I have no time to go (I work from 700-330) and where we live nobody has availability right now. 

I want his mom to write a will saying we won’t be immediately homeless if she passes away. And a lot more. But she’s got the short term memory of a goldfish right now from the MI. 

I just need someone to listen. I feel like I have to hold it together for everyone and I don’t know if I’m able."
"hello, I'm 33m and currently in a psych ward. I've been on 9 different antidepressants of various classes over the years and none of them have been helpful. My doctor has suggested lithium, I'm worried about this because of the close monitoring it requires, the potential tremors, the gastrointestinal distress, and that it lowers testosterone and kills erections.   


Have any of you found it helpful? Have you had to forgo having a sex life? I'd really love it that if in 2023 there was a psychopharma product that didn't near enough chemically neuter you, or decimate your physical health in favour of some mental stability.  I can keep dreaming I suppose, and keep spinning the medication roulette wheel.

Thanks"
"I have been on olanzapine for nearly 4 years maybe closer to 5. It was prescribed to me as an out of the box way to treat my depression and anxiety. I don’t have bipolar disorder. I just cannot tolerate SSRI’s at all. 


I’m on 2.5 mgs and I met with my provider stating I wanted to come off the medication due to weight gain. I don’t plan on replacing it with another medication as years of therapy have worked wonders for me. 

My provider told me since I’m on such a low dose a taper was not needed. I have done my research and I don’t feel like that is sound advice, especially since I’ve been taking it for so long. 

I want to taper but I have no idea how. I was thinking about just going down to 1.25 for a month, if that went smoothly then doing another taper by cutting the half dose in half again (so 0.625 mgs) and do that for as long as needed. Then when stabilized, going to 0.625 mgs every other day. Then after stabilizing going down to 0.625 every 3 days etc. until I’m able to completely come off the drug. I feel like I should do at least a month each between each taper. 


Any advice? I would seek out a new provider but I just started a new job 02/27. I already have 3 appointments for my crohns infusions, so I don’t want to take more time off if it can be avoided. Any input would be sooooo appreciated"
After upping my dose of lithium I've been sleeping upwards of 12+ hours a day. I have no energy and am tired ALL THE TIME and feel like I have a fogo over my head. I also suffer from narcolepsy but I take a medicine for that(sunosi) to keep me awake. It doesn't seem to be having any effect like it previously did. I don't know if my narcolepsy medicine just isn't working or something else? Which doctor should I talk to first?
"What was your dosage and how long were you taking it before you went manic?

I was prescribed as-needed 20mg prednisone for a gastrointestinal issue. Most of what I'm seeing suggests this wouldn't be enough/long enough to trigger mania, but some reports seem like it can happen right away. I would probably never need to take this multiple days in a row.

I'm not asking for medical advice here--I trust this doctor pretty well--just some perspective on other people's experiences."
"My mother died on Monday. She was elderly, people don’t live forever, blah, blah, blah. Also we had a difficult relationship. I was sad when she died; I hated seeing her struggling even with all the meds. 

But now, 5 days later, I’m…fine. I don’t cry. I don’t particularly miss her. (Granted we lived in different parts of the state, so I wasn’t around her all the time.)

When my father died 5 years ago I broke right in two. I grieved and grieved and then went into a year long depressive episode that was horrible. But we had a close relationship. 

But still. She’s my mother. Shouldn’t I be feeling something?????????

For context, BP1, just had med adjustment to address depressive symptoms, and feeling better. Maybe that’s blocking the grief? Am I in denial?"
"Did anyone watch this? I have been following Alex heller on Instagram for years @thementallytrillest bc she would post some good bipolar memes. The recently created a move called The Year Between about a woman who leaves college bc of her bipolar.
Anyone watch this?
Honestly I was disappointed. It didn’t depict depression or mania at all really. And also the main character was pretty rude, mean and ridiculous to people , which I can’t relate to. Overall I think it doesn’t depict bipolar very well and I was wondering what others thought"
"Metallica's ""One"" is now hitting different.... I'm a meat puppet for sadistic professionals who fix my beliefs to theirs....  


I was diagnosed at 20 with ASD through ADOS.

I just re-read all the ASD criterions.... none... and i mean NONE apply to me. Except for two merely notable issues placed within brackets.  


I feel like they diagnosed me with autism simply cause i have good intellectual habits.   


I never had eye-contact issues unless it was anxiety, or depressed as shit... which, for that, wasn't very common either. I communicate better than most people.... I communicate better than most people... I want more and more people to communicate with....  


Fuck this label honestly, i want it out of my life.   
On Lamictal i'm finally revisiting my old ADHD symptoms (was diagnosed at 14), and i feel young, rejuvenated, purposeful... But silly me loses focus sometimes for trivial things... and that's cool... that's classic Sam.  


I'm being played and money-grabbed hard....  
And people just stare at me... like i'm the problem. I better stop... i'm losing my cool"

I am not thinking of doing this or anything, but I have always thought I would love it if someone was there to help me with all of these pieces that keep my mental health intact.  Curious if others feel the same!"
"I’ve been mentally suffering for so long and it’s hard to bear at times. I understand that that moment of mental pain and discomfort will pass, it’s just that, for those who aren’t mentally strong enough, the answer is to end their suffering bc it is too much to bear."
"I'm trying to find out if I have, or have had episodes certain times, but I found that some hypomanic symptoms I feel like I always have because of my ADHD.

How do you recognise ""pressure to keep talking"", ""flight of ideas/racing thoughts"" and ""distractibility"" as part of hypomania when you have ADHD? Like when do you know?
I feel like I always have very quick thoughts, can keep talking and of course very easily distracted... So I just not count those criteria when trying to see if I'm hypomanic."
"Is it really delusional if part of me thinks it isn't real but it just feels so real?

I feel like my mom hates me and tries to brainwash me into taking my meds even though deep down I know she just wants the best for me."
"Misdiagnosis intrusive thoughts are coming back... Cause they were triggered by someone... I'm immediately very angry now.....

I need to go back to happiness, this is not good. The world wants me dead.

If doctors can't help me... I have ultimate solutions."
"Does anyone have any kind of tips to balance out manic energy? I’m a single parent so working out or getting out alone is hard, but sometimes I feel like I have so much energy and get restless.

Other times I’m so low-energy that I don’t want to brush my hair or make anything to eat that isn’t from the freezer. 

I’m on buspar, klonopin, Lamictal and Zoloft. All rather high doses minus the buspar because I’ve just started taking it recently. 

Is there ever a true balance? I’m just trying to achieve some kind of stability with my energy during those times."
"I got blood work done for the first time since starting litihium, I’m at .5 however my creatinine and A/G ratio are outside of the normal range. I got blood work done before taking lithium and they were inside the normal range  I dont wanna make assumptions but i’m thinking it could be the lithium. Wondering if anyone has experienced this as well and if your pdoc had you try something else or just continue monitoring your kidneys/liver"
"I can never seem to make a good impression on people I meet, at least when I first meet them. My cycling in mood makes me seem disinterested and then all of a sudden very interested and it makes me look two faced. At this point the amount of people that hate me is larger than the amount that actually like me or can bear my presence. Worst of all, I can’t control the way I behave towards people all the time. Sometimes im too quite and uninteresting and other times I’m too loud and annoying. I fucking hate it, I don’t want to be around anyone anymore."
"Yeah so no, I should not be smoking weed. It's just not for me. Over did it today by accident (was just taking two puffs, then didn't realize I actually smoked three until my friend ((somebody I'm romantically involved with)) said it). And now my brain is doing gymnastics and going back and forth between this and that. I'm so stupid to think weed would be the savior for all of my issues. I have several diagnoses. I should be smarter than this."
"(NOTE: I honestly don't know if this is allowed to be spoken about but I'm desperate for opinions.) & that one thing is marijuana as long as I don't smoke it every day and as long as I only take one puff from a cartridge. Idk if it's bad for me to be doing this? I stopped smoking entirely last year in early December. I had a manic episode in January due to insurance no longer accepting Vraylar. So I was put on Geodon and that calmed me down... and I was doing relatively okay for about three or so weeks until this week. Depression has hit me like a fucking bus. And this wonderful person I'm romantically involved with let me smoke a puff of his weed and almost instantly I was no longer so depressed. It puts me in a much better mood, and I've never been addicted to marijunana. It's easy for me to stop. And I don't get physical or mental withdrawals. So I'm wondering... what's so bad about smoking it when I'm severely depressed? I can't talk to my psych about this bc most doctors seem to believe marijuana worsens mental health... but I don't necessarily believe that. I just want opinions on using marijuana as a lifter when you have treatment-resistant bipolar depression."
"I begin a relationship with my girlfriend about 2 months ago, she has adah and she thinks of the world and feelings through her experiences and way of seeing the world. For example, earlier this month I had a pretty bad streak of depression episodes, and one day I had a meeting that I was super excited for and Stayed maniac all day, the next day I was super depressed, and she was like ""but you were so happy yesterday, I thought that u were getting better"", I have nothing to complain about her, I'm the first person with bipolar that she ever met and she tries her maximum to comprehend and help me. I just shared this because I needed to put this out of my chest, how hard it is to person who don't live this to understand what we go through."
"Treatment is working! Lamotrigine, working wonders!!
Im suddenly doing daily gym after 4 years of none of that!
I'm social, and not anxious.
I'm sharp, but not angry."
"I can’t finish , it’s a struggle …it’s nothing like it use to be . Maca isn’t doing it vitamins ect, im on the search for something that will get my full orgasms back … I can’t live forever like this 
Anyone found anything for this more so than libido ?

Edit : I’m on venlafaxine,Lamotrigine,Trazodone
The best combo I’ve ever had so I’m scared to switch up again"
"So I'm in the process of getting stabilizers so I'm currently not on meds and I've noticed  I'm getting more irritated. Snapping at people and came very close to causing a car crash intentional on more than one occasion.

Anyone else get like this and what did you do?"
"i dont know if its because of my bpd or adhd, but i'm completely paralyzed.

i was doing ok few weeks ago, but suddenly my mood start to swing and im depressed, anxious and started having constantly mood swings, and this fear possessed my body so hard that i cant move or do anything.

i relapsed with the pills and marijuana and im tacking everything to blocks that endless despair that ive been feeling all the time. 
but it's just getting worse and suicidal idealization is getting stronger everyday.

im goin to be real here. never anything good happened in my life, im surrendered by chaos, tragedy, and anger. 

my HOLE family is crazy.

 and i don't think things can get better anymore. im fighting healy hard to not end things, but im sure ive been curse, my hole family was. 

anyone feels that you have been curse to? that things can only get better to get way more worse after???

dont know if i can stand this anymore"
I hate this stupid mental illness. I feel like I can’t even have any emotions with out ruining other peoples moods around me. I don’t want to be like this anymore. I just want to be normal and happy. I don’t want to hurt anyone because of how I’m feeling. I don’t want to be like this anymore.
"There are some people who pop a pill and a month later, all symptoms disappeared. Mentally healthy again. It’s not like that for a lot of us. For a lot of us, bipolar disorder is a struggle and difficult to live with despite being on meds. Meds don’t solve everything for us"
"Super annoyed. Physically exhausted but mentally right as rain super sharp thoughts not racing…yet. But they are ever present. I guess I need to change my sleep medication again. Can’t do ambien, seroqel, lunesta, Doxepin, or trazadone. Anyone have something they like that I can talk with my doctor about?"
"Relate?

Juxtapose to who?

Mental health stigma erodes,

Until it is feared and mocked like bipolar disorder,

When the mania finally blossoms…

Not so pretty?

Delusional is scary?

Institutionalize to help or hide it?

Bothered by it?

Burdensome?

I can understand that,

Do you understand having a partner threatens to put you away if you did not do what they want?

When thoughts gush like a hydrant and I lose track of time,

No sleeping or remembering deadlines,

So goal oriented, your feral,

Racing thoughts leave me wandering and scattered, I love it until I hate it,

I become a lamp without its shade,

No self help or nurse makes me fine,

I married one and I feel empty like an anorexic,

That’s why my waist slims each day,

Im addicted to the sense of crave."
I’m struggling with suicidal thoughts and a huge impulsive drive to just do it. Idk if I need to seek help or not. I really don’t want to.. I’m off and on my meds but I don’t think my meds are working regardless. Psychiatrist was talking about putting me on a mood stabilizer and maybe that’ll help. I’m just so…. Numb. I don’t want to do this anymore…
"It is usually calming but lately it’s been making me feel like a zombie. 
I stay hydrated, eat healthy, and take vitamins. Why is it doing this?"
"I’m struggling to find the right place for this discussion. I have this thing where when I’m driving I get a lot of anxiety in certain kinds of locations. Basically places that are really dense and slow and chaotic  like shopping centers, college campuses, and downtown areas. 

Navigation software typically makes this problem worse for me  because when I am traveling in an unfamiliar area  I will have to rely on the GPS to find me things like stores and restaurants, and I have no warning typically until I get to the place of what kind of place it’s going to be. And there have been more than a few times when my GPS took me to a very uncomfortable location in search of a cup of coffee or something and before I even got there I was bugging out enough that I no longer wanted to even get there and just needed to get out of the dense area, but there’s no way to do that Because the GPS doesn’t have a mode for avoid dense areas. So I try to tell the GPS to take me somewhere, anywhere, but half the time it just takes feet deeper into the dense area because it thinks that’s a more efficient route then backtracking to the highway or whatever. 

I tried talking to a few friends and posted on Facebook about this, and the reply was really just people making fun of me because what the fuck is wrong with me that I can’t handle being in a shopping center or university campus and just suck it up that’s normal life and you’re being such a stupid little snowflake. 

Personally I hope to believe that people are allowed to have their own needs and anxieties  end it would be really nice if the people around us could acknowledge our concerns and help support us rather than just telling us that we’re weird and shouldn’t care about that thing. 

But, I really don’t know why it is that I care about this. Is it a bipolar thing? Is it just something related to my own personal trauma? Really, I guess the reason it matters to me at this point is that this problem has been so persistent and so frustrating for me and so completely ignored by the service providers out there but I am starting to really think about saving up some cash and paying a programmer to write me a bug out app. 

I want a piece of navigation software that does one thing and one thing only: gets me out of the dense area  that I am in, and onto the nearest highway pointing outward from the area of high population density.

I really don’t think this should be a difficult algorithm at all, considering that most navigation algorithms already have awareness of the different sizes of roads out there. It would really only need to find the quickest route to the nearest road with a higher speed limit than the one I am on, and then from there again to the next largest road. There are probably open source Lego pieces that can be put together to do this pretty quickly, but even a basic phone app is still multiple thousands of dollars at the cheapest. I could probably get someone in India or Mexico to do it for a couple thousand dollars, but I don’t want to invest if it’s really truly something that I alone care about. In my work as a disability attorney, I have from time to time at Clients report to me but they also had anxiety in certain driving situations, but among my clients  the usual response is simply to work on driving less rather than trying to find a way to make it more tolerable. I fear that the combination of this symptom combined with the lifestyle habit of traveling frequently might be too small of a Venn diagram for there to be any interest at all. 

So, if you’ve gotten this far in this long winded post, can you let me know whether you relate to this experience, and if so whether you might also appreciate a technological solution?"
"I’ve sent a handful of emails and texts to some very very important people. All my teammates started ghosting me. My manager did the bare minimum to talk to me. Even HR stopped supporting me in any way. Literally two months before the episode, I was everyone’s favorite employee known for my kind and compassionate behavior yet being a great performer. 

When I told them I’m leaving, it seemed like all of them were celebrating. I did end up with a much better job and pay but still regret everything during my mania since I did really enjoy my last company. 

How did your mania affect your worklife?"
"Anyone else have this dx? Any reading suggestions? Any TLDR from someone who may understand the reason this would exist and not be depression +  schizoaffective or something and why that distinction would matter?

I am going to try and speak to the doctor and/or my psych again but I just don't have a great relationship with them- no big drama and not me saying ""they're out to get me"" lol but honestly they're just mpre the phoning it in type at a big messy clinic for poor people and that's all I got right now, and I struggle to advocate for myself in real time even if I prepare written questions etc. In my defense a bit again, they know about this problem (we've discussed it specifically and also it matches my other top diagnoses CPTSD and autism Level 2) and never offer me more information beyond basic sentences ""this is your diagnosis, this is your meds now"" etc.

Background: I have definitely experienced multiple episodes of what I guess you'd call acute psychosis, full on delusion/hallucination with a big fancy story to it like I'm a liberating alien goddess and lasting a week or two or less. Aside form that, my life pattern fits BP2 on the more depressive end of the spectrum and with several brief hypomanic periods a year mostly characterized by reckless behavior, megalomania and increased paranoia but no actual delusions. Unless it would be those psychosis episodes, I've never had mania, clearly only hypo. So I don't think I'm misdiagnosed BP1.

Does this make sense or sound familiar to anyone?

I forget about it all the time but along with CPTSD they also said I have DPDR and possibly OSDD (?? lol yeah I know that's a big bomb to drop I jsut don't know anything about it and it was talked about a whole bunch but last I saw my paperwork it wasn't on there idk) and I know I dissociated and maladaptive daydreamed a lot during my child trauma which seems to lean in to the idea of my psychosis not being bipolar- having an external cause/being the result of conditioning if that makes sense but I know the way I'm looking at it may not be right.

I've been taking the same meds and stable to depressive for the last 2 years, I haven't had a psychosis episode for 4 years and that was triggered by a personal tragedy and lasted only 4 days until I was put in inpatient and meds cleared it up quickly. Looking back at how most of my psychosis happened during a period of regular abuse I don't know if I've ever had an epiode that didn't have a direct trigger in my life, they don't just happen. To my understanding that is another distinction from much, although not all, BP1 mania.

So the concept of BP2 with psychosis makes sense for my specific situation, it just doesn't seem to be a credible diagnosis and I'm just confused.

Thanks anyone who tok the time."

"I just need to vent I guess. Feeling deep regret every day since I’ve come down. I was using coke and alcohol often for 3 months (I’m now sober 90 days) and I think it sent me into a manic episode. I ended my 5 year relationship for literally no reason, just felt like I had to. There was nothing wrong and now thinking back on it I wish I never did that. I moved out of our home and in with this other guy who had feelings for me. I even got matching tattoos with this man. On top of the world. And now, I have to deal with the consequences of my actions. My ex and I are back together, but his trust in me is ruined. He doesn’t even want me to  move back in because he is afraid I will become manic again and leave. I’m sober now and taking meds and therapy. I don’t feel like I would ever leave him again, I love him to pieces. I just don’t know how to prove this to him. Every day I wallow in regret about this…"
"I went out, drank, made friends, partied...

It was what i needed, unironically.

I've been manic or hypomanic for 6 years due to trauma

Today it all went away. Ngl don't think I was bipolar but didn't know anywhere else to post.

I was just so lonely for years and I am not anymore so it went away, I feel like a different person

Love you guys

btw i probably won't respond, i was chronically online when I was manic, I am not anymore"
How do you guys deal with extreme anxiety attacks? I have found zero things to help except going for a walk and it only helps temporarily. It gets so bad that i just want it to end and start having suicidal idealization. My doctor refuses to give me anything to sooth the anxiety due to them being benzos.
"I just started on a low dose of 25 mg and just taking at night for insomnia and when I have severe frozen to the couch panic attacks/depressions. I’ve been on semaglutide and done great losing weight (I actually needed it - was borderline diabetic and obese).

"My recent first episode was induced by drugs back in December. I found a recent combo that works and stabilizes me, but I still feel far from normal. Everything is slower including my vision, and I feel cognitively impaired. Everyone is going to say to ""find the right combo"" but I don't think anything is going to make me feel normal or the way I was. I don't believe in a ""new normal"" that's cope. I'm more boring, uncreative, and unintelligent on meds. Nothing triggered the mania that was out of my control, I should also mention that the drugs gave me delusions and psychotic symptoms that persisted for days which is why I started the medication. I'm not saying I believe in med free, but meds are just not working for me. 

 Also wondering if my life and cognition gets better from anyone else's experience with recovery cause I'm currently on the edge."

"I’ve recently started taking Vraylar for my bipolar. At first I felt AMAZING. No depression and anxiety. But then, I started feeling down and low because my energy is gone.. my drive for life seems to be gone. I talked to my therapist and psychiatrist about this. I’m working on pulling through and hoping this passes. I’m just feeling so lonely and down on life.. I want my energy and drive back.. even sex isn’t stimulating:( I feel defeated. Anyone else taking Vraylar and have similar experiences? Or no?"
During my manic episode in 2020 I stayed awake for almost 2 entire days without sleeping at all. What has your experience been? I’m actually curious. I just can’t sleep I’m so hyped up sometimes.
"This question goes to anybody in a traditional 1:1, husband/wife, or provider nurturer relationship (sexual orientation does not matter).

Were you scared of bringing them down or being a burden? 

Please elaborate on ANY experience. Feel free to go off on a tangent. Thanks"
"I am currently taking 900mg of lithium XR per day. I decided to give kava a try as I heard it can be helpful for sleep and anxiety. I did not know however, that kava is a VERY strong diuretic. About an hour after drinking the kava, I began to feel delirious and had trouble walking. My body also started to shake violently. These are all signs of lithium toxicity. I quickly ate some salt and drank some sports drink to rehydrate. That thankfully, made it stop. Eating salt will decrease your lithium levels, as will drinking a lot of water. Lithium and Kava do not mix.  


I will also note that kava does not mix will with anti-psychotics, as both are processed by the liver. This can produce very negative effects."
"Has anyone ever changed multiple meds at once? Or had a different effect than expected with a familiar med? Just curious. I got my bupoprion/welbutrin decreased and my lamotrigine/lamictal upped. It makes sense becuase I need to gain weight and the welbutrin makes my appetite really bad.

Normally the welbutrin makes me anxious and destroys my appetite. This time Ive been getting increased anxiety despite the lower welbutrin. Its really unexpected. It could be from the increased lamotrigine, but ive never noticed side effects from that before.

(Im also on Seroquel for antipsychotic)"

"I got diagnosed with bipolar December 2021 (pretty recently) at 27 years old. But my husband and I have been trying to look back and see all the signs of it prior to being diagnosed (there are quite a few). Anyway, I was just thinking the other night about how starting when I was a teenager, I would have times when I felt like I was in a dream or like watching my life on a movie theater screen. I asked my husband if that had ever happened to him, and he said it hadn't. I always had assumed this was normal, but now I'm questioning it. Was this a sign of bipolar disorder that I missed for years?"
For the past 10 days I've been working on vaping way less. I've felt manic for the past 2 days. Could that be the cause?
"I’ve definitely had hypomanic episodes and long recurring periods of major depression. There have always been other factors when I’ve had hypomanic episodes, so it feels like they don’t really count— like really intense stress, substance use, adjusting meds. Am I fixated on stuff because of my adhd? Am I agitated because my CPTSD is being triggered? Am I just inventing the BP in my head by thinking about it too much and just having an anxious spin-out?

The other annoying part of this is that I do this diagnosis doubting every few months or so. I’ll get to a point where I’m pretty sure I’m not BP, then I’ll have an episode and be sure I have BP. Then I’ll think about the episode more and think of all the things that could’ve caused it (too much caffeine, hormones, skipping meds, anxiety, too little sleep, etc), and decide I probably don’t have BP. But then I remember that all of these things can trigger episodes in BP people. And the cycle repeats. 

My hypo symptoms don’t cause any major negative consequences. It drives me crazy, but I’m not spending money I don’t have or destroying my relationships. Im not clearly fitting into the DSM criteria for BP. I just wish I could have a definite diagnosis so I can stop this stupid cycle of questioning my diagnosis. I was diagnosed as BP by 2 separate psychiatrists and diagnosed as NOT bipolar by a third. 

I am in a therapy group, and bring this up, but they just say it doesn’t really matter what my diagnosis is as long as my meds are working and I’m managing symptoms with effective coping skills. It feels so important for me to figure out though. It’s driving me crazy. I also might be a little hypo now, but I can’t tell for sure lol ughhhh"

Thanks a lot."
"I've just started taking lithium at 400mg because my psychiatrist doesn't want me to be manic. How long will it take for it to bring me down to a normal mood and when do side effects like shaking start happening? 
I think I'm just hypomanic at the moment, but she didn't say and it's hard to judge one's own mood."
"When do you take it? I take it every night before bed. But I just read somewhere somebody said that they take it as needed, and that it works in 20-30 mins. If that’s the case, wouldn’t taking it at night do nothing for you during the next day?"

Well cut to tonight and I am no longer angry I don’t feel manic which is good. However, I cannot fall asleep. I have been in my bed awake for the last four hours and I cannot find sleep. I took my sleeping pill as always. I tried hypnosis. I tried meditation. I finally gave in and took Valium and nothing. I’m wide awake."
I used to be quite the artist before I started lithium. Now my hands shake so much that I get frustrated and give up when I get to the line work. Has anyone been able to overcome this?
I’m currently taking 50mg of trazodone to help me sleep but it’s not good for my heart with the other medication I’m on. When I don’t take it I don’t sleep that long. Has anyone had any experience going off of trazodone?
"Some say wean off 10% per month, other studies say wean off over 3 months to 6 months. 

My psych of 3 years completely lost my respect when he barely talked me through withdrawal off cymbalta. And the emotions, time and money to find a new one is not on the platter. 

So, please share experiences about coming off lithium!

"I’ve been on 125mg of Zoloft for 8 years and pretty stable; a few blips but never anything too bad and I recover easily enough to my baseline. 

This time it’s much deeper. I am feeling better — after two weeks basically bedbound and suicidal I can now more or less live life but there is still a darkness in me and the feeling like nothing is really worth it anymore?

My current med schedule is 150mg Zoloft (100 morning, 50 evening), 25mg Seroquel at night, and I’ve just started 500mg (psych wants to get me up to 1000mg) of Depokate. I take 2.5mg of Valium as needed but try not to more than once a month. I have bipolar and anxiety. 

Has anyone found their depression just…abates? Or is a med change necessary? I don’t want to live this way for long.

NOTE: I’m aware SSRIs aren’t always advised for bipolar, but I’ve had good luck on them. Maybe some hypomania but it’s that or suicide so I’ll take the trade off."

"I was diagnosed with Hypomania last November and was prescribed Seroquel 100mg every night. I used to take Tegretol alone.

I was prescribed Seroquel because I was having 0 sleep for several days and my mind wont shut down.

Im thankful for it as it is helping me sleep now.

However recently even if I didnt up my dose, I now feel drowsier than usual.

My doctor said I have to take this for 3 months more before we lower my dose."
"Hey all, I want to start by saying I’m undiagnosed but I believe in bipolar 2 with ADHD, the ADHD has been diagnosed. 

A little background, for many years now I’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety, found little success on the depression side of things. But after being diagnosed with ADHD I started looking into the condition more and saw a lot about the comorbidity between ADHD and bipolar disorder. And after reading about bipolar 2 and a lot of anecdotal posts/stories on Reddit and other sites, it makes sense to me that I would have it as well, given how many things I can relate to and that my father is schizo affective, it seems likely that I might have it.

My therapist seems hesitant to talk about the condition, I’m sure she’s doing her due diligence and making sure it’s not something else first. But I did talk with my DR and he agreed to let me try Abilify both to see if it does something for the depression but also I suppose to appease me because it’s also used in bipolar treatments and that’s something I told him I wanted to try, that way I could help to figure out what my problems are and find the right treatment.

All has been going well with it so far, it’s only been a few weeks. But lately I have been feeling a lot better than normal. Which is what leads me here…

It’s hard to tell what’s ADHD and what could be hypomania correct? I don’t want to jump the gun, but I’m aware that lower doses of Abilify can trigger hypomania in people. (2-10mg) I’m taking 5mg daily.

I’ve been having a harder time getting to sleep, like tonight. I took a trazadone and still feel wide awake and my mind is running. I want to sleep, it’s just not coming to me as easily lately. And I have been sleeping less when I do sleep. Seem to be getting by fine though.

Anyways I guess I’m asking for opinions, how do you know if you’re hypomanic vs feeling not depressed??"
"I am going through a very bad time & waiting to get in touch with insurance until I can get a new med 

In the meantime Ativan is the only thing that has been keeping me from absolutely losing my shit (.5 mg). However I hear even a week or so of use then stopping can cause benzo withdrawal & I absolutely can’t tack on drug withdrawal of any kind onto my mental state any time soon 

God knows when insurance will approve new med. I took it prob 7 nights or so in a row and trying to take a break but desperate for help and sleep. 

Has anyone experienced this or can give me insight. Am i overreacting? I’m terrified of benzo withdrawal is the issue. Please help lol thank you guys this sub has been saving my life lately."

"I can listen to very specific kinds of music, to take control, if mania seems to be shifting to rage.

Fusion, funk and new wave seem to be perfect for tuning me into a happy state. 
Was having a load of racing intrusive thoughts and i felt like i was about to burst, 
Wise me said i must think really hard about about what i'd be listening to next.

And holy crap that worked like a charm.

So, do listen to nonsense sometimes!! For sure!"
"So for now I've been on wellbutrin 300mg without a mood stablizier or atypical antipsychotic (Very stupid I know). Pretty much everyone around me including my psychologist told me that I'm hypomanic within these couple of days and I kinda understand why that might seem like it.

Well last night I finally got good sleep. Even 10 hours to be exact. I don't really have much energy anymore really and I talk much slower and appear more calm and not as hyped etc. so I think that my episode has ended now.

The weird thing is that I still feel happy but within the normal range i think. Not sure. That's why I'm confused

Does it ever happen to you that even after hypomania you feel happy afterwards? I thought that depressive episode or at least just a ""meh"" feeling would come along but it hasn't. Not yet at least.

Thanks for taking the time to read and sorry for the long text.

TL;DR: Can you still remain happy after a hypomanic episode?"
"I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 after telling the psychiatrist about my experience with wellbutrin. I was put on 150mg xl wellbutrin and it pretty much started working instantly. I was speeding a lot, wanting to go outside more, being way way way more social than I usually am. I spent tons of money on stupid things. I also had a lot of euphoria when I started wellbutrin. I also got a lot more confidence. I was sleeping around 5 hours a night and felt really rested. I felt like I was pretty much cured. This lasted about a week or week and a half I can’t really remember tbh. I was wondering if this is something that is normal with wellbutrin and I might have been misdiagnosed. I told her all of this but for some reason I feel like a faker. I am just wondering if this sounds like mania to you?"
"In the past year or so I've been getting daily depression in the afternoon and it most times leads to me thinking I can't make it through the rest of the day and I'd rather just go into a coma or something and everything i think of makes me feel mentally nauseous.

Sometimes it's like I'm experiencing bipolar in a super fast daily mode, in the mornings I'm hypomanic and thinking I can do anything and the afternoon comes and I sink into a terrible depression. 
Is it normal to have this happen? What can I do to stop this from happening every day? I've tried exercising lately hoping to fix it but nothing changed..."
"Diagnosed bipolar I, not questioning it. Possibility I had cyclothymia that turned into bipolar. But there are times now that I still feel my mood shifts are more cyclothymic in nature - not severe enough to be actual episodes (though I do have those) but more than your typical moody that everyone gets (you know, where people would say “oh I’m so bipolar hahaha”).

"Hello,

This might seem like a weird post just wondering if anyone else has issues dealing with the same. I have been diagnosed with a mood disorder some years ago. I have since a teen used alcohol as a medication to deal with trauma and feelings and its has progressed into adulthood.

Every so often I will get my lifestyle habits etc in order and quit alcohol, get exercise and dietary changes, it will last for days to weeks and I will start to feel energetic and alive again. The weird thing is i find feeling like this **harder to deal** with, the excess energy, hyper mood and normality becomes too much and then I will start the old habits again go back into my shell where I feel normal.

I have normalised feeling like shit and somewhat feel safe there, its the feeling good and energetic that overwhelms me and I can deal with it. It nearly feels like self sabotage and I always reset and relapse. Also to add, that emotions, trauma and memories become way to hard to deal with when I don't have alcohol to block out.

Just wondering if anyone has experienced this or what they may have done to stay on track.

its tiring going from one place to the next and constantly failing.

Thanks"

"I think I may have treatment-resistant bipolar depression. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 1 and while medication helps with the mania, it doesn't help with my depression.

"Just trying to make it through the day and do what I can. Feed my pets, walk my dog, repeat. Try not to eat all my pills and die. Try to have a life. 
I’m 29 and I’m ashamed of what my life has become. I’m overweight and hideous. I used to be extremely attractive and was constantly hit on by people and told how pretty I was. Then I gained weight bc of antipsychotics and hypothyroidism. No I am 214 pounds. My eyes are sunken in. My once thick hair thin and gone thanks to medication and hypothyroid. My outsides reflect my insides. Dead, devoid of life.
Some days are ok. I try to go to hikes. But not like I used to. 
I met a boyfriend and made a decision to move across country with him. I went to gorgeous redwoods of California to a grey, dirty city full of trash. Besides my boyfriend and adopting my animals, my decisions are mostly always bad. Hiking is 25 or more minutes away and I’m scared to go alone, because that’s who I am now, full of constant panic and worry. 
I can’t walk up stairs without panicking thinking I’ll fall backwards and break my neck and die. Ironically, I pray for death almost daily. 
I’m isolated from friends and family. I have an aunt and cousin here but they are an hour away and busy. 
Also just found out I have to have surgery due to a mass I found inside me. Literally on the side of my rectum. The worst place of all to have this. I thought things couldn’t get worse, and they did. My surgery is in three weeks. It will be brutal. I will be in much pain afterwards. Imagine my mindset now, and then add horrible pain from my anal cavity , having to soak my ass in warm water 7 times a day, not being able walk or go anywhere, and eating a liquid diet or not eating at all bc bowel movements will be nightmares.
I’m afraid during this surgery my mental health will reach dark places I’ve never been to before.

Today I got in an argument with my boyfriend. It went on for hours. I truly cannot take it. I’m already depressed and suicidal, I can’t handle having a horrible fight with someone I love. We were supposed to have a fun day. We went to my favorite park and it started in the parking lot. We turned around and went home. My dog was so excited for the park. She had to sit there listening to us arguing. She’s deeply affected by my emotions and energy. She’s been off all day since then. It breaks my heart.
Another day ruined. I feel like I have been given this gift of life and it’s wasted on me. Listening to black flag later alone, all I can think of is that I’m truly damaged."

"I don’t want to blame all of my own shortcomings on this illness, but man right now it feels like my life is in shambles because of it.

No savings whatsoever, no job, no schedule, staying out past 3am every night, drinking, and smoking weed. Plus the anxiety, plus the occasional delusional thoughts, plus flaking on friends, plus staying in bed all day and arguments with family. 

I hate it all. I am truly upset with myself & upset at my situation. I’m lucky that my family’s got their shit together so I can lay in a bed in warmth with electricity.

I feel embarrassed to be me. I’m a 23 year old dependant. I’ve got nothing, because of my own poor decisions. It feels like it’s impossible for me to recover in any way."
"The men who wanted me, and sometimes slept with me while manic? They *miss* me, and want another chance.

I don’t.

I will be paying off my impulsive purchases for a long time, too. I once again royally messed up my life.

Why? Because I went off my meds for 2.5 months and had an episode.

Now, they want me on the injection of my main antipsychotic, and I know it makes sense but the thought leaves me nauseous. 

My first appointment for it is Monday.

I keep thinking of what my shrink said. About brain damage and multi month stays in the hospital. Or this.

I know I am not being reasonable, but I feel so lost."
I just applied at a temp agency today! It's my first time looking for full time work since 2017. I've only managed about two years of part time work since then. Between bipolar and trauma (and a global pandemic) I just haven't been functioning well for a really long time. But I've been going to therapy (group and individual) since last April and I finally feel up to attempting to go back to work. It's taken a lot to get to this point and I know you guys will understand how big this is. Wish me luck :D
"Hello all, I'm a female w/ Bipolar diagnosis and I am in grad school right now, so my life is generally really busy. But sometimes my mind wanders into dating, which I used to do before I went into grad school (especially the online kind). I don't have time/money/patience to do online dating for now, but I sometimes think about dating and being in a relationship, have even had a crush on a guy in one of my group projects. Could this infatuation thing be part of my illness, or do others feel this way sometimes, and if so, how do you bring it back to you, and your self-care/self-worth? If my mind is this way, is it advisable to even be thinking about dating, or should I just perish the thought until I have full control of my routine and even graduate from the program? 

FYI, I do take medication daily as prescribed, see a therapist weekly, and at the start of the winter semester, my self-care was pretty good. Then the high stress of school about 6 weeks later, and thinking about other worries, plus a tiny crush started affecting me negatively."
"I’m sitting with a lot of guilt due to my actions in my first major manic episode. I understand that the past can’t be changed, but my prior actions and how oblivious I was during the episode still shakes me up. I feel like so many people at my college know now and I’m scared to return in the future and see certain people that saw that side of me. I’m ashamed and frustrated for what I did to myself, so much privacy of my life lost. How do you cope?"
I noticed when i take meds and my. hypomania/racing thoughts get better i feel a little depressed.
"First of all, yes I have a doctor. I do not trust him that much and am getting another one, for a wide variety of reasons but specifically because I feel he does not listen to me. (And yes I’ve brought up these concerns).  


Second of all, lithium helps. It really helps A LOT, so I’m not at risk of getting off of my meds.  


I have been diagnosed for 5 years or more. I can’t help but notice, my moods follow my menstrual cycle on the dot. 2 weeks before my period, can’t get out of bed. Junk food every day. Crying over everything. Work suffers, and words don’t come very easily.  


Period starts, I feel relief. I feel stable for the next week or so, sometimes less.  


Then about two weeks of what has been labeled “hypomania.” (My cycle is a bit longer than a month).  
For instance, I have spent in the last 5 days, about 1400 on collectors dolls. Last month, I adopted a creek and spent 4 hours a day cleaning it (even with work) and bought about $500 on supplies. I also go through a period of being on the verge of breaking up with my boyfriend and quitting my job and this happens every god damn Month.  


I’m not in any massive debt, just got a large bonus, but I definitely did NOT want to spend this kind of money.   


One of my favorite BP experts, Julie Fast, claims PMDD and bipolar are two separate things, but they seem so intertwined for me. I also have a schizoaffective mother so the Genes are definitely there. My doctor doesn’t seem to know anything about female reproductive health and just guesses at things, like telling me to get on birth control which was the absolutely WORST option for me.  


I know that I will continue taking lithium, regardless, but I’m Wondering if there are other things I can be doing/other tests/etc. It’s very frustrating to me because it is not like I have 1 manic episode every year, hypomania comes monthly and completely upends my life followed by depression."
"God damn!

I’m haunted,

Want to be honest…

Rather eat dust than have a fake smile amongst the choir,

Uncomfortable with the people I am around,

Fractured with no cement around,

Cold hands be manipulative,

I’m disgraced,

My whole self faded,

Burnt!

Every corner has a mallet around,

No more patience,

I’m more than irate,

Don’t need anymore ill mannered direction,

Can’t roll my eyes anymore…

They’ve been confiscated,

Can’t get a grip when the environment moves faster than sand,

Until I am simply not,

"In January I was diagnosed with a neurological disease. I was put on a medication that would help with it. That medication, my psych meds, and the stress all caused me to lose my libido. I love my partner so much. He’s my person and everything to me. But he’s not happy in the relationship because it’s been sexless for months now. I understand where he’s coming from. I feel like a failure.
Now my dad is in the hospital, he tested positive for the flu and is in kidney failure. He hasn’t been doing well. I decided to open up the relationship so my partner could be satisfied in ways that I’m unable to do at the moment. I really hope that this works out for us and that I can try to get back to my normal self in due time.

"What were your side effects in taking this medicine? I've just started using it yesterday and it felt like a sedative, I immediately became sleepy after 30 mins.  But I slept so fine, like it was one of the best sleeps I had for months."
"Before I give my symptoms and ask for advice I want to state the obvious that everyone will reply with so PLEASE read the following before replying.

1. I have NOT changed my medications or the strengths or times of which I take them… so NO changes whatsoever to my medication.

2. The symptoms have been a progression that have slowly been intensifying for about a month now.

3. The symptoms are NOT 24/7 but rather intermittently throughout the day.

4. Lack of sleep and of course anxiety intensifies these symptoms.

Now for the symptoms that are freaking the *^%> out of me!
1. Loudest buzzing in head/ears 
2. Head feels like it is vibrating 
3. Racing thoughts so fast I can’t make a single thought out
4. Feel detached from self
5. When people try to talk to me it’s like I’m look through them… can’t connect to converse 
6. High level of anxiety/panic
7. Hear whispering (can’t make out words though)
9. Fearful
10. Crying spells

"TLDR at the bottom.

Thank God, I’m finally off the Seroquel. This past year has been one of the most difficult years of my life because of my mental health. I was in two hospitals, and finally had to go to Mayo clinic to get a second opinion. They had some really good advice actually!

Anyway, last hospital visit I was there two weeks until finally. I was on 800 mg of Seroquel and 20 mg of Haldol. I have no idea how I was even awake or walking around but that’s what it took to make me stable. Of course I started sleeping a ton and I gained a lot of weight. Also lost motivation for things like exercising, reading, etc. 

After being stable for a while, my psychiatrist started cutting back my Seroquel. Finally don’t feel like eating constantly and I’m not as tired and lowly motivated. Only on 2 mg of Haldol! Thinking about going back to work part time and starting to exercise again!

Anyway, there is someone who is very significant in my life who doesn’t understand how hungry Seroquel makes you and how these meds can fuck you up. If you feel comfortable sharing, I would really appreciate you commenting and saying what Seraquel and/or Haldol did to you in terms of making you, hungry, sleepy, and lowly motivated.  Please no advice about how I should cut this person out of my life.  They drove me all the way to Mayo and are there for me in many, many ways. I hope that this post can be about education.

TLDR: a person very important to me does not understand how Seroquel and Haldol made me gain a ton of weight and turn into a zombie for like six months.  Can you please explain how this happened to you too?"
"HI people, I treat my bipolar about 2 years, and I take a lot of meds to maintain me stable (Vyvance 70mg, clonazepam 1 mg, Olanzapine 20 mg, Lithium 600 mg, citalopran 20 mg). Actually Im in a rough depressive episode, and my doctor initiate vyvanve to control my suicidal thoughts. Because of the price of vyvance i my country is veryyy expense, so we changed to ritalin today. Now Im suffering some symptoms, I cant focus, the letters get blurry and I cant read well, and I fell my body heavy. So, these symptoms go away with time?

"Hey everyone! Thanks in advance to all those who might eventually read this....I just wanted to say thanks to you all! This community seems really supportive of each other, and I'm really grateful for that. Not many spaces like that are left on the internet these days. Anyhow, I wanted to share my story just a little bit and maybe get some extra opinions. I had always knew I had pretty bad social anxiety. Growing up, especially when I was younger( it's gotten progressively worse) I always got extremely nervous around other people. You know the classic symptoms: going to great lengths to avoid social events, making up the same old tired excuses to not attend parties, etc. I couldn't stand large crowds and I always got the idea that others were somehow ""watching"" me when I was out in public..even in places like the grocery store. I always thought they were judging me or silently making fun of me, etc. 

I've been working since I was 15 years old, trying to help provide for my family because we grew up pretty poor. My first job was at a McDonalds as a teen, and I worked there through high school up until I had a falling out with my family, and I moved out and lived with my grandparents. I quit that job, and had a period of time I was unemployed for about 5 months. Got another job at the local dollar store by my grandparents home, and quit there after two weeks. I moved back in with my family, and we reconciled our differences. I got a job at the local Wendy's as a closer for the restaurant. I worked there for a year, and it was at this job that I guess looking back my symptoms sorta started developing. I was chronically late, and I mean super late. Idk why, just I couldn't bring myself to actually be there on time. Some days I just felt too tired to get outta bed to be there at my scheduled time, others I was on top of the world and thought I was too good and didn't care. I would call out of work for weeks at a time even! Just making up excuses so I wouldn't have to go in, etc. Looking back on all this, I'm ashamed really. I quit Wendy's after a year, and got a job as a pharmacy technician. I became convinced over time that my boss was out to get me and wanted me gone. Maybe she did. I was a crappy employee at first. It was extremely hard to concentrate at work, hard to focus, and I felt ""clumsy"" and would forget very basic instructions. Not to mention having to deal with customers and patients and phone calls and stuff triggered my anxiety greatly. After having a blowout argument with my boss, I quit that good paying job at the pharmacy to be a freaking meat cutter at my local grocery store. That lasted about a month, before I landed a job at the local hospital as a switchboard operator. This is where things get interesting....

I began working at the hospital during the very beginning of the COVID pandemic. The stress levels there were unimaginable....I was having to deal with phone calls from ""Karens"", people would call and cuss me out, yell at me, scream at me, etc. I also occasionally had to work the actual service desk in the hospital, and had to confront people who refused to wear a mask and such. I've nearly gotten assaulted over that dozens of times. This all culminated in a panic attack that was so severe I ended up throwing up in the bathroom, and being sent home. I went to the doctor, and they diagnosed me as a having anxiety and gave me lexapro. I've been on it for about three years now. I didn't know I was bipolar at the time, and so apparently lexapro and bipolar disorder definitely don't mix well. At first, lexapro seemed to make me feel okay and definitely helped with my anxiety. Then, about a year and a half or so later, I ended up getting into a huge argument with my boss because I was convinced she'd treated me unfairly. I left in the middle of the night and quit....no notice, nothing. At this same time, I was going thru what I now know as my first major manic episode that I can recall. I quit my job that night because I felt the Holy Spirit told me too...you read that right. During this manic episode, I'd converted to Mormonism and fell into it extremely....like zealously. Before that, I was an atheist hardcore. Ultimately, my fiance helped me get out of the church....and it was like a moment of clarity...I couldn't believe what I'd just done lol. During that time, my whole personality changed....politics and all. I was like a totally different person. After I snapped out of it, I couldn't believe the things I said and did during that time. How strict with the religion I was, how zealous I was, etc. I ended up getting a job at my other local dollar store, before quitting three weeks into it because I needed jaw surgery. After surgery was over, I got a job at a local nursing home as a patient sitter. I lasted two shifts there before I quit. I later tried to get my job back, because I regretted quitting, I got it back, and I worked one more shift before I quit again. I left there to go to McDonalds again. I worked one shift there before I quit there as well!! Now, I've finally landed a really good paying job at my local Walmart and I really don't wanna mess it up. Reading so many other mania stories has finally helped me realize there really is something wrong with me, I'm not lazy, and I need to seek help for this....this does sound like bipolar disorder, doesn't it? I mean it seems I tick every box there is. Thanks for reading this much everyone!"
"I have bipolar disorder. I’ve had hallucinations, delusions, disassociation but I wasn’t diagnosed until three years ago. I’m 36. Has anyone else found it shocking to learn that things you have experienced thru most of your life aren’t real? Or normal?

For me, hallucinations have been things like strong familiar smells that aren’t there or glowing lights surrounding people or objects, recently music that no one else could hear. It has helped to be able to label these things when doing med management with my psych but it’s always a bit—disconcerting when I realize something I’ve thought is normal is another symptom. The delusions and dissociation are harder to recognize for me. And that’s overwhelming.

I guess I’m just posting to see if anyone else feels like the diagnosis introduced so many more questions about who you are?"
It stretches to both sides for so long that you can’t see what started it and you can’t see where it ends.
Hi. I recently am diagnosed as Bipolar 2. I am taking medication but it isnt helping 100%. I  realized I have been using food to make myself feel better in depressive episodes and also when I'm anxious. I also would go shopping and being around people like that helped but I'd buy all kinds of stuff. I would like to not use those coping mechanisms. What do you guys do when you're having an episode so that you dont overeat or buy things? Healthy coping mechanisms.
I saw Latuda went generic. My doctor wanted me to take it but I couldn’t because of the cost. I was wondering what other people’s experience on it is? I’m just scared to try it.

Hey guys I was recently diagnosed with Bipolar disorder and I wanted to know how these medications have affected your manic and depressive episodes.

"I'm in school but my mental health is taking a dive. Showering once a week (if that), suicidal, angry, generally upset, and depressed. I will most likely take a short break from school (only a few months). Is it acceptable to just not do work or school in that time? My family has agreed to help me pay rent under the condition that I do return to school after a few months, which I'm 100% willing. 

My family thinks its a good idea for me to recharge, but other people think I should get a job to occupy my time. Working makes me suicidal as all hell. That's why I don't want to work, but at the same time, I don't want to be a ""bum"" not in school or working. Is it okay to just not do anything for a few months if I have the means?"

"Whenever someone says that they are prescribed SSRIs, my first thought is that their doctor is a quack."
"TL:DR read the title of the post, but for background :

I am BPI diagnosed for 15 years ago, stable and out of hospital for 8. In my last manic episode 8 years ago I was drinking heavily and after a stay at the mental hospital I attended a dual diagnosis outpatient rehab program. I really threw myself into it, got into 12 step work in AA etc. I'd had my butt kicked so I decided to do what I was told for once. My life improved dramacally during this time. I found good meds and doctors, got back in shape, moved to a cooler city, changed careers into a cooler career, met and married my wife etc.

But I gradually soured on AA. AA dogma holds that I must believe that before everything I am an alcoholic, my alcoholism comes first. I wanted to be on board, but I couldn't genuinely agree with that conception of reality. The farther I've gone along in my recovery the more I have come to personally believe that the primary issue is bipolar disorder and the substance abuse is secondary and more symptomatic of not having enough good tools to deal with the BP.

Another thing that doesn't really line up for me is the whole idea of needing a ""spiritual experience"" in AA. Genuinely, not being flippant here- I have had spiritual experiences many times, they were usually when I was manic or high on hallucinogens or both. (I still am a spiritual person, but not anywhere nearly as fervent when I'm not manic).

Finally, AA has a weird relationship with psychotropic meds.  It's getting better but there are still a lot of old timers who don't understand how antidepressants or mood stableizers work and will tell you you aren't sober if you're taking pills.  My last AA sponsor told me to pray more when I was depressed.  I ignored him, talked to my psych and got on antidepressants and the depression lifted.  When I look around the rooms at AA I see a lot of people who would really benefit from real therapy and antidepressants.

My attendance at AA faded out gradually until I stopped going.  I am now experimenting with moderation.  Over the past two years I've been using low doses of marijuana on occasion, and every so often I'll have a cocktail and a beer or two at dinner by myself. One or two times I've gone past that amount but hated the hangover a def didn't fall into a pattern or downward spiral. Despite what AA dogma says about if you relapse you will ""pick up where you left off"" and be as bad as you were at your worst in no time, I have as yet had no negative repercussions with this moderate amount of substance use.  

I have no desire to go on a bender.  I continue to do everything in my treatment plan for BPI and my moods continue to be mild and manageable.

Does anyone else in the bipolar community with substance abuse history relate to feeling a disconnect in 12 step programs and what your personal recovery plan looks like?"
When I’m depressed I am focusing on bringing myself up. When I feel good I have to focus on bringing myself down. When bad things happen that aren’t related to being bipolar I become afraid they’ll send me into a depression. When I feel normal I have to not let myself go to high or over exercise. I talked to my therapist yesterday about how not everything is related to bipolar and it doesn’t define be. But wtf. I’m so tired of thinking of it all. I wish I could just take a vacation from my own head.

In the past, when I had to switch doctors, the new doctor always wanted me on something new with horrible side effects. Here, I don't have many options to choose from if I don't click with my doctor..So far the online psychiatrists suck rocks and don't even prescribe medication.  Sigh...."

i tend to usually say i have bipolar when people ask, since it’s believed by therapists (no diagnosis) that both my parents have it & all signs point towards me having it, to the point of even having been medicated for it.

"I harass the morning,

While my heart flops around and it is all bruised and deflated,

I’m a worn out piston,

Misfiring or not, I keep momentum,

I have the stamina,

Much I have no control over,

But it is me that decides to wake up at 4:00 am,

I ride the morning before the day rides me,

My exclave,

My sanctuary,

When all others sleep,

I find my peace chain smoking Pall-Malls,

And downing caffeine,

To build the guts for just taking the day’s first steps,

My ritual to just being here."

"I hope I try to convey what I'm trying to say , Quite lengthy 
We all know what we need to avoid bipolar depression:
. Proper meds
. Therapy
.Good diet
. Workout.   Etc

BUT despite all this many of us including me fall into the pithole of Depression and once we fall in it I usually stay there for weeks or even months.During depression the only things I can do is binging mobile , ordering fast food (I only eat once in a day because I don't get much appetite and secondly I don't get much money for ordering daily and about the food which is cooked in my home my maid doesn't know shit how to cook it properly)and smoking. I honestly don't enjoy any activity mentioned above apart from playing football in my colony ground(which can only be done for 2 hours in a day ).And I believe that if one has something that they really enjoy  the depreession can go away.Which brings me to the main title.When Im about to hit Depression there's nothing I can think of which I enjoy.I used to enjoy video gaming , anime , making memes etc before BP but even though they seem like a small task , it feels like a burden even though I used to enjoy them before BP so I don't see anyway of preventing myself from the Depression bomb that hits me."

I’ve also noticed that whenever I drink caffeine, I have like a short, mini hypomanic episode. Has anyone else has this happened to them?"
"Just like what the title says. That shit hurt my feelings, I feel so alone as it is. I have no one to rant to about this because no one cares to listen so I’m ranting on here, people here understand me. 

They act like I can fully control my episodes and when they happen. I was in the mental hospital because I was having an episode. Now I’m more stable luckily because I got my medication changed to Seroquel and it’s been helping me a lot but this really made me upset and made me realize how alone I really am. I tried talking to my friend about this but they weren’t really listening to me. Man, I was doing so much better. This sucks."
"He dedicated his content to documenting his experiences being bipolar. Thought I’d share for anyone feeling alone.

I know I am mean. I know that I’m hard. I wish I had better control but I’m having an episode. I had a fight with my SO he even said that he didn’t want to argue and to just give him some space. I chose to attack him more. I’m all me me me right now. I’m too much. He went to go get me some lunch. He loves me but I am just so angry it’s not even rational and some how I have to get it all together and go back to work tomorrow. My pdoc is calling me this afternoon as I left a semi frantic message for him. I’m just so lost the only thing my brain keeps telling me is get in your car and drive home. I’m 46 I live in Texas my parents live in New York it’s not rational. I’m so lost. I’m not sure any of this makes sense I just need help.
"Me again, sorry. I have a trip planned to visit some friends next month, one of whom has become a romantic interest over the years. Things have gotten more serious hence my trip there. Before I was diagnosed I had a lot of failed relationships and impulsive and toxic behaviors. 5 years later I am still struggling with intimacy but not because of episodes where I'll impulsively dump whoever I'm dating. Because this is someone I'm comfortable with and someone I really like and am not just forcing myself to like so the feeling will be mutual, I'm confident about it and I'm very excited. My dad who I live with insinuates that I'm not taking my meds or I need to call my doctor. Yeah, because who on this earth could ever love his daughter. I'll be there for 3 days, 2 of which I'm spending with the guy in question. My mom (who usually seems to hope things work out for me) said something about why don't I just leave and spend one day with him because it might not work out. She's just assuming I'll ruin this like I have everything else and I'm near tears because it's taken me years to get back to the idea of dating not being an absolute mental health nightmare and I've finally gotten to a point where my self-esteem is not in the gutter as much as it used to be. They keep insinuating that he must be ""up to something'. I just want to reiterate this is someone I have known for a long time. It's really discouraging and it almost makes me want to just cancel everything and give up. A relationship is not everything to me, I've been single for 3 years and have been pretty happy about it and have worked on myself. I just don't see why they need to openly doubt me so much and it's really making me rethink everything and that maybe my self-esteem is a delusion and I'm not interesting and I have nothing to offer. Sometimes I feel like I've made no progress against my illness. I haven't had a bad manic episode in years and they act like it happens multiple times a year. I'm in a mixed episode now but would like to think I'm doing alright managing. To them it's like there's no hope for me at all. 

Sorry I've posted a lot lately, don't have another therapy session for awhile. Things were going great until they weren't."
"I've been on vraylar 3mg for about two years now.  My insurance didn't cover vraylar, so my provider allowed me to have samples. Well, until this month. They were able to get vraylar covered by my insurance... but it's almost 1k a month. I've applied for assistance to receive them free, but it's income based. Latuda is also really expensive... abilify made me gain a lot of weight... I'm just lost right now and super bummed. 
If you had to switch from one of the name brands to the generics, which ones worked for you... without causing weight gain? 
I'm already on lamotrigine and Prozac."
I don’t want to do anything. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up again. I hate myself. I hate my life. I hate my job. I hate this stupid disease that comes and goes no matter how much I play by the rules. I just can’t anymore. I don’t see a why anymore. I’m so miserable. Everything hurts. Oh what’s the point anyway. Ugh
Well I had an emergency call with my psychiatrist today and he thinks it’s time for me to go back into therapy. I know it’s not a big deal but I really was doing so well and everything has just come to a head in these last few days and we’ll I can’t go it alone anymore. I have no idea how I will pay for this or find the time to actually go to an apartment but I’m sure it will all get easier with time. Ugh I just want to stay in bed or run away I hate being an adult. I just don’t want to deal with this disease anymore. I’m tired. I have been stable for years and now boom right back at square one.
"I'm not creative. My writing in middle and high school was a struggle, and it was almost exclusively wish fulfillment that was hella limerent or exclusively about my feelings. I also tried to draw and it was similarly unpleasant to look at. I have not done anything else creative. I have zero desire to do anything besides read self-help books and exercise and socialize. The most creative thing I've desired to do in 2023 is make a website that calculates Beck's Depression Inventory for you so you don't have to do it on paper because I couldn't easily find one. Back in 2017, I thought about writing a novel, but since then I think I've become too self-focused.

Do you identify as creative or not creative?"
Does anyone else use acupuncture as a way of helping with stress and anxiety? I recently started trying it and I’m wondering what the results have been like for others.
"Im definitely outside of hypomania by now but i still have the same empowering feelings and thoughts of being in control of everything, 
Sometimes i feel like everyone in a room owns me a kiss. 

I should acknowledge that I'm in lamictal titration stage 1. 
It lifted my spirits unlike any other psych drug.... Im hugging my parents more...
I'm obsessing on birds again, still expecting strangers i flirted with online, to reply.

Erotomania is nothing new to me... I had a very very devastating one when i was just 15. I used to dream and write about her every single night, i was really stupid for doing this...
But it's not stopping me from doing it again, it's like im liking the sensation a bit too much."
"What are your favourite genres. Or maybe to spice things up, favourite bands/artists? 
I'll go first:
People like to call it prog rock... But i call it lovely music that will stick!

Bands include:

The Pineapple Thief
Katatonia
Porcupine Tree (Steven Wilson)
(Also noticed I've been slacking on Dream Theater and they deserve a mention)
Opeth (classics especially watershed)
Lunatic Soul (absolute genius)
Tool
80's Krimson 

Also enjoy Led Zeppelin very much from time to time."
Hey pals! I have noticed about myself that I go into mini psychosis anytime I smoke pot or take a hallucinogen. It’s not habitual behavior but sometimes situations lead to it (I know it’s not good for me). Does anyone else trigger and travel quickly from psychosis to reality and back again? This transformation is not positive and can be quite traumatizing. It’s just an extreme experience only staring to take place in my adulthood (I’m 32/M)
Was happy to read after having a rough week
I currently work as a receptionist and I hate it. What kind of jobs do you guys do? I'm seeking something that is part time with minimal people interaction. I am on SSDI so it can't be high paying either and I don't want to get a degree. I have one in cybersecurity that I've done nothing with already.
"I have been feeling this like tingling almost electric feeling all day. It’s not painful or negative. It also doesn’t feel like a shock, more so just a constant undercurrent. Sometimes maybe a bit uncomfortable but I also don’t really mind it.

I noticed earlier that wow I have a lot of energy and my thoughts were moving faster but I honestly did not think this could be potentially some start of mania etc. 

Do you guys have any experience with this type of feeling? 
Maybe it has nothing to do with bipolar but just thought I’d ask."
"First time in furniture sales.  And in my first week I did 32,000$ of sales. 

You are much more capable than you think.     I for way to long got that…. Self doubt… that we get.  And that doubt sabotages the skills that we possess."

"I came into the office. There was this young woman there in addition to my regular doctor. My regular told me she was in her first week of practice and was shadowing them today. They asked if that was okay with me. Made sure I knew I could say no. But the thing is... I know they need experience. There's even a growing shortage of primary physicians here. We need them and they need the practice. 

So I said yes. Though deep inside I didn't really want to. It didn't feel comfortable. I wasn't able to bring up everything I wanted. Part of me feels ashamed about that. In principle I'm for it, but in practice it's uncomfortable.

Anyways, I just sent my doctor 1200 word long email about all the things I wasn't able to bring up and also explaining why I have a distrust about new doctors and take time to be able to open up.

I sent it around 12 am at night after having three beers. I'm not sure if it was a good idea or not. I was completely honest at least.

Sent it to my sister for proofreading first. She's been bugging me about me talking to my doctor lately. She thought it was well written and gets the point across without being overly dramatic. She has a nursing degree and has dealt with worse patients than me, so I trust her judgement.

Not sure if I'm looking for advice or anything. Just needed to share it with someone."
I was put on abilify almost a year ago and have gained 20-30 pounds (I don't know the exact number because I don't want to see the number on the scale due to a past ED) I haven't changed my diet or exercise so it is definitely the abilify that caused the weight gain. My doctor says I can go off it in May but I'm afraid that I won't be able to lose the weight I gained. Does anyone have any experience with going off an anti-psychotic and losing weight?
"I work the night shift Friday Saturday and Sunday, and get home Monday morning and took my lamotrigine when I regularly take my lamotrigine at 10:00 a.m. went to sleep about 4:00 p.m. and when I woke up my phone's clock said 12 and I thought it meant 12 noon so I quickly took my limotrigine thinking I was 2 hours late, then I went to open my window at 3 and I was like it's 3pm why is it so dark out so I went to my phone and Googled the time and realized it was only 3:00 a.m. on Tuesday and not 3:00 p.m. on Tuesday. Since I actually took my meds about a little after midnight Tuesday when my next dose was supposed to be 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday, that means I took my meds 10 hours early so what should I be worried about And when should I take my next dose should I wait until 10:00 a.m. Wednesday now or...?"
"I just have to put this out there because I’m so darn proud of my husband. 

He’s bipolar and recently started back up with sleep disturbances. Well, actually, straight up sleep deprivation because he couldn’t sleep. At all. He was teetering on the edge of psychosis and I was sure we would end up at the hospital as per usual. HOWEVER, he allowed me to call his crisis team and pharmacist and he agreed to start his olanzapine again until I can talk to his doctor. 

I’m happy to report that after a rough 5 days, he was finally able to sleep last night. I hear snoring now. I can call his doctor today and let her know. 

For anyone out there who feels discouraged, trust yourself and your caregiver. If something is off, catch it right away. 

EDIT: We didn’t quite make it  His doctor told him to increase his zyprexa to 20 mg at bedtime. He reluctantly took it, fell asleep for about 15 minutes, then jumped up and ran to the bathroom trying to make himself vomit. He said he thinks I’m trying to kill him. Needless to say, we’re at the hospital"
"I’m 21, I was diagnosed with bp 2 at 18. I’m a senior in college in a grad school program that has kicked my ass to the moon and back. I’ve had some of the worst depressive and manic episodes that led me to lose a lot of close friends and I almost dropped out and gave up. I’ve been stable since July but I’m scared for the next time I have an episode. What if my meds stop working and I have to work on finding the right one AGAIN? I feel like I’ve been on a million med cocktails. I’m dating again and I’ll have to have the bipolar talk with my next boyfriend, what if they think I’m crazy? My mom also has bipolar and I watched it ruin my family for years and it led me to be suicidal when I was younger. What if I do the same to my own family in the future? I have to take meds for this for the rest of my life. I just want to be normal and stress about the little things. Sorry for the word vomit"
"I get waves of so called 'rizz'.
And it's not just being horny.
Feels like i own everyone.
Lol."
"Heard today about how I was actually Bipolar I. How I close I came to a couple months in the hospital.

I am devastated.

Devasted."
"UPDATE(I called to get back on meds and they told me he will call me back but that was a day ago I think he dropped me as a client - just got informed there is a shortage in Canada so now I can't refill my hormones until March 27th like 3 days before I do injections I get really suicidal I can't imagine weeks, I called my doctor but they told me I can't talk to him until Monday and I asked for my psychiatrist to call me for the past 2 days but I think he ghosted me like I don't think I'm a client now because I missed 2 appointments. I already have an energy drop) I think I've been manic this whole time

(I'm not telling anyone to do this!!) Been on 10 different meds(antidepressants, antipsychoics, and mood stablizer)

When I'm on meds I don't feel like myself like I can't hold a job, do basic things like housework, side  effects are took much each time. 

I've been off meds for 6 months without notifying my doctor and I've been holding a job for almost 4 months now, I can do stuff around the house, I don't wake up crying anymore or suicidal. I just can't pay attention to things 

I don't feel like I have episodes anymore I feel like I've been misdiagnosed and I'm scared to tell my psychiatrist I even missed my last appointment. Now I've been told if I'm not on meds I can't get top surgery. I called my psychiatrist and the front desk told me he will call me tomorrow I'm anxious."
"It sounds silly, I recently started to set boundaries with myself. No yelling, or name-calling; the theater that plays all my past fuck-ups (on repeat) has been renovated and has turned into a library.

Some days are harder than others though. And today is unfortunately a rough day. And that’s ok.

I haven’t been more active in this subreddit and I apologize. I want to help more but I’m also in the middle of not drowning. I am glad that we’re all in the same pool. Remember to wear floaties and be kind to yourself then others. Love y’all."
"my psychiatrist tried putting me on abilify first but i had a really bad reaction to it so now i am just on trileptal for mood stabilizer and celexa for depression. is it common to be on just mood stabilizers? 

besides all that i just need to vent. i do feel like i need an antipsychotic because the trileptal evens me out but, not enough if that makes sense? i still get little bouts of episodes and i have a doctor appointment this evening and i am going to bring it up. has anyone else just been on a mood stabilizer? im not sure if it just isnt the right medication for me or if a mood stabilizer isnt meant to get rid of everything. i know these are questions for my doctor and i will be asking them but im also curious about other peoples experiences and if theyve been on only a mood stabilizer and how helpful it was"
"I've been depressed for a while. Everything sucks.
Psych upped my meds two weeks ago, but i don't think its helping. I'm frustrated.

No advice needed, just venting cause it makes me feel a little better"
"I’ve been in a pretty mild hypomanic episode for months now on and off… on and off because I’ve been having 8 day periods of feeling mostly normal.


But today, I was speaking especially quickly and had an uncomfortable amount of energy. I rearranged the pantry to try to tire myself and focus my fast thoughts. I took my anti psychotic geodon of 20 mg in the middle of it and got really tired eventually and had to fight to stay awake to finish working after my cleaning sessh. So I had a small cup of black tea and I got more ‘up’ again (I had to work), That just made me ‘tired wired’ and also feel a bit ‘dumb’.  

I’m nervous because i’m wondering if a full manic episode is maybe on the horizon now. (Yes I’ve had them before.) 

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? 

((In case it matters: my meds are 300mg Lamictal. 20 mg geodon twice a day as of 2 weeks ago. And I just started birth control 2 days ago.))"
"Had a meeting with a new therapist, I talked to him about my trauma, my stress, my depression and just my overall well being. He ended our conversation with “Just don’t stress”. This immediately put a bad taste in my mouth. Like really? I responded with “If it were really that easy I don’t think you would have a job”…He has not gotten back to me since. Am I right for feeling this way?"
"I recently got disability for this, but I moved back in with my parents. I’m 32 and because I lived in a city for ten years prior, I don’t have a car. 

I’ve been in a bad bedridden depression for the last year and they are now telling me that I need to stop being passive and “do something” because the world isn’t “coming to my door.” While this is ok advice, it actually stings to hear in this situation. 

I constantly feel like I’m not good enough to even survive let alone work right now. 

Has anyone found any successful part time jobs that they like and were able to actually keep? Are there any suggestions for something I could maybe do online that isn’t too demanding? 

I have looked for jobs but this depression rut is really kicking my ass. I can’t even get out of bed or bother to clean my room let alone get a job right now. 

I hate the way this look. I hate being perceived as lazy (am I?). I hate having to constantly question myself. 

It’s been almost a full year of being in bed. I don’t know how to get out of this rut. I don’t even have clothes that fit me anymore because of my meds in the past year. I’m the heaviest I’ve ever been. I ruined my body with tattoos that I HATE during my last manic episode and every time I look at them I’m reminded of that terrible time in my life. My self-confidence is at an all time low. 

I’ve tried so many different meds that I think my depression is just treatment resistant. I don’t know. 

I feel like scum of the earth. I look like it too."
"i got dx with bp1 and put on mood stabilizers and antipsychotics (although a pretty low dose). however, my manic symptoms dont seem to be very intense and im not sure if its even mania? or hypomania? 

i’ll go on spending binges, binge eat, binge drink, and feel like more carefree and hypersexual/confident but its never been like crazy crazy. like i hear stories of people going to jail, getting hospitalized, spending thousands of dollars, going on trips or even moving the country, divorcing their partners, etc. 

the most i can think i did was cheat on my gf like 3 times within 2 weeks (we were both cheating on each other though basically), max my credit card and almost not be able to pay rent for months, take work off a lot, and have sex with a bunch of random people. i also just recently started having paranoid thoughts again but i wasnt really having them very strongly when i was ‘manic’, and i thought they were more prevalent when youre manic.

 this has all happened over the course of 6 months but i dont know the timeline of each ‘episode’ or even if any of that had to do with an episode at all? ive also been to juvie when i was 14 & the mental ward when i was like 17, and i almost went to juvie during that time too. but then again i was a teenager, and both of those instances were very traumatic events. 

i guess the reason i ask is because the diagnosis apt was only an hour long, but my therapist said she thinks i have bipolar too. however, theyre not working with each other and ive only seen each of them once. my great gma on my dads side had bipolar and my mom has bipolar, and her mom had schizoaffective disorder (im unsure if bp1 or bp2 for mom and other gma)

im worried i was misdiagnosed incase the medication reacts poorly with me and ig just self identity? like i was also diagnosed with bpd and that makes sense to me"
"I have bipolar disorder 1 I take Latuda 60 mg paroxetine 40mg hydroxyzine 25 mg 4x a day buspirone 15 mg 3x times a day

I been sick on and off throwing up headaches neck stiffness I get migraines bad so I have medication for that too butttt because I been throwing up I can’t eat to take my meds because I run to the bathroom to puke what I ate then there goes my medicine I had a GI issues had a round of antibiotics so tomorrow I have to drop off my lab stuff to see if the issue still there soooo question how can I take my medicine after eating and not throwing back up? Or should I just call the doctor or GI doctor? mind you the appointments are usually far out I just want to feel better mentally 
I am on a mania stage bad I can’t stop talking, I have energy like tomorrow but because I’m sick for the first time in my bipolar Life I’m sleeping early, I can’t stop pacing, I’m crying for every small damn thing I’m emotional to the max I’m multitasking to the max I wanna spend money ect please help lol sincerely a woman in a  mania stage who wants to be a zombie again"
"I have bipolar 1 and have had some long and intense manic episodes . I heard someone mention PTSD due to mania and it really got me thinking so I started researching the symptoms of PTSD and I really think I am experiencing PTSD from past manic episodes... Which kinda sounds silly, I know. 
I. Gave. Myself. PTSD. 
The things I did during these episodes actually caused me trauma. I hurt other people, I ruined relationships, ruined my reputation, I hurt myself, I put myself in debt (among other things). I have an immense amount of shame and guilt that I find really difficult to cope with...can anyone else relate to this?"
"I’m having one of the worst depressive episodes, and i’ve had many. I have terrible hypersomnia, I cry every time i have to get out of bed. I’m barely functioning and am having constant suicidal thoughts, which I fight against every time. I’ve gotten close to an attempt, but backed out. I told my psych and he increased my meds and said if i don’t feel better in 2 weeks, (I promised him I wouldn’t attempt so he’s giving me the benefit of the doubt) I’m going in patient. However, i’m afraid. Should I go? If you’ve gone, did it help at all?"
"I would literally be awful as a parent

Like you know how the entire world says that pets help with depression, lower heart rate, and just want nothing but love in return 

I have a cat, he's a wonderful boy, cuddly, adorable, the right amount of play and chill. He's super handsome, is a purr machine, good at getting his nails clips not the worst cat I even had to bathe and the sweetest little voice. 

Yet when I'm not feeling it, I just can't see him and I just feel like momentarily all my affection has vanished. Like he's fed on a schedule, I provided his with plenty of toys I switch out every week so he has enough stimulation. 

But then my mind being my mind if I seek him out for comfort and he doesn't want to be bothered I take that personally and hard, but he's literally a cat and it's fine. But my brain is like wow even a cat doesn't want to be around me like this of course no one does and there goes my spiral.

But there are so many times I can't do more than feed and water him and close my bedroom door. Then he'll of course be confused like you always let me in your room and on your bed all day until you don't. But it's like I don't want to be touched or interact even with a cat, and he'll meow at the door and it will grate my nerves so bad I'll put my face in the pillow and cry. Despite how much I love him he constantly reminds me I'm not normal, and other people would not be having these sorts of 'problems' with a pet. 

Sorry for the rant it's just reading that post was like a reminder not that I even wanted to, but I can't have kids. I would literally ruin them in weird ways without intending too, I only have a cat that I actually love but why is love so hard for me"
When I was unmedicated and manic I would create so much art constantly and I considered it my life's purpose to spend the majority of my waking life in some sort of creative pursuit... Then I started taking lithium and while it has been a major success story for turning me into someone who can keep a job and rent an apartment and not have outbursts or suicidal episodes I pretty much stopped making all art and even for the most part I struggle to think creatively now as well. It's contributed to a big lost and purposeless feeling about my life overall and I was wondering if other people have experienced or even overcome this obstacle. (And stopping taking it is not really an option as every time I do bad bad bad things happen). Any advice would be appreciated and I hope this is the right place to ask this. Thanks :)
"Has anyone ever had trouble thinking of things to say; thinking of conversational topics, and kind of, feeling blank of things to say either due to a depressive episode, following a manic episode or due to some medication? If so; what was it and did it go away? I’ve been feeling this way for 6 months and kind of desperate. Feeling like I can’t connect with anyone, awkward silences which is causing social isolation. It seemed to start and get worse with a deepening depression.

This has been going on for 6 months now and I'm so eager to have it resolve because I haven't been able to maintain many friendships, make any new ones, date, talk to even my own family."
"I’m coming up on one year. The most I’ve traveled is to my backyard and the grocery store if I don’t order in. I’m on Disability for this and I’ve done absolutely nothing but lay in bed. 

I’m worried that I’m one of the only ones who has let it get so far to lay in bed for so long. I have no muscle and my bones are probably a lot weaker. I’m on medication and in therapy but I just can’t get myself to do anything. I have a depression room - clothes and things everywhere. I never finish anything completely. I feel like I’m going crazy. I don’t want this life but I can’t l get myself to do anything to change it. I want to believe that I can get off of disability and back into my career again, but I know that it will probably end in me leaving or getting fired like I have before. 

I keep making posts when I feel different things but I never know what I’m asking for. I guess it just helps to get things out and talk to people who understand. 

I’m just sad."
"Obviously I’ve most likely had the disease longer, at least since I was diagnosed with major depression 8 years ago. 

I always knew bipolar had a huge chance of taking me. My father’s family is basically a family tree of the illness: great-grandfather (probably), great uncle, grandmother, dad…and now me. I have a 5 year old. Now I get to carry on the fear, give it to her, perpetuate an endless cycle of ups and downs and pain.

I’ll have new medication, new coping strategies. I’ll muddle my way through this like everyone else but right now I’m just…sad. Downhearted. Scared."
"My doctor is putting me on 0.5 of Rexulti today for GAD and MDD in addition to my paxil(40mg). I've been on 2mg of abilify for a month and it activated me too much- irritable, anxiety and insomnia. Is rexulti more sedating or it is the same? Also are higher dosages more activating or sedating? Thank you xoxo"
"Two things:

one:

I wrote a book during a manic episode. It's 50 pages and took about 4 hours -also the only thing I have ever written. A Pretty interesting read according to my bipolar friends, it is deeply relatable

Two:

I wrote a lil shortcut for my iPhone for managing or recording symptoms. I find it incredibly hard to remember times and days when I am down. This shortcut prompts a series of questions and logs the answers in a note on your phone, it also can text whomever you think can help you , if anyone. Also, I am more than happy to share it with any and everyone who may see the benefit.

I call it sadtap below is a video of how it works.

"I've been on seroquel for insomnia for years now, started at 25mg and gradually worked my way up to 300mg. The thing is that if I take any dose above 300mg, even 325mg, i get these absolutely horrid side effects. 

It feels like someone is standing on my chest and I can't catch my breath. The anxiety, probably due to not being able to breathe or sleep, is terrible. It's like my entire body is shaking and my breathing gets erratic. 

Have any of you experienced anything like that from seroquel? The dosage window for it is pretty wide, with some people taking 800mg+ daily, so i don't think i could describe it as an overdose. 

I know this isn't a subreddit for seroquel, but it seems to be a common prescription for most of you, so I thought I'd make a post to see what you guys have to say."
"I even made a even in my calendar. I feel so bad I haven't even contacted them yet. I'm in the mania , but it's not as chaotic. I am alittle more quick to anger and I haven't been able to sleep a alot. It sucks right?"
"Okay everyone, with much reluctance, I am getting on Latuda. I have had very bad experiences w/ antipsychotics but sadly after a year without them, I need them again. 

I’m only settling for Latuda. I am going into this with the most optimistic mindset I can have, so - I’m looking for positive experiences & outcomes only! 

My reasoning: 
I did not realize until I got off Seroquel after years, I was living in a fog. I had very little emotion (aside from painful depression), no interests, no color. Sleepwalking.
When I got off it I felt like I was seeing the world for the first time again. Not a day goes by I don’t appreciate my newfound way of seeing the world… and I’m terrified of losing that. I don’t want to go numb again. I just want to not go psychotic every few months haha. 

I hear Latuda is gentle. Not as harsh as other APs. For those it worked for - what’s it like? Do you feel things just as strongly as you did before? 

I’m being as optimistic as possible…. Also looking for womens experiences specifically. Thank you all so much!"
"So I just found out I am bipolar 2 about 2 months ago. I got on medication it seemed to help but not a whole lot doctor upped my dose and now I've been a depressive state for almost a month, my doctor says it could take months before seeing results..
With that being said, I don't want to feel this way anymore but I don't know if the medication is making it worse or If it's just bipolar running its normal course. Anyone have thoughts I would appreciate it"
"For background, I've had a history of impulsive spending and it is still something I struggle with in mania. I'm coming out of a mixed episode and have made plans to visit a friend up north, tacking it on to a trip back home to see my mom and my psychiatrist. I made my travel arrangements with the points I was given when a flight was canceled in Southwest's whole ordeal over the winter holidays. So these plans are not setting me back financially except that I'm staying in a hotel. This is a friend I've known for five years, we talk on the phone a lot and have video called and whatnot. Because we are interested in each other romantically, my parents are ripping me to shreds about ""this is so random why are you doing this right now you need to call your doctor."" They never seem to care about me when I am manic other than to mention how annoying I am. Any time I do ANYTHING fun or for my happiness, they tell me I'm manic. This is not even random, we've had plans to try to link up several times but the timing was never right for me. I am finally ready for a relationship and am thrilled to just go spend time with someone I've been friends with for years, regardless of what happens with us romantically and my family is telling me how I'm going off the rails. 

I get so frustrated with this (it happens often) and my parents refuse to educate themselves. I recently took care of my sister's cats while she drove three hours away (she's chronically ill and is usually unable to drive the 45 minutes to our dad's house, so this was risky for her) to meet a guy she had met previously that week on facebook. Nobody said she was crazy! He ended up standing her up and it was oh poor her we just were excited that she was getting back out there (she's very dependent on always having a partner). It's so unfair that I'm accused of being in a manic episode any time I do something for myself. This happened when I went to visit a college friend too!

Any tips on how to not get so viscerally angry at this would be appreciated. Does anyone else deal with this too? I know it comes from a place of caring but when they refuse to hear me out on my own experiences it does not feel that way."

Has anyone here who takes Antipsychotics have a problem with memory?
"That's been happening cyclically for some months now and I'm fearful of what's going to happen the next time; any advice on how to cope with that? I'm taking a mild dose of amitriptyline, an antipsychotic and I'm tapering off clonazepam."
"**this is not a post suggesting that any person stop taking medication or use this as an alternative to their current medication. It is important no medication changes happen without connecting with a health professional**

But for the sake of discussion I have been thinking about this and experimenting with it a little bit. I have a diagnoses of BP2 and have tried using weed sometimes to help. The problem with me is it seems a lot of medications take away hypomania for me, but generally make me not want to get out of bed. I am from a state where weed is legalized for purchase for 21+. 

I always felt like in my prior experience I would just smoke or ingest any kind of THC and it would be hit or miss; sometimes it seemed like it was the only thing that somewhat helped but other times it felt like it worsened my symptoms. Obviously I understand there are mixed episodes, etc., but I was curious if anyone else has tried tapering specific strains to specific episodes. For example, the main two strains of weed are sativa and indica. For manic and depressive episodes, one would think that it might work to use these as sativa is uplifting (for depressive episodes) and indica is more sedating (for manic episodes). I haven’t tried this for a super extended amount of time, but there are times where sativa is the only thing to get me out of bed and actually doing chores, etc. 

Is this an idea any of you have thought about or put into action? I am curious as to what your opinions are on this because the reaction I have received from health professionals have been very mixed; some have told me that if smoking weed works for me to keep doing it, some have told me its a drug which makes me an addict in addition to my other diagnoses. Thoughts/experiences?"
Well I was supposed to go to work tomorrow. I am just too angry and I can’t do it. I refuse to have a public breakdown so I’m taking care of myself and removing the pressure. I usually have a pretty good grip on my emotions but lately it’s all slipping away. Thank goodness for FMLA!
"Concrete with me,

I’ve got the glue,

Are you bored and exhausted too?

Intrusive thoughts,

Abuse from those we thought loved us,

Don’t let it fade the flame in your heart,

Not sure about you,

But I want to see a few more acts,

Doubt intermission has even been met,

Perhaps a little recognition of it all can make it less bitter,

Conjure an adventure over dead end plans."
"Hello friends. Weather changes triggered a very angry manic episode. I've met the best person who loves and treats me amazingly. I was irrationally angry at him, and went on a childish tantrum. Now I can't stop crying :( I don't deserve them and I feel like nobody should have to be subjected to this. 


I feel like I should let them go :("
I’ve had two hypomanic episodes a week apart. I was already depressed before but now I’m even more depressed. I don’t have suicidal thoughts but I’ll be crying for a while and be ok and then crying again. That went on for about two hours. I was hitting myself very hard because I felt helpless. Do you think I should go to the hospital? I get my new meds tomorrow. But if I go to the hospital I’m not sure they can do much.

"Hello to everyone. I'm currently taking 200mg of Lamictal daily. It has  been really good for stabilizing my mood, but I'm still struggling with  daily anxiety. My P-doc will prescribe me 10 Ativan for panic attacks,  but I really can't ask for these often due to my history of alcohol  abuse. What has worked for you, to augment your Lamictal, for anxiety  specifically? I'm not interested in taking SSRIs or Bupropion due to  side effects."
"I've been on strong anti-depressants (Moclobemide)for 18-19 months now since my BP2 diagnosis. It was never meant to be long term and my psychiatrist has ordered me to ease off them. 

I've tried twice now. The first time I went without them for 2 weeks and spiralled so hard I felt insanely suicidal. Such an intense depressive episodes. This time I'm 3 days off them and I'm convinced everyone hates me and my thoughts are rapidly declining. 

I had a dream last night I was begging my psychiatrist for help and to be send to psych ward. 

This isn't normal right? He told me my chemicals should've  been almost evened out by now. I'm off them for a couple days and I find living pointless. I don't know what to do."
"I've been experiencing a particularly spicy episode of hypomania and spent most of the last year cycling between hypomania and level. The cycling started since I had my Wellbutrin increased to the highest dose, February 2022. My doctor is weaning me off the Wellbutrin completely and she increased my risperidone to 4 MG. As of now (well, when I finish weaning), my only medication for bipolar will be the risperidone (I'm also on gabapentin, but that was prescribed for fibromyalgia). 

I've been on antidepressants of some type or another for the last 15 years roughly, so I'm afraid of what to expect, because I've had pretty deep depressive episodes most of my life (with the exception of this last year). 

Anyone else who's only taking risperidone (or another antipsychotic) find it manages their moods sufficiently? I know antidepressants aren't great for bipolar, but I find myself terrified of falling into another depressive episode. 

My doctor is trying to put a push on getting me into my psychiatrist, but she's been trying since August, so I don't hold a lot of faith in hearing from him."
"so in that 1st half everything runs smoothly and you can function well. however in the second half progesterone decreases estrogen in the brain. which has been promoting the release of feel-good neurotransmitters. so understandably feelings of sadness and anxiety worsen especially for those with ADD. yes a quick fix would be estrogen birth control but it's dangerous for other health comorbid gynecologic reasons.


treating ADD can improve the PMS supposedly and possibly my bipolar too? so it's possible my behaviour/mood is dependent on my hormonal fluctuations. [recent bloods confirm i am healthy no concerns.


I cross referenced my period tracker against my calendar of activities and mood tracking. I fit the pattern pretty much perfectly. For the 1st two weeks I am functional [maybe not to the level of me pre-diagnosis] but not happy or normal as depression is always relentlessly hovering in the background. thus in that second half I completely crumble, revert to a a helpless, sorrowful mess. 


having cross referenced the dates I've seen that this change of mood typically occurs at the end of the week/weekend. 


has anyone felt suspected  this or noticed this before? especially so if you were assigned female at birth and menstruate! 


at my Bipolar support group the leader said to look into this because comorbid ADD/AHDD with BP and seem to compliment each other do well. some way the manifest in similar ways to the point it's difficult to untangle them apart, separating one symptom from one another distinctly.  


thanks for reading if you got this far."
"Hi there. I’m hoping someone can relate. My husband is bipolar with psychotic features when manic. He has been off Olanzapine for a few months. Recently, he started up again with sleep disturbances. His doc said to take the olanzapine as needed. 

He couldn’t sleep for 2 nights (very minimal). So he took an olanzapine (5 mg) on the third night and slept hard and long. But then the next two nights were sleepless again despite the 5mg of olanzapine. So we were advised to increase to 7.5 mg until I can speak to his doctor. That was last night when he increased the dose and the sleep was still hard to come by. He did sleep, but not through the night.

I’m really hoping the olanzapine is helping to keep psychosis away, at least. I’m also hoping that a second night at 7.5mg will be the charm.

Anyone else have this experience and it worked out okay? This is the first time my husband has had the insight to try to stop an episode before it happens and I hope it works. He’s really trying and agreeable to these tweaks.

Thanks for reading my post. Being a caregiver can be incredibly exhausting and lonely. I’m still trying to figure this out."
"I don't think I went longer than 6 months or so without a noticable episode between age 17 and 23. I trialed a bunch of different medications over the years, but I'd end up in an episode a couple times per year that seriously messed things up. I was hospitalized several times during those years and usually got better between hospitalizations but 6 months later I'd be unstable again. I ended up on a cocktail of meds that weren't really working summer 2021 and had a bad mixed episode where I ruined some close friendships, went off all my meds cold turkey, and attempted suicide. I was feeling hopeless that my mental health was preventing me from reaching any of my life goals and that I was stuck on a cycle of illness. Coming out of the hospital, I ended up with a much simpler med regimen that works much better for me. The next few months were still a bit bumpy, but starting about year ago, my seasonal depression lifted. Since then I've graduated college, lost 45 lbs, started a good full time job, moved to a state with much milder winters and started running to deal with stress. 

I wish I could go back in time and tell my younger self that it really can get better. I'd thought that I was going to keep surviving from crisis to crisis forever and that I wasn't going to be stable enough to work towards my goals. I worried I'd always be dependent on family and that I wouldn't be able to hold a job longer than a few months. I moved out with roommates last summer and I've been getting good performance reviews at my job. I've now been at the same company long enough that if I do have another episode I'll qualify for short term disability while I recover. I have also been able to make real progress towards my health goals of losing weight and getting into running."
"I have been on seroquel for about 5 months and it’s been a life changing for my sleep. 

But tonight I can’t sleep? Like it’s not caused any drowsiness at all !

"I guess I was diagnosed when i was 7 i dont know the type as im still waiting in records but the part thats fucking with me is my mom hid it from me. It was apparently so bad the school i was going to would not let me come back without a treatment plan and medication. When i was 12 she moved me to my dads and i cold turkeyd my meds i guess she thought it would just dissapear im now 26 and went to a psychiatric emergency room where they so kindly told me Im showing signs of bipolar so i asked my mom and thats when the flood gates were loosened. Apparently i was on a super high dose of geodon. It just feels like shit that she let me make all those decisions ect joining the military, getting in trouble for smoking in highschool, and stealing to support my habbit im currently waiting for med managemnt appt so i can get on lithium or something again but im so fucking depressed that it is bipolar becuase it means i will never have a chance at stability and a normal life."
"So I will be going to see psychologist this Friday to talk treatment and get looked at. My parents don’t agree with the decision to take me, but they know it’s what I want. I’m only 16, and my parents say that meds are gonna ruin me, ruin my relationships with my friends and make me a zombie, that there gonna mess up the chemicals in my brain, and that I should wait till my brain is done developing. They also suggest that I should be on weed cause it’s natural. Should I be worried about taking meds?"
"I dislike how they portray the characters doing bad things during mania/psychosis. This illness doesn’t make people do bad things. It doesn’t make you steal stuff, cheat on your partner, get violent, neglect your children, etc. This is why bipolar has such a big stigma."
"Anyone only have one manic episode?

I had my first manic episode from an SSRI at 35 and no signs of mania before that. Now it's been a year and I haven't had any other episodes. I am only taking Abilify currently. I just spend so much time wondering and worrying if it's going to happen again naturally. It's like an eternal waiting game because I just can't know and it feels so foreign still to me. Anyone just have one episode throughout their bipolar diagnosis so far?"
"Please input your thoughts.
Hello. I'm wondering if anyone else has similar sleep disturbances.
My partner and I live together and while he's someone I truly love and care about, I just can't sleep well with him.

I'm 22M (Type 1).
I'm currently euthymic and on maintenance therapy (Buspirone, Depakote DR, Wellbutrin SR |morning dose| Levothyroxine, Liothyronine)

Now, I know it's not his fault because he can't control it and it's completely my issue, but self awareness won't help me sleep. 
He snores rather loudly, especially when he drinks. 
I don't know why snoring specifically, but no matter how tired I am the snoring keeps me up. I can be exhausted, yet somehow each time he does, it irks me and I try to ignore it but my heart beat and blood pressure go up and it's just jabbing me in the ear.

Again, I know that I'm the one having the issue. I've tried some earplugs, sleeping with white noise via earbuds, tiring myself out before bed. Because he doesn't deserve to be blamed for something he can't control.
But it doesn't work. I find myself hyperfocusing on the snoring even though I'm exhausted."
"If so, how did the conversation go?"
"Damn my wave has crashed hard. I've been doing so well ( or at least I thought it was) all winter. My first winter in over 25 years that I was pretty stable( multiple childhood traumas around winter time). Then bam all the darkness crashed down on me all at once. No gradual build up this time, just a numbing, suffocating darkness crawled into me. Not even sure why I'm posting I just feel lost and invisible and wanted to feel seen. As a quote from one of my favorite bands ""This island has become an ocean and my boat's too small, the waves are crashing in and I can't save this sinking ship"". I don't even know where to begin with my thoughts I'm sorry for ranting on here I just need to vent it out. I've talked to my therapists and we will start the process over as usual, I've told my wife she's here to support me but I still feel so alone. I'm afraid of myself in this state and I have to be strong for my wife and my son. I hate drowning while feeling an obligation to have to keep it all together. *Trigger warning self harm* cooking dinner the past two nights has been torture, I have no control when that knife is in my hand my voices just want me to add to my collection of scars. So far I've fought it to just a slight drag against the skin to get the sensation but I need to keep fighting. My demons are all breaking out of their cages and it's been so long since my last battle my last war, my swords are dull and my shields are broken. I'm sorry to everyone for this being so long and if it upset anyone. I wish you all the best and thank you for giving me a safe space."
"Latuda works better for me than any cheaper drug I've ever tried, but I've felt a bit precarious needing a medication whose goodrx price is more than my rent. Thankfully with the manufacturer coupon and my good insurance, paying hasn't been a huge issue, but it definitely limited my interest in taking jobs with worse insurance options. I'd heard that it was going generic soon but hadn't seen any hard evidence of that.

I looked today and it appears that several manufacturers have rolled out generic lurasidone in the past week. Goodrx is showing it at $50/month at some local pharmacies with their coupon. It's supposed to take another few months before it fully rolls out to every pharmacy, but it's happening! I feel more secure already knowing I can afford it even if I have insurance issues in the future."
"But why the am i waking up smelling like candy? 
I'm thinking it's a Lamictal side-effect.

"Over the thirty five years of being in treatment for bipolar, I've had alot of antidepressant ""poop outs"" where the depression lasted as long as three years before I got another med that worked for me. 

Then, something changed. I did something that changed the course of my bipolar illness. 

Mindfulness-based Dialectical Behavioral Therapy. 

I fought the idea of Mindfulness for the longest time. Especially since the word was weaponized against me by doctors when I was struggling with Tardive Dyskinesia. I was told I was a ""walking ambulance"" and that I was 'a bull in a china closet' and needed to work on Mindfulness. 

Finally, I found a Trauma program and the curriculum was Marsha Linehan's Dialectical Behavioral Therapy. I go to a University that offers it on a sliding scale, the only downside is that my therapists are students and graduate every one to two years. But at 8 bucks a week, the price is right and I've been in it for seven years. 

What I notice is when death thoughts come up, instead of catastrophizing that it's another depression phase that's going to last a year or more, I tell myself that ""I'm feeling depressed today"" and I do things to make myself feel better, like exercise, music, and also am allowed by my doctor to take an extra one of my fast acting antidepressants. I don't know if I'm allowed to mention the name of an antidepressant, but it's a new one, it's a new type of SSRI and though expensive, for me, it acts quickly.

It has been a somber week. My baby bear had to be put down early Monday. She has seen me through some awful episodes but her main job was to support my other dog. She was a best friend. It hurts. I miss her.
I have be retreating into myself going on month three now. It’s because I am irrationally angry all the time and it’s the only way I can keep from exploding. I’m really tired. This is hard and I’m mad at my own brain for making me work this hard to barely function. Every week after work I can give my SO like two hours tops before I have to go hide in my bedroom. He is understanding but he also said he is feeling neglected and it hurts his heart a lot that I have to retreat. I’m not doing it on purpose but I am trying to save him from my angry and frankly ice cold meanness exploding all over him. Anyway I’m posting a lot right now so I apologize to the community if I’m being a bother I’m just angry and lost and confused. Just venting here helps a lot.
"Pinned,

Hampered is the shoreline,

I’m more sand than Teflon,

Would sound the alarm, 

But I fear the blitzkrieg of help,

And it comes to a point that it’s merely mundane,

Habitual,

A ritual,

Not something worth a care or stare,

Self esteem becomes an impacted guardrail,

I’m not so solid,

And embarrassingly frail,

With good practice I might fully extinguish the fluster,

I’m a mere deadweight at this point,

Refusing to release from the limb,

A mere cost of nutrients from the other buds branching in the life I failed."
"Looking at people my age with the life I wanted for myself is honestly tearing me apart. There is nothing about myself or my life that would ever be admirable or acceptable to anyone. This feeling inside of me is so painful no matter what I do and I don’t know how to make it better. It’s jealousy, anger, regret, longing, sadness and self-hatred all wrapped into one."
"I have been on a cocktail of 4 meds for a few years now and they have been serving me well.  I'm level, I'm even, I'm almost stoic (on the outside, anyway), and I like me this way. 

But I've had a pesky low white blood cell count for years now that keeps getting lower.  Hematologist says it's likely a side effect of the apripazole, which means I'll probably have to go off it.  It was the last one added to my cocktail and had the greatest effect of evening me out.  

Has anyone else had to leave a good mix because of side effects?  I don't want to ride the roller coaster again.  I don't want to be that me again.  I like who I am now.  I am not happy."
"I always read and heard that it has to be at the therapeutic blood concentration. But here I am on 300mg extended release for a month, still waiting to be able to get a blood test, and knowing it’s not therapeutic, but doing sooooo much better.

"My psychiatrist wanted to try a different antipsychotic but that meant that I was going to temporarily be on THREE antipsychotics, plus a mood stabilizer plus an antidepressant plus a stimulant.  Crazy, right?  


But I just recently worked with my psych to remove one of the antipsychotics and it was successful!  So now I am only one two antipsychs, and we are trying to lower the dose of one of them!!!"
"Content warning throwing up and eating disorders mentioned 

Hellooo fellow bipolar Reddit users 

I am 20 years old and recently started taking medication again for the first time in 2 years, I’m bp2. I spent the majority of my mid to late adolescence in treatment centers so I’ve taken like every anti depressant anti psychotic ssri you could think of. When I turned 18 and finally had autonomy over my body, I stopped meds. 

Obviously that didn’t work so after two years of that I reached out to one of my old doctors and he prescribed me latuda since it’s newer and something I haven’t taken before. I’ve been taking it on and off for a few months. I finally got on a 3 week streak of taking it!! But here is where my issue and question come in. 
 
I’ve been diagnosed with anorexia since I was 14. Although it’s better now I’m still not perfect. About 80% of my stomach is completely wrecked from that and some medicine I got prescribed for pneumonia when I was a kid. Taking pills in general is really harsh on my stomach. I struggle with acid reflex and throwing up because of my weak stomach. 

Usually I eat one full meal at the end of the day, then take my latuda. Two days ago I fell asleep early and woke up early. I didn’t eat the previous day and was having acid reflex so I made 5 vegan nuggies and took my latuda. 

Holy shit did I yak up a storm. It was one of those ones Where you literally can taste the pill coming up every time you heave. Ever since that I have been incredibly nauseous, dehydrated , having cold&hot flashes and headaches. Every time I’ve eaten since (I’ve made effort to eat greens proteins as well as chug pedialyte) I’ve had to sit and do deep breathing for like 20 min to keep my food down which isn’t normal for me. 

I haven’t taken my latuda since so I’m not sure if these are withdrawals or sickness from throwing it up. Any advice about latuda or anything I mentioned would be greatly appreciated!! Thank you in advance my bipolar warriors  <3"
"i’ve hit a rough depressive episode, and lamictal was working really well up until this month, granted this month and the last were stressful as hell but i think the lamictal has stopped working as effectively as it was. i bumped up to 200 a few weeks ago but it made everything like 10x worse so we went back to 150 and i was fine for a bit. this month i just can’t seem to get out of bed and i’ve been sleeping a lot tbfh. the only thing saving me rn is my puppy honestly. a lot of stress this month also has to do with one of my dogs, and i’m putting him down on monday so i’m hoping it’ll help stress levels significantly even though i’ll be grieving like a mf. 

lamictals been working really well for hypomanic episodes and for the depressive episodes for the most part but there’d be some breakthrough depressive symptoms but nothing that couldn’t be managed tbh. i think i might have to change meds completely tho which SUCKS because i love lamictal. i really need something to help with both hypomanic and depressive episodes and SSRI’s have never helped so i can’t go down that route. 

anyone have any ideas of good meds? i’ve read so many good things about lithium but i don’t have insurance to go do regular blood tests but i was interested in bringing it up to my psych in a couple of weeks. i don’t want to take more than 2 meds and would love to just take one if possible.

"I don’t get full blown mania. I get hypomania while my depressive episodes are more severe and common (type 2). I recently had a hypomanic episode after a full year. I had just celebrated two years of sobriety so the drug cravings have been pretty bad, been struggling for money just to pay rent, and the weather has been dragging my mood down like crazy.

I woke up one morning feeling good. I had therapy, but didn’t have much to talk about. I stayed in a good mood for three days. The next morning, my emotions were gone. My chest was light with nothing and my mind was swirling with racing thoughts.

-“I should restart life again. Get rid of these friends since they mean nothing to me.”
-“I shouldn’t be in a relationship. I’m not cut out for them anyway.”
-“I’m going to sell everything and disappear to Japan with my cat.”
-“Who cares about college? I’m going to start my business like I’ve been wanting to for years.”

I broke my fiancé’s heart with a singular sentence. I pushed her away, rolled my eyes, and got really annoyed when she started getting emotional. Emotionless and cold is what she called me then she contacted my therapist to ask for help.

Turns out I was having an episode and I didn’t even know it. I became aware of what I was doing and why my brain was doing such awful things. I don’t want to lose my fiancé. She keeps me afloat and always has the most patience and understanding with my bipolar. We talked and I apologized and said I would get better. I managed to bring myself down and told her to set boundaries with me when I start getting irrational and manic.

I have caused so much tears and emotional turmoil. I felt like utter trash after coming down and realizing WHAT i was doing to her. My hypomanic episodes cause so my destruction. I’m not happy. I don’t have emotions and I never want to say such hurtful things to her again. She means everything to me and I would hate to lose her because of this dumb disorder.

I don’t get the god complex or physical impulsivity or the pure eurphoria. I get irritable, irrational, mean, heartless, and I go way too fast.

I just don’t want to hurt the love of my life again in such an episode. She doesn’t deserve it. I’m currently in a depressive episode over my actions and all I feel is guilt. I have been showing her I’m trying to work it out and she has noticed some good progress.

I’m afraid to hurt her to the point that she leaves due to my episodes."
"An overused gear wears out and hinders the coupling,

Words and threats,

I am constantly uneasy,

Perpetually nauseous, as everything begins to feel synthetic,

From kind to chasing me,

Your efforts took me in like gravity to a satellite,

Now I feel my whole self is a stitch to be reopen again,

Perhaps that is just the way it is,

My foundation is not solid so it’s tempting for others to dig in,

Like a swarm of locusts,

Until I am bare and thin,

Want to hide and implode into a thousand bits,

Because the threats got me feeling anemic,

Like walking into cold winter winds,

My entirety is numb,

And I have felt like a refugee on occasions,

Dismantling the self and pushing all out feels less overwhelming than exerting oneself to build a new trunk,

Rattle me!

Identify cannibalizes itself."
"Got too high off an edible and had to go the hospital when the delusions persisted after a psychotic break. It’s almost March and I still feel that anxiety and worry. It scares me cause I can’t be on pills forever they make me feel dull and uncreative. I was entering a creative field in college and now I feel like that’s ruined, and I sure as hell can’t do math. Im going to stay on pills for now but I have no idea if it gets better."

"Anyone on these injections?

My psychiatrist suggested them in the past, and I recently went off my meds for a couple months and had an episode.

I see her again on Monday, and am worried she will now push for them. I have a lot of anxiety about that sort of thing and don’t love the idea of a loss of control."
"I have been taking Geodon for two years now. I’m on the lowest dose and I don’t want to go up on it or take anything else. I’m weird about being put on medicine since I don’t want to take any and ignore the fact I have Bipolar Depression.

I feel good when I take it, like i’m able to calm down and remain stable when my emotions start becoming too much (my brain will shut off everything once it gets to a certain point). It’s the only thing that keeps me asleep and let’s me fall asleep. Melatonin and other similar things don’t work AT ALL. I want to get off of all meds and never take them again, but i’m not going to be able to sleep at all.

Anyone else take this medicine?"
"So recently I have been having very very vivid dreams to the point I can’t tell if it’s reality or a dream. 

I have gone over a few of these dreams with my husband to confirm they were actually dreams and not reality, which is great.

But every night I don’t feel rested now, I think the vivid dreams are from seroquel but I have been on it for 4 months and I’m only having problems now!?

Has this happened to anyone else ?"
Sick and tired of living. I think im going to give up soon. I have no further hope or will to live anymore. I feel like therapy and meds have not helped enough. Thanks for all the support folks have provided on here.
"I have been in this group for a while now, and I really appreciate seeing people who experience the same hell (that hopefully will turn into joy in the future), and I just want to get something off my chest.

I’m a student that came to Canada half a year ago, and the health system is royally bad, really REALLY bad. Hence I can’t see a psychiatrist really and I am currently trying lamotrigine (Lamictal). I used to do Abilify and Zoloft before this, Quetiapine (Seroquel- absolutely horrible) and Risperdone and Zoloft before that as well. Tried so many things and they have never worked, even if I gave each of these meds 6 months at least. Nothing. The same thing is going on with Lamotrigine as well. It’s as if I am downing peach colored chalk, and I don’t think anything will happen if I down the whole pill bottle (not think about it for now). Basically I have no hope that I will find anything that works, last stop if lithium before I consider anything bad.

Well, that’s the background. Now here comes the really bad part. I used to smoke weed every now and then, once a month most frequently- and now I did it once more yesterday. I only took a little bit, just enough to feel it. Now I woke up after 14 hours and for once I am afraid. I can’t think, I walk really weirdly, and I am paranoid. I pray that it will not turn into psychosis, and I am really anxious and cynical as if something horrible is going to happen.

I shouldn’t have done it, I don’t know what to do, I can’t go on like this"
"I can't apologise to my friends because 'being desperate looks bad'.

They want to believe I'm a backstabber or something.

I lost all my friends"
I'm having massive issues with severe anxiety and paranoia. Will mood stabilizers help me with this? I was prescribed vrayler but I'm too scared to take it bc seroquel and abilify gave me akathesia
Every time I’m manic I managed to do something impulsive and somewhat weird and I just think back on it now and it’s just embarrassing as all hell  I can’t not embarrass myself. I’m okay with it though I think it’s funny in a way when I’m stable and think back on it. Only during some type of mania  I can put on quite a show.
"Hey weird question.. I know but is it possible that when you’re in a depressive episode that you (can) feel hints of happiness / hope which are like short living but existent? 

Or if your manic/ hypomanic that you (possibly can ) feel angry, sad,  anxious or irritated/ agitated?"
"I have had a rough few years with my Bipolar disorder.  Recently we finally found a medication combination that is working with side effects I can handle.  I am stable and functioning.  


Yet I am starting to miss being in the midst of an episode.  This, to me, is mortifying because I have never, ever wanted to be the kind of person that uses my mental illness for attention.  In fact, I worked hard to hide it for the most part.  I didn't mind people knowing that I had Bipole, but I didn't want anyone to know how much I was really suffering.  


It is really hard being stable some days, and some days I just want to curl up in bed and never leave.  I know this is normal for anyone, and we all have bad days, but this is getting to the extreme.  I even briefly (and not seriously but still disturbing) thought that I should kill myself because then people would know how hard life could be for me but I wouldn't have to deal with any pity because I would be dead.    


Don't know if I am just venting or asking for commiseration or advice."
"is this something that happens to other bp/ADHD folks that take adderall for the adhd side of things? it's maddening, holy shit. my legs constantly feel like i need to keep moving. i don't \*think\* i'm heading into mania because i'm not really having my telltale early signs, so i think it's just akathisia rather than manic restlessness.

anyone have any coping tips for it? i've had little bouts of akathisia in the past that i resolved by massaging the feeling away with my massage gun but this is sooo much more intense than the prior experiences. and it's damn near constant. i like how i'm finally able to get stuff done again but whew are my legs restless."
"I've been in a depressive episode for almost a year now, and I deal with the inability to experience pleasure (anhedonia). Things that I used to enjoy such as listening to music, hanging out with friends and family, playing video games, exercising, etc. don't bring me any pleasure anymore, and I've lost the motivation to do these activities. I don't even feel pleasure from simple things such as warm showers, eating food, or sleeping. I find it extremely difficult to pass time throughout the day due to me not being able to enjoy anything I try to do, and time seems to move relatively slowly for me because of this.

I've been on quite a bunch of different medications (antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, antidepressants, sleep aids) since being diagnosed with bipolar I at the beginning of 2022 with all of them being unsuccessful so far. I am currently on Vraylar 1.5mg, Effexor XR 75mg, and Valium 10mg (for sleep).

I was wondering if anyone else experiences something similar, and I'm curious to know what others do to cope with this.

EDIT:  

Thank you to everyone who has taken time to respond to my post. I appreciate you all for giving me more hope and motivation to continue trucking on this journey to recovery.

I forgot to mention that despite being unable to experience pleasure from things that I used to enjoy, I don't let the anhedonia stop me from trying things again. I still make an effort to do my old hobbies and spend time with loved ones. At times it does seem a little hopeless or even pointless to even continue, but I believe that healing is a process and that there is hope at the end of the tunnel. Despite the many setbacks I've faced in changes in psychiatrists, therapists, or medications, I haven't lost hope that one day I'll be able to enjoy life again.

I'm glad I found this community, and I hope we all get to where we want to be in life. No matter what challenges face us in our battle with mental health, I wish everyone the best of luck."
"Not that lithium is dumb, but I feel like it's making me so.

Does anyone else have the same experience?

I almost stytter when looking for words when I used to just fluidly say what I was thinking. I also find it extremely difficult to function normally in the way that I'll forget things people ask me to do consistently. I just don't feel like myself since being kn it for the past 6 months."
"In 2021 I spiraled and lost everything, including the ones I love. 

I’m trying to make amends with the people that I’ve hurt, but I know that the word bipolar will throw some of those people off. I don’t want to blame my diagnosis for all of the things I did wrong, especially in my apologies. I don’t want anyone tiptoeing around me, which is what always happens. Even my own mother does. 

I haven’t spoken to these people in over a year and I’m blocked on almost everything. 

I’m not sure how to word things or even what to say, & I’m trying hard not to sound like a victim. Below are a couple of texts I’ve sent, but haven’t received any answers…  


1) I didn’t know how to reach you, hopefully this does. I thought of you today and I wanted to reach out to say I’m sorry. I made a complete fool of myself and lost control. I was spiraling and instead of getting help, I pushed away the people I cared about the most. The way I treated you and others was wrong. I should’ve told everyone what was going on with me and I have a lot to atone for. I lost everything good in my life and I have nobody to blame but myself.

I don’t expect to be forgiven but I knew I owed you an apology. I really am sorry.

If you ever want to talk I’ll be here. I hope things are good with you.



2) Hey it’s ____. I just wanted to reach out and say im sorry for 2021. I was going through something and I took it out on everyone around me . I made a complete fool of myself. Anyway, I just thought of you and want to make it right. I hope you’re doing well - I miss you."
"Hello everyone I’m new here. 
Since I can remember I have extreme mood swings , mostly depression , paranoia , delusional thinking and anxiety and in stressful situations It can be possible that I dissociate and be depressed for long time. 

I’m in therapy and now I finally found a good one ! 
I’m 24 female and have these symptoms since I was 13 or 14. 

My question is : how long did it take your therapist to get you diagnosed ? And is it possible that it also might be BPD ? 
But I really want to be alone when depressed most of the time so I guess that wouldn’t fit for a Borderline Diagnosis? 

And another thing is : Does weather also influence your mood and what kind of medication is needed / help for delusional periods? Should I ask my therapist bc she doesn’t know how severe my paranoid thoughts can be.

Thanks for helping"
"My dog is loving it, my younger son is getting a few new things for his room and I bought some cacti  to plant since I can’t kill them. I wish I could stay like this all the time, I’m not out of control, not sexually irresponsible at all, not overspending $.. I’m just happy. Is this how “ normal” people feel?"
"I have been on Abilify along with some form of antidepressant for 2 years now. The last time I had a manic episode was in April of 2022 and I’ve been mostly stable since then. 
I had a completely normal night and a completely normal morning until maybe 9 am when I starting feeling incredibly manic. I was at work and started going a million miles an hour and almost feeling out of control of my body. It was to the point where I got pulled out of my classroom (I work at a daycare) and was drug tested because I was acting so erratically. 
Thankfully my boss was understanding when I explained I had bipolar disorder and my drug test came back negative for everything but THC (which my boss is okay with because I was honest about my smoking habits). I got sent home for the day because I was in no position to he around kids. Thankfully I still have my job because I have a great boss but it could’ve been so much worse. Now my Zyprexa is staying in my bag in the event of another episode at an inopportune moment."
"I dropped out of high school when I was 16 because of bipolar and had to stretch out my education with health breaks but I'm really proud of myself for the work I put in to get here. I graduated undergrad with an excellent GPA last semester and made lots of important connections with professors while I was there and I'm really thanking myself for doing so even when life felt impossible. I definitely worked myself to poor health multiple times throughout undergrad, and that may not be the best decision for everyone (it probably wasn't for me), but it really paid off in a big way.

I barely survived this winter. For once, I'm glad I saw it through. Now I have the opportunity to continue giving bipolar the finger by advancing my academic career and moving forward with my life. I'm hoping this news means the end of my seemingly-neverending depressive episode that has lasted for nearly a year and a half."
"I gave my friend $2,000 for no reason during a hypomania episode because I appreciated his friendship.  Yikes. What have you done? Not judgements here, sometimes we can’t control it"
"TLDR; I’m in a not so great manic episode and having a really hard time managing it. I have no idea what to do besides send my psych provider a message and I’m concerned. 

Before I was diagnosed I was just labeled as being impulsive, moody, irritable, touchy, flighty…you know the usual descriptors.

Once I was diagnosed I could see the patterns looking back and it was pretty obvious. About a year after diagnosis I went into a severe manic episode. Had to drop out of school kind of episode. I wasn’t able to identify it as one until I was out of it and did a lot of damage during that time. 

Lately, I’ve had to work with my provider on making changes to my meds because of some serious side effects. I haven’t had a really bad manic episode for a bit but now I’m pretty sure that’s where I’m at/just starting. 

I’ve been decreasing my depakote for awhile. Essentially I’m just on lamictal now and seroquel. Full honesty, I kind of suck at taking the seroquel because it makes me really groggy the next day plus the whole eating everything in the house at 3am problem. The plan is to transition to a different med to replace the seroquel after I’m off the depakote. I was warned to watch for any mania. For awhile it was ok, no big ups/downs. Then this past few weeks things have been going downhill (or uphill?) and I don’t like it. 

The impulsive urges are harder to stop. I’m extremely defensive/irritable when I usually wouldn’t be. I was convinced I was going to write & self publish a very successful children’s book. Im still talking myself down from that one, but I’ve got a list of great ideas a mile long. I’m super anxious and pushing the line on being paranoid. 

I am trying really, really, really hard to fight it but it’s exhausting. I feel like at least I’m aware but it almost makes things worse because I’m fighting for control…and feel like I’m losing. It’s a vicious circle of “don’t act that way! That’s not you!” And “fuck you, I’m doing it anyway”. 

I’m tired and concerned and I just want to stop fucking up our lives. I start a brand new job I just landed as a full time nursing instructor next week. I’m terrified I will ruin it if I can’t get this under control. I’m hoping my provider can help me but it very much feels like I’m helpless."

"I'm curious how many of you have run into this, and how you dealt with it.

My department moved locations back in November. I was at the office this morning - I'm usually not there as I work at multiple locations during the day, so I don't know everyone in the building very well. We had professional development scheduled today so I headed to the office this morning. We use the copier of another department housed across the hall, so I went over there to make some copies. There are only two people in that office, one is super nice and friendly and the other can be kind of an entitled bitch. 

When I got over there, the friendly one was there but the other one was not. I started chatting with her a bit, and the topic of the other lady came up. I asked if she knew about an email she had sent my team where she was accusing us of taking the forks and spoons from the kitchen area and not returning them. We had a little laugh about it, and the friendly one said it's hard working with her because her moods are unpredictable. she then said ""I mean, bipolar is probably the better word for it, she's nice one day and irritable the next."" And she had a good laugh.

I was kind of taken aback, to the point I couldn't really react. I wanted to say something like, bipolar isn't a word you should just throw around like that, it's a real illness with real implications. But I didn't. 

It's still sticking with me and it happened ten hours ago. Should I have said something? Why did it make me feel so defensive? How can we fight stigma like this in our everyday lives?"
Anybody ever try Doxepin? Your personal opinion?
Hi all. I don’t post much because I have been stable a long time. I recently changed my medication with doctors approval and advice as Vraylar made me too numb and too fat. Well now I’m feeling angry a lot and my SO says I’ve been obsessed with my phone. He says I have been ignoring him for two months. I really don’t know what to think. I’m worried it could be mania sneaking up on me. My work which I once loved makes me irrationally angry now. I have done “normal” things to try and fix this like fixing my resume and getting an appointment with a recruiter so I still think I am stable. My biggest worry is that I want to like burn my work bridges and tell everyone exactly what I think of them and most of my thoughts are less than kind. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist so I know it won’t get out of hand but as someone who has a history of burning bridges I guess I am just a little scared of myself. Can anyone empathize? What do you do for irrational anger? I’m taking my meds and I am doing all the “right”things but I do feel that my anger is getting the better of me.
"Sorry for the grammatical errors.  English is not my first language.

So... I'm not doing well these last few days. Failure after failure ended up collapsing me and handing me over to the heavy elephant. It's been a long time since I experienced depression for more than a few hours. It will be a difficult week, I hope it doesn't become months.
When I'm depressed, food tastes nothing to me and disgusts me. The texture feels weird and the smell is the worst. Added to the total lack of hunger I have spent the last few days drinking water and I'm starting to feel dizzy and very weak (which sucks because depression already makes you feel very tired and if you stop eating getting up is a nightmare ). 
If anyone has been through something similar, what do you eat to get some energy other than a whole meal?  The last time I stopped eating it didn't end very well and I don't want to repeat the experience."
"I can't seem to produce any ""mind chatter"" the way I used to. The delusions are gone but so is my creativity, my thoughts, etc. I can barely think. I'm on Abilify and test running Rexulti right now and it's even worse after my injection."
"I've been taking it since December for insomnia, 25 mg to 50 mg daily, and 100 mg of lamotrigine in the morning for Bipolar. I've been sleeping fine except for the last several months, I had been laid off and put on credit card debt, I found a job that pays me better and I've paid off my debt, but I'm still not sleeping well. I don't want to become dependent on medication to I read that long-term use can cause heart problems. I see posts where people have been on the medicine for several years and able to quit cold turkey."
"i feel when i take trileptal i concentrate better or feel motivated to do something like reading.

what can explain this effect?"
"I’ve been slowly increasing at 25mg every two weeks for 7 weeks now. I’m also on 300mg on seroquel (have been for a very long time and intend to slowly decrease once the lamitcal stabilises)

I’ve been on 75mg for almost 2 weeks, taking 1x25mg in the morning at 2x25mg in the evening

Recently I’ve been experiencing random nausea, it’ll start halfway through the day and grow worse by evening and my appetite goes way down. Could this be the meds? I didn’t initially think it was because it started at such random times, not when I actually take the pills.

Has anyone else experienced this, and did it go away?"
"I've been diagnosed type 2 for a couple of years now, on and off medication (hoping I can stick to it this time) and right now I just need to vent, and I hope this is the right place to do that. I can delete this later if its not. 100 mg lamictal a day. This illness runs in my family on my father's side for several generations. I only found out this vital genetic information /after/ having children and digging deeper into it. My great grandmother died in a gutter because of this illness. She had been officially diagnosed and treated, for what its worth. In and out of state facilities. One of her children inherited it, then passed it onto my father, who passed it onto me.

I am an adult, and the expectation is that an adult should have greater self control than children. Right? I try my best to teach my 3 year old how to manage her emotions, like labeling them, taking a moment to breathe, and talking about it when we're done being emotional about it. All the coping skills I learned, in therapy, I try to teach her. She's 3 and sometimes she manages herself better than I do myself. She's going to leave me in the dust in the next decade and I'll still be... bipolar.

I try as hard as I can to manage what's going on inside my mind but it feels like its not enough, and I'll never get to my end goal, which is I guess an unrealistic vision of being 'cured' and not having to constantly fight my own thoughts and then, when I fumble, not be devastatingly embarrassed and ashamed of myself. Why? I had a little outburst last night in front of my partner and I wish I could take it back. I still have that annoying nagging feeling like telling myself ""that's not a proper way to behave!"" Why is it that I can see it happening like a third person, but I can't always stop myself? Why am I still paranoid that I'm driving my partner away and this will all end in divorce? Years and years of assurance that it won't happen, that they accept my diagnosis and they'll stick this through with me, and I still don't believe it? And then, when I don't believe it, I instantly feel like I'm hurting them with my distrust? wouldn't you be hurt, too, if several years of love still keeps getting questioned?

I am an adult, I have 2 kids, a homestead and livestock, a job and a degree I've been /slowly/ trying to finish, I can't keep behaving this way. But I still do. And I am so angry at myself. So angry that I have dark thoughts about self harm today. That I know are completely ridiculously unreasonably inappropriate and I should not do that. Somehow being able to label what I'm feeling makes me feel worse, because now I'm more aware of how ridiculous I'm being. ""I don't have time to be feeling this or fighting this. Spring is coming and I have so much work to do to prepare for and then go through the growing season, and I'm several weeks behind on my coursework."" That's what I tell myself to try to snap myself back to reality. It never works.

As I've gotten older I've noticed little moments of hallucinations just out of the corner of my eye, more lately than when I was in high school. I think back then I almost never had anything like that happening. Maybe just once or twice, fleeting. Nowadays its a weekly thing. Noises, like the kids crying and wailing after they've gone to bed, or visuals, like 'shadow people' at the top of the stairs or in my workplace as someone walking past. Yesterday I swore I saw a kid in a jacket run past the living room window. My partner went outside in the snow to check, and told me it must've been a turkey or some other animal. Last week I dropped a tool on another mechanics foot because I thought something stared back at me from behind some barrels. Good thing they were wearing steel toe. Is increased hallucinations a side effect from lamictal? My doctor doesn't think so, but I can't help but feel its more than a coincidence. I feel like a paranoid tin-foil-hat kind of person more often now.

6 months ago I re-started treatment after yet another suicide attempt and instant regret about how a parent should never behave that way. I wanted to take as little medication as I can get away with (less medicine=less side effects?). I don't want to be on multiple things and/or high dosages. I barely want to have to be on anything at all. But my love for our children and my spouse trumps that last sentence. Should I ask for a higher dose? Should I take the doctors offer on adding an anxiety medication? At the last appointment the doctor mentioned that the hallucinations might be anxiety based, since a lot of it involves worrying about the kids safety or the presence of strangers (I am not a people person). besides that, I am constantly terrified of how my behavior affects my family.  I had this conversation with my spouse last week. They said they're happy with how the medication has helped, that it has made a difference (I don't think so, I still feel like a terrible spouse and parent), and that they don't need me to take a higher dose. Like the joke about the woman at the 'husband store' asking for better, and better, and better, until in the end you lose the entire thing and can't go back. That was their analogy.

There is one bright spot to this post. Rabbits have a surprisingly good grasp on reality. I knew dogs could sometimes tell and be helpful, but I never thought a rabbit could. My daughter's rabbit picked me as his person. He reliably and consistently wakes me up from nightmares, and tries to get my attention when I'm hallucinating or having an outburst or cowering in another room with terrible thoughts. Whether he climbs my leg or jumps in my lap or licks my face or brings me some of his hay. In return I spoil him by keeping stock of every single kind of hay available for purchase and having a hay rack at each litter box in every room with said hay varieties, and every flower, herb, veggie, or fruit a rabbit could ever want, and chew toys in every room in weird locations as 'hide and seek' games for him to enjoy while I'm at work. How the hell can a tiny, domesticated pet rabbit tell when a human is having a nightmare or suicidal thoughts or seeing things that aren't there?

The rabbit interrupted me this morning from harming myself, so I included a piece of thawed mango in his lunch salad. 

TLDR; still haven't fully accepted this illness being permanent and mostly out of my control. Still wish I had something curable. Still feel immense shame about the thoughts and behaviors I can't control. Might harm myself out of shame. Then also feel ashamed about that too. Thanks for reading. Sorry you had to read it."
The title explains. He says I'm never happy and that I'm mean but it's not true. I struggle but I'm trying to be better. What can I do to help us both??
Currently on lamictal but ever since I started taking abilify I’ve gained at least 15 pounds. I just stopped taking it because of this. How long does it take to flush out of my symptoms and start feeling not like a fat ass?
"I only recently learned about Akathisia. I’ve always had restless legs, but I would say within the past couple of months I’ve had certain episodes where I feel like jumping out of my body and I can’t stop moving and shaking my legs EXTREMELY. It’s like my regular restless legs X100. I’m experiencing it right now along with general discomfort. Currently laying in bed banging my knees together. 

I think maybe this might have happened for the first time when I raised my seroquel from just 100mg at night to 25mg morning and noon on top of the 100mg at night. But then it seemed to go away. I stopped the 25mg 2x a day maybe 1-2 days ago cause I ran out. 

My mom is going to get me Benadryl (per my psychs recommendation if  switched to Vraylar, which hasn’t happened because insurance won’t approve it) but I also read akathisia can be a sign of encephalitis or Parkinson’s so I’m worried such a small change in my antipsychotic isn’t what’s causing this. 

Also, how much Benadryl is too much?

Update: Gabapentin and Benadryl worked!"
"Hey all,  Here is a list of all the higher than general population comorbidities for persons with Bipolar. There is also higher than average comorbidities amongst family members. Many of these have also been linked to chromosome 6p21

BD

ASD

ADHD

POTS

OCD

hyper mobility

left handedness

gender dysphoria

scoliosis

immuno deficiency  (this one is so common that BD and POTS are sometimes considered autoimmune disorders)

I'm curious how many people here have multiples of these comorbidities?  I'm a left handed trans woman with scoliosis, hyper mobility, and bipolar 1.  My siblings are both hyper mobile as well, one has BD and OCD; and the other has POTS"
"I’m on 300 mg once a day but don’t see improvement. My doctor wants me to wait to see her until Tuesday but I have been feeling very irritable and can’t sleep but also extremely depressed. I thought about increasing my dose to double as I have my blood test today and the results populate in my portal so I can see them . 

I emailed her but haven’t heard back as it takes a couple days for her to respond but it’s the weekend coming up so I don’t know if she will. Has anyone else been in this situation?"
"I posted about this on here once before but took it down because I don’t really think it’s relevant, but I’m not sure where else to post and I’m really seeking solidarity.
I’ve always been really insecure about how I look and over fixated on my appearance. But I think since being hospitalized for psychosis this has gotten even worse. It’s quite debilitating, I see other people and get really irritated that I don’t look as good. It’s so superficial and shallow but I can’t help the obsessive thoughts and fears around it. I’m wondering if anyone has had this experience and gotten better with meds."

So, I've been particularly stressed as of late.


Through a weird turn of events, I've gotten an opportunity to use the EBRAINS research infrastructure, and will have an opportunity to utilize a European university super computer in my projects.

I *plan* on using THE VIRTUAL BRAIN, and similar neurocomputational software to help me study what I plan on studying.

Well, I have to first get hardware( a computer/laptop that isn't slow) capable of importing data from said super computer, and running TVB on its servers.

I also have to gather some relevant patient MRI/ EEG  data, and lastly, I have to learn to effectively use TVB, and generate computational models.


This is a HUGE opportunity, and an even bigger one for a 19 year old layman(for the most part, but I'm a neuro nerd for sure).

Well, I also have college coming up in a few months.

So I have to learn all this stuff before college starts.


I also just started dating someone again.

I'm stressed as fuck.


Also, this transition to spring has given me some more pep in my step.


My gf asked if I was manic, and said she was concerned.

So did my online friend.


I can't tell, I don't want to think I am, but they both said something, and I am showing *some* warning signs.


I don't know if it's worth checking out, or not.

Thanks."
i’m going to share the replies with my husband to help him better understand why i am the way i am
"Weight Gain, Tardive Dyskinesia, I have both and apparently, this is why many people quit taking their meds. When I worked in radio I didn't know that Scott Weiland had bipolar, I just thought it was a heroin problem. Then I read his book. I'm not sure he believed in his diagnosis and that, of course, was his choice. We are all free people here. While meds might have saved his life, he chose a different path. I wonder how many other people are in the same boat, sort of on the fence with medications. They saved my life but they also are ruining my body![https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjkgCsKdiXE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjkgCsKdiXE)"
"Hey guys!
I've been about 4-5 months on Paxil, it worked for anxiety, but it killed my libido and motivation. My doc prescribed me Cymbalta (I asked about this drug, because I didn't try it). I'm on Lamotrigine 100 by the way.
So it's about 6 day of Cymbalta 30 mg. I was scared about nausea/GI issues, but thankfully I hadn't it yet. But I have heavy mood swings. 3 days ago I've been talking with my teacher and started to cry in front of him. 2 days ago I've fallen in full blown hysterics: I've been crying very hard, blaming myself and had self harm thoughts. I feel irritated too.
Idk if it's normal and I shall endure it?
Any experiences with Cymbalta?"
I’m diagnosed type 1 but my doctor thinks I may be schizoaffective. It has added to an already stressful life for me. I know IBS has a stress component and I’m 99% sure I have IBS. I won’t go into detail but I’m pretty sure of it. Does anybody else have IBS here and could mental illness be a factor in why I have it?
I hate being on antipsychotics and only take Lamictal. It helps but still in a sense I feel practically unmedicated at times (like now). Things are very out of control for me and meeting with psych tomorrow. I don’t want to be on more medicine I hate how it makes me feel. Are there medicines that are taken as needed basically? When you feel a manic episode or mixed coming on you take it to cope. Or is this desperate thinking. Please help. I don’t want to be on them all the time.
I feel like its a medication problem and/or beginning of mania. I never took wellbutrin and lamictal together until recently and i think it is too much upping.
"Let’s just say all my credibility was destroyed after that. Thankfully, I changed companies but the shame and guilt stays on. 

Lets share some bizarre things you’ve done during your hypomanic episodes."
"This has been happening for years and years but it’s just now happening again and I want to ask. 

I’m not diagnosed for anything and am not on any medication/taking any drugs, completely sober. Haven’t been to any doctor in years either

Maybe like 3-4 times per year I get in this phase where I’m extremely energetic, irrational, fearless, etc. lasts for like 1-4 weeks. It’s like I’m on adderall or some sort of stimulant, constantly grinding my teeth.

Things happen like driving recklessly, spending lots of money on dumb things, doing/seriously considering doing things I normally wouldn’t do. Also being more direct to people with extreme confidence, 0 social anxiety, when I normally am pretty reserved. Also not eating much at all and feeling fine.

Again, completely sober, not taking any medication, and the feeling usually comes after I have been feeling sad/depressed for a while or something bad happens. Just wondering if anyone here has similar phases occasionally or if it’s something else/normal."
"it’s inevitable that every year on my birthday I get a little sad/let down. every year I tell myself it’ll be different and every year I’m wrong. my main way to express love is through acts of service/gifts. I was never one to have money like that but I do my best with what I have and to make the person feel special. I like to think I go above and beyond for my loved ones on their special days. especially my partner. I’ll do anything for my partner. 

this year wasn’t so great, and I’m trying to not see it that way but I feel I’m invalidating myself. I invalidate every negative mood I have & not allow justification to feel this way. I tell myself I’m overreacting. so let me explain. my
partner made me what I wanted for breakfast and dinner tonight. which I am eternally grateful for. he got me a card, and put little things I can pull out and give to him, like take care of the pup for the day, and things like that which is really cute.  

I’ve been with him for more than 5 years, so my love language is pretty clear. the moment I begin to tell myself negative things I get mad and counter by arguing (with myself) that at least I have someone to cook me breakfast and dinner and write me cards and that’s what matters. I’m not saying it’s expected, I’m saying I would already do those things for him and then some. that wouldn’t be *it* for me. 

we’re struggling financially, so then I tell myself I shouldn’t be upset for not getting a present because we need to be saving. I put his bday present on a card and I’m still paying it off months later, I’m good at making a decision and not thinking about money as much as I should. 

I feel selfish. and I’m mad I feel this way. I’m also upset I feel upset. I’m torn with telling myself to set expectations bc I’m a queen and deserve the world, but then bully myself internally and become a mute. 

please, don’t bully, I already do that enough to myself on a daily basis. I’m working on getting properly medicated. I’m trying. I just want to love my birthday, and then don’t. I feel like a JA for projecting my way to show affection onto others and expecting them to do the same. I’m learning, I’m trying. thanks for taking the time to hear me out, I’m always reluctant to speak my peace & never do."
im not on any other mood stabilizers and i cant sleep and i feel elevated asf my thoughts are racing so fast my pupils r huge as hell help
"I will be traveling out of the country in a few months which means I’ll be jumping 6 hours ahead. I’m wondering if anyone on here has done the same and how was it for you? I know how important it is to keep a good sleep schedule with bp, and I’m worried that it may throw me off and trigger an episode."
"Depressive and hypo/manic.

For me- depression, 4 years. Hypomanic, 9 months and counting (my psychiatrist is aware I’m taking my meds please don’t fret). Full blown mania, about a month before turning to a mixed episode.

I’m just up at 1230am (wonder why) and want to know what y’all’s experiences have been :)"
"I just feel like meds are controlling my life and i have no say in it. My family can tell when im not taking my meds because the mania is very noticiable. I just feel like life looses its colors, I used to feel everything so intense and now its muted down. Makes me depressed and i cant even cry because of the meds, I should feel better but I just feel like I have lost a treasure"
"Hi, how do you deal with intrusive thoughts?"
"I haven’t being depressed in a very long time, i am honestly so happy. For people who are struggling, I just want to say that it does get better."
When do you know its time to check yourself in for higher level of care?
"I'm having paranoia that when my husband moves here I will fall out of love with him and lose my mind if he lives here with me. I'm scared I'll randomly divorce him or he will leave me because of my bad anxiety. I have never had these intrusive thoughts about him before the past 5 years we've been in a relationship. My husband is absolute gem and I guess I'm having panic attacks about ruining the relationship and going crazy for no reason.


I went crazy on a ex for no reason but he wasn't a good guy. I guess I'm just terrified I'll do something crazy because of how bad my anxiety is."
"I was just approved for a drug study in TRD, I think it’s going to be esketamine! I’ve tried so long for ket treatment, but it’s an arm and a leg. Here’s to hoping I’m not placebo"
"I'm really confused about mania and hypomania. I've never had a situation where I ruined my life or acted extremely out of character. 

I do have 1-2 weeks at a time (usually around PMS) where I can't sleep, wake up with anxiety, extremely depressed, pessimistic, have lots of fun, am socially confident and energetic but with a short fuse and snap at my kids and husband a LOT. Sometimes I am lucky to get the confidence and energy - usually from caffeine or Adderall, sometimes without it. Sometimes it's just a spiraling depression and no ""boost"" in mood, but always agitation/irritability.

I'm typically pretty reserved but I do occasionally get very confident and drop my socially anxious ""mask"". 
For example, I introduced myself to a group chat of strangers that I'm hoping to meet up with soon by telling a self deprecating joke. Normally I'd never actually tell a joke unless feeling an extra boost of confidence and optimism in life. Is this a form of hypomania? 

Does hypomania include a mix of the following?:

-racing thoughts
-ruminating and anxiety filled thoughts -insomnia (although still very tired)
-Social confidence (I'm incredibly shy so I'm boosted to around a ""normal"" confident person) 
-major indecision on life choices (school, housing, pets, jobs, etc)"
"I have a major problem with focusing, like I can't even watch a movie without getting distracted after 2 minutes and forgetting what I was doing, everything I do like work feels like it takes years to complete and I can't stop daydreaming. My memory is horrible and never gets better. You might be tempted to say: ""That's ADHD"", but I don't have ADHD. These issues only started 4 years ago. Before that I had very good grades at school and could study for hours on end on just 5 hours of sleep and no caffeine. Is this normal? I feel like these issues are getting exponentially worse by being on antipsychotic drugs, especially the irritability, like I feel so dysphoric and anhedonic that I constantly snap at people."
"Sweet stability…nearly two whole months of levelheadedness, productivity, positivity, confidence in my medication. A few days ago I started to feel a little bummed out and fatigued but I thought it would pass since I’ve been solid on these meds. Today I couldn’t bring myself to shower, and then got a very simple answer wrong in my seminar and nearly started crying. That opened the floodgates and now all I can think about is how much of a failure I’m turning into, how hopeless I feel, how much my academic performance has deteriorated since last August, and how I’m just not good enough for what I want to do. I’m thinking about dying a lot, the most I have since I’ve started mood stabilizers. It’s excruciating and distracting and yet it seems like the only way out of this horrible horrible cycle. There’s nothing else I want to do or can even see myself doing but I’m obviously not capable of following the path to my career. I feel so isolated and trapped, I can’t even imagine a way to make things better or push through this slump. I want to be able to believe other people when they say they believe in me. I want to be good enough for my field. I just want all this bullshit inconsistency to end."
I’ve heard it’s not possible to keep your SSDI benefits and get married? Could someone provide some clarity around this please?
"I’ve been pushed up to 4.5 mg of vraylar a bout a month ago. I was iffy about taking my meds but I’ve been pretty consistent for the past 2 weeks . I feel wayyy better than I did the past few months . I was in a depressive episode and all of a sudden my mood shifted . Now I’ve been bumped up to 6mg to try to “balance “ the mania . My psychiatrist recommended this due to my symptoms . Lack of sleep , a lot of energy(which I like because it makes me productive) heavy intrusive thoughts and impulsive actions ( I have a spending problem ). Is anyone else on 6mg and If so how does it make you feel ? Because I feel fine on 4.5mg and I’m a-little concerned if 6mg is too much ."
"Hi everyone, I have bipolar II, ADHD, and anxiety, among other things.

For as long as I can remember, I've woken up 4-6 times per night. I always fall right back asleep, but my sleep is still interrupted. I always thought my waking up was normal, until I started talking about it with my therapist and psychiatrist. I just got the results of a sleep study I did, and it turns out I have mild sleep apnea.

I'm not looking forward to using a CPAP machine, but maybe it's for the best. I was just wondering, does anyone else here have sleep apnea, and use a CPAP machine? I've heard that exercise and losing weight can help as well (I have about 20 lbs to lose)."
"Title. I’m just a shell of myself without the SSRI at this point. I take it and my thoughts become warm again. My Doc mentioned this combination but initially I was worried about the irritability side of things, but since the stabilizer takes the anger and irritability away… seems like it might work. Hoping to hear from someone about this."
"someone use this combination?
ive taking those for like 2 years to prevent my manic and depressed episodes.
first was only divalproex 1000mg and lamictal 100mg, now my lamictal dosage is 200mg and ive started to have some weird simptons like muscular weakness, memory loss, dizziness, and increased a LOT the stomach pain from divalproex.
and i feel like my brain isn't absorbing informations like before, i fell so dumb and  unproductive. this is crushing my self esteem (more than usually)
so i've made a quick research and found that this combination is dangerous, but 2 different doctors recommended this combination so i dont know if is bad or not"
"I was (mis)diagnosed with bipolar some 1.5 years ago and started eating Lamictal. Went through a more thorough evaluation of my mental state with another psych recently and she told me (like I suspected) that I'm actually not bipolar and we made a plan to taper off Lamictal.

I was on 200mg for ~10 months and am supposed to go down 50mg every two weeks. It's day 2 of 150mg atm and I'm noticing I feel foggy and exhausted in the evenings. I've also noticed some minor tingling in my feet and hands.

Can someone who went through this let me know what kind of 6 weeks I have infront of me?"
"I work at a (very) small company that receives partial funding from a University. We work on campus, and I usually get the University's 1€ meal at noon.

This summer, the campus's restaurant will close, and I will have to either buy all noon meals (making it 4-7€ per meal), or cook all my meals and bring them at work.

Today I asked the university for extra budget (250€) to cover my meals during the summer, and I mentioned that as my personal budget is not unlimited, if I will have to start cooking my own meals it will ""prove difficult because of my handicap"".

I have a legal recognition of my handicap (bp 1), and I already have other work accommodations in place (like flexible working hours, absences, etc).

As soon as I sent the email, though, I felt illegitimate in mentioning my handicap as a justification. I felt like I was stretching it... you know?

Though, cooking is so much effort, and I already struggle with cooking dinner every day...

What are your thoughts?
Was it a stretch to ""play the handicap card"" to higher my chances of getting the budget?
Have you heard of work accommodations regarding meals?"
"The good days for me are so rare. I feel like I live most of my days just waiting for the inevitable bad things that will happen. I think about my parents getting old and dying, how I will eventually die, how my dogs will die. 

I think about how I’ll probably never find love or have kids. How I’ll always be on disability and will probably never have a fulfilling career again. 

I just keep thinking all of these bad things and no amount of therapy or medication seems to help. 

I live everyday through my screen. I’m okay until I remember my own life, and how it’s not anywhere near being okay compared to a lot of people.

Idk. I’m rambling. I think I’ll always just be a shit person. My 30s feels too late to change virtually everything about my life. 

I just feel sad and alone."
"so i'm diagnosed type 1, and i'm the kinda guy who cannot take antidepressants because they'll make me think the government is reading my mind. so when i've been having issues with lithium leaving me suicidally depressed and not...really working for the depression side of things, my psych has been very hesitant to give me antidepressants for obvious reasons. we decided that we would try and treat part of the issue, which is the lithium-induced depression making me unable to function (and thus making the depression worse). and so i was put on adderall like...a month and a half ago?

as expected, my sleep got worse but i started being able to function again. a few days ago, i actually quit the lithium as i was starting to plan my suicide and the adderall clearly hadn't helped with the suicidality at all. so back to the drawing board on fixing the depression issue. my psych said i could try the adderall alone to see what it does, with the stipulation that i quit immediately or resume the lithium if it starts making me manic. i figured it was worth at least seeing how it worked without the lithium so i'd have an idea of it for future med combos. 

and i immediately started getting 8+ hours of sleep a night again. which seems to suggest it was either something about the combo, or about the \*lithium\* that was making me lose sleep. obviously i am still mood tracking, but the whole situation seems very odd. the two meds seem to be interacting with me in ways they really should not. adderall is helping me feel more relaxed and get more sleep, where lithium made me more suicidal and restless. i've had lithium before in the past--it always makes me violently suicidal, which people have told me is the opposite of what it should be doing. and now i get adderall making me sleep more, which again seems like the opposite of what should be happening. i discontinued lithium and went from 5-6 hours of sleep per night to wanting to sleep for 10 hours like. IMMEDIATELY. with just adderall.

i can't possibly have \*only\* ADHD, since i've had psychosis in the past both in reaction to antidepressants and independently of them. my mania tracks too well with symptoms of mania to be a mistaken symptom. but now i'm wondering if a comorbidity of ADHD could mean that meds are reacting very oddly with me. i am overall med-sensitive, as well, but i would figure that would make meds react too strongly, rather than the opposite action of what they're supposed to do.

so i'm kind of at a loss. i'm going to give the adderall a few more days to see if it's just a fluke, or if i'm resting better bc the suicidal urges have gone, but i'll be definitely reaching out to talk to my psych about this because we both expected that discontinuing the lithium would mean having to quit the adderall due to stimulant-induced mania. this seems really weird.

has anyone else had meds seem to do the opposite of what they're meant for?"

"I've been on medication/stable since 2020 and I always had my ups and downs, but I feel like I'm spiraling after being fired and I'm scared I'm going to dig myself into a hole I can't get out of. I don't feel like I'm going to do anything drastic, but the thought is there and I just feel so hopeless. I feel like such a fucking failure. I work so fucking hard and I have nothing to show for it. In 2019 I graduated college and I have not been able to find a single job in my field. I've applied to hundreds of jobs and I hear from less than a quarter of them.

"Previous post: https://old.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1150vx9/i_think_im_gonna_stop_taking_my_meds/

I saw my doctor yesterday and told her how I was feeling. She said she thinks some of my symptoms are related to the fact that I stopped drinking 45 days ago, but she understands my frustrations with lithium and my moods. We're working on changing my meds, with the eventual goal that I will get to come off lithium and reduce other drugs once I achieve stability, to find what works best for me.

I'm relieved she's really listening to me, and understands how painful I find living a straight edge life, and that I want to get to try psychedelics safely. She also gave me consent to consume marijuana in very small quantities like once a month. I don't like marijuana much, but I appreciate being able to do one thing once in awhile, it really helps with my social anxiety about being judged for my health issues.

Anyways, just wanted to let you all know that I listened to all of you, that I've been taking my meds faithfully, and that I even switched back to taking them in the morning because I find a huge difference in my moods when I take it in the morning."
"Seal the gates,

"I am 31M and cry probably every 1-3 days when depressed. I may cry for a few minutes or even an hour, sometimes more.

"Hey everyone, I got put on lamictal about a month ago to treat BP2 and I thought it’s been working well. But I realized last weekend how incredibly tired it has made me. I sprained my knee a few days after I started the lamictal, so I just thought the exhaustion was from my injury healing. But now I am unsure.

I have been sleeping 13+ hours a day and still not feeling rested or energized. Whenever I do anything it wipes me out and I can’t do anything else for the entire day. It’s gotten so bad that I haven’t been going to class or doing my homework because I can’t get out of my bed. Has this happened to anyone else? And if so what was your solution to it?"
I take adderall so I can’t smoke weed or they’ll take my script. Right now I’ve been trying Hydroxyzine 50mg 3x/day and it’s been good as a preventive from having a panic attack but it doesn’t really do anything else. I’m still anxious all the time only now a little more sleepy. I’m constantly irritable because of my anxiety and it’s exhausting.
"I have very treatment resistant major depression/anxiety(gene testing helped confirm this) caused by an unknown mental illness. I show a combination of symptoms that have my psychiatrist lost as to what exactly it could be.

I just started lithium as a last ditch effort before we go towards more experimental treatments. (ketamine or TMS)

Is it possible to feel effects the first day of taking it or am  I experiencing a placebo effect from just starting it?

Also I'm a bit weary of the medication and would like to hear others experiences with the medication. Thanks."
"I'm on 3 kind of meds, Seroquel (50mg), Prozac (20mg), Adderall (30mg). I couldn't find and buy the adderall so I went a week without it. Some things happened but I can't tell if it was some kind of episode or just intense withdrawal.

At first, it was extreme fatigue but I still couldn't sleep. All fucking day, I was miserable. As days passed I became so depressed and I felt intense hopelessness.
Crying for hours kind of depressed,  being constantly suicidal kind of depressed.

I drank half a bottle of cologne, it was impulsive, I wasn't thinking about suicide, but I still did it. I have no idea why I did it, still.


When I did find the Adderall, jesus christ, I was craving it, after taking it I talked about lymphosarcomata for an hour straight, non stop. That burned my brain I just layed down till I passed the hell out.

I was feeling good, so I just want to know if I'm getting bad again or it was just withdrawal ot something like that."

"Bipolar is so widely misunderstood in the world, and the medical community is hardly any better. I live in a developing country and we don't exactly have the best doctors in the world. I've had bad experiences with so many of them just being incompetent, refusing to listen, and relying on old/wrong data they learned decades ago.

I'm going to a new doctor today. He's not recommended by anyone, because anyone who comes recommended has a 1 year long waiting list. 

And I have to trust this man with my life? My literal life? What if he gives me the wrong meds and I have a psychotic break I can never recover from. What if he doesn't listen to me, and take me off the meds I already know are working for me. What if he thinks I'm a know-it-all because I dared to google my own condition... so many of them resent my having just the most basic knowledge about MY body and MY brain. 

I'm terrified. But I have tried for a decade to manage this on my own and it's not working. I need to let go and trust somebody. Please, please let this be the right decision."
"I'm afraid that treating one side is always going to push me to the other. 

Like things were great in the beginning, but now that I'm no longer in a depressive episode my those same meds that helped me get there are starting to make me hypomanic.

Is there a possibility of staying stable for a substantial amount of time. Say... more than 3-ish months?"
"To have bipolar is to never feel safe in the confines of your own skull. 

It’s never trusting yourself, or your thoughts. 

It’s losing the trust of the people you care about most in the world. 

It’s exercising self-control so well that people think you’re doing better than you are. 
“I don’t think you actually have a problem.” 
“You don’t seem to struggle with ____.”
While also being told to try to have more self control. 
When all you do is try to control yourself. 
Until you can’t. 
And what you’re able to control and what you are not able to control ends up making you look like an asshole. Or self-absorbed. Or insensitive. 
And the spiraling starts. 
And the guilt. 
And the anger. 
And the sadness. 
“If I stopped trying so hard would you believe what it feels like inside of my head?” 
“If I tried harder would I be cured?” 

Am I failing or am I thriving in spite of what is? 

And then the “normal” days come. And I gaslight myself. I think “I’m not really that bad.” I feel healthy. I feel happy and enthusiastic without the reason being mania. Or I can handle stress or heartache without falling into depression. 
So I think, maybe they’re right. “I’m not mentally ill. I’m not that bad.” 

Until I wake up with intrusive thoughts. Pure nonsense the second my eyes blink open. The self-control kicks in. 
“What’s wrong?” They ask. 
“Nothing.” I say to them. 
And I try to mold myself into an illusion of okayness. Maybe an illusion so convincing that I’ll believe it myself."

I’ve been on lithium for 9 years 1500mg I’m getting off it for medical reasons and switching to lamictal. This process started a week ago and I have only decreased by 300mg and I had to go to the ER today on my lunch because I felt dizzy and like I was going crazy that’s the only way I could explain it I could not calm down. I don’t feel like myself and I’m only in on this a week out of 3-6 months he said (wanted to take it slow because of how long I’ve been on it). My lithium level came back .5mg it’s never been that low. I just don’t no how to to feel.

"Just got discharged from inpatient yet again, but the doctor pretty much told me that I'm all out of luck and that hopefully therapy can help me. I'm diagnosed Bp 1 w/ psychotic fx, but the mania and psychosis hasn't been a problem at all for years, save for one brief mixed episode due to med adjustments. I've just been stuck in this depressive pit that doesn't cease for what seems like two years now, no remission of symptoms or breaks in between, it's like I'm just constantly depressed without any more cycling. I do nothing but cry in bed all day unable to do anything, and I've had three very serious attempts in the past year and a half. Dunno how tf I'm supposed to consistently engage in therapy when I can barely manage to eat every day or not cry, it seems I just wake up wanting to die without any situations/circumstances or irrational cognitions that I need to correct, like it just seems so chemical.

The only time I've had stability since diagnosis was on Symbyax, which lasted about a year, but I couldn't believe how magical it felt to finally be myself again. But it suddenly pooped out and I went straight back to the depression without any warning, and re-introducing it two future times to 15mg/80mg did nothing.  Lamictal 300mg didn't help, Seroquel XR 400mg didn't help, Vraylar 4.5mg didn't help and gave me horrible akathisia, Lithium fucked my thyroid and gave me horrible acne which worsened my BDD, and Latuda 40mg actually seemed to help but the akathisia+sense of panic it gave me at night was so horrible I couldn't whiteknuckle through it anymore (I gave it about a month but I was banging my head and running around screaming). 20mg had tolerable akathisia but absolutely no effect on me. And Caplyta is $900 for 15 days with Medicaid. I just feel absolutely fucked. But ofc there's a million fucking anti-manic meds produced, and while the Depakote keeps that in check for me how tf is it that a condition where the majority of patients spend more time depressed than manic only have like 5 bipolar depression meds developed? Are we merely an inconvenience, a rabid genetic deformity that needs to be put down with anti-manics to keep us from getting too high to cause trouble for the normal ppl? Meanwhile if we wanna kill ourselves we can go fuck right off, it's our problem?

I'm thinking of retrying some of my old shit and just whiteknuckling through side effects (even the Lithium acne if I can get my OCD/BDD in check through ERP therapy), but if that doesn't work it seems all I got left is going back to ECT, or trying TMS and esketamine. But I can't help but feel gutted and hopeless, at first I looked at recovering as a ""when"" but lately it seems like a wishful ""if"". I just can't live like this anymore."
"Besides therapy, medication, and hospitalization, I'm having a hard time finding things on the internet that can be done to stay in control during a manic episode. I'm dealing with one right now and I cannot afford to let it disrupt my life more than it's already doing. 

Things I've been doing that help me:

-Stretching

-Short walks

-Cold air (it's winter, so going outside)

-Talking to people

-""Box"" breathing

-Taking frequent notes and observations of my symptoms/what I'm doing (helps me stay aware)

-When I'm driving I literally coach myself out loud to drive the speed limit

-Listening to my favorite calming music (opera/choral)

-I pray when I am manic. It feels good but I've also been warned not to overdo it...



What do you do that helps?"
"Hi, 27F here diagnosed with bp 1 for 8 years now. I make good money for myself but my bank accounts never have reflected it. I've had money issues all my life on and off meds. My impulsive spending always gets the best of me. 

Why I was 18 I was addicted to sex during mania times but have quit that behavior long ago. I never realized how when it comes to shopping there's just I gotta have it or I won't shop for what I want for many months. 

Right now I'm manic for the 1st time in months but hopefully this abilify can help. So please does anyone have tips?"
"You could describe the impairments during depression, mania, mixed, and/or anything else."
Mine just suddenly started when I turned 25. I distinctly remember the day I started having problems mentally. Growing up I never had any problems and was stable up until I wasn’t. Does anyone else have the same experience or has mental health always been kind of a problem for you?
i’m about to start taking vraylar and i’m wondering what others experience are with the drug?
"Cause I know for me- 21 years experience and 10 times hospitalized…
“ The first thing that goes on the path to mania is sleep.”"
"Now i can properly address symptoms of adhd that i had before turning 17 (21 now). I'm full of life, but very distracted. Talkative, but mostly productively so! I've been going for walks day after day (wanna go for miles)... All this, after years of locking myself up at my pc simply consuming trash. Doctors dismissed all of it as me being autistic (Asperger's doesn't imply low ability). So yeah I've been backseat driving my psychiatrist and eventually he meandered his way to prescribing me Lamotrigine (I know that many over here relate to this).  


On my way to loving the world more!!"
Hey y’all. I love my anti psychotic. It literally saved my life. I have noticed tho that I haven’t had a crush since I started it over five years ago. Every time I think I have a crush I get the ick real fast. For a second I thought I was aromantic but before I was on the meds I had crushes and sex on a regular basis. Is it possible that my anti psychotic is causing my brain to not feel romance and sexual attraction in the same way as before?
"I’ve been on Lexapro, Wellbutrin, and Abilify for three years and it has been great for me. It literally saved my life. Allowed me to get the amazing job I have now since I was stable and I am handling a fairly big workload decently well. It’s been so great for my life, marriage, and friendships. 

Then, Abilify was starting to cause issues including a lot of gained weight. After lots of tests my psychiatrist took me off Abilify and had me start Lamictal. 

I feel so fucked up. My head is heavy. I’ve had a headache for days, and it’s been a couple of days now where I’ve had moderately blurry vision. My body feels shitty and I’m tired. I’ve been going back and forth between not sleeping at all and sleeping a lot, both for 24-48 hours at a time. Feeling like nothing is real. Nauseated. I cried some days for hours. Also was super hypersexual and felt shameful about it. (Something about feeling guilty that I would desire pleasure at such a vulnerable and unpleasant time?)

I’ve been taking sick days at work and I’ve tried to return three times. Each time I can only last half of the day before becoming completely useless. Then I’m exhausted for days. For every step forward, it’s two steps back. 

This illness is so stupid.

I filed for short term disability since I clearly can’t handle it at this time. I had to do this at my last job too, after about a year. I feel so guilty and feel like a fraud for needing to use this benefit, even though I’d rather take time to rest and go back to work and be able to handle my shit. My fear is going back to work and messing up or performing so badly that it causes issues anyway. Even when I did go on leave the last time, nobody outside of work knew except my husband. I don’t want people to think I’m lazy when I’m really struggling to do basic crap and can’t remember anything…

I’m sure a lot of y’all can relate.

I hate the lack of capacity I have now compared to how I used to be. :("
"Hello everyone. I’m having kinda a rough night and currently the people in my life can’t talk so I need a space to express my thoughts.

So I’ve been on lithium for a couple months and so far it’s been great. I’m doing so much better. I’m so stable. I’m like actually happy like a good bit of the time. I can function well and my schoolwork has been so much easier.

But I’m fucking terrified. I’m so scared that it’s not gonna last. I’m so scared I’m gonna go back. I haven’t felt this good in like six or seven years and I forgot what it was like. I forgot how this felt. I forgot I had hobbies. I loved trying new things. I don’t wanna loose this I’m so scared. Like the further I get from the date I started this medicine, the more worried I get. I feel like I’m just waiting for the spiral. I so afraid of becoming who I was and being in that place again. Like I don’t know how to process being stable long term because I don’t trust it. I don’t think I’ve ever been more than six months without an episode

Yeah I’m just having a hard time tonight and couldn’t talk to anyone so thanks for listening if you did.

EDIT: I was able to talk to one of my buds and am feeling a little better. Hope everyone has a good night"
"I’m having surgery in a very sensitive place. I’m so fucking scared. I’m on meds and somewhat stable, actually the most stable I’ve been in a while. But I have an immense amount of anxiety and fear on a good day. 
My surgery is next month. I’m terrified of the day of surgery and I’m afraid I will be sobbing and having panic attacks up until they put me under. I’m also terrified for after surgery. My surgery is bc I have a lump near my rectum. I know, gross and awkward to say. It’s going to be terrible to be in pain in that place and have to go to the bathroom will be gnarly. My fear is that the experience of suffering so much physically in such a sensitive place will send me over the edge. How can I get through this?"
Can eating trigger hypomania?
"Hi. I'm a young adult from the Philippines (cannot disclose my city to protect my privacy) who has been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder Type 1 a decade ago. I get injected with Abilify maintena once a month, and I see my psychiatrist and psychologist monthly or as needed. I'm fortunate enough to have a fantastic support system-- great, genuine friends and understanding family members. However, my problem is that I cannot seem to hold a job for longer than 8 months.


For context, I graduated from college 5 years ago but did not start seeking work until after 2020. My parents run several businesses (Cannot disclose the natures of business since I want to stay private/anonymous) however, their lines of business are not within my interests, hence I have been seeking for work externally, beyond what my parents are willing to offer me. 

I have started a small side-business of my own (cannot disclose to protect my privacy) however, the income that I earn from it is not enough. To make things clear, my parents are still supporting me but I want to learn how to be independent as they won't be around forever.

I have never been fired, but I wasn't regularized by my first two employers and the reasons they gave to me were that I couldn't match up to their expectations for the job.

I am now with my third employer and I have recently been regularized but I was told by my supervisor that I should improve my performance or they would lay me off if they do not see an improvement within 2 months.

To clarify things, I always do the best I can in every job that I undertake and I feel frustrated about myself because no matter what I do, my best doesn't seem to be good enough for any of my employers. Is there something wrong with me?

I know that I can always accept work offers from my parents at their companies as a fallback or last-resort, and I recognize the privilege I possess to have a safety net, but before doing that, I want to exhaust all that I can and find a job that I could stick to.

To quote Taylor Swift, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world."
"And this is something my mental health team have noticed and they seem to be really concerned by it. I'm not though. I'm also sleeping between 3 and 5 hrs a night. 
Maybe they think I'm going to become manic?"
I cut bald soot in middle of my head so now i look like 70yo man. I also did couple piercings myself
"I'm stable again and everything is so fucking boring. I'm shattering, it's so boring. I usually am bored when at baseline. I just get so angry and feel so violent. I want to destroy my life. I can't manage to do my assignments for uni and I can't bring myself to care. I forgot what my normal feels like. I want to be reckless, fuck everything. Everything is so boring. Boredom feels worse than anything. I just want to feel something other than anger. Other emotions are fleeting, only there in a moment. I don't know how I'm supposed to make them stay.

Before, before i developed bipolar it was just how i was. I didn't feel that strongly, and it was fine. Good enough. That's years ago now. I don't know how i managed to function or do anything at all like that. I don't know how to be responsible. I was so responsible before. I did things so well. I don't understand. How am i not supposed to throw it all away? It's taking everything not to be impulsive. 

I want to drop out. Even though my choice of field is a very rational and good choice that will help me down the road, i still want to throw it all away. It's just three years, and I'll have something to fall back on. Something that'll give me flexibility and an income. Yet I can't bring myself to care. I don't know how I'm supposed to get through it. The me from before is gone, and this new me knows nothing at all."
"In 2022 I was placed in a psych ward 4x. One of those times being for 1 month. Before last year I had never been. 

I don’t think I will ever recover from my manic episode, which lasted around 6 months. 

I’m having a real problem with flashbacks on things I did while manic. There are things I’ve done that cannot be reversed. I start seeating a lot and my heart beats so fast that I start to feel sick. 

It seems that medication and therapy aren’t helping when it comes to these flashbacks. I wince at them and I can’t help but call myself fucking stupid or a loser. I still can’t believe I did the things I did. I’m beyond embarrassed and I’m just really having trouble coping with it. 

What are some ways you deal with this if familiar? Have you learned any specific tips in therapy?

I think I need to change my anxiety medication (I take buspar but it’s not working). I’m on lamotrigine but wondering what I can add instead of buspar. 

I feel like I’ve lost myself and I’m not sure what to do anymore."
"I’ve been on lithium and lamotrigene for many years and i decided to add Wellbutrin to the mix a month ago for seasonal depression.  So far, I think it’s helping.  Anyone on this combo?"
Kinda nervous about posting but I think I need some support around this. I feel like my hypersexuality is affecting me and my relationship. How do you cope with the urges? The constant perversed thoughts? We talked about slowing down our sexual intimacy and focusing on non sexual forms of intimacy which is great. I've just felt kinda numb and like not present recently when we've been intimate and I'd like to get back to a place where it feels exciting. I'm trying to limit the amount of porn/sexual content I look at. My sex drive is also really high (I take testosterone for HRT) but it's always been on the higher end probably due to trauma? Idk I just feel ashamed that I let this part of me affect my relationship so much that it's overwhelming my partner. I feel embarrassed and I want to enjoy sex but I want to do healthier. I masturbate pretty frequently too so I've been trying to to limit/go a day or two without it. I just want to feel in control again. I guess any advice or encouragement would be great? I'm in therapy and on medication and I have some coping skills I've been utilizing but I just wonder if there's anything more I can do?
"I always wonder if I’m just a little cry baby.

I get overwhelmed easily and when I do it’s very uncomfortable. I consistently feel dizzy, disoriented, (but not dissociation. Kind of like when you have a fever or a migraine) i wind up crying crying, feeling like I may pass out, things start to look wobbly (not full blown hallucinations, I have those too but I have to be real bad for those to happen), and I just need to close myself off for a while. When I’m like this I’m prone to feeling sad because others dislike me (which…They don’t…I’m imagining this), paranoia about being under surveillance or victim to some grand scheme that I can’t control, and passively suicidal. (I want to reiterate that it is PASSIVE, I’m not planning). I get migraines, frequent diarrhea, and will sometimes vomit.

This happens 2-3 times per year for 3-6 weeks. Sometimes more, but that’s only if there are external stressors. Unfortunately I can’t work a job because I wind up in this state. I wind up stumbling around like a drunk person and eventually getting full blown visual, olfactory, and auditory hallucinations.

I don’t know if this is my disorder or if I’m just weak or if there’s something else wrong with me? I don’t know.

I’m not asking for medical advice, but I’m just hoping someone can point me in the direction of something to explore. I literally can’t go to a group anxiety clinic that I’m pretty sure I need because I can’t leave the house on my own or for extended periods. I hate living like this…I went out for a few hours yesterday and today it’s been ramped up to like a 7 to an 8/10. Such small things that should not be a problem.

There is nothing physically wrong with me that could cause this."
"hi guys, i haven't had an honest to god mixed episode in a really long time so I have some questions. does anyone's cognition struggle? i have a diagnosed cognitive impairment already but ive improved a lot in sobriety. but today i went shopping (and spent a lot despite knowing i just lost my job) and on my way home completely blacked out for a little bit and suddenly was realizing i was in the middle of two lanes and about to run a stop sign in my neighborhood. getting home, i drove into the garage door after forgetting to put it up. i saw it, noticed, just kept going i dont know why. i was diagnosed with adhd when i was 10 but i dont often have moments where i legitimately cannot remember the prior minute or so. 

also... does anyone find themselves stealing while mixed/manic? i was in a store with my mom and picked out some earrings and then some clothes to try on. my mom is willing to buy me things like clothes especially when im struggling with money as long as it's reasonable and she wouldve bought me the earrings as they were fairly inexpensive. but i was like. i could put these in my pocket. so i did. i understand stealing when its basic necessities that can't be afforded but i do not have a reason to steal especially not something like earrings that i can live without. i just keep doing things when i realize that i can. im trying to calm down and do some writing or anything to keep my mind occupied because im very anxious and paranoid lately. hope everyone's well!"
I'm so bored it feels like my brain is melting
"Hi. I hate my meds (lamotrigine and sertraline). I don't want to be on either of them. I take them intermittently because the side effects of lamotrigine fuck me up (stutter is back!). My dose is also very small - 25mg, meant to be twice a day but I forget so tend to just take it once.  I never tapered up, as I moved doctors and then they just seemingly never gave me the right information. When I asked about it, I got told to keep doing what I was doing. I said I was on a very low dose and they just ignored it. I also went off the sertraline because I grind my teeth on it and my dentist said I need to stop doing it, plus I am not depressed.

I'm effectively unmedicated. Thing is, my doctor doesn't know about this because well, I can't tell them. I don't have a psychiatrist and I only see a GP once a year who weighs me, tells me to lose a stone, and tells me to cope with side effects. Not seen a psychiatrist since 2017 (not for want of trying). I had a medication review and I said I hated the side effects but was told to just deal with it, which wasn't useful. I would like to discuss this with a doctor but it's very hard to get appointments.

I suppose: how can I tell my GP I'm unmedicated? They don't seem to actually care about my health. I know I can taper myself up on lamotrigine slowly and carefully, but I don't want to (lol) because I hate it so much. I cannot think of words. I stutter. My brain is slow. I feel stupid and stulted.

Wondering if I even need medication at all? I've been doing this for about 3 years and only had one hypomanic episode and it was fine once I took some of my old quetiapine. I haven't been on quetiapine for about 5 years but I hung onto it to take it PRN if my mood lurches. I know this isn't sensible, really. But the doctors won't listen to me. I am trying.

Edit: I tried to make the point to them, that even my FULL prescribed dose is not therapeutic, and they said “the prescribing doctor told you what to do”. I said well, I was manic, and that was several years ago, so can it be reassessed? Because I obviously never titrated up to a therapeutic dose! And now I don’t know how to. 

And they said no lol

I found out 3 years in too that lamotrigine can make the contraceptive pill less effective and nobody told me. Luckily I didn’t get pregnant but only found out when a pharmacist asked me if I was aware of the side effect! And no I was not!"
Hello everyone I’m currently going through a depressive episode and I was wondering if is supposed to be as long as my last manic phase. Thanks in advance for reading this

"For about 2 months I was in a terrible dark depression. But I had a 3 week long international trip planned which I almost didn’t go but I did! And it was stressful, exhausting and amazing. I just got back last night and the jet lag is hiding me so hard. The last week of the trip I was staying in hostels and had crappy roommates so I haven’t gotten a good nights rest in at least 7 days and traveling almost 20 hours yesterday on top of it. I got myself to sleep at 11pm last night and I woke up at 4am and have been awake ever since. I’m starting to get super jittery and flooded with impulsive thoughts and having moments of excitement. Nothing crazy tho, but definitely a slight mood change. Has anyone experienced this with jet lag and traveling? I’m back to work today so I can’t try to sleep and I’m only on a really low dose mood stabilizer right now. Should I contact my doctors or just see how the next week plays out?"
"I started a little depressive episode a bit ago and have since withdrew myself from everyone i know, including my partner. I’m so irritated with everything they do or don’t do i can’t stand it, but the long i’m away the less i feel about them. And it’s scary bc i love him, but i dont know what to do especially since if i tell him all of this he’ll take it personally and get real upset, but it’s literally nothing personal it’s just my episode"

"I’ve been manic since the beginning of the year after six months of depression. In mania, I’m very health conscious. I stay hydrated, eat clean, workout religiously, and live a very healthy lifestyle (no drugs, drinking or smoking). Unfortunately, I have really worn my body out this time and have contracted a bad upper respiratory infection (not Covid) that has caused me to completely lose my voice. I’m on strict bed rest until further notice, but I’m manic and sitting still is like laying in a bed of needles during a severe earthquake. Working out is one of my biggest outlets when manic. I typically workout for 3 hours every day, most of it cardio on the treadmill. When I’m on the treadmill doing HIIT, I feel like I can finally keep up with my racing manic mind, it’s very therapeutic and keeps me sane. 

I’m struggling this morning sitting at my kitchen island sobbing as I write this thinking about how I’m ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED to 'slow down' even the slightest bit because I can’t go back into a depressive episode right now. What am I supposed to do?"

"I have spent over half my life watching as my disorder has been used and abused by a society that belittles and ignores the legitimate needs of the mentally ill and vulnerable and disabled.

Yet the moment so-called healthy people are facing legal troubles all of a sudden they have Bipolar 1 or 2 and need care.

I am so fed up with society raiding the mental health services for terms and resources when they want them, to be misused and misinterpreted to win an argument or worse snidely using"" You need therapy!""  as a trump card or misdirection, while those of us living with them are always scrambling for insurance and the right care!

I've been dealing with Bi-polar disorder since I was a teenager, and I am perpetually angry over how terms and skills specifically designed for treatment and therapy for mental health  are taken out of context by others to win arguments!

This is why no one is willing  to Go To Therapy, not to heal themselves, or save a relationship or face trauma because society has wrenched therapy from its actual tenants and purpose.

What Therapy is Not:

A place to win arguments.

A system designed for you to abuse or misuse another person for being mentally ill.

Using a persons' health issue as a stepping stone.

People will not engage in therapy with another person if they believe they will not get a fair evaluation or honest feedback.

Also, no ethical therapist can evaluate and diagnosis  any person with a medical disorder or condition If They Have Never  Ever Met, the person and treated them professionally either in private practice or group therapy or know them personally.

If you've read books and studies or articles on mental illness it does not mean you are now qualified to diagnosis other people with medical skill and acuity even if you are convinced  someone else has a disorder, because of how they act,  that does not mean they have it.

Is anyone else sick of fake professionals?"
"i am bipolar II. what i want from this post is to hear others experiences with bipolar depressive episodes.

for months now i have felt like i’m in a depressive episode and i can’t snap out of it. i feel happy in small doses when something happens that makes me happy, or i don’t really have feelings when i’m working and distracted. i use to love taking a shower, doing my makeup, skincare, taking care of myself, now it feel’s impossible to take a shower most days. i loved just standing there in the hot water, now i can’t wait to get out. i’m not interested in anything anymore, i live in a constant state of boredom when i’m not busy. i have always had such a passion for music and now i just skip through ever song until i get angry that i can’t find anything to listen to so i turn it off. i come home from work and sit in silence because my fiancé is currently at school due to the army so i’m home alone and i don’t want to listen or watch anything. i drink daily because a. i have an issue b. i like it and c. it sometimes makes it so i can do something other than sitting in silence. at this point i feel so depressed but at the same time i feel nothing at all"
"As a general rule, most people with Bipolar have to be on medications for life.  The idea of [Big Pharma](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2023/02/19/prescription-drugs-placebos-and-harmful-effects-unlocking-big-pharmas-secrets.html?utm_source=share-bar&utm_medium=user&utm_campaign=user-share) is pretty prevalent in our society, the idea primarily being that these drugs often do more harm than good, and this is on purpose so that people keep trying medications to get better when there are other, healthier, options out there like a clean diet, CBD oil, etc.  


I have had a lot of people bring up the idea of Big Pharma when having discussions about medication for mental illness.  I am of the opinion that people should only be on them if there are no other options, BUT I am not a huge believer in Big Pharma.  I mean, Lithium is still the gold standard for treating Bipolar, but it is a pretty inexpensive medication.  If Big Pharma was truly a thing, they would try to stop Doctors from prescribing Lithium, but it remains top of the list for a typical Bipolar presentation.  


So I am curious about other people's opinions - As someone with Bipolar, what are your thoughts on the pharmaceutical industry?"

But I’m too fucking depressed to do anything. I called in a state of depersonalization and he sounded annoyed. He said I should be sitting with my emotions for no more than 15 minutes and he’s going to have to be extra vigilant on reminding me that. I wish I could have fun.

Now at week 8 and not noticing much dulling. 

Does anyone else have better experiences? I’m trying to see if I should switch to something else. 

I also noticed alcohol was almost intolerable weeks 1-3 and now makes me want to drink a ton with no hangover."
"I was in denial about my diagnosis at first but have come round to accept it. 100% bipolar. my only qualm is that because I've been manic once I'm automatically type 1 when I identify with type 2 so much more due to the resistant depression. but my mania which has only happened once and became psychotic was brought on by extreme sleep deprivation and antidepressants. likewise when I was hypomanic only the one time ever, it was due to my antidepressants going up. in my ""natural"" state before diagnosis was never manic. manic states only seems to occur in response to me taking antidepressants. whereas before antidepressants I was depressed and during antidepressants I continue to be depressed. does this make sense to anyone? I feel like I'm bipolar 1.5 or something. when I go to support groups and hear of people unmedicated and manic going missing etc. I cannot compute or relate because mania isn't a regular normal thing for me, clinical depression is. in the past 4 years of being diagnosed bipolar I was manic once and hypomanic once. instead of upping my antidepressants which made me hypo we added an additional mood stabiliser which has helped a bit but I'm constantly crashing nonetheless. the best mood I've managed only lasts several weeks then I'm low again."
"First time posting on here, so please forgive me. 
I was diagnosed with post birth bipolar (a lot more downs than manic episodes) after I had my ds in late 2021. I was coping as best as I could, considering I had just started medication. 
We moved house in August 2022, and my mental health began to decline and in November 2022, I attempted to take my own life. 
My husband has taken time off of work to help me get better, as a lot of the time I have been absolutely useless. I went through a phase where being around our babies scared me, as I was worried something bad would happen (like a freak accident). 
We have been waiting about a year for a specific job to come out, which he is more than qualified for and he desperately wants. Somehow, everyone at work sort of knows what's going on at home. 
The job came out a few weeks ago, and a few days ago he went for an interview. They were very impressed with his cv, and said the interview went very well, but they did ask about him being off of work and what was going on at home. We got a call later that day to say he didn't get the job, and we feel its because he is off of work with me at the moment.
We aren't going to do anything about it, as it's just a feeling we have and nothing to actually go on, plus he wants to apply next time around. 
I just feel horrific. Not only have I put him through hell with having to help with the kids more, and him dealing with me being depressed, but now I have ruined his chances of getting his dream job"

"I just started it, and it seems like a lot of people have problems with it. I’m taking 300mg along with 250mg of Lamictal, as well as a dose of Metformin for the Seroquel. I’ve not noticed any sleepiness, although my dreams have been stronger, and semi lucid. I’ve definitely noticed constipation, and may have noticed some ED. But I think that last part may be due to life events. Otherwise this drug has been helping me quite a bit. I seem to notice the effects of antipsychotics quickly. I’m glad this one hasn’t given me any movement disorders other than bowel…"
"Some people just don't get it, right?!?

It's been over a year since my diagnosis and I've come a long way, but I've had to do most of it alone. I'm tired of being lonely and not having anyone to talk to after a rough day. Or to celebrate on good days. I'd like to think I would be a good friend, who truly listens and wants to support you as best as I can. Plus someone who has a good sense of humor so we can laugh together and be silly as well as serious at times.

Part of my issue is that I have spotty wifi to use with my laptop and the only other way I can communicate is with my vintage flip phone... So, after we chat here for a bit, can you move it to text? ug that sounds weird, I'm sorry but its literally my only way to talk on a regular basis:(

So um... thanks for reading if you made it this far!"
"Can stopping an atypical antipsychotic medication (for example abilify) abruptly cause hypomania/mania in people who aren't bipolar?

I'm curious since it's an antagonist of dopamine and if you suddenly stop it wouldn't there be a surge of dopamine even in people who aren't bipolar?"
"My body feels weird right now its like im half a part of it. Its hard to move around and feels tingly i dont know.

I know im in my body but I dont feel like im in my body"
"Started tacking Lamictal a month ago. I increased the dose on friday (my psychiatrist told me to of course) and I became really sick yesterday. I called emergency because I was feeling really bad with kidney pain, headache and vomiting. The emergency doctor told me that I had just the flu and I needed paracetamol and some sleep and to keep taking Lamictal (which I didn’t do because I was too sick) 

Today I called my psychiatrist and he told me to stop the medication ride away. I feel so angry about the emergencies. I know theses sides effects are rare but doctors need to be informed about the danger of some medications. Anyway, I feel better know but I know it could have been worst if I had listen the this emergency doctor."
Just curious about your experience. Thanks!
"I thought it would be helpful to poll the peanut gallery, as it were. . ."
"Not as a side effect of meds, but as a symptom.  I've tried countless supplements, resistance training, got bloodwork done (nothing remarkable) and still 4+ years of never improving cognitive impariment, especially with spatial working memory.  Even if my mood is stable, my cognition remains seriously impaired. Is there anything in terms of prescription meds that can help manage cognitive imairment? Is Bupropion an option for this issue? I also have serious fatigue, but that's probably because of the seroquel."
"I'm currently on quetiapine and depakote Recently I've gained 10+ pounds almost overnight. I also am unable to function sometimes during the day due to drowsiness (even though I take my dose at night) 

Has anyone else experienced weight gain with antipsychotics? And what do you suggest I do to combat this? I feel way more impulsive than I did before I also experience agitation or feel on edge. 

Bipolar sucks. If you have no advice, even personal stories are appreciated. Its comforting to share an experience with others even if its a negative one.

**edit mistake lol"
"Sitting here today, went slightly manic last night. Shits been an issue just realizing fuck I've been in and out of psychosis for awhile now. Like these delusions will just never go the fuck away and I always find a way to convince myself it's reality. I'm still wondering if it is reality maybe I am special idk anymore. All I know is the anti psycotics make me so depressed they take every bit of personality from me makes me feel like a zombie I lose my sex drive I can't go back on that shit... honestly if I can't get better idk how I'm gonna live this way I'm fucked"
Ive been seeing the same psychiatrist for about 2 years. This week he went PRN ( on call only) so now im being assigned a new psychiatrist. Im not really sure what to expect. Im very worried that are going to start all over and rediagnosing me again when im finally kind of stable... anyone dealt with this before?
"Hi all, 
I’ve recently been diagnosed with bipolar and psychosis and started taking Abilify 3-4 weeks ago. I felt restlessness but thought it was nothing, but suddenly out of nowhere about four to five days ago my heart started racing out of nowhere, and I had horrible horrible anxiety. I feel now that I can’t even trust myself driving, and I’ve never felt like this before. But then I get behind the wheel and do fine, but the mere thought of it drives me insane. Also my cat has gotten out of dental surgery, and he’s on a different schedule, and needs to stay in my room/ under my supervision all the time, so that’s also driving me up a wall.  My heart races all the time and I wake up at three am every day. I only am able to get to sleep cause of melatonin and cbd. I quit weed because it was giving me panic attacks. I think my psych put me on the wrong med. I called her about it and she told me to stop. So I went 5 mg one day 2.5 the next and today is 0. 
Any tips or tricks? Stories? Please help I’m in such a bad spot"
"Today my pdoc said he wants me to start Invega. 

Backstory is I’ve been on Abilify for just over a year and have gained one pound per week. No other side effects.

My pdoc has suggested this change to avoid increased weight gain. I’m not sold on this. I have also read other terrible long lasting side effects caused by Invega. 

Just looking for others’ experiences with Invega. Thanks"
"I've accepted I'm hypomanic AF right now. I've been running on 4-6 hours sleep (normal for me is 8-9), can't shut up at work or when I'm talking to friends, feeling a wired energy, took out a loan for $2000, spent $200 on PJs, etc. I took a sleeping pill and an extra antipsychotic last night and actually slept for 12 hours. I still feel rather wired today, but I'm wondering if I can bring myself down if I can manage to get a full night's sleep every night. 

It's impossible to get into my psychiatrist right now (I went hypo earlier this year and was put on a cancellation list at the beginning of September and have yet to receive a call), but last time I went hypo my doctor adjusted my medications and it brought me down to earth. I'm wondering if I should call my doctor again, but I'd really like to try to bring myself down. Is that even possible? 

I'm truly a little reluctant to call my doctor, because I feel like my Wellbutrin might be triggering these episodes, but I'm afraid to reduce the dose or stop the medication, because I'm terrified of falling into a depression."
"By low functioning I mean I'm just trying to feel less alone with how bad things are. I'm wondering if anyone else is totally incapable of basically any level of functioning. In bed most of the time, with brief periods of high functioning success before the disease comes back full force.

Despite my best efforts, I've been disabled in all areas of life since my disorder began. My functioning has drastically decreased. I am unable to have a relationship, maintain most friendships, work any kind of job. I rarely leave the house. I am not doing well with medication side effects. I have numerous physical and psychological problems. I have three other mental disorders on top of BP.

I'm trying to decide whether I should change majors, because I don't have the energy to keep up with the current one, despite this being my greatest passion. I will have to do some mourning over the person I could've been.

I just can't do it. I don't have it in me. Managing severe BP is two full time jobs."
"Hey all! I’m hoping that this doesn’t trigger anyone. I wasn’t wondering, for those who get into states of low moods and dark bouts of depression… how do you cope?

I don’t really have a support system. So I kinda just write, and when my therapist is available, I talk to her.  I have two cats. But I think they might be sick of me. But yea, I don’t have anyone, and I’ve experienced low moods before, and have been able to function. This time feels different, I can’t shake it. I feel like it’s heavy and will swallow me. I’m scared."
"Hi, I’m dx bipolar 2 and I don’t think I’ve ever had a psychotic episode. But I don’t know what’s going on with me right now. I’ve been severely depressed for about 3 weeks, out of the blue. And now I feel like I’m hallucinating or going crazy. I’ve been seeing stuff a lot, like I thought some pipes in my apartment was a person and trees outside were people. Now I feel like I’m kinda out of it, like I look at things and I can’t recognize them, like I looked at my dog and I just didn’t know what or who he was. I feel like my husband hates me and is going to leave me. I’m not religious at all and never was and now I’m suddenly super into learning the bible and finding god, I feel like it would be good for me. I have been online shopping non stop for days and just don’t care about how much money I’m spending. 
I just don’t know what’s going on. I saw my psych last Thursday and will see them again in a week or two. I know it’s sounds like mania but I just don’t feel like it is because I can’t get out of bed and have been suicidal. All of the knives have been taken out of my apartment because I was afraid of killing myself. 
Has anyone had this type of experience? Or similar symptoms? I’m on 6 meds right now and I honestly don’t know if any are working anymore. I just feel defeated."
i 22F have been diagnosed with bipolar 2 for about 5 years. for the past 4 or 5 days i have been so irritable and angry that i can’t focus or sleep. this is a lot different from what i usually experience which makes me think it’s not actually hypomania? i don’t know. is this normal? my medication has not changed. i have been under a lot of stress but i don’t know why it would cause different symptoms??
"So... I've really messed up my sleep schedule.

I'm still getting 7-8 hours each day, but I'm falling asleep around 6 am and waking up at 1pm. I'll take a nap later, if possible.

Any advice for fixing this? I work for myself, so it's not really an issue in any other way except having a ""normal"" routine...

(This happened because I've been practicing guitar at night. I have ADHD, and I hyperfocus to the point where hours go by without me realizing it. I also don't quite know how to handle that, my hyperfixations give me life)"
"I'm back playing my video games to lose weight. I managed to lose it all before but I gained it all back and more. Its so hard with the meds, depression and so much junk food around with the holidays.

Anyway I'm back using Ringfit Adventure and Knockout Home Fitness on switch to lose the weight and get fitter, along with dieting of course.

Video games are the only way I can exercise because they're really engaging and give you much more motivation than if you're trying to do it all by yourself and cant afford a gym membership. I found I lost a lot of weight and really got in shape the first time round when I stuck with it for a good few months

I'll do a quick review of each in case anyone else is interested and I find these games to be great motivators for weight loss

Ringfit Adventure (Nintendo Switch): This is my number one favourite ever, it includes a leg strap and a resistance ring thing (idk what they're called) that you will use for a lot of the workouts. Its very accessible, it takes your weight and age into account and recommends a difficulty for you and you can set it to easier or harder with a very large range of difficulty from 1-28 I believe and it has assistance modes for if you have trouble with your joints and a silent running mode which is also useful for some people with difficulties. It covers all aspects of fitness from aerobic, balance, muscle training etc. It can be a really tough workout or you can set it to be a nice workout. My mom, husband and myself all play it and think its really great. Also forgot to mention the gameplay is like playing and rpg but using your body and exercise to beat the monsters. 




Knockout Home Fitness (Switch) : I really like this one, you have a personal trainer that gives you a different routine daily and then there's the 3 minute workouts. It's a mix of boxing, kickboxing and fighting workouts but of course you are hitting and kicking the air. I find it to be fun and it's like a nice quick session you can do daily. The trainer is very motivating and positive unlike other fitness games (which I will mention next). For this game though you really need coordination with your body and to be able to keep up and follow the actions which I find to be really hard sometimes with my brain and I have difficulty in general with direction and order of things and choreography type things but I still try to do it and get a workout done. I like it but I can see people getting frustrated with it if they have difficulty keeping up with it but the motivational and positive trainer does help. I think it's great as a quick workout since so far the personal training sessions I've had on it have been 12 minutes long and burning approximately 70 calories which isn't that bad at all and paired with some 3 minute workouts is really great 


Fitness boxing 2 (switch): I believe this is made by the same people that made knockout home fitness but the vibe is different. I only played the demo for it but I didn't like it at all. I didn't like it even though it is almost the same as knockout home fitness because I swear the feedback is so negative when you are struggling when knockout is so positive and encouraging. It really shows how a negative vs positive feedback effects your motivation, just like how we use positive reinforcement with children and animals. It has a demo so that's good if anyone would like to try it


Beatsaber (meta quest, PlayStation vr, pc, etc):  I thought I'd throw this one in as a little mention since I have tried it for moving my body and getting fit. I find it's really good for getting your body moving if you move your whole body while playing and dancing to the music and not mostly flicking your wrist. If you want a bit of workout from it you'd want to play on expert difficulty. Anyway I think it's a good game to get your body moving especially if you might be a bit out of shape and own a vr device. I still have yet to try any of the fitness games on vr since a lot of them require a subscription and I don't like the amount of heat the headset puts on my face and the weight of it.

Well that's my review, I hope it helps people. I will try more like just dance and I'll see what else I can try. If you mention a game on switch I could try it and review it next time since I have access to a lot of switch games. The next one I'm going to try is Let's get Fit on switch"
I get what y’all are talking about now… my mom pointed out that I’ve seemed stable the past couple of week (yay me!). But I also have noticed that I’ve also been bored- even with getting back into my hobbies. I’m not used to my emotions being in the range of neurotypical. I almost don’t know what to do with myself because I feel so bored and bland. I feel like I’ve lost some of my sparkle.
"To give you guys, some back story I had fight with two of my neighbour's in December. There are two guys living next door, who kept calling me a boy, even they are younger than me. It started pissing me off and one day I just faced them, knocked on the door and started talking. They kept explaining to me, that I'm just tripping, but I said to not call me like that anymore. One of them said ""What If I do"" and we started fighting. Other neighbours heard it and started pull us apart.

After that there were rumors about me and my condition between other neighbours. So everybody just  started just to look at me with suspicion. 

And I get grustrated sometimes that people keep questioning my sanity. I have sometimes delusions, but I can trust myself, at least I try. 

These guys keep gossiping about me, I can hear through walls, when I'm eating dinner(cause we live in the dorm). I'm off meds right now and keep thinking ""Are these guys want to gaslight me?"""
"I’m supposed to eat with my morning meds (300mg lamictal, 50mg naltrexone). I have difficulty with eating. I usually get to it at some point in the day but I’m struggling today. 

What do you eat when you have to eat but just can’t? I’m feeling depressed and would like to take care of myself."
"For context, I received a couple of texts this weekend from two separate phone numbers. The first one was of a screenshot of the definition of “crazy”, and I blocked the number. It was really alarming to receive and I felt disturbed. I was out with my friend at the time, and I wanted to know who sent it to me, as I have a suspicion of who did. The next message came a couple of nights later. It was a long drawn-out definition of OLD (obsessive love disorder) sent to me in text format from another number. Just the definitions were sent and nothing else. My instinct is telling me I know who is sending me these messages, but I’m trying to be graceful about it, and I’m trying to not let it affect me. I don’t want to reach out to her, because she has harassed me in the past and she makes me anxious to communicate with. Her current boyfriend was seeing me before he saw her… and I don’t know what kind of insecurities she has, but I don’t communicate with him anymore. It’s a long story, but I have moved past the situation, and clearly she has not, if it is her.

I understand whoever sent it is desperate enough to contact me in such a way and is intentionally harassing me about my mental illness. As I was typing this I received another message. I am wondering at what point should I go to the police? Can they even help?

 I don’t want to keep receiving messages that seem to imply whoever is sending them believes me to be unstable of mind. I have had my struggles in the past, but I am actually quite sane now, though maybe just a little weirder than most. Nothing wrong with that :)"
"These thoughts only come up when I’m manic, and I have a history of being irrationally angry when I’m manic. 

I feel so guilty when I come back to my senses but right now I hate him and don’t even want to be in the same room. I’m mad about things that I haven’t communicated (so I don’t even have the right to be angry imo). Everything he says is like nails on a chalkboard and I want to scream. I’ve never acted on these feelings and don’t think I ever would, but it’s hard when I get in this state. 

Once I calm down it’s like everything is back to normal. I love him, and see him for the amazing supportive partner he is. I don’t have the heart to discuss this with him yet, and don’t even know how I’d verbalize it if I did.

Does this sound like a relationship issue or a me issue? Has this happened to anyone else?"
It definitely feels like PTSD and it’s been a couple years since it happened.
"I am looking to get an assessment soon for what I’m sure is Bipolar disorder. I am curious of what others went through that made them realize they are bipolar.

some back story, I (20f) have just celebrated sobriety for a year on November 17th. I had to quit because I went through what I feel was a manic-psychotic episode. I was hallucinating, hyper sexual, had persecutory delusions. Leading up to this I went through a breakup. I have not been diagnosed but looking back on my behaviour from age 17-18 I suspect something was wrong. I feel as though I had these episodes more than once. I also have major depression. In my last year of high school I would sleep at school for days and just not move this would last for a few months. 

~At one point I wanted to start an only fans and do porn/become hyper sexual (I am self admittedly a prude and this is out of character for how I feel about sec)
~constantly breakup with my ex-boyfriend and have explosive episodes of anger at him. 
~become paranoid and thought friends were plotting against me
~hallucinated
~I thought I was just the most gorgeous thing and took all these photos- looking back the photos are literally just normal photos I don’t look as good as I felt. 
~at one point thought my dad did something horrible to me (he did not)
~convinced myself I was a sociopath and that my friends would find out and leave
~had tones of spiritual based delusions and thought I was psychic and just knew things.

During those 3 years I was addicted to pot, I also can report every-time I did psychedelics I went into some psychotic mania, I thought I knew the answers to the universe and would just get super weird. After not smoking and getting on meds I have been stable (for the year). 

Do these symptoms sound familiar?"
"I don’t want to get into too many details. But basically we’ve grown apart and she’s changed into someone I don’t even recognize. She met this guy in 2015 and she’s gone downhill. 

It really sucks."
"I’ve been in a mixed state for a couple months, and my wife of course has taken a lot of the emotional flak that pours out of me. So much that last night she announced it’s over. She can’t take any more, can’t live like this anymore. We have a 5yr old and a 2yr old. I can honestly say I didn’t know pain like this was possible, and I have spent a lot of the last 7 years wanting to die. This is beyond pain. This is grief beyond imagining. She says she still doesn’t want to rip us apart, but she feels like she has no choice. I can’t argue. 

I don’t think I am capable of parenting without her. I know for a fact I’m not capable of doing it while she goes and finds a good stable guy to become another daddy to my babies. Seeing that…well, I know what happens then. I don’t deserve her, I don’t even know how to deserve her. Being bipolar and having parents that never modeled how to love with respect and devotion, I was fucked from the start."
"My usual signs of mania have been no sleep, super wired/motivated. Lately I’ve been sleeping a lot and unmotivated. BUT I’ve been recklessly spending money, drinking, horny, talking a bunch, angry. I’m pretty sure I’m manic it’s just not my usual signs. Sigh"
"I’m going on 10 months of Risperidone and I’ve gained about 20 pounds. Does the weight gain ever level off or decline? 

I’ve been working out consistently since the beginning of this year and have yet to see the results of it 

Any experiences with risperidone weight is greatly appreciated! Thank you, friends"
"I am very against anything that has an effect on my cognition.  So I won't take Lamictal or Topomax, and I won't do ECT.  I think they may be good fits for other people, but they just aren't options for me personally.  I will pretty much try any therapy, but I doubt some of their efficacies.  Same w. diets and such.  Willing to try, but I doubt they would work.  I would even consider a fecal transplant if my doc suggested it!

Are there any treatments you refuse to try?"
"Hi! I had an antidepressant induced manic episode last September and I’ve been on depakote 1000mg. I think it is causing my depression. I never had any (hypo)mani before the antidepressant and only had mild depressions in the past, but after the mania I’ve been having a terrible depression, specially in December when I was totally bedridden. Do you have any experience on depakote causing depression and do you think it’s worth taking it for someone without any manic tendencies? Thanks"
i cant tell if its just my meds working or if im entering an episode. i only woke up 2 hours ago and ive already done all the chores on my list and now i feel restless and like i HAVE to do stuff. i dont want to sit on my couch watching movies all day. i want to be up and moving
"I’m pretty certain i want a face tattoo. I’ve already got tattoos so it wouldn’t look too out of place.

I don’t feel manic or intensely emotional at the moment. I’ve actually been sober from alcohol since Christmas and free from drugs for almost a month. So if anything I feel very clear headed in comparison to usual.

Only reason I’m questioning it is because I haven’t been manic for a while and feel it’s overdue. I’m also not getting high like I usually would from drugs so not sure if I’m trying to replace the thrill I get from those with this?

I know tattoos aren’t for everyone so regardless of your personal opinions on tattoos, I’d love to get others thoughts."
"ive bee headed into a mixed episode for the past two or so weeks and i really didnt expect id feel this way but every time this date rolls around it fucks with my head remembering how 5 years ago i was in college and i had so much hope for my future and i thought id get the bipolar under control and stop trying to kill myself all the time. this wasnt really any sort of turning point but at the same time it was. i feel like im over it then it sneaks up on me. i just lost my new job because of this episode. five years ago i got sexually assaulted and it was entirely my fault i was uncomfortable the night before and i shouldve left but it was snowing and windy and it was in the negatives i didnt want to walk home. ive taken myself through it so many times and told myself it wasnt my fault but i still feel guilty for trusting him and he was my friend so it felt like such a fucking betrayal. my alcoholism really kicked off after that and i had my first psychotic depressive episode now every year i get so paranoid it makes me want to kill myself just to make it all stop. and its so hard to hold it together. i spent the day with my sister and my nieces and she left my older niece with me while she took the younger one home to nap and i put on a movie while we were coloring and i couldnt stop crying. i shouldve been happy i love them so much but i just havent been allowed to process my emotions because im always so worried people will comment that im not making progress. i keep getting those ""i thought you had it under control"" and ""i thought you were over it"" comments from my parents. i dont know why im posting all of this and i hope i dont trigger anyone. i havent attempted in two years and it feels good to be able to stop trying to leave this side of the earth but i wish i actually wanted to be here. my sister always says i can talk to her but any time i have im always getting told that i gotta stop letting stuff bother me so much. 5 years feels like so much and so little at the same time and i wonder if id be so depressed about it if i had lived a more fulfilling life in that time.  its 930 here and ill probably go to sleep just to get out of my head but every night the past few weeks ive been waking up multiple times. this is the second year ive gotten through this day without drinking until i pass out. last year i ended up in rehab less than a month later. i hope i can keep my sobriety this year because im close to six months and ive never stayed away from alcohol this long. it feels good to be in control of the things i do and say. thanks for taking your time to read my whining, hope everyones doin alright."
"I know this subreddit can get heavy at times so I want to give a snapshot of where I’m at in managing this wild ride. 

Since 2020 I’ve been committed twice and been to jail once, and been in probation for about 18 months and i just have to say… Life is good!

I have a career in programming which i enjoy, a hobby in standup comedy, an outlet in drawing and making t-shirts and posters, and great group of friends (mostly comics).

Don’t let anyone tell you you’ll “lose your spark” by seeking treatment. Sure it may take time to mind the right regimen but its worth the fight to find the balance you deserve to have. 

Bipolar is a part of us but it doesn’t have to define us. I know I may not be and probably won’t be stable forever but while i have it im not afraid to savor every moment. 

18 months stable and happy and if I knew how good life was now I would have fought even harder to get it in my darkest place. 

You’re worth fighting for too."
"Although I'm in euthmia right now (with occasional bouts of highs and lows) and I know I need to take meds and get an increase due to my euthmia (think it's natural although happened a day after I started meds) 
I need to keep telling myself to take them, 
Because I know in around may I'll most likely enter a depression like last year which lasted until late September! 
Anyone else think like this during euthmia"
I’m currently on geodon and I’m worried that one day it will wear off and I’ll have to change my medication. I’ve been stable for 3 years and I’d like to remain stable. I have bipolar type 1. Any experience or advice is greatly appreciated :)
"Don’t lean on me,

I’m not sound,

An oasis gone dry,

So many come for help,

But I’m just as lost,

I vent like a worn out machine’s exhaust,

With the couplings out of sorts,

Choking on the grievances,

The annoyance of it stuck in my throat!

Want to expel it like phlegm!

Let me tilt like a glass on the edge…

Did you assist or push it until it broke into a thousand shards,

Now I spend my days trying to glue it back together,

And it always splits,

Probably need new company,

But I hate myself just as much,

So I’m left cycling with these thoughts,

While gossip and judgement makes me shut up."
I am sad.
"I am highly considering taking advantage of FMLA. I am more than sure I’d qualify for having bipolar. I think therapist recommendations suffice, but if not, I’m sure my psychiatrist could confirm my condition as I’ve been with her a while & she’s seen manic episodes, depressive episodes,
etc.

My question is. I have a friend with a chronic illness who is allotted one day off a week when she needs to use it (not sure the limit on how many days per year - not concerned) very rarely do I need extended leaves. I manage well enough even in manic / depressive episodes but sometimes all it takes is one day of being over tired / overworked to send me over the edge & it would be a tremendous help to have that option if I need it. 

So my question is. I see a lot of talk here about extended leaves or manic episodes and such. Does anyone have a FMLA set up that’s more in line with what I’m talking about? 

Thanks for your help!"
"I'm on 50mg of Quetiapine and I feel I need an increase, im going threw euthmia right now but I know it's not long until a crash (I know it's euthmia because I'm having mild short bouts of ups and downs which is normal for me during euthmia) 

I know that this stuff takes time, 
How do I ask without seeming despite? I'm only on Quetiapine"
"Hey guys, I have an appointment to see a new psychiatrist in a couple weeks and I cannot make a decision about something because it has to do with my ethics and morals, and probably legality?

I have a great half-time job that I've been at 1.5 years. When I first started, my boss wanted to pay me under the table for the first three months to make sure I was a good fit before adding me to payroll. However, I barely survive living paycheck to paycheck and that extra $100-$200 in taxes is actually needed to make sure my bills are paid so I have asked him to keep me under the table and he has no problem with that. He sends me some kind of legal form each year that I'm supposed to use once I file my taxes.

Anyway - there is a medical/dental/behavioral clinic and pharmacy here that goes on a sliding scale for patients with no health insurance. I just started using them about 5 months ago and I have been telling them I'm unemployed so I can be on the sliding scale where my 6 monthly medications are around $70 instead of $300 and doctor appointments are only $25. I know this is not right and I always feel really bad about it and I've been thinking about showing them the document my boss sends me each year to prove my wages but I'm so scared I won't be able to afford my medications or counseling appointments.

Here's my pickle: The main thing I want/need counseling/therapy for is my fucking boss (yes it's an online company and I work from home and have never met him but holy fuck lol). I just know that the doctor can see my chart right there in blinking lights saying that I'm unemployed...you get my drift.

I know there's the whole doctor/patient confidentiality but even if it's scamming his place of work? What should I do?"
"I'd like to get a medical bracelet because I'm on so much dang medicine and if anything happened, I think the medics should know - especially about the lithium. I'd prefer something like silicone over metal. I also don't want to spend tons of money on something I'll have to replace if my medicine changes. I don't really want to list all the medicine on it either. So maybe something scannable? This is just a new idea for me so if anyone has something they really like, could you share? Thanks in advance!"
"\*I know this is a subjective question, and so I'm not sure if there is a correct answer here. I'd still love to hear different opinions on this.

I've always had that little dream of being pregnant and having babies, the whole nine yards. I was recently diagnosed with BP1, and I'm realizing how impossible it has made my every day life. Now I don't know if I *should* have kids, let alone carry them. I can't imagine passing on this sort of illness to anyone, let alone my own baby. I know I could adopt, or foster, and it's something I've thought about a lot. But I want the experience of pregnancy and bonding with a kid that way. It feels horribly selfish to risk handing down my mental illness (and a long history of it in my family), but I still want that dream. Would it be selfish to have a biological child, knowing the risks of my genetics?"
"I’ve noticed a ton of like fatigue and lethargy … glued to my couch all day since November.

"I just started a job on a night shift. The schedule is brutal.  7PM-7AM 7 days a week. That's 84 hours. For the next 3-6 months.

My family had a collective coniption when I told them I'm doing this. I ignored them, but also didn't. I spoke with my therapist and provider. We made changes to my med schedule.

Tonight is night 6. I've been averaging 4 hours of sleep a day. I normally need 8+ to function. The last 2-3 days I've been getting up wide awake and doing my job. I'm irritated. Talking with no filter. OCD. Skin crawling. Impulsive shopping. Horny AF. I have to literally coach myself out loud to drive the speed limit. I just finished praying. I only do that when I'm elevated. 

I'm still in control. Mostly. For now. If I lose control and start showing psychotic symptoms that's it. Game over.

Maybe I shouldn't have taken this job. I may have taken for granted how fragile I really am as a creature. But I can't stop now. My position is in high demand and it will hurt my reputation if I throw in the towel.

If I tell my spouse what's going on they will freak out. Obviously I'm going to talk to my therapist next week, but how the fuck am I going to do this for months?"
I know that food sometimes I skip meals and I know that’s not good for me because food helps my antipsychotics absorb better into my system. I’ve been on them for 3 years and sometimes I skip meals but I haven’t felt any different when I don’t eat on them? Does it really make that big of a difference? I feel stable but I also know I need to take my meds with food to get the full effect. Does anyone else sometimes skip meals on their meds?
"My sister has been manic for months and it seems to only be getting worse even with med changes. I live out of state and thought about sending her a care package of things to help her relax, sleep, and recover. Anyone have any suggestions as to what items I should include ?"
What does hypomania look like for you? Are there any symptoms that aren't firstly thought of when thinking about hypomania?
"So I've been hypomanic for about a month now. I'm working on updating my meds to get it under control, but until that happens, I'm working with a fast brain, not enough sleep, and random agitation. Yall know the sample platter this disorder comes with.

I wanted to ask about experiences with hypomania and how everyone deals with their's. Right now I'm wondering if anyone else lovebombs their partner. I've noticed I'm crazy affectionate with my fiancee lately like when we first started dating. How do you guys deal with the random rage, get to sleep, not try to sign up for way to much to do once you come down? I like to try to go back to college and apply for a second job. I also am curious about the type of meds everyone is on. I was recommended an anti psychotic despite not having psychosis when I asked for my meds to be bumped up. Doc said to manage better I should be on an antidepressant, mood stabilizer and and anti psychotic. This wasn't my normal dr so I was wondering how common the mix was. 

Sorry for grammar any typos, it's 3am for me and I should be asleep but I'm about to start highlighting the bipolar survival guide."
"I used to be so focused on keeping sugar intake low that I'd avoid even fruit out of fear of what sugar seems to do to my mood and stability.

After a long running sugar binge, I've got it back under control now, even avoiding a very tempting cupcake the other day. But I still tend to have a couple of bananas a day in shakes.

I've heard of others having to watch the fruit as well in favor of mental health. How strict are you people about it? As far as adding fruit to smoothies, oatmeal, and other healthy options, I do also weigh in that keeping them somewhat tasty helps me to avoid saying ""screw it today"" and going for a less healthy option like a bagel for breakfast.

It's no fun being this strict as I've always loved sweets, but the effects it has on my mental wellbeing are way too dramatic to risk."
I'm 100% stable right now and I've been so for four years. But I wonder how medication management would look like when I'm 70 years old. Right now I'm 26 and on the perfect cocktail of meds. But I wonder if I'll stay on my max dose of Fluvoxamine (300mg) or on the max dose of Latuda (120mg) when I'm 70. Maybe I'm thinking too far ahead?
"Every. Single. Time a certain med seems like it’s working, bam, it doesn’t. I’m on my 7th med change, currently on lamictal. Was great for a month or two, now I been consistently depressed for a couple weeks, the med is also making me gain weight super fast so that’s messing with my self esteem which doesn’t help at all. I just feel hopeless, like is this how it’s always gonna be?? I’m so tired of it. I just wanna feel “normal” for once."
"Today, I went out with my brother, my sister, her boyfriend, and her friend. We watched a rom-com called Maybe I do, which was funny despite the bad reviews. I laughed, we all laughed, but in the end, everyone ended up happy and I was left feeling even more lonely and hopeless than when a hour and half before.

I feel hopeless about many things, but what I feel most hopeless about is relationships, both platonic and romantic ones. I just feel very lonely and I can't quite connect with people, and I feel very distant from most people, including relatives. I even fear them, and I guess that is due to CPSTD. And I am aware too that most people, or their families, have prejudices about people with bipolar or other mental health issues. I had a girlfriend, whom understood me, but in the end her family did not and she had to choose between me or them and she made the right choice; during the film, I couldn't help but remember her.

I feel scattered. Sorry."
"My mother has said this to me before. She’ll say how everyone has ups and downs and it’s normal to stay up at nights working on a project. I’ll counter that statement with explaining bipolar more but it’s still frustrating when people don’t believe me.

I was also telling a friend at work about my diagnosis and someone overheard me and said the same thing, it’s kind of disheartening to hear ngl.

I only seem to show like sever symptoms when i’m alone or with people i’m very close to, trauma and all yk, so i see why most people don’t “see” it but still…. What do you guys do in this situation? What do you even say?"
"Soo I feel the most depressed and manic in the evenings. It goes like this, around 5:00 I start to get really down for a few hours. Then I get manic around 7:00 and can't get to sleep intell like 12 or 1 in the morning.

What do you think I should do, ask my doctor if I can have a second does in the evenings or should I try to get a bigger dose."
"I'm 33 years old, but I feel like a child.

They want me stable. They don't like me wild. 


My Tinder match liked my manic side

but when I asked to see her again, I was denied.


I should save my money, but I need a distraction.

Something to bring a few moments of satisfaction.


I have no job. I have no future.

I'm a lanky, full grown adult moocher. 


I know this disorder will be with me til death

and I'm grateful to be alive with every breath.


My life didn't turn out quite as expected

"Hi!  First of all english is not my first lenguage so sorry if i make any mistakes
I don't where to ask this but i've been diagnosed with bipolar and started ond meds and ive been feeling something strange. I feel like my tounge has swollen and doesn't have the correct space anymore so now my tounge is hurting and have lots of  wounds by the sides. Is this a possible side effect of one of my meds? Should i consult with another speciality doctor?"
"I don’t usually drink much, I’ll have a drink or two. But I guess I need a med adjustment and I went way off the deep end last night. And I feel like such a loser this morning. I have to have more control. Which means just not ever having a drink I believe. Which I know I what I’m supposed to have been doing the whole time but I just had a hard time letting go of it. But I’m finally ready to gain control, I feel the meds lacking and I’m up more at night and I’m crying more and I was questioning coming off my meds like a week ago…the old me is resurfacing and I’m like OH NO! So when I see my dr Tuesday I will be making sure we fix that! But I just wanted to share, I’m quitting alcohol and if you haven’t yet, I hope you can too."
"Just got out of my first relationship and it lasted about 7 years (on and off).

I honestly stayed and took more abuse than I should but was scared I’d never find someone else who I actually found sexually attractive.

I’m just ok looking and only 5 ft 7.

Plus, I’m unemployed basically with a part time job of a couple hours a month.

I never got my degree due to illness struggles.

I just feel clueless.
I have a couple app matches.
But, honestly I’ve been on tons of dates and never been passed a first date.

There were women who wanted more or I like as people, but sexually they did nothing for me.

My ex and I developed into a thing very randomly.

Anyone in a similar situation able to offer advice?"
"Yep I self harmed for the first time in my life. I'm 32 this year ffs. Medications have been changed and the mental health hospital is calling me daily. If I don't answer the phone they send a community mental health nurse round to do a welfare check, I'm completely under the care of the mental health team and one step away from being sectioned under the mental health act.

My best friend self harms and she sent me pictures, the state of mind I was in, full blown crazy ass manic, thought it would be fun to do the same thing. Cut my wrist and my leg, definitely should have got stitches because the ones on my leg we're wide ass slashes. There's scabs now and no sign of infection so fingers crossed.

If someone is in an unstable state of mind, DO NOT MAKE THEM THINK OF SELF HARM. I love my friend dearly but she needs to understand my mental health better. 

My assigned mental health nurse does know and has seen them. He was happy there's no sign of infection.

I want the new meds to start working properly. I'm absolutely in space with this mania bullshit. It took 6 months of 1-2 hours sleep a night. A shitty long ass mixed episode before my brain shot me at Lightspeed to Alpha centauri. 

I enjoyed it for a bit but please let me crash. This isn't fun anymore."
"Been feeling good lately about crossing some healthy lifestyle things off my to-do list, which always needs a refresher when winter wraps up. Resuming the gym, cutting out sugar, and cooking have been recent ones.

My partner now wakes up around 7am, and I honestly miss the days when I was up at 6am or even 5am. I currently go to bed around midnight, and wake around 8-9am. It's been hard to get the adjustment started though, especially because I prioritize getting good sleep as much as I can.

Getting the right amount of sleep aside, have any of you noticed any benefits by waking earlier or later? Inspire me!"
"I’m a male with bipolar type 1.

Took me a long time to accept my diagnosis but I have done well the last few years addressing it and seeking professional help.

But I want to know why so many people in my life have caused me harm. Mainly in terms of partners.

I have been beaten until I bled too many times. I have had a partner threaten to lie and say I am suicidal and sent to the hospital if I do not do what they wanted me to do.

Society has given me the script that men do things like this to women, so why has it happened to me and why does it bother me?"
The hell else am I supposed to do if I’m not drinking any alcohol? I can’t just sit around and do nothing that’s boring as hell. I know during bad manic episodes weed makes me worse for sure and causes paranoia but when I’m not having bad episodes I’m fine. I don’t smoke when I’m having an episode. Can anyone shine some light on their long term experience with cannabis use and their bipolar please? It would be greatly appreciated :)
"A little backstory:  25F I got diagnosed with bipolar depression when I was in rehab when I was 17 after a very traumatic time for me. Ever since then I have been on vyvanse 20-40mg, the lowest dosage of Zoloft 25mg (higher dose makes me manic) and lithium starting at 900 now up to 1500 (main reason for increasing on this one was anxiety idk if anyone else had that). 

Since this all happened so young for me (started on meds when I was 14-15) I don’t really no what natural me feels like. I have always struggled with addiction and adhd tho while being on medicine regardless of what it is. 

As of a week ago I’m now weaning off lithium slowly and getting put on to lamictal. I’m extremely nervous to start a new medication as I didn’t have any issues with lithium besides minor dry mouth, sunburn rash in the summer, and we think it raised my iron levels but nothing to concerned of. I’ve been on medication before like risperdol, lexapro, and latuda (there’s other im not mentioning) and I felt like I was crazy on them. I felt all over the place. 

My biggest issue right now is constant anxiety in regards to a fear I have (emetophibia fear of throwing up. Basically I feel I need to be in control of my body) I take klonopin to help with that and my adhd. Which has been hard because my adhd meds now give me anxiety and I’ve tried lowering them. 

If anyone has any tips or advice or experience it would be so much needed xoxo"
"I've been on Quetiapine (50mg) and it's working well but I feel I need to increase
I've been on it for 2 weeks on Tuesday"
"If all my bipolar episodes have been triggered by heavy marijuana and alcohol abuse, should I consider getting re-evaluated?"
"Atypical bipolar: How do you experience dysphoric hypomania?

Hi! I suspect I might have atypical bipolar although I've been diagnosed with GAD, panic disorder and agitated depression. My psychiatrist seems to think that I don't meet the criteria of true hypomania because I'm ""self-aware"" when these episodes happen.

What I experience (usually triggered by stress or overstimulation):

- Extreme anxiety with panic attacks 
- High energy with constant adrenaline 
- High productivity
- Insomnia
- Racing thoughts 
- Feelings of distress and like I'm ""losing it""
- Burning sensations in my skin (arms, legs and back)
- Metallic taste in my mouth


When this happens, I know it's not ""normal"" to feel this way; I absolutely hate it and I'm desperate for sleep (so I rely on benzodiazepines and sleeping tablets until it resolves). I don't feel a decreased _desire_ for sleep, but my body really fights to keep me awake. If these episodes last longer than two weeks, I completely unravel into a crying mess. I've had to take time off work many times over the last few years because of these ""burnouts"".

I have also experienced the ""euphoric"" version of this before (but less commonly). Same symptoms as above except (initially) with excitement, pressured speech and mild grandiosity (saying things like ""I'm solving all of my company's problems!""), but this always devolves into the dysphoric and depressed version eventually.  

I've been struggling with this for 8 years, swinging between agitated depression as my baseline with these ""burnouts"" in between (minimum once a year; maximum four times a year, depending on stress levels).

I've been taking the maximum dosage of Sertraline (SSRI) for about eight months, and while it's helped a lot with the depression aspect, the above episodes still happen to me. When I started taking it, I had an extreme episode lasting about five weeks until the medication settled (I survived on clonazepam to get me through).

My question is: Do any of you relate to what I've described above (as potential dysphoric hypomania)? And were you misdiagnosed with things like GAD before the atypical bipolar was identified?

I just feel like there's more to this than meets the eye."
"So I was diagnosed in 2000-ish when I was in my early 20s. I didn't grow up with my sperm donor around. He was a horrible person and I'm glad he wasn't around. 

But recently I found out that he was schizophrenic in addition to being an addict. And psychopathic perhaps, I'm still waiting on confirmation on that. How might this affect my bipolar diagnosis? They just keep adding things to it, too. Now it's ADHD, anxiety, OCD, and panic. I don't even know where to start from here. My psychiatrist is going on vacation, so I'm not sure I'll be able to talk to her soon. Any ideas or insights would be greatly appreciated. 

I'm not going to be available most of the day, but I'll check back in when I can. Thanks, everyone. I really appreciate anything you might have to say about this."
"More looking for some reassurance here because this always bugs me.

Currently taking:
1. Lamotrigine - for BP II
2. Testosterone cypionate - to treat low hormone levels as a result of a pituitary tumor, but sometimes wish I didn't need this 
3. Alvesco - steroid asthma inhaler
4. (New) Lyrica - as an alcohol alternative for social situations only, as I've always struggled with alcohol use so it's sort the lesser of evils here
5. Ketamine treatment - may stop after winter
6. Cialis (as needed, which is rare now) for ED
7. Levalbuterol (as needed) - asthma rescue inhaler

And a few supplements:
1. Vitamin D3 - I live in the northeast, enough said lol
2. Magnesium citrate - has helped dramatically with anxiety
3. Iron - trouble keeping levels up in recent years

I'm 38...so I also understand more meds will inevitably be added in my future for whatever conditions.

But sometimes it's tough seeing friends or partners on 0-1 meds, and it's usually just Albuterol, birth control, or other fairly common meds."
"I started lamotrigine 5 days ago and yesterday started developing flu like symptoms severe body aches stiff neck headache and just generally feeling run down, is this normal ? As I read it can be the start offf DRESS or Steven Johnson syndrome I should note I have no rash I just want to know if it’s normal"
"In the last 3 months:

- wife left
- lost my job
- diagnosed bp2
- lithium hell
- quetiapine hell 
- soon to be evicted and will be living in my car
- 34 years old

Yet.. I’m not giving up. If I can turn this around almost anyone can <3"
I was on Quetiapine (300 mg) months ago. I decided to stop taking my meds bc of gain weight. I've been on therapy for almost a year but recently I had a pretty bad mixed episode so I was prescribed abilify. Tbh I'm too damn scared. I don't want to gain any more weight. I'd like to hear some advices or your own experiences on this med. Thanks
"Hi, 22 y/o female here recently diagnosed (6 months ago) with Bipolar II by a private healthcare service because the NHS waiting list for psychiatric assessments is like a year long and I was losing my mind, and needed help fast. When I got diagnosed, the private clinician shared my diagnosis and details of my assessment with my NHS GP. I’m on medication (Quetiapine/Seroquel), and haven’t experienced a hypomanic episode since being on the medication, but I’ve noticed signs I’m starting to slip ( experiencing frequent nightmares, paranoid about shadow people in my room after experiencing nightmares, having thoughts of spending all my money, stopping doing my University work).

Besides medicating me, I’ve got no treatment plan from the NHS, or anything - just a medication review every 6 months) 

Do we just go through our hypomanic episodes regardless of what happens to us? Who do I talk to? I’m scared of fully going into an episode. But the NHS are useless. 

Note: I had one big hypomanic episode and got diagnosed. So I’m just kinda scared because I don’t really know the full signs of an episode or if I’m just being paranoid. I’ve had no support - just a diagnosis and medication."
""
"I have been on lithium for 8 months. I skipped a few doses in November, but have otherwise faithfully taken a dose between 600-900mg every night.

Unfortunately, I am still suicidal almost every day. I self-harm some days.

Perhaps my level is just not high enough. I am gonna do whatever the doctor says, because they know best, after all. I'm gonna go up to the highest level possible, I'll take 10,000 mg a day if that is what it takes. Maybe we can make this drug work for me.

I am just asking this question because I see everyone saying lithium worked really well for their depression and suicidal thoughts. Unfortunately lithium does not seem to work that way for me. I had issues with Seroquel too where it gave me such bad physical symptoms I thought I was dying every day.

Note: I also take Lamotrigine 200mg once a day and pregabalin 50mg twice a day. I do not drink or smoke or do any drugs. I do not consume caffeine. I work out 5-7 times a week. I see a therapist weekly. I am doing everything I can to get better."
I feel like I have very strong emotions about the friends I have in my life. I don’t have a lot anymore but it’s very difficult for me to let them go if they don’t want to be friends anymore. More difficult than usual. Almost as if they don’t understand the depths of the emotions bipolar people have in a way. I lost a lot a friends because of my illness and just me in general. I love my friends too much unfortunately and it’s hard for me to just forget about them. Anyone else feel the same?
"I have been doing pretty well with my disorder lately, but it is exhausting.  I think people assume that it is easy to be ""well"" if medications are working and you aren't in the midst of a serious episode.  Sometimes it is easy, but a lot of the time it is a lot of work.    


Sometimes I just wish someone would acknowledge how freaking hard it is, and how much effort I have to put forth in order to feel euthymic.    


The thing is that for as much as I want someone to pity me, to recognize how challenging it is to live with this illness, I would be mortified if people even knew how hard it was for me.  Like there are equal parts wanting recognition for my suffering but also equal parts refusing to let anyone know I am suffering.  Wtf, right?  


Then I get into really sick thoughts about how if I killed myself then people would a) know how hard it was to live with this illness and b) never be able to mortify me by looking at my face with pity.  The best of both worlds!   Obviously, I am not going to do this because I am not even suicidal right now, but that is how pathetic this line of thinking gets."
"I am having intrusive thoughts and hiperfixation, but I didn't realize that before posting here and I am very grateful guys!!

But some random decided he is better than my doc to diagnose me and invalidate me because the origin of my problem. This piss me of and made me lost time enough to made me feel I needed to write this. 

We need to be responsible, most of us are not psychiatrist and even then don't understand ever aspect of this illness. This sub exist for us help each other and understand the aspects that no one told us.
 
If you don't feel a symptom or don't know it exists, don't mean other people will be the same. All the experiences are valids, no one knows the history of anyone here, no one is in the body of anyone here and we are spread over the world, what make us more diverse. 

So please, we need to be respectful and responsible, because no one can predict how the words will resonate in the others and can be catastrophic.

And we have a feed here, if you think someone post some bullshit that you don't understand, keep scrolling, the mods will help with unwanted content.

"Does anyone else have a list of people that you feel you owe some type of amends to? People that at some point you pushed away, stopped talking to with no explanation, or maybe they just saw one of your low moments without ever knowing what was truly going on?

I go through this imaginary list in my head almost once a day, wondering if maybe I actually write these names down, I'll finally get around to reaching out to these people and explaining what is truly going on with me and what I have learned about myself. Could this be the key to getting me off the hook for doing that to them?

Then I think, is this really for them? or is it for me? So that I'm able to let go of this sinking feeling that the people that I once considered close to me see me from such a dark perspective because of my actions?

Do I truly want these people back in my life? Am I ready for the mental energy that is needed in order to not just explain myself, but to deal with what they have to say? For all I know I could be stepping into a room full of rejection, it could be too late to make these amends, so maybe that's what I'm afraid of also."
"Obviously antidepressants only make my anxiety worse and also I've been on seroquel, abilify, and topamax which all three gave me akathesia. I'll never go on a antipsychotic again. 

I'm so scared to try a mood stabilizer but I'm running out of options for my anxiety."
"Hi guys, I’ve been on 900mg of lithium for about 7 years now and lately I feel like I have been experiencing a lot more mood swings. I’m wondering if anyone has ever switched from lithium to another bipolar medication, or takes a combination of lithium and another medication and has seen success. Thank you!"
"I’ve been trying to see my psychiatrist since early December. I’ve been so scared of meds and have recently come to the realization that i can not continue to live how i am off of meds, but I haven’t heard from my therapists office at all? They said they’d call me when I’ve moved up the waitlist and i mean it’s been a few months at this point. Should i be concerned? Does it usually take this long?

I thought for sure i’d at least get moved up the list a little when i told my therapist about my silly goofy thoughts but i guess not lol"
"I wish people would just stop telling me “ fake it ‘till you make it”, “ smile”, I’m a dental hygienist and I’m in contact with lots of patients/ children and I’m doing my best! I’m not rude, I talk/ smile/ educate/ comfort patients but apparently NOT ENOUGH,  I literally told my office manager that “ this is as good as it gets, this is my happy face”, if they only knew the darkness that is inside of me they would realize that I AM INDEED FAKING IT already, the suicidal thoughts, the darkness that takes over my mood is soo intense THIS is me putting my best foot forward. Showing up for work on time, seeing patients and being here is all I can do. PLS people out there stop trying to make us be YOUR fake ass “ happy” because what you see is the best we can do.

In another note I’m  afraid of what I’ve become after I’m done w my job.. me a social butterfly have become reclusive, almost mute, I don’t even know what to talk to people about anymore, I’ve stop desiring a partner, I’ve stop giving my opinion on things because “ who cares.. no one”, I’m 46F I wonder if this has to do with age also, I’m soon to be an empty nester and I’m afraid of being alone but this is what I’ve decided in a way bc of being hurt too deeply and also me hurting people due to my bipolar disorder in relationships. 
Yes I am on meds- I guess I’m on a low spot right now, but even when I’m on a high I still feel as if my life is empty and I’m still “ afraid” of relationship/ friendships bc I feel that I’m gonna fuxk it up or that I don’t deserve it.
Is this all there is left ?"
For years I’ve been searching for someone else who has bipolar that I can talk to and relate to. I had so many questions and I wanted to hear other people’s experiences too. When I found bipolar Reddit I finally found that comfort and was able to talk to multiple people and has put some of my worries to ease. Whoever made bipolar Reddit deserves something. A medal or the Nobel peace prize damn near. It’s helped me a lot. This is a good community of people. Most people at least.
"i miss alchohol, im on seroquel 50mg and i want to get wasted, i love drinking but i know i shouldnt please any advice"
I was speaking to someone about this and they said that's a ridiculous high dose to be on. I'm on it for mixed states and paranoia I believe
It’s midnight but I want to run around and scream. I just got paid and have already blown half of my paycheck. I’ve decided to buy a new car. Right now feels like i’m at my peak from the last few days. I can’t stop moving. I have things to do tonight and tomorrow but I don’t want this feeling to stop but I know I should try to calm down but I can’t and don’t want to.
"Procrastination When Depressed (Advice Needed)

I have a substantial amount of extremely important and anxiety inducing work I need to do.

I have been trying to work for weeks and the deadline is approaching. It feels utterly impossible. 

Previously, working/studying was my crutch. I would put all my time, effort, and focus into it. This time, though, *if* I can get myself to open my laptop, I can barely manage to look at the work before anxiety consumes me. 

Please share any tips that you have. The deadline is only getting closer, and the anxiety is only getting worse.

"Anger,

Resentment,

Never tire yourself for another!

Those who demand compress you,

Until fever dreams make for sores,

Vibrating in torment,

With ranting and writing as an exclave to contain the motion,

It beats barking like a dog at strangers,

Or spending sprees to flower my entitled ego,

How much merit am I worth?

Because I feel important!"
"I am Bi polar type one and this past year has been extremely hard.. I got married to someone who is active duty we’re separated and eventually after waiting 8 months apart for me to be rejected from going to his base in Okinawa, and we were relocated to Panama City, FL… most of the time things are great. But recent news of well deployments being a natural part of this lifestyle. I must adapt. But I can’t help but feel myself regressing back to when I was first clinically diagnosed and started to have horrible mania and then depression would sore up and crash down. Manic till I am delusional and just have a mental crash.  Or so down I can’t even get out of bed to do the dishes .. 

If anyone has type one bi polar can you let me know if you ever regressed back to old patterns even when taking medication? 

I’ve been on lumictal since I was about 14 and have been in intensive therapy at least 2 times a month (sometimes every week) at this point it’s pretty much my choice - when I feel like I need it I go more often..  i am 27 years old& (female).  
I did  learn how to sort of wrangle and manage my mania quite well up until this past year. Maybe it’s all the change..  new to marriage. New house. Away from anyone I know really.. I was always at least able to be self aware enough to know when I am actively starting to feel the mania surge like sparks through my head.. so I can stop myself from destroying everything in my wake .. 

At this point any advice would be great.. maybe I need a med change because all this new stress has just become too much? And lumictal isn’t strong enough to stabilize me anymore ? I have been on it since I was first diagnosed.. or could it possibly be that I have hit the where females go baby crazy and those hormones are greatly affecting my brain chemistry?
Obviously I am planning on consulting with my psych / and therapist about lifestyle changes etc… 
but 
I’m looking for wisdom that can only come from a professional lol. I’m looking for someone who has actually experienced this kind of regression while taking their medication regularly that USUALLY stabilizes and just please give me some advice .. I am a loss."
"The last few weeks I’ve noticed I was slipping back into an elevated state. I’ve talked to my psychiatrist and therapist, and my meds have been adjusted accordingly. But it’s getting worse - my sleep is off, I’m drinking and smoking weed again, I have urges to go have one night stands, and I’ve maxed out my credit card. I’ve tried my usual stuff to cope like focusing on cleaning or trying a class for a new hobby to get my energy out, but totally no luck. I need some advice on getting through this. It’s the worst I’ve had since my last hospitalization and I’m feeling the urge to stop seeing my providers, which I know isn’t good. I know the logical stuff to do, but I’m justifying my behavior and it’s not getting better. Does anyone have advice or words of wisdom?"
In my experience if I’m depressed alcohol brings me down further and when I’m not it brings me higher but makes me unstable. Makes me more susceptible to mood swings and does the exact opposite of what my meds are supposed to do. Makes my bipolar worse. I recommend staying away but that’s just my opinion. Does anyone agree?
Every morning I drink about 1-2 cups sometimes if I’m really tired i’ll push to 4 cups in a day. I’ve never drank coffee during a full blown manic episode though. Has anyone had any good or bad experiences drinking coffee during hypomania or mania? Does it effect you that much?
"Im on Lithium Lamictal and Gabapentin , gabapentin is mostly for my restless legs. Recently I have been feeling unstable. My dr mentioned maybe going of gabapentin and adding trileptal. But im worried if i stop gabapentin how ill manage my restless legs. My question is can i be on 4 mood stabilizers?"
"Prior to being diagnosed with Bipolar, when I was going through a period of depression or even euthymia, I thought that my baseline goal was how I felt when I was deeply hypomania/mildly manic.  I felt the most confident and joyful at that state, so I assumed that anything less than that must be some form of depression.    


I now know that that feeling of exuding confidence and complete inner joy is actually *not* normal if it is paired with impulsivity and such.  I am curious though it others assumed the same thing, that the ""normal"" that they were aiming for was actually not normal, but somewhere on the manic spectrum."
"This is something I sort of want to touch base on. I recently experienced being in the mental unit of the hospital. There were quite a few people who were seemingly screaming a whole bunch of things that did not make sense, were verbally and physically aggressive, and the way they were slurring when each of them came in made me to believe they were possibly on drugs which probably enhanced their psychosis. I made a post recently about my experiences and although I went in thinking I was dying, I got the help I needed, and actually left with a whole new perspective. I used the word “crazy” in quote marks because honestly I did not have any other word to describe the things I saw. Looking back now I guess I could have used “psychotic break” but as someone with BD, Panic Disorder, adhd, etc etc, I honestly don’t mind the word crazy if it is accurately describing someone’s behavior. Is this wrong, am I being overly insensitive as someone tried to point out although it wasn’t my intention? Lmk, googles literal definition of crazy is “mentally deranged, especially as manifested in a wild or aggressive way”.

——EDIT: I’m using the term crazy to describe behavior not a persons entire self or personality. If you feel triggered by my experience, look at why you are triggered. I used to be triggered by the word. But then I realized they aren’t describing you as a person—merely your actions. End of the Ted talk."
"just kinda. venting my frustration. i'm considered high enough functioning by my mental health team that i don't really get to have any kind of prioritization when i'm having a bad time. i've still not found a medication cocktail that keeps me stable, but i go 3 months between appointments because my psych knows that if the meds harm me, i'll just quit them and pull through the rest of the 3 month waiting period independently. there's this ""well i know you're not at risk"" hanging over my head that means i get put last so my psych can save time on not seeing me monthly to try and sort out my failing med situation. like, why do i have to be in crisis to receive treatment that doesn't deprioritize me to a 3 month wait period of suffering every time?

obviously, i'm glad that i'm not seen as a danger to myself, but i also think maybe i should receive more attentive treatment than just dismissing me to go do my own thing for 3 months? it's not like it changes anything if i call and report a dangerous reaction to a medication, either. hell i straight up ended up in the ER from lamictal and he did not move my next appointment. then gave me nothing but klonopin and told me to come back another 3 months later lmao. 

i know i'm lucky i'm not worse. i guess i just wish i was listened to. by now, i guess i should be used to this. i was too high functioning for a diagnosis until an SSRI made me think the government was reading my mind. :/ so i guess i shouldn't be expecting people to pay me much mind, they never have."
"Later tonight, one of my kids (15m) is being discharged from the hospital on an involuntary hold, after expressing an attempt to take his life to his therapist. I have BP1 and have been hospitalized a few times, but I was always a single adult who had to go to work the next day (hell, sometimes the same night) and carry on with life. 
What are some things I can do to make his homecoming as nice for him as possible? Like should I clean up his space, make his favorite dinner, have his favorite snacks on deck, or do I do nothing out of the ordinary and carry on as usual so as not to make a big deal out of it? If you’ve been hospitalized and are willing to share, what are some things that would’ve helped you with your transition back home?"
"Hello everyone, I was diagnosed bipolar 1 at 13, 3 years ago. I’m 16 now and I have not been medicated due to my mom not wanting too. Before going crazy on her my dad also suffers from Bipolar 1 and the meds they wanted to put me on were the same ones he was once on. But they did no good for him. Are there any recommendations to deal with it or control it without meds?"
"I am taking review classes to get my architecture license, which I never wanted to pursue in the first place because I love working in the field of climate change adaptation and management. My parents expect me to get my license. I started with more than 4 months to review and learn everything. Now I only have 3 months and 3 weeks left. My confidence is never in the middle, i'm either delusional that I know things or entirely down because I think I know so little. I hate it. I either give my all and obsess over things or lose all my will and just give up for the day. I feel so unstable. I have been going to both my therapist and psych since last year to get me through this, but I still feel like the odds are against me because of how mercurial I am. Anyone else experience the constant changes in their mind? Tips? Thoughts?"
"I smoked marijuana. I discovered it after self medicating with alcohol for years and it works. 

This last two weeks I'm pretty certain I was manic, my poor wife agrees, and my weed wasn't do anything for me. I could have been smoking oregano. This has happened before... has anyone noticed a change like that during episodes"

"I think I'm getting sick but it could be the meds I'm really not sure, threw up yesterday and mild breathing difficulties, I've been medicated 2 weeks and never had any issues"
"I need some help... 

Last year I had an casual relationship with this guy, both of us wanted casual and he was respectful, nice to talk and the sex was great. So after months he ghosted me and when I asked why, the answer was that I had gained weight and he wasn't attracted anymore. I actually accept that and he has the right to kick me for the reason he wants, no one has the obligation, even the motivation being really ridiculous. 
The problem is that after sometime and I couldn't stop thinking about him, everyday a lot of times for no apparent reason, I started to dream with him a lot and sometimes I just have the urge to stalk him... Yesterday I had this urge and I was trying to find him on Reddit, but it is a impossible mission without the nickname and I was searching for topics he would interact and of course I couldn't find him, so I had another dream with him and when I wake up I just felt so fucked up, because when I enter in the obsessed mode I don't know how to stop and it continues for days thinking just about him... I don't want nothing with him, don't want to talk to him, don't want to date or whatever and I don't care if him would want anything that I know he doesn't because he said that. 

So wtf is happening and someone knows what to do?

Edit: the name of the symptom is HIPERFIXATION - This post is not about the relationship, it is about the symptom and I posted because I don't know how to deal with it. So just comment if you know some forme of help me."
"I want an ESA. An ESA would do me wonders. 

In order to get a cat, I need to already have a cat that needs to be approved. I do not already have a cat because I haven't been approved to have one.

See the issue here?

And all I asked was that our local shelter hold the cat for me until I could get it approved. They won't do that. I explained my situation and everything.

I am never going to get a cat.

I feel like my landlords are making sure I have a real difficult time obtaining a cat, because legally they can't deny an ESA. So why not just make the processes such a bitch that people will likely give up."
"I gave up and lost all independence and lost myself and who I am. I'm 23 and starting from scratch again when I was 16-18 I was in and out of the hospitals rebuilding who I was and now it's been years. I gave up on therapy, friends, leaving my home it's to the point I can't even drive myself anywhere anymore due to anxiety. So I'm just wondering if anyone has advice or tips to how to get yourself back on track."
"This is my first time using Reddit so I have no idea what I am doing but I guess I am searching for clarity if I can find any.

I have been on and off with my boyfriend with Bipolar for over a year now and it's one of the hardest things I've had to deal with. I love him more than anything and I have never left his side however he always leaves mine when he has episodes. Every time he has an episode he will leave me and ghost me. He won't say anything or he'll break up with me and say nothing, and this can last for months. It typically lasts for about 2-3 months before we get back together again but the cycle always continues where something happens he gets triggered into an episode and leaves me. I don't know what to do and it is killing me.

Recently, he got a new job and started going to college (This is his 3rd attempt at college, he drops out everytime) and this new change triggered him to fall apart, and in turn he ghosted me. We have spoken two times in the past month about this and he keeps telling me how depressed and empty he feels. He feels at war with himself and he doesn't want to leave me but he can't be here for me either. I don't know what to do or how to help. I'm so lost and I don't want to break up, but I feel like he doesn't love me anymore... I just don't know what to do.

It doesn't help I have Borderline Personality Disorder so my world revolves around him and he's ghosting."
"I was healthy all my life & out of the sudden because i was so happy & in love i made myself crazy & i believed everything

"I’m sweating from scrolling through my camera roll. Extremely hard to see. 

That is all."
"I used to have (what I thought was) my best friend, who had also been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, to talk to about bipolar problems and understood them. It was great because it was finally someone who actually understood that sometimes things just happen. Turned put she was really just using me, which my twin sister pointed it pointed last. Being a twin, obviously her opinion was the one I believed the most despite the several people who pointed it out first . It's a twin thing. 

I hate therapy. I can never find a therapist that doesn't annoy me. Since finding all of these sub reddits dedicated to people with bipolar disorder coming together and supporting others I have felt less alone and crazy in this world. Reddit is my group therapy. 

I used to do old fashion snail mail pen pals with people from Facebook groups. I actually enjoyed it for a while, But eventually I stopped because I felt like I was hiding a part of my life of the bipolar. I don't have friends to talk to anymore. I was wondering if there was anyone out here in the  It would be nice to have someone to write to and talk to. United States who wanted to be a pen pal with me?"
"I (29M)was diagnosed BP1 about 8 months or so ago. I currently take 150mg of Lamotrigine, and I’m just curious if anyone has experienced changes in their handwriting specifically. I used to ALWAYS print in all caps, but as of about 2 months ago I suddenly found  myself writing in cursive as my “regular” writing. I haven’t written in cursive daily since 6th grade, and always hated doing it but now it bothers me to write any other way."
"I just wanna see if it helps. I'm so miserable and it's been months and they clearly don't do shit. If it doesn't help after a few days, I'll take them again."
My husband got a shot of Invega on Monday and ever since he sounds more and more himself. But then this morning he sounded a little hyped up again. Should I be worried? Or is this normal?
"How do you draw the line? How do you know your world view is valid?

People throw the world “delusional” at different religions, political views, general opinions and it’s just hard to know if I’m actually ~~crazy~~ or not. I don’t feel ~~crazy~~, but I know that that’s part of the disease sometimes.

I’m not actively in any episode, I just feel like being Bipolar is a form of neurodivergence and my brain works different and I don’t feel … valid? This was kind of a ramble, hopefully y’all have something to say."
"I suspect I may have bipolar disorder II. Recently I've only been depressed so my possible hypomanic episodes were 1,5+ years ago.
Does you have any advice on how to get a diagnosis? I'm currently tracking my mood.

ETA: I'm already going to a psychiatrist and getting refered to another place, I especially want to know how I can express my concerns or show proof of my different mood states."
"i got out of a suicidal depressive episode beginning of december and since then i’ve been on the come up. i started taking meds again, being consistent about it, making it to all my appointments, etc. basically doing everything to take care of myself.

it’ll be 1 year since a traumatic event happened to me next weekend and the past few weeks everything’s gone to shit. my chest has been in physical pain for a few weeks, i am so overwhelmed and feel so fragile, i tried breaking my wrist 2 weeks ago, i withdrew from school this week (advice from my therapist), and since then i haven’t been able to get out of bed. 

i think this is a trauma response and not part of my bipolar cycle but it’s frustrating to see all my progress go down the drain. i’m wondering how/if this will affect my cycles. my energy to live is depleting as the 1yr mark approaches. i’m at a loss as to what to do"
"Damn. Some days feel like they can unravel months of hard work. 

My mom got severely injured in a kitchen accident. May be partial to permanently blind. 

Served with a lawsuit. Yup, manic me had too much fun back when I was very ill. A lot of it was medical and mental health debt. Even responding to the lawsuit cost $150. Literally to file a paper saying you do or do not agree. I'm in the middle of a disability claim, haven't worked in 2 years, and don't own a thing. Damn. Isn't the life I expected. 5 years ago I was successful, owned shit, and lived a cush life. 

Help me I'm poor. (Bridesmaids quote)

Any advice? I'm tired of fighting. Ever since my onset of psychosis at work, I've been fighting. I fought a lawsuit for wrongful termination. I had to fight for unemployment, yes, even after winning a lawsuit. I had to fight for my family to get Medicaid and food stamps. I have to fight for every damn approval of medication and test. I am fighting to get a disability. I feel like every time I get close to a place of peace and ""recovery"", another battle comes up and slaps me in the face."
"I wrote this about 10 years ago and just found it on my computer.

My smile is empty yet convincing

I laugh at things that should be funny

Show mild concern when in reality I’m terrified

Wear a pretty dress; paint a pretty face 

Take my pills when no one is watching

Chuckle cynically when someone asks “how are you?” But answer, “pretty good.” 

Let down my guard, take off my mask

Simple words cut so deeply no matter how they were intended 

My chest is on fire, my mind ready to explode 

I question my reactions but what is normal anyway?

Vengeance for the uncommitted crime, capital punishment for the innocent

Need to dull the pain

Flying feels better than crying but how can I truly fly when my wings are broken?"
"Disclaimer I’m not bipolar. I don’t bash people with bipolar disorder. I don’t lump ALL bipolar people together. I don’t think every mood change or decision y’all do or don’t make has to do with being diagnosed as bipolar. I’m honestly just looking for some insight. Getting some conflicting information when I did some digging on my own. Also to be completely honest I would rather speak with folks who actually are bipolar. First hand knowledge & life experience is always the best point of view. It’s the most raw and honest in my opinion. 

With that being said is it true that people diagnosed later in life have a more difficult time? I was speaking with a family friend and he said that when people are diagnosed later in life everything is more extreme. Such as their episodes, their depressive state (if and when it occurs), finding the right medication combinations etc. Until speaking with him I didn’t know age was even a factor on the severity of symptoms. Literally never crossed my mind. He also made it a point to say manic episode last longer. Now that really has me confused because everything I’ve read says the length of a manic episode is pretty much different for each person. I don’t remember reading anything about age. Again, I’m just trying to learn. Also any recommendations on literature would be welcome as well. 

Thanks in advance for those willing to reply."
"im contemplating weather i should stop going to therapy or not, i don't feel like it's helping anymore my meds are basically doing all the work

"The author of this book lost his 27 year old son to suicide. His son Matthew battled with severe depression since childhood. He was also diagnosed with bipolar. 

I am reading this book right now and I feel like this is one of the few books which can really change lives for the better. I'm spending most of my time on the bed for a few days now after being well and active just last week. I missed a day of exercise and some bad news and baaamm! but I'm reading this book and I'm starting to feel better. 

It says when your life has a purpose, it can have meaning. We all need hope to cope. Anyone who has come across this book and found it helpful? I highly recommend it!"
"*legit questions from caring people are welcome*

BUT

Stop coming to our community and asking us belittling, disparaging, degrading, and insulting questions. 

You can't come in here and ask us if the guy/girl you are talking to is bipolar because they are moody, impulsive, up&down, etc. Maybe they just don't like you? Maybe you coming to a bipolar forum to diagnose them is the real issue? It's so annoying to have people come in here like we are some conservatory for crazy people, and we will provide you with all the facts about our wild animals. 

BP people are literally some of the brightest, kind, most compassionate, understanding, most caring, most creative, funny, intelligent, etc etc.....people on this earth. 

Yes, we have bipolar disorder, but we are not defined by what we have. We are not defined by our symptoms.

"Hi all, I’m 24 and was always known for my creativity, charisma and ability to use my networking skills to make friends and make most out of situations. I’ve also in several incidents been known for displaying a certain “chutzpah”. 

It’s gone in my favor so far for the most part but that all changed around this time last year. Every year since turning 21, I realize that during the spring/summer time, I begin having these racing thoughts and grandiose ideas, and for some reason, they always come out true. It’s almost as if I have access to information like noone else and can easily win over debates. At times, depression/regret follows but I’ve shrugged it off.

Last year, I was in a great company where I was a junior analyst but I kept getting more and more opportunities for my personality, ideas and people that believed in me. All of the sudden, it all got to my head when my boss two levels above started doing things that took the limelight away and started talking condescendingly to me saying I’m just getting started. 

This felt like a personal battle and I went into full destruction mode where I was saying the weirdest shit to my senior leadership team (some very important people) and also sent emails to the CEO and CFO. Mind you these people have their own wikipedias. 

In my head, I thought I would get rewarded for the courage but slowly everyone in the company started distancing themselves from me. I mean everyone. It was almost like I went from a rising star to delusional. 

That made me look for another job which I did end up getting and am still doing well for myself but all this made me cringe and regret everything I did and extremely sad at my downfall at the previous company. I disappointed so many people that believed in me and looked upto me. For the past year, all I think about is that downfall period where I did things I would never do. All those emails, messages, manic texts is crazy to me. 

I’m atleast now happy that I know I’m bipolar and I can try to control my manic episodes in the future and potentially use them to my advantage. I still have so much guilt and shame. 

I’m so glad I found this community. Any advice/thoughts would be appreciated. We’re all in this together."
"Is it just me, or is your hypomania sometimes triggered by new music? For me, every once in awhile, I will randomly come across a new song that I REALLY vibe with and will listen to it on repeat for 4-5 days straight. I have noticed that when this happens it’s usually accompanied by some hypomanic thoughts and behaviors. Anyone else experience anything like this? 

The last song I can remember triggering my hypomania pretty bad was a song that was featured on an episode of 'Euphoria'. After the episode aired, I immediately googled the lyrics and listened to it non-stop for days, but I remember getting a lot of work done that week lol the song was ""Haunted"" by Laura Les."

"I was in the hospital for the first time this last September. 

I feel myself going downhill again, mainly with depression. The suicidal ideations are coming back, and I'm starting to hallucinate again. 

I'm on meds, and they seemed to be working. I was like completely fine besides feeling depressed up until about the last two days. 

I'm scared I'm going to keep getting worse and I'll end up in the hospital again, it feels like I just got out. 

I just don't know what to do, I've been doing everything right. Going to therapy, taking my meds daily. I've read therapy books in my spare time. I get in my exercise, I make myself eat properly even. 

I am worried about work. They think of me highly even with the recent hospitalization. But what if I end up there again, I don't want to lose possible promotion all because I have this stupid mental illness."
"I was prescribed hydroxyzine for anxiety but I see it’s meant for allergies. Does it work? and more importantly did it make you drowsy?
Thanks!"
"You call me sick,

I feel right,

Doctor throws prescriptions,

I feel insulted,

No sleep,

No appetite,

I want to fight,

Hate hesitation,

"I haven't been in an episode for a few months at least I don't think, I haven't been suicidal or spending money or any of my usual habits. I have been really really angry at just...everything lately. Does that happen with bipolar? My doctor upped my dose of lithium to 450mg I was on 300mg, but when I had my lithium levels checked it was not in the therapeutic range. I'm currently also on Vryalar.  Once I started taking the 450 of lithium my anger just went away. Has anyone else had this?"
"Currently I am pretty sure I am in a hypomanic or manic state. I haven’t slept since yesterday afternoon (I work night shift and am a healthcare worker, so usually I’m exhausted after a 9ish hour shift and fall asleep shortly after I get home if not immediately). My mind is racing, I am cold but profusely sweating (this is a new one for me), I rattled on and on about random things to my boyfriend when I got home until he left for his day shift job, decided to FaceTime my friends and contact ones I haven’t spoken to in awhile, religiously research the most random things, almost applied for a college an hour away for a degree that I only researched in the past hour or so, ect. I took medication that usually make me severely drowsy but that didn’t even touch me. I seriously cannot calm down and I honestly don’t think any sleep is going to come to me before my next shift tonight. 

I’ve been employed at the facility for about 3 months, just getting back into the swing of things after a 6 month unemployed meltdown. I only called in for two shifts about a month ago due to migraines that I saw a doctor for and got meds to treat, but I really don’t want to be a worker that calls in all the time. I worked at a facility when I was younger and only called in twice over a period of two years, and I feel like I’m failing because I can’t seem to maintain the same functionality that I used to. I attempted to find my own coverage for the shift and then run by my boss when I already found coverage, but there was only a couple people I could ask and I was ignored by both. I did not mention during my interview that I had this diagnoses because I’ve never disclosed to an employer that I have BP before, usually I perform at my job in a way that no one would ever know. My boss is not much older than me and seems to like to have close and open relationships with the employees, some of which have been pretty open about being on medications similar to what I’ve been on in the past for BP. Is it safe to call her and explain my current situation to her?

This also worries me because she has planned extra training for me to potentially take on a supervisor position with a raise in pay, and I am extremely scared that if I’m open with her it will cost me. It pays me extremely well and I don’t want to lose the position; I am also slightly within my 90-day period in an at-will employment state, meaning they can fire me for any undisclosed reason and I can’t legally fight it on the basis of discrimination. What should I do here?"
"So uh I'm lowkey scared. My sleep has been weird the past 3-4 days. Can't sleep until like 12am to 1am and then I get up between 5am and 6am. My appetite has been low(which is a symptom for me), and I've been more anxious lately. Not a whole lot of anxiety but just a bit more. I also feel wired, which isn't good. Thing is, I have no reason to be manic? Can manic episodes happen out of nowhere?"
"I just caught  for Covid for the second time.  The first time I had it was last spring and during it I had the most extreme manic depressive episode that I’ve ever had, but I was never really sure if they were connected. I’ve never had an episode like that in my life. Today I’ve been in a lot of physical / emotional pain and cried hard a few times today which isn’t really usual for me, but I’ve been really stressed out all week so I understand why I was crying. I think feeling emotional when sick is pretty common but this is only my first day of feeling sick so i can’t speak much more on my mental stability yet. 

What’s your experience with having Covid and the connection it had to your emotions and mental state?"
"I have been a pastor for 20 years (I’m LGBTQIA+ affirming and I don’t evangelize. I want to make the world a better place god or no god). All of my job history and education is pastor stuff. Being a pastor has been horrible with my bipolar 2 and there are not any accommodations possible. 

I’m having to change careers late in life and I’m not qualified to do anything above fast food. I’ve been looking for work for six months and haven’t even gotten an interview. It’s become so hard to look for work it triggers a manic or depressive episode. My therapist tells me I am capable of working at places I’m not qualified for and that I just need someone to give me a chance. (I don’t qualify for unemployment or ss benefits)

How does someone get work accommodations in a service industry?
It just seems that the customer facing or back of house work would trigger my bipolar. 

How does someone drastically change careers with bipolar? I think about people who are teachers and how it would be hard/impossible to have accommodations. 

I feel like having bipolar is like telling your job that you will be less productive than your co-workers. 

Most of us (statistically) unemployed and will make drastically less money than people without bipolar. Why isn’t there an organization that all they do is help bipolar people with work issues (finding a job, keeping a job, mediation for employers, job training, etc)"
"TW Death and dying

I don’t know if this is a bipolar thing specifically, but this community has been really helpful so I’m reaching out here. I have bpd, bipolar 2, CPTSD, adhd, and anxiety, in case this speaks to anyone with any of the same. 

I have obsessive thoughts every single day. They can be about any number of things from winning a prestigious award to hurting someone who hurt me. Ultimately, all of these thoughts are around some sort of redemption. 

Once the thought begins, it plays out in my head over. And over. And over. No matter where I am or what I’m doing. I find myself standing in line at the gas station or in my car or doing any of the other mundane parts of life trying to hold back tears, often failing. Sometimes my brain will get stuck on a sentence and it will do the same thing, replay over and over, sometimes to the point that I accidentally say it out loud. 

I recognize these thoughts pretty quickly and I try to tell myself to stop, but my brain just won’t. These thoughts are STRONG. They’re incredibly annoying and unproductive. 

The most recent thought I’ve had has been particularly troubling…. I’ve had a lot of suicide attempts, with my last one causing damage to the corpus collosum region of my brain. Even during moments of stability, I truly believe things are not going to end well for me. Between the drug and alcohol use, the multiple prescription overdoses, and my last attempt by hanging, I am certain I’m going to come into early dementia. Dementia also runs in the family on both sides. 

I read that Bruce Willis now has dementia and is unable to communicate. The reminder sets in and suddenly I’m imagining myself with dementia by 50. But then it progresses as I remember I have a neurology appointment for a brain MRI tomorrow, and I think of the doctor telling me I only have 6 months left. Now the real obsession starts. I’m thinking about being in hospice care at 30, all my friends and family coming to say goodbye to me while I’m still here, and my funeral. Every detail is devastating. What would I say to my mom? How do I give her the strength to keep going after I’m gone? What will my funeral be like? Who will speak? Planning little gifts for everyone so they can keep a piece of me with them forever. Heart wrenching stuff to think about. 

I realize these thoughts don’t necessarily serve me, but I also understand that it may be my trauma brain that causes them. If I can predict something bad and prepare for it, then it won’t be as bad. 

Ultimately, I want these thoughts to STOP! I want to be in the here and now. I want to live my life as it is and to the fullest. Especially since I have this belief that my brain will go soon. Since we all truly have a finite amount of time left, I want my time left to be good, to make up for all of the time I’ve spent suffering. I still suffer quite a bit, but I’m doing a lot of good work and I believe there is a light at the end of the tunnel. 

If you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading, I hope this wasn’t too tough a subject to read. So, how do I stop these thoughts? What tricks do you have up your sleeve for when the obsession comes on? Even if you don’t have advice to stop the thoughts, hopeful words are greatly appreciated. Today has been heavy. 

Thanks r/BipolarReddit. I’m grateful you all are here on this planet with me, even if only virtually. It’s nice to know I’m not alone."
"I was wondering if this is a thing, so I know obsessive projects may be a thing but I was wondering if it is the same for obsessive subjects.

Like have you had hypomanic episodes where you had mad obsessions with a certain subject or person and not thinking or talking about it made you annoyed? So instead of hypomania making you always more talkative you'd only talk a lot when it was about that specific subject otherwise you'd just get irritated or try to bring the conversation to the chosen subject?

Maybe it's not related at all, but I was just wondering if perhaps any of you experience this during hypomania."
"Serious question. For me, constantly any time I’m idle or especially when I’m tired, I get the the crawlies. It’s so irritating."
"The dam is gonna break,

A tsunami of thoughts,

Can’t contain it,

A rocket that will either hit the stars or explode on takeoff,

Always spectacular and amused,

Sometimes angry and pissed,

An animal that only knows how to hump and bark,

I want to show off my feathers,

Pulsating like a lighthouse,

A light that pulls in moths,

Sold myself and hate myself,

Always smashed into a corner in these situations,

Like vultures eating off of me when things go off,

If I lose it, I lose it,

That is nothing new,

I spiral like a plane to mountain,

And I hate and love it,

It’s just heat and energy,

I’m blinded by it."
Curious if anyone taken Tylenol/codeine mix and has seen any changes in the symptoms?
"getting back into the swing of figuring out meds again and although I enjoy taking care of myself I find that if I dont necessarily in a way baby myself back to health I always end up getting distracted from myself and then fall back into bad habits so I just came to the conclusion I literally have to baby myself in order to actually take care of myself, like I either have to be fully committed or not at all LOL. it’s just annoying sometimes because I just feel like building new habits that will help out with BD is just taxing because every little thing has its own new meaning now. Idk if this makes sense or if anyone can relate. Also found out I cant smoke bud anymore with my antipsychotics because I literally was having heart palpitations and couldn’t swallow, my face felt numb (wasn’t laced) , think it was just an overkill on the smoking that day mixed with the meds and the anxiety from the heart palpitations made my heart palpitations worse and it was just a giant storm. Moving forward only going to light up a small bowl and a few hits on special occasions. It just like if I dont baby myself I fall back to weed ya feel"

"Hi everyone, I hope everyone’s doing good!! 

I’ve been with my bf for 4 months now and he knows that I’ve been to therapy in the past and that I struggled with depression but he doesn’t understand that I’m bipolar 2.

I’m currently not in therapy due to health insurance reasons but I’m coping on my own and I have good but also bad days. I struggle with irritability and the urge to pick fights pretty often and it affects the relationship to my parents but also the people around me. Sometimes a minor inconvenience can set me off and I feel like exploding but I try to walk away. It’s even harder when it affects me in my romantic relationship because I don’t know him well enough yet and I don’t want to scare him off. It’s not even like he’s doing something wrong, I just struggle really bad with irritability and I feel like the worst human afterwards.

Can anyone else on here relate to my situation? How do you deal with it?"
"Hello, all! I’m tapering off of Latuda 40 mg and will be starting Seroquel (goal of 400 mg) and wanted to know your experiences with Seroquel. Did you gain weight, if so when did it start? Do you take it at night, does it make you sleepy? If it made you tired, did it ever stop (i.e. reach a certain dosage or after 6 mos)? Latuda would knock me out about 1.5 hours after taking it and I feel tired all the time. I’m hoping this will finally be the medication that works well for me. Thanks for any input!!"
"TLDR- can withdraw it from alcohol cause hypomania??

I slipped in my sobriety and was slightly experimenting to see if I could have alcohol. I was sober for 7 months and thought I’d be okay to have a couple of drinks out to dinner. It of course increased over a two month time span to having a couple of glasses of wine or drinks a night, until last Friday was my planned last day of drinking. (I could tell my slippery slope was in full swing). It was my grandfathers funeral and I let myself get really drunk. The next day was horrible. I was sick and depressed and the anxiety was awful. Same thing the day after and the day after. I pulled it together yesterday and today with getting back to my routine and exercise. I felt semi better. But, not today, I am snapping at everything, I’m acting like I have in my hypomania moments, yelling, vicious, slamming doors, throwing things. I am EXHAUSTED. It was hard to fall asleep last night. But, I’m literally already in bed today at 8pm. So i don’t know if it’s just the alcohol withdrawal? Or is it also creeping into hypomania? Can that happen when withdrawing from alcohol? 

I’m also semi glad I had a slip up because I realized I can’t just casually drink and I realized how awful it feels to come off a substance again. I quit weed in September and went into a mixed episode a week or so later. 

I’m very glad to be on the sober train again. But, I am not loving how I’m feeling now. Anyone been here? Thanks."
"Some background on me: my father is diagnosed bipolar, sibling too. I had difficulties all through childhood and into college, ended up dropping out because of them, but found my footing in a good job. I had my first diagnosed episode in 2006 in my early 30s but had been in therapy for a couple of years by then. Classic case of a shrink prescribing Paxil and having a weird reaction (started crying and couldn't stop once I got up to therapeutic dose). Doc had me quit cold turkey and I became manic and completely unable to function. Had to use all my vacation time to take two weeks off from work to come back to earth and when I did my brain was permanently changed. 

I had been in a management position and was due for a promotion with lots of extra duties and travel, but I was barely able to respond timely and coherently to email. I had always been a little shy, but suddenly I was having full-blown panic attacks every single day. Got demoted but stayed with the company because I had been so good at my job before, but I wasn't functioning well. More and more duties were removed from my plate until it didn't make fiscal sense to keep me on (the great contraction of 2007-8) so I was let go. Very reluctantly and with a lot of grief I got on disability. I briefly tried to return to work 9 months later, in a lower-level role in the same industry which turned out to demand much more quick decision making and physical activity than my previous position, and ended up sexually harrassed and overworked and extremely suicidal. I was on a cocktail of the usual meds, which made me very situationally fuzzy. I was stalked and almost mugged a couple of times, which never would have happened before. Embarrassingly I was let go again. 

What followed were a series of therapists and psychiatrists and medications, and many hospitalizations and stints in outpatient programs. I just seemed to get worse and worse. My trauma issues from childhood frequently went untreated because I was told my mood swings were the problem. Meanwhile I became suicidal and borderline psychotic every year like clockwork. That pattern only stopped when I got my most recent p-doc. He listened to me when I expressed concern that the meds I was on were making me worse and agreed to help me get off them and start over from scratch. When we started doing that my hospitalizations became less frequent until they stopped altogether, though I did go to outpatient clinics on and off.

We worked together for about 8 years, until he retired in 2021. At the time of his leaving (yes, it felt like being left because he was the only so-called professional who had a long-term, good relationship with me) I was in a holding pattern, just taking Wellbutrin, Ativan and Ambien with Seroquel as needed (all in tiny amounts that they don't even produce pills for), but I had to quit when my scripts ran out. My primary care physician refused to touch them, and seemed offended that I asked. 

Because of how disability insurance has changed and because so many old school p-docs retired during Covid there are no private practice p-docs who will take my insurance. I was told to contact one of what used to be an emergency med clinic, where you used to go if you lost your pill bottle and needed something until your next scheduled prescription or your doc was unavailable and you needed a quick consultation or you were in crisis. Now they have become who people on disability are to go to. They don't even see people in person, just ask your history and run you through a questionnaire. 

I did call last year and start the ball rolling but when I started to ask questions about being able to choose which meds I was willing to take the doc assigned to me seemed confused and slightly exasperated (I'm not sure because it was all over the phone). I understandably have reservations about taking the wrong meds and ending up all messed up. I have major trust issues and decided to go no further with the clinic.

I am completely isolated at this point, life and friendships passed me by while I was struggling to just live, so if I started to become psychotic there isn't anyone to turn to or to catch me if I fall. I MUST remain in control of my faculties, I cannot afford the hunt-and-peck method of medicating. These days it is extremely easy to lose your apartment and become homeless or simply to get a reputation for being too weird and becoming an outcast... which has already happened because of how stressed out the pandemic made me. I don't even look like myself. 

I'm becoming desperate these days. My therapist (the only doctorate/phd who takes my insurance) is a joke (sorry, but she is. She's ""watched"" me deteriorate for three years and has nothing but her prepared scripts to say... watched in quotations because she hasn't seen my face since the pandemic started). I just got out of a bad involvement with someone who I was hoping she would help me manage, but she does not have any training or knowledge about ptsd or trauma, and I'm afraid that the stress of that whole ordeal physically hurt my brain. I've been afraid to see a doctor about my weird lopsidedness because I don't think I could stand another dismissal of ""maybe you're just depressed"".

I am currently at the end of my rope. I have a couple of choices: call the clinic again and take my chances, or stay on my own and pray for the fortitude to cobble together a management style on my own. Actually, in order to be present enough to navigate the system to be a good advocate for myself and even find the kind of support I need I need to make myself stable on my own. 

Huge ask: what non-med tools do you use to manage your head, what resources have you used to understand what you are going through, and how do you keep your head up?

If you have no advice to give thank you so much for reading this mini-screed. It helps me to try to put my experience into condensed words."
"Hi. I'm a Brazilian 42 yo man (he/him and been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder type II at 14. Also was diagnosed with Absence Complex Focal Seizures Epilepsy at 8/9.

About a coupe of years ago, 2018/2019 my diagnostic changed to Cyclothymic Disorder because of my very large bipolar cycle. I clocks at 8 years total, 4 hypomanic and 4 depressive.

Although Cyclothymic Disorder is seen like a minor version of Bipolar Disorder I don't feel like that at all.

I'm hypo now, my depressive cycle ended 2020 after starting in 2016. That was the worst. I lost everything work, M.A. Degree, Friends. And ended institucionalized for 3 months after a suicidal attempt. It was like waking up on a crater with all my life in shambles around me.

To get I worse I got a new diagnosis adding to previous one (Cyclothymic and Epilepsy), Dissociative Amnesia and Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder. Seems like my brain I a wreck, a runaway train.

After that I changed from my academic career to bread baker. Made a lot of courses last year, but now I'm feeling void, longing for a life already destroyed and hearing the clock ticking and counting down time for the next shift (2024).

I'm feeling hopeless and everything seen pointless. I tried to make plans and make time counts, but I know the cycle keeps running and the crippling depression will get me away.

I don't know what to do and some times even if I want do do something. What's the point?
I don't even remember some parts of my life and I question myself because of it and the symbiotic process that I have between every disorder.

Cyclothymic Disorder doesn't feel minor to me. At least with the boosts from all the other disorders I have.

I don't know what do do anymore and don't know how much I can take.
Part of me, a big one, didn't survived last crisis and still lying there in the crater of my previous life."
"I’m newly diagnosed with bipolar I, and am wondering if anyone else is taking the same cocktail as me. Lithium was the missing piece of the puzzle for my brain which I’m thrilled about and latuda has been really good as well. It’s weird though the things that used to bother me no longer do, i know its the lithium but sometimes i wish i cared a little lol"
"I have BP 2 with rapid cycling. I lean more towards chronic hypomania with occasional depression. 

I see many people speak of their depression as being something that keeps them from leaving their bed. Now I have absolutely had some bouts of depression where I feel like I can’t move/don’t want to get out of bed - but it’s very rare for me. More often I feel lethargic, tearful, and get very disorganized/feel like I can’t clean or keep up with things around the house. Does any one else’s depression look like this? I’m just curious."
"I’m not nuts. Every now and again, I’ll start to make out the shape of some thing moving quick in my peripheral; then it’s gone just as quick.

I‘ve *had* audio and visual hallucinations before. This feels weirder. I can just about make an outline then the “object” softens and it’s gone again.

I’m not seeing shadow people… it’s more along the lines of movement? I don’t feel watched or spooked out like the other times.

Do y’all see odd things on occasion?

Edit: phrasing"
"Just started geodon a few days ago. I’m taking 20mg for now. I take it with dinner and I feel fine.

I took it with lunch at 2PM though and then around 6PM I felt pretty overwhelmed by a skin crawling feeling. It was hard to put makeup on and be at a gathering at dinner with friends.. i had to leave early. 

It reminded me of the akathesia I was experiencing on Latuda, but not as intense. It lasted until 9PM. 

I have to increase to 40mg next week for lunch and dinner. 

Did anyone experience this feeling on geodon and did it go away for you? 

I really want a weight neutral med to work out :( aaah…"
"Has anyone had a cocktail like this? Diagnosed BPII but may be moving to I because I’ve had hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions. Nothing too out there though. I also have GAD apparently, don’t remember being diagnosed till they mentioned it today, ADHD, and possibly BPD. My depressive episodes have been trying to kill me lately, and my reactive mood has put tension on my relationships and job. I really want to climb out of this hell. I hope I hear some positive stories with this combo and hope everyone finds recovery at some point"
"Hi, I am on 150mg lamictal for bipolar disorder and have been for about a year. I am looking into floating in an epsom salt float tank and read online that it is not recommended for people prone to seizures or who are on anticonvulsants. Has anyone ever been in a float tank and what was your experience? Thanks!"
"Edited to add (because some people might misunderstand): I am not promoting being unmediated. I am asking if there is anyone in this sub like me. Please don't downvote me. 

 tried for 15 years to find meds that worked for me but I never did. I'm one of those people who got the rashes, the swollen tongue, passed out when standing, etc. etc. Are there any other nonmedicated folks in this community? Is there one out there? I don't want to be disruptive but I also could use support without ""adjust your meds"" being the default answer people go to. I have been considering getting back on the merry-go-round but since my very personal psychiatrist retired last year only impersonal, meet by phone doc clinics is available to me and I'm scared of mistreatment. But regardless of that I'd love to have a place to talk."
"Something’s coming. Elevated mood, very optimistic, sleeping 7-8 hours on sleeping meds though. Hopefully this is just hypomania but I’m lucky enough to get psychotic feature with my full blown episodes. Hopefully this is only hypomania."
I’ve had multiple manic episodes in my life. 3 years ago I had an episode with psychotic features and I probably should’ve been in the hospital. My mood is elevated and I’m taking medication to sleep now so hopefully it’s hypomania coming. How often do you get manic episodes? I am actually curious  I want to here it all.
"I really just need some to talk to I may not reply back fast im about to start work but I need help I feel like im doing good in life parents notice im ""happy "" but really I real hate me life I drink alcohol and when I stop for a month or to ill start cutting my self intend of drinking and I don't know why deep down im sad and not wanting to life I got a new car im holding a job im being a adult but im still not happy iv focus on me tryed to work on my self and it hasn't work out im considering on getting a therapist but iv gone tho 4 all ready and its such a pain to wait that you for reading this im 21 M by the way"
"EDIT 2: /r/bipolar is back open! Locking this thread.

-------------

Hello beautiful people. 

First thing I saw when I got up this morning was a message in the mod inbox asking why /r/bipolar was closed. I ventured over there and, sure enough, the subreddit has been set to private.

A comment on a thread on this subreddit indicated that the mod team is working on an internal issue to the sub, but that's all we know. We were not informed of the closing and we have no knowledge of when it might open back up.

For the time being: If you're here for the first time, welcome. Please read the rules and engage respectfully with the community, use the report button or modmail as necessary, and we'll be here to support you.

*Please keep all discussion of /r/bipolar's closing to this thread, to avoid flooding the subreddit. I will be removing other threads relevant to this issue to consolidate discussion.*

Again, we have no knowledge of what caused the closure, but we are here to support you until it reopens, and further on if you choose to stay.

EDIT: A statement has been released by one of the /r/bipolar mods:

""We absolutely hate having to take these actions of privatizing the sub but, it was, unfortunately, necessary as a result of a brigade attempt.

""We are currently investigating this issue further and are in communication with the site admins in an attempt to resolve this issue. 

""We ask at this time that if you have received any unsolicited DMs regarding dietary advice you please send them to us. If possible, please take a screenshot and send us an Imgur link so we may properly document it.

""This ""dietary advice"" offers suggestions that involve starving yourself and skipping meals. This advice is incredibly harmful, and we do not allow the promotion of disordered eating. The accounts responsible for this brigade intentionally reached out to members that have posted about weight gain as a medication side effect recently. The goal is to target vulnerable members of this community and cause harm, and we will not allow that.



""We are unsure of the total number of accounts that are messaging members, and we are unsure of what other harmful ""advice"" they may also be spreading. We were nearly at a point where we felt comfortable reopening the subreddit but received information that made it clear that it was not an appropriate time.

THANK YOU to the /r/bipolar team for doing what's necessary to keep your community safe. We'll be on the lookout here too."
"I’ve been changing my medications/trying to get them right along with therapy, but it seems like every minor inconvenience is magnified. I’m on disability at 32 and my career is gone. I live with my parents. I have no significant other and no friends here. No car. I’m slowly rotting away. 

I feel ugly. I think I’m a bad person, I don’t have any redeeming qualities anymore. I don’t like myself and I don’t expect anyone else to either. 

Im just so sad. I wanted a family/kids, a home and a solid career. I wanted stability in my life - enough that would keep me from constantly wondering about the what ifs & the should’ve could’ve would’ve’s. 

I have so much regret in my life. I can see clearly now how one small decision can change the entire trajectory of your journey. 

I have failed at being a daughter, granddaughter, sister, niece, cousin and friend. 

People only check on me because they know I’m bipolar. They check to make sure I’m still here / not in a facility somewhere — they aren’t checking to catch up on life or to talk about lighthearted things. Not to meet up for dinner and drinks etc… it’s just to make sure I’m still alive. It’s been an entire year now in the deepest depression I’ve ever felt - after the worst manic episode of my life. Everything was destroyed & I mean e v e r y t h i n g.

At the end of the day I think I just exhaust people. Nobody wants to be around this and I understand. I don’t want to be around me either."
"Tl;dr: I’m hypomanic and didn’t sleep last night. Today I was so fine that I even impressed my new hard-ass boss. I have Adderall and weed at my disposal for fixing my sleep schedule after this, but does anyone think that I can go another night without sleeping and be fine for my language lesson at 9am, then relax for a couple of hours, then work a 9 hour shift at a job where my primary goal is fixing other people’s problems?

I do also have Adderall as a boost and can consume large amounts of energy drinks if need be."
"I’ve been feeling pretty hypo. Haven’t been sleeping. Today feels like the tip of the iceberg. I just drank a dr. pepper- first caffeine I’ve had in days. I feel tired now? Is that normal or is it a false tired?

"I’ve been on lamictal (200mg) for four years. I just started seroquel over a month ago after failed attempts with lithium and abilify. For the first time in YEARS I am not only stable, but I am happy. I always have trouble noticing my hypomania but I’m probably hypomanic as well, but I still feel stable which is amazing. The seroquel really obliterated my lows and depressive states. But, I’ve had the worst rapid weight gain and appetite changes. I’ve had an ED (atypical anorexia) for years, so I’m not used to eating heavily or much at all. Seroquel makes me binge so many calories before bed and I feel so guilty and horrible. It’s gotten worse and worse and worse and I desperately called and reached out to my psychiatrist who kind of shut me down and told me to stick with the seroquel regardless of the rapid weight gain. It has, and still is taking the worst toll on me.. though the seroquel helps emotionally, I’m battling a really evil battle with my self image and appetite changes. I don’t know what to do. I stopped taking the seroquel (200mg) in desperation but I had the worst nausea and withdrawl, so I am currently still taking it. 

If anyone at all relates or has had a similar experience please share. I feel so alone.. I know I’m bound to be thrown into a depressive state soon. I just feel it. What can I do? Can I be prescribed something to stop the weight gain/appetite change?"
My mood is elevated and I can’t sleep unless I take sleeping medication. Stuff is about to happen and I’m a little scared. I don’t want to have psychotic features again. Any advice to cope or ease the episode would be great.
I’m sleeping 7 hours night because I’m taking sleeping meds but I can tell something is up. I’m having weird mood swings of irritability throughout the day. I’m very optimistic at times which is unusual for me. Nothing severe luckily. I’m just scared it can become a manic episode with psychotic features again. Any advice? I see two therapists and I’m in constant contact with my doctor.
I'm approaching menopause probably within the next year. I've noticed that my schizoaffective disorder symptoms have changed a lot in the last few years and I am just wondering what experiences people may have had with these hormonal changes and whether starting HRT was beneficial or if they found it made their bipolar worse. Any tips or advice is greatly appreciated.

I have been consistently exhausted for months now since I went back on meds. I have no desire to do anything other than lay in bed. I’m relatively stable but miserable. Is there any way I can be stable and have any energy?
Hey y’all. How do you manage fatigue from antipsychotics? I don’t think it’s the only thing contributing to my fatigue but I think it definitely impacts it. I could sleep 12-15 hours a day and still feel tired. I’m at the end of my rope I feel like I have to plan my whole life around sleep.
"I started titration up to 200mg in August. I'm not sure if it's the hard water, in the place I moved to last year, just been whittling my hair down or the lamictal. I just recently noticed my hair has gotten drastically thinner. I haven't been pulling out clumps but I have had strands coming out with every pass through in the shower unlike usual. Anyone have wisdom?"

My doctor said I can't take it after 6pm won't be home until 8 what should I do? Will I be fine
I know nobody is a doctor but i kind of wanted some feedback from people with experience. I have been diagnosed bipolar 1 with psychotic features for a couple years now buuuut i have severe paranoia and hallucinations and lose touch of reality during manic and depressive episodes which apparently psychosis in bipolar is only during 1 mood. Tried talking to the psychiatrist but they didn't seem to really take it into consideration. What do y'all think?
I recently am out of the hospital (3days ICU and 4 in psych) after an attempt which was preceded by a concussion. I'm now on 300mg of Seroquel. My dreams feel like an alternative world and I'm getting confused on what's real memory and not. In this alternate world my mom has died and it's leaving me with this sick to my stomach feeling that she's gone(though she's still alive). What should I do I'm so confused and sad
"The anniversary of my mom's death is coming up on 2/21. (Believe me, dying was the best thing she ever did for me.) We had a codependent, abusive relationship and I think this anniversary - 8 years - is triggering something in me, in my brain. 

Is that a thing?"
"I didn't think I was until the third day in a row of not being able to get out of bed. Normally I sleep for about 5.5 hours (always been an issue since childhood), but last night I slept 10 hours. I would be alarmed if I had the energy to be. I can barely hold a thought in my head, much less get anything done. It makes me panicky to look and feel so out of it. I feel so alone when it gets like this and that's when those dark thoughts start to come in, when I feel locked away from others. 

I have class by zoom (going back to school after a very long time away is a small victory) tomorrow morning and I am grateful to have something to focus on, but I'm scared of the rest of the day. I have some major issues I'm trying to work out and feeling this bad is turning difficulty into a nightmare scenario."
"I forget what it’s like to feel and be absolutely nothing. Except anger and frustration at the smallest little things, because why wouldn’t my brain just throw those in as the only feelings. I hate that no matter what I’ll always cycle back to this. Being in this state is horrible."
I’m worried that my bipolar disorder will get in the way of my job again and I don’t want that to happen. I work full time and I’m probably not going to climb the ladder any higher than I am now. I feel like I have some serious restrictions on me for being bipolar. Higher paying job comes with more stress and idk if I really want that. I want the money of course just not the stress.
Anyone tried both. Thoughts?
My sleep is off and spring is right around the corner. I’m hoping it doesn’t trigger anything else in me or cause a manic episode. I hope I pray.  Does anyone get spring time mania?

I have to start traveling quarterly soon and I’m also about to have some type of episode. Does anyone get anxiety from traveling for work?
"I worked for a while in indie development but I was scared of the joining the workforce due to concerns that “crunch” would be too much pressure.

All nighters and weird sleep would definitely make me manic.

However, I was thinking of trying it again.
Does anyone have success?
What are tips to find a flexible workplace or jobs?
What learning path is best to get there?

My background is iOS development.
But, I heard javascript is a better path as it’s much less limiting and easier to break in entry level.

I also worry that I may be too old at 35.
Any words of support or advice would be helpful.

I’m also worried about them being understanding if an episode happens.

Do your employers know about your condition?"
"I've heard that mania eps are followed by depression, but is it also possible to have just depressive episodes? I've noticed my depression getting worse without any recognizable trigger or reason so I was wondering if this is attributed to my bipolar disorder or just how depression is sometimes."
"I have been on effexor 75mg for 2 weeks and I can't sleep much now. Earlier in the week I slept 5 hrs and was basically fine. Seroquel didn't help much and so I didn't take it last night. I slept for 3 hrs last night and am full of energy today. I have lots of restless energy and can't focus on anything. I am very agitated. Does this sound concerning, or will it pass?"
What happened to the other bipolar sub?
Does anyone experience worse symptoms after the sun goes down? I’ve always attributed it to “I’m tired from the day” but even on days where I’ve done nothing but lay around my symptoms are still worse pretty much immediately after the sun goes down. This has been an issue in the winter when the sun sets at 4:30pm (16:30) where I live. I’ve heard of sundowning in cases of dementia but wasn’t sure if it was applicable to bipolar disorder.
I’m taking sleeping pills because without them I sleep 3-4 hours. With them I’m sleeping 7-8 hours but I’m feeling more happy than I usually am. Could this be potentially another hypomania episode? Has anyone experienced this before?
"Stuff has been messed up for me lately and I'm trying my damnedest to keep on the level, but ... fuck could I use some support. That being said I can't take any more time from school. Everytime I do it fucks my housing or financial security even more and getting out of a hospital to end up houseless isn't exactly going to help keep me on the level."
"Have anyone here done something similar?
I “woke” up from my manic episode a couple of days ago. Feels like the whole period is a blur of sorts.
I now realise what I’ve done, I ended up with 3 new tattoos on my arm. I don’t hate them, one of them is very symbolic of bp disorder but not if you don’t know. In my “regular” state of mind I wouldn’t do them, but yea now my right arm is covered in 7 tattoos, just glad I like the other 4 from before…
Have anyone here done something similar?"
I had a bad mania episode with psychotic features in 2020 that changed my life. It’s almost like it scarred me and shaped me in a way. I’m not the same person I was before it happened. Has this happened to anyone else?
"Hey y'all, was just curious if anyone has experienced any visual side effects from taking this drug? Currently I'm dealing with some unusual vision differences since I had been prescribed the generic version of Topamax, and I'm unsure if it's the medicine, my brain is just different now, or if my vision is affected. 

The best way I can describe it, is it's like being high without having gotten high. Things seem darker (kind of like how they look in a dream) and I get the feeling of intoxication while 100% sober. I do smoke at bed time to help relax and fall asleep so I am also considering that maybe the medicine and the thc affected something.  

I'm taking a little break from the medicine to see if the symptoms would elevate but so far it just seems better but not gone (like 80% still affected I'd say). I started my break 2 weeks ago and thought by now I'd feel some relief."
"I had to wake up extra early, had two cups of coffee.

Cannot get rid of the Seroquel fatigue.

Feels as if I never had them.

So now I'm frantically waiting (I have to be somewhere very soon) for the Seroquel to wear off. 

Anyone have similar experiences?"
"Update: I disclosed to my employer since we are unable to have time off without a doctor's note and I was asked to resign. I'm still being considered for the job I wanted at the same company that isn't having a training class until next month so hopefully that pans out. I'm tired of this endless cycle of losing jobs just after getting into a routine and feeling okay. I finally got a break and now it's going to look to my family like I'm not trying and I don't think I can take anymore guilt as hard as I have been working on my mental health.

Hey guys, I posted the other day in an absolute fucking rage. Well I get it now. I know this date comes up every year but it still blindsides me because I think I've moved past it. I saw the upcoming date on a sign yesterday and it all clicked. So for my friends with PTSD as well as bipolar, how do you cope with anniversaries? 

After what happened (this year will be 5 years) I went into a mixed or manic episode, I'm not really sure, where I was having paranoid thoughts and lashing out at people because I thought they were thinking bad things about me. I got hospitalized for a bit. I do have bouts of paranoia throughout the year but it's always worst around this time. I take risperidone as needed because I'm not prescribed benzos anymore because of abuse and I actually brought it to work with me today even though I know it'll make it impossible to do my job. I just can't fathom going through another day like yesterday. I'm not really a crier, I want to cry sometimes and I just can't. Yesterday I was near tears over every little thing. Everything either annoys me or startles me. I think I'm definitely going into a mixed state. I only got a few hours of sleep last night because I woke up in the middle of the night with pelvic pain so severe I couldn't go back to sleep. Now I'm wondering if I just made that up because I'm so stressed. I feel so close to asking my boss for at least a day off because I can't handle this, I'm crying in my car at 7am in the parking lot. But I work in sales and everyone's motto is leave your baggage at the door and get on the phone. I really try but it's so hard when this is the baggage. I don't want to have to disclose my bipolar to my workplace but it's the only way to get excused time off without a doctor's note. I'm moving to a new job next month and the recruiter mentioned that since I don't like sales, I can take time off between the jobs. I think I'll talk to her today."
"My parents (62) and I (26) are taking care of my brother (33) this week while he’s having a manic episode, caused from him being laid off from his job. We’re on day 4 right now and so so so tired. We’re trying to keep him on a routine. My parents are at a stand-off at this point and want to go in different directions. My mom wants to keep him at home and stick with the routine until he starts improving. My dad wants to take him to a mental facility. I have no idea what to do. 
Should we keep riding the storm ourselves and making sure he take his meds or get professional help and admit him?

But I’m working full time remotely at home and can’t focus with him here too. I cannot move my workspace out because I have to work with multiple screens on a daily basis in my job. 

But my brother isn’t getting better. He’s still waking up at 3:30 am and turning all the lights on in the house and so we’re all up at 3:30 am too. We’ve moved the Alexa so he stops cranking music at full volume but he’s found CD players, record players, etc and is constantly playing that. 

I’m so tired and sleep deprived as well. I don’t feel like any help to my parents because I have to be in my own workspace for 8 hours. It’s affecting my work performance this week as well and don’t really know if I should mention this to my boss, because I don’t want it to seem like I have an unfit environment to do my job (but I somewhat do, JUST THIS WEEK). And I can’t go into my office because it’s hours away from me.

This is my turning into a rant. Sorry I’m sleep deprived! I don’t know what to do help."
How do you deal with lack of impulse control? It seems that I am self-sabotaging at every turn. Planning on going to the walk-in clinic tomorrow. This has gotten entirely out of hand.
"hi, i just wanted to ask if anyone else has experienced something similar to this. i recently (and by recently i mean 2 days ago) became CONVINCED i had rabies and that I was dying because my private school’s cat (meaning that this cat no interaction with anything outside of our campus) scratched my joggers. Rabies is REALLY rare in my country, and practically non-existent in my city. i told my mom to drive me to the hospital and she refused, so we got into a fight. the next day, in the morning, i asked again which escalated our fight even more. She gave me an Ativan, which calmed me down for a few hrs. We already had a psychiatrist appointment that day, so we went. When we told her about this incident, she said it was Mania fueled and a psychotic attack. (Idk how to directly translate what she said from my native language but it’s very similar to this) however, I thought BP2 only had hypomania with no signs of psychosis. Is it possible for my BP2 to have evolved into BP1? Also, if anyone could share their experiences that are similar to this it could really help. Thank you :)"
"Looking through photos today to make a Valentine’s Day post for my husband. Found a photo of myself from early last summer right before I was admitted into the psych ward. I had been in a multiple month mania psychosis at the time it was taken. I am beyond thin and my eyes are bugging out of my head. So crazy to see how far I’ve come from then. Cheers to all of us, just trying our best to survive."
"For some reason it has been getting difficult to communicate with people at work. I have meeting occasionally throughout the week and it’s hard to participate in some of these meetings for some reason, I don’t feel shy but it’s difficult to get a few words out sometimes. Does any else experience this?"
Hello! I might start on lamictal or abilify and was wondering if anyone have any experience on them that they want to share? I’m currently tapering off Seroquel because of drowsiness and weight gain and am wondering if that is common with lamictal or ability too?
"Bipolar Type 2: On meds. They work great

Escitalopram; prazosin; lamotrigine; Abilify. 

It’s been a hell of a year. July I lost my Pa, August I had an accident that gave me a small brain injury/concussion. Then have been dealing with my grandmas dementia since then. I also lost my job this month. I’m doing what I can. My routine is gone, I get sad and alone sometimes. But I’m still getting up and running errands and getting through my days. I hope these meds don’t start failing because I’m slightly a wreck."
And will I lose my job?
Anyone want to vent about their apathetic psychiatrists? You know the ones. They almost seem done with their career field. Youre just another patient to check off the list for that day. Are they really listening? Who knows.  Do you like your newest psychiatrist? I do! Keep taking your meds and eventually youll find a good one!
"Do you think that bipolar is reason for some of your wrong decisions? I have been with people who gave me security when in depression, feeling holpless and looking for anybody to help me. Also I've been with people in mania because I was angry for previous experiences and didn't care about anything. Now I feel guilty."
"i am dx with bpd, adhd, and bipolar 1. 

I think i feel happiness so intensely because of my bpd it can mimic mania especially with my adhd in the mix and insomnia, and ive come to the conclusion the episodes i had when i was younger that included psychosis were caffeine induced ( i was drinking WAY too much coffee, and i think thats why it lasted months on end ya know. )   

i haven't been on medication in a month ( maybe longer? ) and i think my brain is finally fully detoxed from that shit because im the happiest ive ever been"
"Am I just being too sensitive to them? I have major side effects from all medications I've been on so far. The only ones that work on my mind destroy my body. It's like I have to sacrifice my white blood cells, platelets, immune system, prolactin levels, hair, or a number of other things for happiness.

I've heard of people being on the same med for a long time. I want to do that. Like be able to stay on the same medication for 20 years like some people. How many do most people try?"
"I’m was on 2.5mg of olanzapine and have tapered and am nearly on half of that but I don’t really feel much emotion, like I don’t feel much from movies and music. Who’s emotions came back when off it or when you got to 1mg if you did a slow taper? Was there anything that helped boost emotions in the meantime? Any help would be greatly appreciated."
"I was just recently diagnosed properly with Bipolar disorder which came as a huge blow to my family and myself. It gave me a bit of clarity but I’m still trying to wrap my head around things. 
Does anyone else feel guilty when they speak to their loved ones about what’s going on in their mind? 
Like I’m having a very low day but don’t want to tell my mom because she worries type deal?"
"All of my hospitalizations have been involuntary and emergency level.

When I have been in the hospital, there were always a lot of people who were there for non-emergency reasons such as major medication changes or they just felt that they were destabilizing.

What are some guidelines around going to the hospital without it being an emergency?  I don't want to be jumping into the hospital on a regular basis lol but I would like to avoid involuntary status in the future."
"Every night I take 500mg of Seroquel and if the med does its job I will be partially sedated. However, right now I'm sitting in a hospital waiting room and my brother is in surgery receiving his new heart. I don't want to be asleep when we get the call about how surgery went and how he is doing. He has been in for 6 hours and he will most likely be in for another 6... I'm not sure what to do though, I will take my other meds because they don't have the same effect. I was thinking of possibly taking a smaller dose. Any advice would be appreciated."
"I'm bipolar 1, diagnosed about 30 years ago. Since I had a psychotic episode 15 months ago, I can't seem to get back to stability for any length of time. Around Christmas, I decided I needed to try a new approach. I continued to work with my pdoc, adjusting my meds and agreeing to a reduction in work hours down to 3 days a week. I started seeing a naturopathic doctor to see if she had any suggestions on things I could do to improve my situation, and we added some supplements as well as being more consistent with exercise. My therapist also made some suggestions, including journaling and stress-reducing techniques like massage and mindfulness.

I've been implementing all of these strategies for over 6 weeks. I actually feel worse now. My sleep is not at all restful, I wake up many times during the night. I have this low level nausea that never seems to go away. I'm extremely irritable and angry much of the time. When I'm not irritable or angry, I don't feel much of anything, unless I allow myself to think about my current mental situation and I start crying. I've been isolating myself more from friends and family, even my husband, because I just can't be open with them about how I'm feeling. (When I've tried to explain to my husband how I'm feeling, I can't really express myself clearly and he's told me he doesn't know how to help me and just ends up feeling helpless and frustrated.)

I'm definitely in a bad place, and I'm starting to feel hopeless because I really don't know where to turn now. Does anybody have any suggestions on what else I can do? I'm not quite suicidal, although it has crossed my mind, so hospitalization seems a bit aggressive at this point.

I am open to any suggestions you all may have."
"Everday hurts, everyday I ask myself why am I still here if i’m all alone. Last year I had the biggest manic episode that completely destroyed ALL of my relationships, I went off on people saying nasty things to them via social media it was horrible looking back. I logged into my old facebook today and read all the messages i sent to people while I was manic, people actually think I’m crazy which is sad. The saddest part before my manic episode i was having the best year of my life and it all came crashing down. I’m 27 and shit is just going bonkers. I can’t seem to shake it off, as much as I try to forgive myself. I literally have no friends which is super isolating - ive tried to explain to people what occured but some people don’t get it nor do I get them to it’s complicated. I don’t know how I’ll live longer with all of this grief in my hands."
I’m going to eventually taper off my benzo’s and find other medications but I’m not there yet. I will listen to my doctor for sure when tapering off benzo’s but I’ve heard such horrible story’s and potentially causing mania. Can someone give me some insight into your experience?
"I've just recently read more on BD and I think someone from my family might have it. Before suggesting anything to them, my question is: How has your life changed after the diagnosis? Was it better before knowing? Or is it better now? Do you feel like having a diagnosis became part of your identity and took over your life? Or is it better now that you have some clarity?  


Also, from your experience or what you heard, is it possible to heal BD? (Serious question, I know what google says)

I'm still looking to understand how I can best support my loved one. Thanks for your help!"
"Nobody ever wants to talk to me. Ever since I was 12 in school everyone would avoid me. When smart phones came out everyone had their seperate group chats with everyone except me in it that would be super active and the one with me in that wouldn't be active. The exact same thing happened to me in college. I really don't understand it, I'm always nice to people and even when I try harder it gets me nowhere. Recently I even messaged a cousin to say hi since it was a long time since we talked and I got left on read after one reply. 


I don't get it at all. I really love talking to my family and husband and my 1 friend I have and I'm full of chat. I'm very open and honest too, I never fake interest and I'm always very genuine. It really frustrates me. One problem I know is I'm very shy and can't do eye contact and all that but when I get comfortable with people I get chattier"
"I'm terrified to be treated badly by a psychiatrist again. But now I see clearly that I need to take the chance.

I started off my post with a basic question about a weird symptom I was experiencing.  To give context, I wrote out more and more of my history with mood swings, depression, and what I think was some form of psychosis. 

Seeing it all on the page made me realize this is serious. And thank you all for sharing here, I wouldn't have connected all the dots if it weren't for your stories. 

I don't think I'll share that post I wrote because it's got a lot of identifying information. My psychiatrist appointment is in a couple weeks."
"I find that I'm currently having a really difficult existential crisis. The whole world feels ""discovered"" to me. I find myself obsessing over the meaning or lack thereof of everything. I am needing to rebuild my whole conception of reality because my brain essentially threw everything in the trash.

But what remains an ongoing mystery to me is my own disorder. I don't even know for sure if it's bipolar or schizoaffective. None of the doctors do. There is no objective way for them to test me, and I don't want to pay for another analysis. I could have a fatal disease of any kind, completely undiscovered. I'm deeply frightened by the unknown.

I'm a hypochondriac AND have bipolar, among other things. I am horrified by the medication side effects or the possibility of more severe effects. I worry about dying every day, or having a severe crash as a result of the medications. I'm also afraid of bipolar itself. The mysteries of mania. The fact that we know so little, and many of the treatments for me are so ineffective.

Every time my muscles twitch or my back hurts I'm afraid that there isn't enough blood flow there, or there's some hidden disease destroying me slowly.

I'm just riddled with fear. Chronic, constant fear. I want to feel secure but I can't be. Both because my mind and the outside world seem so volatile. The only thing that feels safe is sleep or death, and only one version of death, the one where everything stops and I never exist again. That is comforting.

I am *not* suicidal, but I am insecure and feel unsafe while alive. I feel burdened by how much I don't know and how much I do know."
"I’ve been on my mental health journey with my psychiatrist for 1.5 years. We had me stabilised on quetiapine daily quickly, which I was very grateful for. I trialled 3 different SSRI’s in that time period (zoloft, prozac, lexapro) and hadn’t felt a positive effect on any of them. Zoloft actually contributed to my first manic episode. 

My psych is now trying me on an SNRI (Effexor), I’m coming on one month, and I’ve felt better than I’ve felt since I was 14 (F,25). I can’t remember the last time I actually had motivation to do anything. 

The only thing is, it has made my sex drive disappear completely. I also can’t cum. I’ve never been able to with a partner but always by myself. I haven’t had an orgasm in a month and it’s killing me. But I also finally feel a sense of peace. 

Idk, what would you all do? It could easily be 2 years before I find another anti-depressant that works like this."
"Lamotrigine (lamictal) appears to suppress my mania instead of raising my depressive episodes and I’m not super sure why. Does this happen with anyone else? My psychiatrist is saying that raising the dose should help with my depressive episode currently but since i started taking it about a year ago, i’ve only had experience with it suppressing my manic episodes."
"Things have not been great for a while now. I've been bouncing between depression and mania and I'm fucking tired. Ive been making questionable decisions and now my life feels out of control. I don't know what to do now. I'm feeling suicidal because I feel like I'm ruining my life and I don't see another way out. Any support is appreciated. If I go to the hospital I'll have to figure out work and how to explain it to my loved ones, which is what scares me the most. They think I've been doing so great and I don't want to disappoint them."
You run into all sorts of different people whether if it’s at work or online. I’ve found that those certain special people that just seem like their lives are miserable and have nothing better to do with themselves and you just gotta be nice to them and keep the peace. Their lives are probably god fucking awful. I feel bad for them. Kill them with kindness and bury them with a smile :) does anyone have any experience they want to share? I’d love to hear your story  this one guy at work does nothing but take shots at me and he knows I have a mental illness. He doesn’t know what though.
"My Dr put me on 300 mg of Lamictal, up from 25 mg. Yesterday was the 1st day. Took it in the morning, did okay during the day. Started to get sad around 9 and then it was just horrible. I was scared to go into the kitchen, because knives. I didn't sleep at all - it was like I was trapped inside my brain. I cried myself hoarse .... 

Today, I am cutting up the 300 into 4ths and taking one. I know better than to just not take it. 

I called out of work and ... Yeah."
"Ever since I was 16, I had this vague idea that the lows of depression were the most dangerous state when it comes to suicide. Maybe I never thought about it clearly, or maybe the dramatization of suicide in stories created that association and reinforced it. But 16 years later, I'm more worried about accepting that suicide is a considerable outcome with a clear head.

I used to think that if I was unaffected by my mood, then I'd be able to deal with life's problems, but I think I may have lost that hope or motivation.

I'm unfamiliar with this state, so I'd appreciate it if someone could share a coping mechanism, so that I'd have more things to consider and try.

Thank you for even taking the time to read."
"So, I've done a lot of work to recover from a particularly nasty bout of mania in 2022.

I'm 19 (soon to be 20), so I'm still figuring all this out.


Just had a **huge** opportunity come along (check my recent  post history if you're curious).


I feel less hopeless, and things are finally looking good.


I'm wondering if things will stay this way?

I really don't want this stupid illness to screw things up (again).

I'm wondering if I should stay vigilant, or if I should just allow a good thing, to be a good thing.

I could use some advice on how to keep this illness at bay, I really need things to go smoothly. I *really don't want to blow this opportunity*.


Thanks guys."
"Study in replies

I would not do this to my child if he/she/they had autism wtf no. I want your honest opinion on this cauae it really looks like a bad idea imo."
"It’s something I’ve only noticed in my later episodes of depression and panic attacks, after many years of the like, but I’ve been finding that I forget a decent portion of any times I’m under emotional stress. 

I’ve recently had a week long depressive episode, the lowest and longest in a while (my mood has been up and down for a while, normally 4-7 days relatively functional, then the same severely depressed). I’ve realised that I can’t really remember much of the week. My memory is patchy, and I don’t know whether it’s the fact I’m sleeping so much or something else. But in recent years I’ve remembered less and less of each of my depressive episodes. 

This is the same for panic attacks, however. My last major panic attack I had a huge breakdown and cried for hours after. I had a huge rant too, mostly emotional nonsense about my situation, and after coming out of it, I can’t remember almost anything I said. I roughly remember who was there, but don’t know at what points some people showed up, and I only have vague memories of what I spoke about. To the point where I had to ask people if I’d been rude and what I’d said because I genuinely couldn’t remember if in my emotional nonsense if I had offended anyone (someone insinuated I did but I don’t remember it). 

I see a lot about memory and concentration issues with depression, and I certainly relate, but I haven’t seen anyone really talk about weeks or months being patchy, or only having vague senses of what I said or did during a panic attack. These days I’m finding my depressive episodes and panic attacks coincide with pretty bad dissociation, but I’ve remember periods of (albeit rather mild) dissociation in the past. 

Anyone else experience this? Is this my brains way (along with bad dissociation) of trying to cope after 9 long years of severe mental health issues? It feels like my brains only method of survival is to just completely shut down?"
"I'm trying hard to keep this job, even though it's really f*cking with my mental health. It's a call center environment, doing customer service for one of the big insurance companies in California. 

But, I'm coming to the realization that I need some help! Maybe less hours or ... something off the phones? 

I don't know what I can ask for. Any ideas?"
I’ve had restless legs ever since I’ve been on antipsychotics and I lost 55 pounds from walking in circles around my apartment. Great exercise lol  also eating a lot less. Can you tell me if you experience this at all with your antipsychotics? What meds have you taken to cope with it? My antipsychotics are keeping me stable so I don’t want to change them.  I’m on 3mg of klonopin a day for it.
"Last year was shitty. Turned 30 and couldn't get out of bed for 2 days because of how little I've done with my life. Depressive episodes and mixed episodes and anxiety and various physical health problems all year. It was all very lame, lots of suicide ideation and a few self harm relapses.

Did very poorly in my online college classes and had to take a break, which may lead to dropping out. 

I have no actual dating experience and not much sexual experience, and the day after Halloween, my first/only Friend With Benefits told me he had just started seeing someone and broke it off with me. So on top of my health, bipolar and money issues, I'm also feeling heartbreak for the first time, like a goddamn emo teenager.  

Relationship with my parents have been rocky because I've been so depressed and irratible, and they have their own stuff going on.

So, now here I am, Valentine's Day. I've figured out a medication problem that has now made my mental health marginally better...less SI and Intrusive thoughts....but pretty much everything is shitty. I caught a cold and I'm sick as hell and I'm missing a second day of work and I hope I don't get fired because I've got a big pile of credit card debt that is finally catching up to me. My ex FWB posts a lovely post about how much he loves his new girl and I finally have to admit to myself that I guess I had actual feelings for him and now I feel like I'm back to forever alone.

I'm aware this is all very Woe Is Me, but if I can't be depressed when I'm sick on the worst holiday, when can I be? I'm tired of rolling around near rock bottom and waiting for things to get worse.

End rant. I hope you all have a better day and get lots of half-priced candy tomorrow."
"I’ve (16F) never seen enough info about tegretol or if lessens how much you feel or wtv. I know some people become zombies when they’re on meds n stuff but I’m not exactly a zombie just not affected by much anymore. I don’t get mad as much, I don’t get annoyed as easily, I don’t laugh as easily, I think less (in general, I’ve become stupider), I still have negative thoughts but i just care less about it and everything else so much less and life feels so much more casual. I don’t know if this is how it’s supposed to be or this is a side effect of my medication but yeah. Can’t see my psych for a long while bc of life so i can’t ask so here I am. Anyone else experienced this?"
I’m just a little curious on how that works out for people if anyone was successful.
"My insurance cut off my Vraylar (cold turkey) early last month and, although my psychiatrist prescribed me Trileptal, it was not enough... so, I spiraled into a manic episode. She then prescribed me Geodon which calmed me down but not quite enough, therefore, she upped my dose from 20mg twice a day each to 40mg twice a day each. And I feel like I've been doing decently well on it. However, *now* my insurance isn't covering it. I'm beyond done with my insurance company. I'm disabled and do not have a job bc of it so I'm on Medicaid. I just do not understand how they could cut somebody off from lifesaving drugs. It's beyond me. And when they stopped insuring Vraylar they literally suggested Abilify which I've already been on before!! It made me throw up and I couldn't deal with the side effects. I hate the US. It's a terrible, money-hungry country."
"My partner treats me amazingly! He helps during whatever episode I am in and always makes sure to take care of me, and i love him so much for it, but I fear I’m bad for him.

One time i was having an episode and was very irritable and he did something and I got upset. Instead of lashing out i’ll just distance myself, so when this happened I stoped reaching out for a bit (like a few hours or so) and stopped responding to him. This deeply upsets him and he will think i’m leaving him.

I’ve tried to explain my situation with him and we’ve talked it through since, but it’s things like that that lead me to think i’m bad for him… I just want to take care of him, not hurt him."
"I work in a mental health lived experience position, and it’s good mostly. But I find when things are rough or overwhelming (as they are in all workplaces), I find that I have tough it out more than all of the non-lived experience staff to avoid being labelled as ‘that unstable peer worker’. I can never have a down day or verbalise stress without the whole workplace assuming I’m having an ‘episode’ due to their knowledge of my past (sharing my story publicly is a big part of my role).

Just needed to get this out. I want to show normal human emotions like everyone else without people assuming I’m relapsing!"
"Had my first manic episode 2 months ago and life is just too painful. Its my fault, I ate an edible that made me too high and I started having delusions that persisted and now I’m stuck on meds feeling like another person but they are the only meds that work. Everything is just wrong, I cant read anymore, I cant write, I can’t draw, I can’t drink, I cant even have a coffee. My brain feels different as well as my thoughts that don’t feel like my own. All my creative plans and life looking forward are now all in the trash. I look at other people living normal lives and thinking what could’ve been. I fucked up and a part of me can’t live anymore, it’s too painful I can’t keep going on like this."
When my doctor asks how I'm feeling at our biweekly appointments I'm never sure how to respond. I don't feel great but i also don't feel horrible. My highs and lows still seem kind of out of control after a month on the new medication but im scared to trial yet another one.
"I've had Bipolar 2 for around 20 years (I'm 34) and I've tried every medication under the sun to basically no avail. Nothing has worked for me, or the side effects have caused episodes of hypomania and/or depression, suicidal thoughts, etc.

I applied for a study in San Francisco to see how Psilocybin affects treatment resistant Bipolar 2. I've watched documentaries and read tons of articles about psychedelics being used to treat mental health problems, so I really thought this was possibly *the* answer. After not hearing back for months, I finally received the rejection (no reason given) and I spiralled.

I had the worst bout of depression I've ever had, felt suicidal all day every day, barely ate anything other than the minimum to make it through a day. I was in bed for weeks. I had panic attacks. It sucked. I'm still not quite out of it, I feel. I'm in a weird limbo in my head. 

I don't know why I put so much hope into the clinical trial being my saviour. I see that it was stupid, but I still believe that psychedelics are a potential answer to my problems that traditional treatment hasn't been able to solve. I've been thinking about taking it into my own hands, but I don't have the first idea of where to get a hold of this ""medicine"" so that's a non-starter.

I just want to have a breakthrough after all these years of treading water and taking on more emotional weight. I just want to feel happy for a change. ^^"
"Do you guys ever get just so angry over the tiniest things? Even if you try not to/realize that the issue isn’t worth getting angry over? I’m talking that blood-boiling, heart-racing anger. 

It only happens to me sometimes. It’s not a typical characteristic of my personality. But evvvvery once in a while, I can’t seem to control how mad I get/what I get mad over and it’s incredibly difficult to calm down and think positive/happy thoughts. 

My mother was chronically explosive and angry when I was growing up, and abusive. She isn’t one to go get help so she was never diagnosed, but I do think she exhibited several traits of bipolar, herself. She’d suddenly get new expensive hobbies, had an affair, had bouts of impossible energy, and though she acted like depression doesn’t exist, she would get in what she called “a funk.” 
And of course I was eventually diagnosed with bipolar. (She thought that was ridiculous, as she doesn’t particularly believe in mental illness - “depression is laziness,” “mania/psychosis is just people making poor choices”) and I wasn’t incredibly shocked when I found out that it is often hereditary. 

So is this anger sometimes part of it? With my upbringing, I really try to avoid anger and use mindful thinking and techniques to de-escalate those negative emotions when I get them. But sometimes, man, it feels fucking impossible! Once I’m over the anger I feel so ashamed and like I failed. 
Or is this anger a nature vs. nurture thing? I was raised by anger and so now it’s in me whether I want to succumb to it or not?  or perhaps it’s both. 

TL/DR: do y’all get uncontrollably angry like there’s a whole other person in you that you don’t recognize and can’t seem to calm down?"
"So, the clinic where my psychiatrist is at told me that *apparently* they have not received any prior authorizations from my pharmacy despite the fact that my pharmacy sent it TWICE this month. Idk what's going on at this point. It's extremely aggravating to not know. Like is it my psychiatrist's office or the pharmacy or my insurance??? Idfk."
""
"The worst part of it is, is that my husband is depending on me being able to keep and work this job to pay rent. I feel like I'm failing all the time. 

We finally had a come-to-Jesus talk this morning and I explained that, as much as he loves the idea of me being able to do this, it may just not be possible. Bipolar is a chronic disease and I told him before we got married that I might require a lot of care and he said he still wanted to be with me. 

My brain weasels want to know what we're gonna do if he changes his mind. And how we're gonna do this and that. And shut up, brain!"
"About a week ago I quit seroquel cold turkey, because for some reason I felt like I didn’t need them anymore. I had bad withdrawals, sweating, vomiting, and to be honest for this  last month I have been sleeping around 4 hours a night with some nights not at all.

Anyway I now want to go back on meds, do I slowly go up to my dosage, or go back up straight away… Not keen on telling my doctor I took myself off them, so don’t want to ask them what to do"
I’ve had multiple manic type episodes and I’m worried that one day my heart will give out during mania. Does mania really effect your heart that much?
"Did you start a new med first? I take 400mg Lamotrigine and 100mg Seroquel ordinarily but bumped the Seroquel up to 200mg again because I had a manic episode. I don't want to take the Seroquel anymore because I've been on it for years and it's horrible, but how do I get off it without triggering an episode?"
Am I going to get banned for my reactivity though?
I’ve gone through my share of fake friends. People that just can’t handle my bipolar disorder or that I’m too negative or pessimistic.  Friends who say they’ll stick with you but drop you on a dime once they see your bipolar disorder. I have 1 best friend that drives an hour and thirty minutes one way to see me once a week. I feel like bipolar people go through rough times with maintaining friends. Is it just me?
"the devil's deal: take meds to become more functional, and in return become severely suicidal. forced to keep going at the meds because of needing money. i don't get to be both productive and also want to be alive. so how do I choose? is it better to be absolutely absorbed in my own delirious inner world, or actively hating myself and begging for death? how can I possibly choose between two bad fucking options and feel anything other than let down again? no matter what I try, I'm just constantly finding new ways to suffer. 

sure, I'll keep trying new meds, love to see what other allergies I've got. the swollen joints was a fun one, but maybe I can get the brain swelling again instead and just let it kill me this time. 

god i fucking wish meds worked for me. i wish my entire life wasn't just a punishment for the mistake of being born. but I still haven't paid the price for inflicting my presence on the world, so I get to watch other people find help and comfort from shit that just poisons me. i hope the allergist next month can figure out some magical solution to the way I keep reacting to everything, bc right now nobody even knows why, just that it keeps going poorly. 

and then the few things I don't react to like an allergy, well those just make me suicidal as payment for making me a good little worker bee. all productivity must be paid in blood, obviously. 

i hate feeling like I have to trade my peace of mind away to be a good participant in society. but the altar of capitalism demands a sacrifice."
"maybe its the bipolar speaking but I don't know...

I got into therapy a year before lockdown started.

during lockdown we switched from face to face therapy to digital. I wasn't crazy about it but thats how went.

I know she respects my opinion and such. when BLM protest was happening, I refused to partake. not that I don't support the movement but I was scared to be involved. we still didn't know how people could catch COVID. it was a different time really. I was also afraid of the people who were counter protesting it.

we had an argument about me not attending. she told me that it was a time to stand up to people. I was in therapy to stop arguing and fighting with people. it seemed so counter to what I was there for.

we had an argument and I told her that she cared more about being an activist than being a therapist.

we didn't talk for about a month. it was pretty upsetting since it was lockdown and I just didn't have anyone to talk to.

after some time she mailed me a gift (a coffee table book) and a letter saying she was sorry. we didn't really make up but I just had no one else to talk to so I started therapy back with her. 

I convinced my best friend to start therapy and she suggested she could be his therapist too.

after about ten months of talking to both of us, she out of no where told us both she could no longer be our therapist. it was very sudden. I was really hurting at that time too so it was very difficult. 

this was about a year ago. I reflect on it constantly. today I found the book she gifted me and threw it in the trash. 

sometimes I wonder if she was jut in a bad place. or just a bad therapist. sometimes I wonder if she was in love with me. 

has anyone experienced anything like this??"
"Hi, I’ve just been diagnosed with Bipolar (psych didn’t tell me if it’s 1 or 2) and I’m having difficulty accepting my diagnosis. 

There are several reasons. One is that I spent nearly 2 hours with a social worker talking about my history of trauma and all of my issues, they gave me a preliminary diagnosis of PTSD, anxiety, depression. In my own research, CPTSD best encapsulates what I experience so I was like okay that makes sense to me. Then I was sent to see the psych who diagnosed me with Bipolar in minutes without taking a full history. Something just doesn’t feel right to me about that. I want a second opinion. 

Another reason is that I just don’t think my symptoms warrant a Bipolar diagnosis and I haven’t been able to really identify with anyone’s stories on here. If anything I resonate more with Cyclothymia than Bipolar 1 or 2.

I will admit I do experience a majority of the time what I believe to be a mixed state of hypomania and depression. I’ll feel like I’m bubbling with energy, thoughts, ideas, etc. yet I’m stuck and have no motivation to do anything then it fluctuates daily. It’s like the pendulum that determines my emotional state swings from one end to the other really fast and so fast I experience both. If I do happen to be in one state for a longer time (several days), it’s the hypomanic state. It’s exhausting that I feel this way and which is why I sought treatment. 

My last psychiatrist explained to me that while I don’t meet the criteria to be diagnosed as Bipolar, she recognized I have a hyperactive component to my mood and prescribed to me Buspirone. She felt that an SSRI over time might increase the level of hyperactivity I experience and the Buspirone wouldn’t do that. That medication worked wonders for me and I was on the lowest dose possible. It felt like the first time in my life that I had agency over my mood swings like I could experience sadness without sinking into depression or any emotion and just move on after the emotion ran it’s course. 

I really liked my last psychiatrist and felt like she really listened to me so to hear this new psychiatrist give me a diagnosis so quickly and dismiss my fears about the medications he prescribed… just feels shitty and I can’t trust him. 

I’m open to hearing others opinions on this. Am I in denial? Am I minimizing my own experiences? Is my new psychiatrist being an asshole? I don’t know. 

If you’ve made it this far, I appreciate you."
I was wondering if other people experience a lot of nightmares and if anyone takes medication to help with nightmares. They have been getting really bad for me lately and they are ruining my sleep and giving me a lot of depression and anxiety. I am bipolar 1 but I also have been told I have ptsd from my childhood. I have heard there is medication you can take but I don’t really know anything about it.
"I’m tired of stereotypes 

I’m tired of losing people who don’t have compassion

I’m tired of the lack of understanding in general

I’m tired of blaming other circumstances other than my own choices because I KNOW that my choices have an impact too

I’m tired that people don’t think I can change

I’m tired of people thinking that because I don’t take medication I’m not on board with being stable

I’m tired of sharing stories and wondering if that makes people question my stability, even if it’s a story from my past

I’m tired of waking up and wanting to die because I don’t feel worthy of living

I’m tired of thinking that other people would be better off with me dead, or that I’d be better off dead, because the stereotypes hurt too much"

"I'm both excited and nervous. I didn't even know this was a thing in my city until about a month ago. I told my therapist that I didn't have any support in person, just online, and she suggested it. I know someone on here suggested it too. 

I'm sure they're different everywhere, but anyone go to their local NAMI meetings? What was it like?"
I have a psychiatrist and a therapist. Why would I be referred to a case manager after all these years? What role and purpose is a case manager?
i had one today for the first time in a while. i was taking a nap & it was like someone was in my ear talking wtf? how do y'all deal? why is this happening & how do i cope?
"I really want a shot of vodka I don't want to drink if it will really negatively affect me, is there a safe amount to drink?"
I've noticed a big increase in the number of therapists who are providing advice online for people with Bipolar. Does anyone follow any creators they really recommend or have any content you would suggest (either paid or free!) that's great for people looking for advice?
"i hate my job i hate hate hate my job. the woman who sits behind me makes me so fucking mad and i dont know why. she talks to me with a bit of snark and i wanna break her fingers. everyone there talks to me like im a child because i dont have kids. im 24 and if they knew me better theyd be glad i didn't curse a child with my genes. i feel like my chronic pelvic pain is worsening because of my mood (I had surgery in july that removed stuff that caused me pain so this is all i can figure) and thats making me irritable because im in so much fucking pain and im depressed. I work in a call center and I come across very bubbly and happy on the phone so nobody should have an issue. my issue is i really like the company i work for. they have a good mission. i just dont wanna work in fucking sales im an introvert and when i try to be extroverted people dont like me anyways. I've been finally feeling stable and level headed since adding lamotrigine to my meds but now its falling apart and i just feel so fucking angry at everyone and its not a good look. if you saw my post here two weeks ago, I haven't had another instance where I've outwardly snapped at someone, thank god. But this woman behind me is testing me. When I get to my car i just let out a string of fucking curses and I'm so embarrassed even though no one knows. 

If you read this far thank you i hope you guys are having a good day"
"Hey I was recently diagnosed from bipolar NOS to bipolar 2. Im currently on seroquel XR 300mg, pregabalin, diazepam and I’ve just started lamotrigine I was wondering is it normal to get flu symptoms when starting first two days were fine but I woke up today and my whole body feels like it’s been run over by a truck and have a tight neck, sore throat and stuffy nose"
Hi all! I’m on my 3rd day of taking lamictal and I’m honestly terrified of getting that bad rash that can happen with it….to the point it’s giving me severe anxiety. What are others experience with lamictal and rashes?
"I am getting surgery in a very sensitive area soon. It will be a Fistulotomy plus Possibl gland removal and more on my rectum area. I know, so awkward and gross.  It will be extremely painful and hard. Afterwards I will be in a lot of pain and dealing with it coming from a sensitive place, and it will be a struggle to go to the bathroom. Overall terrible 

I have many concerns about this whole situation. Endless. But one of my main concerns is how my mental health will be affected. I’m on lithium and have been the most stable I’ve been in a long time for the past 5 months. However even before knowing about the surgery, the previous few months my anxiety has been out of control, and I’ve been experiencing some depression. I’ve ben constantly anxious and panicking and worrying about disaster situations, like what if I’m assaulted when walking to my car or what if I fall down the stairs and break my neck. Plus anxious about life stuff. My depression had been rough and I even self harmed for the first time in a long time. I don’t have a psych or therapist right now since I just moved to a new state, but just got healthcare so will be able to soon.
I’m just worried about after my surgery …since I will be in a lot of pain in such a sensitive place. And be not mobile or not fully active for months. I’m worried my depression and anxiety will get worse. I am worried that I’ll be struggling so much that I will be suicidal. I definitely won’t go to the hospital because I had a 14 day hold in September that traumatized me , completely. I was nearly assaulted by a male patient who came to my bed in the middle of the night and I felt so unsafe the whole time. I don’t want to be hospitalized. 
For those who had surgery or health issues with bipolar, how did you get through it? What helped? What happened?

tl;dr: I’m having surgery and I’m scared for my mental health. For those who have had surgery before what happened and how did you get through it?"
"Other than limiting/eliminating caffeine which I've done. 

Except for Lamotragine, the rest of my bipolar meds are taken at night. I am finding myself in a mixed episode.

I cannot wait all the way until night to take the meds. I need relief NOW.

Maybe frowned upon but I took one of my Lithium pills half hour ago. Don't feel a difference.

I just want to calm down and not feel like I'm crawling out of my skin. I also feel depressed and crying but with wired energy to go with it and my sleep is getting less each night. 

My psychiatrist isn't available for about a week unfortunately. 

How do you deal with day time mixed/mania?"
"I saw my NP lately and reported having three episodes since last fall (a mild depression that lasted 2 months, a moderate mania that lasted a week and a half, and a severe but short-lived depression right after that. This is in addition to the pretty excruciating 1.5 month-long mania I had last spring)...so I thought it was pretty clear that my mood isn't stable. But she scheduled my next appointment in five months. I don't see her again until early July. I'm only on lamotrigine (100) and a sleep med she gave me that I hadn't heard of before (ramelteon) to deal with the insomnia caused by lamotrigine. I am not on anything with a significant anti-manic effect and spring (aka, manic season) is just around the corner. I am pissed. Livid. Infuriated. I'm getting a new prescriber lol. As in, I just called the CMH place I go to and got switched to another NP like five minutes ago.

My question for ya'll is: Am I being unrealistic in wanting to see my prescriber monthly if my mood isn't stable? If I'm rapid cycling wouldn't they want to monitor me more closely and get it under control??

I've gotten care at two different CMH agencies for the last decade and a half, and I usually get scheduled every three months. It's never seemed like enough, but I can't tell if I'm being ridiculous or not..."
"We married 4 years ago after a year of dating. Both of us had just gotten out of long-term relationships and ended up falling for each other even though we were still grieving what we had lost. I was also not diagnosed at the time so I constantly think that maybe I was just chasing the dopamine high that he gave me. A couple of weeks after getting married, I found out he had been sending inappropriate messages to other women, dating back to when we were already going out for about 2 months. 

This really killed all of the trust I had in him. But we were recently married, and I was determined to make it work. I even told him that he may never recover my trust and he should think carefully about whether he wants to be with someone who doesn't trust him. His answer really made me respect him a little less each day that passed. He said that it's not that big of a deal because it's not like he actually slept with any of those women. 

It all came to a breaking point today, when he said that I'm stuck in the past and that's why I can't move on. And I can't help but agree with him, but I also think about how I deserve to be with someone I can trust. And it's not just the lack of trust, but it's a lot of other things that I ignored because I really wanted this to work. This is really embarrassing for me, and TMI for some, but basically he seemed to be scared of touching me or giving me oral. The few times he has given me oral, he actually pauses to spit out in between licks. It's like he's grossed out but he swears he's not. I've had past partners that would treat me like I was the best thing they ever tasted and actually begged me to let them. So his way of doing things made me feel so bad about myself that I eventually asked him to not give me oral again because it was a hit to my ego each time he did that.

I probably seem like I'm rambling right now, but I guess the whole gist of this post is that I wasn't happy in a marriage where I didn't feel like I could trust my partner with my heart or my body. And now I'm wondering if I jumped the gun because of my disorder. I've been taking my meds for about 4 months now and each day that passes I feel like my eyes are opening more, but I don't like what I see."
"Sorry for so many posts lately, just need to share.

I talk to my doctor at noon tomorrow.  Planning to leave for home in the morning, so I can get checked into the hospital as soon as possible.  Probably should have gone sooner, but the closest behavioral health unit is 4 1/2 hours away, so I might as well take the extra few hours and go home. Because I’m not letting the cops here drive me all the way to someplace I don’t know.

I completed the last of my steps for my plan yesterday, I feel like one more bad day and that’s the end. Planning on telling my doctor that, and telling her that I should have agreed to up my meds at our last appointment.  I hate to up meds before I know that I’m in an episode, but I’m learning that I need to adjust at the first sign that I may be slipping.  I know a healthy lifestyle helps, but it’s hard with work and school.  I know it’s possible, I had six whole months without an episode a couple years ago and it was amazing.

I don’t know how school is going to turn out with all of this.  Wishing I had picked a school closer to home and that my dad had let me transfer closer for this semester. I haven’t done homework in the last week, as all I can think about is my plan. I’ve been to class, but it takes everything I have to focus and my mind still wonders to my plan.

Today I told my sister that I’m not doing well, and that I might be coming home in the next few days. I haven’t talked to my parents.  Other than sharing a few days ago that I was having some si. I don’t want them to worry about me, but at the same time I wish they knew how much I am struggling here.  And at the same time I don’t want them to know how bad I’ve gotten.  That’s the part of me that wants to see me go all the way and end it, even though I know it’s possible to be stable, but it’s been so long since I’ve been stable.

My tolerance for episodes is going down, which is good, means I ask for help for less severe symptoms.  But my endurance is also going down and I’m tired of fighting this.  Also my episodes seem to be progressing faster than they used to, or I’m just not try as hard anymore. Anyone else notice that happen to them?

I need to find a new therapist, one that doesn’t make me anxious about telling them the truth. I feel like I’ve lied to my current therapist too much to go back and fix it. But there are not many therapist in this area and I hate tele-health for therapists.

Thank you for reading this. I hope everyone else is doing better."
"Lithium did the trick for me on the second trial of it, almost 20 years later. Thank God. I also feel that the teachings of Jesus Christ were instrumental in my living life in a better way, as 'The body is the Temple of the Soul."" I'm now doing well. Thank The Lord. (For a while I was convinced that all religiosity was a symptom of mental illness, but I realize there is a way to have healthy spirituality which I am working on. Much love everyone! Peace!) I had to do a lot of soul searching and soul work. I'm a work in progress and have a long way to go:-)"
"Two overlapping problems I struggle with - anxiety, and not drinking. While I've enjoyed a great 5 months of not drinking, and I seldom crave it or worry about it, I have explored options for both of these issues with my psych.

He and I have a very good relationship, he knows everything about me, and I'm extremely honest with him. In the past with regards to anxiety and drinking, he suggested a low dose benzo to hit both. Take one instead of drinking, when I want to go out with friends or whatever (not so much to treat panic attacks). I do horribly with benzos, so I passed, and we tried naltrexone instead. Unfortunately that just made me depressed, even if it allowed me to have 1-3 drinks and go home no problem. It was the day or so after that I'd get really really bleak. Plus even then, I don't totally trust even naltrexone to prevent me from caving totally versus having a few drinks once in a while. Not to mention the ill health effects of alcohol and how those offset positive goals in my life like fitness, working out, my career, healthy hobbies, etc.

I was just recently randomly curious about how muscle relaxers even work, and learned plenty including that Soma has anxiolytic and euphoric properties, while (allegedly) not being as addicting as benzos.

I'm considering bringing up the conversation again, as Soma to an alternative to drinking. For all I know it could also set me off into anger like benzos and some other GABAergic drugs, but at times I consider something like this as a lesser of evils. I've made strides over the years, but if history repeats again, eventually I crack under anxiety and have a drink (which then turns into a week long binge if not more).

If this is a totally terrible idea, I'm accepting of that. I'm not a kid just trying to get my rocks off on pharmaceuticals - just want to explore if this would be a ""lesser of evils"" solution. I'd rather someone say this is a horrible idea; I'm not trying to start a hot debate over trying to get high or something. I'm open to alternative ideas as well. But while my psych is even cool with me trying shrooms for depression on my own as long as I tell him, I don't want to jeopardize our relationship by sounded like I'm trying to be irrational with our progress or take advantage of his trust.

Unfortunately, specifically for a night out, pot or even microdoses of shrooms don't hit the spot, and I end up feeling very left out, cranky, and ultimately ruining an adult night out of dancing. Which I also work on in therapy to get a better long term resolution.

Thanks!

**tldr; basically looking for an alcohol alternative just for a night out every month or so (naltrexone didn't work for me), and my psych has been open to this in the past. Is Soma a bad idea, or has anyone else found something? Please assume this is ""lesser of evils"" to help avoid alcohol which is highly destructive to my life - not looking for something new to have fun with.**"
I feel like utter shit today. It feels like when you miss your meds and start having mild withdrawal. My head feels foggy with uncomfortable pressure. I'm a little dizzy. I'm really tired. I feel like this every couple of weeks and don't know why. Does anyone have any insight?

"im sorry i dont know who else to talk to because everyone around me doesn't understand and i have tried to help them understand but they cant. i cant deal with this disorder anymore. i have bipolar 2 along with adhd (if that info matters). i feel like i cant control my symptoms. i dont know if i am having an episode but i have been having trouble sleeping, i can't focus as well, i feel uncomfortably energetic and depressed/upset at the same time. i feel intense anger and sadness towards everyone and everything around me. i want to cut off all relationships, i want to quit college, life just feels too much. i literally can't do this. i don't know how you all do it. i want to get better. why haven't i gotten better. i go to therapy, i take my meds, i try to eat healthy and i started exercising again and i journal. why am i not getting better? what am i doing wrong? i don't want to feel this way anymore. my mind is so scattered right now. i have already been to the mental hospital twice, i don't want to go again. i don't want to sh but i have this strong urge to. i feel so alone. you guys don't have to give me advice or anything i just want to know that i am not alone."
"I asked this on the other bipolar sub but got no answers, it's frustrating that the biggest bipolar sub has people who post almost irrelevant and unhelpful pictures get the most comments but when you ask an actual question you get no answers.

I just want to know what to expect from lithium, I read a little and talked to my doctor, but I'd appreciate it if people who took it can help me understand more."
"I'm actually borderline but posting here since lithium is much more often prescribed for bipolar.

Did anybody experience sleeplessness the first weeks of beginning lithium carbonate? Did that disappear after your efficient dose is found?

I feel much better mood-wise, but I can't sleep at all since the second week on lithium (now unto the third). I'm forced to take it just before sleeping in order to do the blood test.

First week was perfect, so I don't know why I can't sleep at all (not even a nap, although my body is exhausted) and it's frustrating (same for the weight gain while my appetite drastically decreased and I'm eating literally nothing)."

"I’m 22 and I live with my parents and I don’t earn money myself (I’m studying and for me that’s enough). My parents don’t have problem with it but when I look at my friends, they go to work, study, party, everything. Is it embarrassing? Is bipolar just an excuse I’m lazy? I don’t think so, but I would love to hear your thoughts."
Ever since I’ve been on antipsychotics for about 3 years my word recall has gone to complete shit. I’m on 100mg of geodon a day. Does anyone else feel their memory’s are crap from their medication?
"Hi, what side effects have you had from taking Seroquel (quetiapine)? Thanks."
"I work with children who have exceptional needs.  I was having a chat about some of my clients with 2 of my family members when they said, ""All these disorders and acronyms, don't you think they are excessive?  People are just using them as an excuse for their kid's bad behaviour, don't you think?""


I responded with, ""I really hope that isn't the case because It makes me wonder if people think the same of me, that I just use Bipolar as an excuse."". One family member said it wasn't the same at all and tried to backtrack their original comment. The other family member didn't really say anything.


How would you have reacted in this scenario?  What would you have said (if anything)?"
I feel like everything I do is centered around my bipolar disorder. I never go out unless I have to go to work. Isolating for 3 years now. I’m always worrying about my next manic episode. I’m lucky enough to have psychotic features with mine so I have a whole bunch to look forward to. Anyone else feel like their bipolar disorder has impaired the shit out of them. Does anyone remember the good old days when we weren’t bipolar and had these problems all the time?
"Sorry if this question seems dumb but I was just curious my doctor prescribed me some Zoloft aka sertraline for my severe anxiety and depression. The first day I took it I didn't feel anything but I was sleepy. the second day I took it I was extremely irritated /kinda paranoid then about an hour later I felt extremely good and euphoric in a way then I went back to feeling aggitated/anxious and happy at the same time. 

I heard that people who have undiagnosed bipolar get this reaction but I want too sure."

"I'm sharing this b/c I know folks tend to stop posting when things are going well and I've posted a lot of dark suicidal shit here.

This week has been the easiest I've had in so, so long. Maybe years? Still a bit depressed and having my normal anxious symptoms, but it feels manageable.

I feel like I forget how much easier basic human functioning is when I'm not waking up automatically in a state of intense suffering.

It's super weird and IDK what exactly is causing this b/c it's very unexpected (I was in a psych ward for suicidal stuff like 3-4 weeks ago). But I'll take it while it lasts lmao  I'm trying to enjoy it.

Thanks for listening."
"How do you deal with making decisions, especially big decisions, when dealing with bipolar disorder? When I'm (hypo)manic I tend to be impulsive and not really give my decisions much thought. Sometimes I feel an urgency to make a big decision and regret afterwards. A lot of times I feel very emotionally-driven when I make a (hypo)manic decision. How do I make better decisions when I suffer from bipolar?"
I took adhd stimulants when i knew i didn't have  a great experience controlling myself to take more i took it for a month about. Could that make my bipolar permanently worse?
"I know my SO needs the Bipolar SO community to, I don’t know, learn how to live with someone like me, but I feel like a specimen being analyzed.  Sometimes he quotes the community saying “they told me I should handle this thing you do, this way” for example.  It feels hurtful to me.  Again, I am in no way suggesting our SO’s shouldn’t leverage their community resources for support, they should.  But I can’t help but feel bad when he tells me what they say he should do about me :-/"
"I got seasonal affective disorder in 8th grade, major depressive disorder in 10th, and now bipolar 2 after my 1st year of college. I’m in my second year now. And I’m just getting worse and worse and worse. Every year the thread I hang by gets thinner. In all this time I’ve been very academically sucessful, almost all As, honors, all that shit. And now I’m just falling apart. I’ve never found a medication that “fixes” it, and yeah I know it’s bc no medication with “fix” me and my life. But I’m failing all of my classes, have turned in barely any work, haven’t talked to my professors at all, am probably going to miss all next weeks classes without telling them even after I said I wouldn’t. I go between caring abt my life, to not caring if the world explodes. I’m leaving places crying and just all over the place. I’m not a crying person, especially not in front of people.

I thought this last week would be better. I was catching up on homework and it was feeling better. Then the coffee I’ve had before made me a little hypomanic this time and I don’t even know if I can blame it for starting the mess I’m in bc it’s not new, it’s just a continuation of the mess that’s been getting worse. I feel like everything is falling apart and I have no idea what to do. 

My friends don’t know Im bipolar and I’m not going o tell them. I have no idea how to talk to my teachers let alone what to say. I’m in therapy once a week but I’m still in this shit and I can’t see a way out. My family has no idea I’m failing my classes and idk how to tell them. I have disability accommodations at my school but I haven’t used them once bc I’m supposed to give advanced warning and the whole freaking problem is I don’t know when I’m going to feel bad. So I say nothing and it makes it worse.

I feel like I need to be able to look back and say, it’s getting better, that it’s a rocky road but I’m making progress. And I’m just not. I’m getting worse and I don’t know when that’s going to stop. And that’s really scary"
Had my dose of lithium upped from I think 150mg to 300mg (whatever the first dose increase would be) wondering how long dose increases take to work. My doctor said 4 weeks but I’m really hoping it works sooner than that
I heard from someone that they experienced paranoia and psychosis with their depression. Has anyone experienced this before? My depressive episodes aren’t that bad luckily but unfortunately my manic episodes are absolutely horrific. Luckily no suicidal stuff though. I don’t want to experience bad depression. My depression is bad enough and it’s nothing compared to some people I’ve met on Reddit. Has anyone experienced this before?
"I forgot to take my Trileptal last night and felt really weird this morning. Last time I tried to taper it my akathisa was ramped up for a while. I take 900mg usually which is a 300mg and 600mg tab combined. I decided to take some this morning, and accidentally took 3 600mg pills! They were in a 300mg bottle for some reason. The whole day I’ve felt kind of stoned, still feeling it at 7pm which is my normal dose time. I don’t think I’m going to take any tonight and will try to reset tomorrow. The maximum amount you’re supposed to increase by is 600mg, and I increased by 900mg with the 1800mg dose. Does this sound like a reasonable plan? My psychiatrist isn’t reachable on the weekends and doesn’t offer emergency services."
"Is it just me? But I feel like whenever I recall a moment in my life it’s based on an episode. Not a genuine phase I had. Like if I remember a song I’m like, oh yeah it was during this depressive episode. Or if I think of something I did, it could have been a lecture or something. I’d  think this is how I experienced my emotions in this moment. I don’t know how to feel about this…."
I’m bipolar and brought it up that some stuff in the /bipolar Reddit rules were preventing relevant conversations about race. This was in a thread specifically for expressing concerns to mods and they banned me completely. Otherwise they’re great but damn
"I've seen this risk documented and discussed in the context of corticosteroids such as prednisone, as well as even birth control pills. But I haven't seen it mentioned or researched in the case of cyproterone acetate, and I don't understand the mechanism behind this potential risk well enough to make a guess.

NOTE: I know cyproterone acetate is conventionally understood to pose a risk to those with depression; however, as far as I know, this is based off findings that were mainly centered around high-dose CPA being used for female hirsutism. It doesn't seem like those findings are particularly useful or applicable in non-hirsutism-related contexts, or for those who take low (~10mg) doses instead."
Everything I do I end up humiliating the shit out of myself sometimes. It happens more times than not. Some friends have zero respect for me because of it. Every episode I always humiliate the shit out of myself. Again and again and again!
"I just think about the person I used to be prior to having episodes. I was motivated, reliable, never depressed, actually ENJOYED life. It’s been going on two years now since getting diagnosed and I’ve never felt the same since even after trying different medications. I feel like I’m under water drowning even though I’m so close to breaking the surface it seems to never happen. I feel like I’m a shell of who I used to be and it sucks remembering how I was because I don’t think I’ll ever get that back. Currently medicated and it helps to an extent but it’s never brought be back to what I was before"
"About a week ago, in the middle of a sleepless night agonizing over what I had done during a manic episode three years ago (I had no idea I was manic) I  had my aha moment! It dawned on me that in the last 5 years on Adderall, I had done some craaaaazy stuff that I had never done in my life. Such as wanting to watch my husband have sex with another woman in front of me--I went as far as looking up sex workers to arrange one for his birthday, taking pictures of hot women for him at the beach, and more uncharacteristic things. I also wrote a very erotic novel in three months. But what really spurred the realization was the crushing guilt of having a texting affair for three months with my young daughter's friend's father who I found out was a malignant narcissist.  So now I'm swimming in guilt and shame. I'm having a hard time wrapping my brain around how I didn't notice sooner.  I almost destroyed my 20-year marriage to a man I love dearly and put my daughter at risk by entangling myself with a dangerous person.

It sent me down a shame spiral. But I knew it just wasn't me and wondered what happened. How? After doing a little digging I found that Adderall can induce mania in people with Bipolar and met with my psychiatrist ( I had kept all the embarrassing stuff from her over the years and insisted I was just fine.) Even though over the five years I lost 20 lbs, almost becoming anorexic and barely slept. She couldn't tell as we met over zoom once a year. My husband chalked it up to a mid-life crisis and me having a sexual awakening and getting fit.  

Now looking at my life through the context of Bipolar it makes so much sense. The fluctuating energy levels and moods, total lack of self-care, irritability, anger, creativity, a million ideas without one coming to fruition, underachievement, etc  I always thought what is wrong with me? Hence, why I sought a psychiatrist after I had a stroke at 38. (oh yeah I had a stroke in my thirties and almost ended up completely disabled). 

Sorry for the rant. I just wanted to reach out and see if anyone else went through something similar on their journey to a proper diagnosis."
"I'm feeling very bad right now. Went to the ER last night and they sent me home. I have an appointment on Tuesday but I'm in a horrible state of mind. I don't know what's going on so I don't know what to tell the psychiatrist.

For two weeks I've had panic attacks, existential dread, a feeling of emptiness and extremely powerful loneliness, and a fear of the universe being limited/too small. If I try to tell this to anyone they don't understand and assume it's anxiety. But it's not just anxiety. Last time this was this bad was when I was off medication.

I'm also having nonstop nausea at the same time. Every single night. My stomach is so bad I can't even eat anything. I'm in the bathroom much of the day.

Edit: It's gotten better. I don't know what it was but it's easing up. Still have no idea what to tell my psych and if he can even keep it from happening again."
How’d that go? I write like a genius when I’m manic or hypomanic but I can’t do any writing at all while I’m stable.
"right know I feel as though I'm feeling too much. the full spectrum of every unpleasant human emotion is coursing through me. fear, anxiety, sadness, trepidation, shame, guilt, anger, disappointment, regret, anguish, frustration and so much more. I feel sick. I wish I was numb and couldn't feel a thing. these last 6 years I have constantly been treading water and I my energy is running out. everyone is up ahead, swimming and surfing through life but I am stuck going nowhere with my head often underwater gasping for air. I know how to swim, I've done it before but my mind won't let me. my brain doesn't work like it should, it's not trying to preserve life it's self destructing. imploding with me as it's hostage. the times I've wishes for death are too many to count, it's an everlasting thought. ceaseless. nothing makes me happy or brings me joy. it's no way to live. I just don't know how to do this life thing. I'm at the end of my tether. there's not one person or thing that can make me feel better and that is so soul crushing. I'm not trying to devalue my community or support system but this is what this disease has robbed me of. I rarely see the point of anything. I know I sound ungrateful because I'm loved, thought of and regarded but that doesn't change or impact my brain chemistry."
Lost a best friend and it gave me a manic episode in 2018. Luckily no psychosis with that one but I lost my job from it. Not good.
I’ve been bipolar since I was 25. I had 1 bad terrible psychotic terrible episode that I’m still trying to get. Other smaller episodes that were still destructive. I’m afraid I could have another psychotic full blown manic episode again. How often are you having full blown manic episodes?
"Being bipolar, you really put your friends and family to the test of time of who really will stand with you in rough times and who will leave you. Some people see the oncoming baggage and jump out of the way before it hits them or friends will slowly distance themselves from you and make up excuses why we can’t be friends anymore. Bipolar people come with unwanted baggage sometimes unfortunately. No fault of our own it’s our illness. Some is our fault but I can’t help it. Bipolar people are my people because people who have bipolar are the only real ones who understand what I’m going through."
"I’m really struggling with depression. My sister the other day asked me what was wrong and I just didn’t have an answer. My manager yesterday took me aside and said I haven’t been my usual bubbly self recently and what was wrong. Idk. I feel like I’m being punished for having this disorder. My boss is giving me easier shifts until I’m more like my old self again, she said. She said she genuinely cares about me and wants me to be myself. All I can think of is my Dr stopped my Lamictal 200 mg and that maybe that has an effect on me and my mood. I can’t help but wonder if someone said something to my manager or if she genuinely noticed it herself. I feel so stressed. Things with my gf are strained and it’s not looking good. I’m wondering if I need to be on disability to cope with what’s going on. I just don’t know what to do. Please help."
"I've been repeating the same cycles: meet guy, get with guy, integrate into his community getting to know and care for his friends and family as your own, guy turns on me and kicks me out of the entire community, rinse and repeat. 

I can't do this anymore. I have no friends. I'm about to start praying to a god I don't believe in just on the slight chance he'll finally end my life and suffering. I cannot do this anymore. 

I've never ever been able to have a stable successful independent life on my own. I have never been able to make and keep friends. I HATE MY FUCKING SELF why am I such a worthless sack of shit

Nothing fucking ever helps!!!!!!!!!!!!

Kill me please god do it I already know you don't like me"
"tired. I'm tired. that is the word that comes to mind when I think of myself, my life and what I've become. I'm tired when I wake up, tired in the morning, tired in the afternoon, tired in the evening and tired when I go to bed. I'm tired of barely getting through the day. I'm tired of wishing I was never born, wishing I was dead the moment I wake, wishing every second away. I'm tired of feeling too much or nothing at all. I'm tired of letting everyone including myself down. I'm tired of feeling alone. I'm tired of being a failure, a disappointment, a burden. I'm tired of not being able to enjoying life or relish in the finite time I have and not being able to appreciate existing. I'm tired of stagnating, of not making any progress. I'm tired of wasting my young years. I'm tired of living like this. I'm tired of trying but having nothing to show for it. I'm tired of perpetual anxiety. I'm tired of being a manic depressive. I'm tired of chronic mental health issues. I'm tired of the way they cripple me. I'm tired of being Black, a woman and plus size. I'm tired of despising myself. I'm tired of this world. I'm tired of this life, but mostly I'm tired of being me."
"Hello ladies and gentlemen,

Firstly i would like to excuse me about my english-its not my mother language so it will be a little bit messy maybe.

I am bipolar type2. Was eating almost clear carnivore for 2 years(Ground beef, cream and additional cow fat). During those 2 years did not have really strong depressions as long as hypermania episode. Was quite stable, sometimes was down cause was not in ketosis. I never tried medications, but those years on carnivore were the most stable for me. Did not feel myself perfect but still quite active and without extreme paranoia and anxiety. So carnivore worked, it does not cure me tottally, but helps a lot.

But suddenly i got really painful depression now, carnivore doesnt improve    my mental health for 3-4 weeks already(my blood test results are 3.1 and 1.2 mmol this week). So it seems that i am in ketosis, but it does not help. 

Sometimes i had hard periods, but mostly it was due to low ketone level. Also i found out that overeating protein ruins my ketosis. But this time i dont have any ideas why ketosis is not improving my mental health anymore. Any ideas/experience? 
Please help, its awful to feel like that. Cant understand how i was living for many many years without carnivore

Thanks in advance"
I’m terrified of my paranoia because it caused so much destruction during my last manic episode. I hope it doesn’t come back. It’s so exhausting. I can’t not embarrass myself.
"One of my coworkers triggers my paranoia big time- enough that I had to add an antipsychotic to my med mix. I need to help of what to do. I work in retail and we’re both the sales managers for the store, so her and I have to work closely together. I’m at the point where I’m wanting to leave my job. But I don’t want to do that because I’m almost six months employees with this company and that’s a huge mile stone for me holding down a job."
"Just curious. Firstly is it ok to mix IR with XRT?
I titrate from my daily staple of 150xrt daily  and sometimes when I become higher I go all the way up to 550 mg sometimes…. I was thinking adding 50mg of ir or something at night so it kicks me faster… I don’t take in mornings… maybe they would help as well? I’m currently only sleeping 4 hours daily past week..

Also any one ever add adivan to their mix?"
Has anyone else experienced memory issues while manic? My last episode was so bad that I have problems remembering what was reality and what wasn’t as far as delusions and pieces of it are missing almost like a blackout. For context I was manic October through December 2022
"I, like man, struggle with impulse control. I’m normally pretty good with it, but I just moved in with my boyfriend so all my expenses were cut in half and I also just got my tax refund. 

I impulse spent half of it and am now going to have to do payments on a washing machine when I was supposed to used my tax return. 

The items were genuinely much needed, I just never had the funds for them and they piled up so when I finally had the money I bought it all. 

It’s done now, and I’m back to managing my impulse control in a more healthy way. But how do I get rid of the guilt that I compromised something I wanted to do (save for Disney world and buy a washing machine). 

Any tips?"
"I am really scared of losing my hair on lamictal. If you have had hair loss or thinning, how soon did it start? Did it go away and how much hair did you lose? Let’s say if you’ve been like a month on 200mg, would you be in the clear for no hair loss?"
"My spending habits are bad which is typical when you have bipolar but I have FINALLY caught up on everything and Finally all my cards are not over the limit...i even paid off one more card yesterday. 

I have money to make it til payday but I am freaking out so bad right now because I ordered doordash.
I feel so horrible and guilty...like the world is about to end. Like im back in horrible debt ruining my credit and have to ask family for money to survive.

I have $120 and will get another $100 Tuesday then u get paid $1400 friday....but i cannot calm tf down. 

I think ill go take a klonopin. Please help."
"Hiya, so basically I wanted to know if any of you only take Seroquel (quetiapine) as part of your treatment. I know Lithium is the preferred med for this illness and I've been on it for over 3 years consistently for bp1 with overall good results.


Along these years, however, I've also had to take a bunch of other medications like zyprexa, depakote, lorazepam, wellbutrin, abilify, haloperidol and I don't remember what else when I've had manic episodes or lack of motivation. Currently what works for me is only 1200 mg of Lithium and 100g of Seroquel at night though.


Unfortunately, there's been a shortage of Lithium where I live and it's been really hard to get it, while I do have some lithium left for a month, my psych told me that in case the shortage continues (which is likely), taking only Seroquel (at a higher dose of 300 mg) might be effective. I trust him but I'm still dubious because of how long I've been taking lithium that I don't know how I might react. Any input is appreciated."
I can’t not embarrass myself.
I’ve been staying in my apartment for most things these days. I work from home Monday Wednesday and Fridays but I usually like to stay in my apartment and would rather have people come over rather than go out anywhere.
"I am sensitive and intune with everything. I feel everythings pain, I feel everyone’s demeanor. I sense most things. I hate that I feel everything and how self aware I am most times. I hurt when others hurt. My son. Though he is young and I understand that he will have big and small emotions.. I can hardly feel calf and stable in the world we live in. The people all the pain. All the suffering and sadness I feel it all. I feel like I am too aware in a world so harsh. I try to harden myself sometimes. Sometimes I try to feel less so I hurt less. I block out all the things that make me feel so deeply. I am scared for myself sometimes. I don’t want to feel everything all the time. I feel a lot more since having my son.. Not only hormones but genuine concern I will not be able to handle the harshness of the world towards my son. Let alone me. I guess this is just a rant. I know all moms feel this way when it comes to their kid. But, I can hardly stand the harshness of this world by itself. I don’t want to be medicated. Medication will only lead to blocking out how deeply I love and care. I just don’t want to feel so deeply to everything. I feel the deep pain of anyone or anything being abandon. I feel the tone in all the voices being carried. I feel the pain in peoples eyes and the way they speak. I feel even the slightest bit of evil in people ..and already know what people are capable of. It sickens me. 
How am I suppose to live when this world- these people are scared, in pain, suffering, animals suffering, people are doing awful things intentionally. Joking about ever hurting someone or something. I can’t wrap my head around it. 
How are we suppose to be ok."
I have a feeling I’ll have to go on lithium one day. How bad is it?
"and mental health issues, my mom packed me some art stuff and also like a journal type thing. I've never been good at writing or narrating my life like in a diary or journal, but I'd love some ideas for other ways to use writing in that journal as a therapeutic tool.

Maybe some sort of daily log that I can sometimes be a little creative with or something, maybe chronicle things in my life in a way that doesn't feel like I'm a teen girl or something lol, idk any ideas would be appreciated."
"I don’t know if it’s because I’m depressed and not eating the best, or what, but I have not felt like I have the energy to do much of anything at all these days. What do you all do to feel more energized?"
"I've been struggling with depression since autumn 2017 put on antidepressants which coupled with insomnia led to a psychotic manic breakdown in 2019 spring. I'm medicated on latuda, lamotragine and duloxitine but I'm still so fucking depressed. lamotragine was added in October and has made me feel less suicidal but my mood constantly dips. it's only ever a matter of time. has anyone been through this and found something that helps? yes I have had counselling and therapy."
The other day I finally received and got confirmed that I was approved for SSDI. It’s a huge relief after 2+ years. I am in disbelief that this process is finally over. I am so grateful for my advocate who has helped me over this whole thing. I figured I would share my good news with everybody here and answer any questions people have for me.
"Something I have seen practically nothing on. Does anyone do this? I read to date, 1 study that indicates arrest of weight gain in combination but to hear any anecdotes would be great. I’m aware this is usually seen with APs but the metabolic syndrome from Depakote seems about the same. I have a Doctor willing to try it with me.

Thanks, praying for everyone who’s still struggling and without adequate help. Myself included."
"I see a lot of talk about weight gain on this subreddit so I thought I'd share my experience. The med that made me gain weight was abilify. My weight shot up so fast and my self-esteem tanked as it happened.

I was also the type of guy who refused to accept my diagnosis. So I would go off my meds, then when shit hit the fan, I would go back on my meds. By doing that I noticed that my appetite dropped when not on meds, but would immediately increase as soon as I went back on meds. For me, abilify tricks me into thinking that I'm hungry and need to eat. And, I feel that need all day. In addition to that, it makes me crave really shitty food.

If you are trying to keep your weight under control the key is to figure out how much you need to eat to actually stay healthy and energized.

I started out at 175lbs, shot up to 212 lbs, went down to 190 lbs, then back up to 198lbs because I started slacking on diet.

As an athlete, my weight has oscillated in small amounts my whole life depending on the intensity of my workouts. I learned several ways to lose weight for competitions ( I was a jiu-jitsu fighter and had to make weight for competition). YMMV, but the most effective I have found is taught by Jason Fung. Check out his youtube and his book reviews on amazon. I cannot recommend this guy enough.

I hope someone finds this helpful and encouraging.

Is it just me or does anyone else get a negative nervous anxiety in their stomachs when they have anxiety and it feels like poison when it’s bad?
Has anyone been in a year long depression or longer? I haven’t been able to even get out of bed. I’ve been basically bedridden for a year and I haven’t worked either. I feel useless and I just want it to end.
"Both my parents have bipolar disorder (my mom's wasn't diagnosed but was in the process while in rehab but end up relapsing). I was a manic baby 
They both did heroin and pills. I had a very unstable start. My schedule was backwards and I was malnourished) I ended up living with my grandparents at age 5 because of CPS. 

I've always played with myself. I would have friends but only a few people I can say I've connected with.
I heard trauma causes bipolar to surface faster but children rarely are diagnosed. 

I'm more so curious if anyone has a similar experience and has been diagnosed."
"For those of you who also feel worthless and constantly doubt yourself, how do you fight it? I usually do ok when I’m with other people. But as soon as I get home and am alone, I feel like shit and start to hate myself. My therapist has given me some ideas, but they don’t quite work for me. I have wonderful days with people who love me and who see worth in me, but I can’t feel that on my own. It feels impossible."
I had a bad argument with my father and it’s effecting my sleep. Definitely pushed my stress past my limit. I’ve been on sleeping meds for about a month now to sleep 7-8 hours but without them I sleep 3 hours. Can I prevent a manic episode from occurring?
I take 100mg of geodon a day and 3mg of klonopin daily for my restless leg issue. Does anyone else with bipolar 1 take antipsychotic’s daily?
I get cycsts on my face instead of pimples when I’m really stressed out. Does this happen to anyone else?

"I was very suicidal last week, so I wrote a note with all the important information, picked a date, have a couple of spots in mind, and one purchase to make before I’m ready.

I had to choose a date a few weeks outs, due to family get togethers that I didn’t want to ruin. So I figured I’d give meds one last chance to work. And do a few things for myself that I’ve been putting off.

I down played how bad I was to my therapist last week. She is very much on high alert it seems, which makes me want to share less.
I talk to my psychiatrist Tuesday, and I plan to tell here that I wrote a note and picked a date.
 
I just don’t know if I’m actively suicidal anymore.  Since the day after I set everything up I’ve been a bit depressed but rather calm. None of those frantic, I’ve got to kill myself, thoughts.  Just thinking over my plan and looking for any flaws. 

Should I be expecting a hospital stay in the near future?  Has anyone been to stay in the hospital while in college? How did you deal with getting behind?

I don’t exactly know what I’m looking for here, just want to hear others thoughts I guess."
"The brain fog is unbearable, even my vision feels delayed. I just don't feel good, but that I'm almost normal. My break was drug induced and now that I'm on Vraylar I'm not having delusions 2 months later. Everything just feels slow and lame, I feel cognitively impaired, I can't think or even write. I know people are going to call this the ""new normal"" but I'm telling you this isn't a life worth living now. I had plans, I had creativity, I still have my personality, but I'm just not happy. I'm on anti depressants and I'm not depressed, I'm just lost."
"I got in a wreck Tuesday. (No insurance) My motorcycle tired went flat while I was driving Friday. My physical health is shit. And I have two jobs.

I’m not going away. I’m not ODing. I’m not having a crisis. I’ve got too much shit to do. I managed to keep both of my jobs. I defied the exceptions of everyone that knew me.

I have no idea what tomorrow holds. But I’ve won today."
What does this mean? I was given Seroquel
Should i be concerned about this?
I got in a bad argument with my dad and ever since my sleep has been terribly off. The stress definitely pushed me past my line. I’ve been taking 1mg of Xanax and 25mg of trazadone to sleep at night otherwise I’ll sleep 3 hours. On sleeping pills I sleep 7-8 hours. Has anyone prevented mania or hypomania before?
"Specifically with those on mood stabilizers.

Did they do well? Did they ellicit a hypo/manic response?

Reason I'm asking is because I have a psychiatrist wanting to prescribe them for me. 

But I live with my mom whom is against me going on anti-depressants because (based on what she has read) they can be ineffectual in the long term, and can be made worse by mood stabilizers for those with Bipolar.

She's very skeptical of experts, and is often resistant to what they say...unless they agree with her biases. 

But...I also want to play devils advocate in case she's right.

Soo...if I could get any and all experiences (good and bad) on anti-depressants while on a mood stabilizer, I'd greatly appreciate it."
I was on seroquel and lamictal for almost two months and those were the best results I have ever experienced in my three years of trial and error. But then I got the damn rash. Immediately I went off lamictal I fell into a depressive episode overnight. Now I’m only taking seroquel at the moment and my psychiatrist doubled the dosage. I take it morning and night. Does anyone take it two times a day? If so how long did it take for you to adjust? I feel like a zombie I don’t even know how I’m awake to type this…..
"A month ago I couldn’t get out of bed. 

Why I think it’s working:

I did my taxes on my own for the first time in my adult life.
I started sweating to the oldies with Richard Simmons.
I opened all my mail without crying.
I started watching what I eat.
I started taking care of my nails everyday.
I switched from regular coke to diet.
I get bored lying in bed now as opposed to comfortable.
I found a doctor and went to said doctor after months of procrastination despite health issues. 

There are still things I struggle with that don’t really make sense considering the progress I’ve made in just 3 weeks, and I get sad at night. But I feel way different than I did a month ago. 

But I hope this isn’t the start of mania cause this is how it starts lmao."
"My husband has something going on that hasn’t been diagnosed. He has ADHD but there is more going on and he has brought up the concern of bipolar himself. He has these episodes around the same time during the late afternoon and evening where he will just snap out of nowhere and honestly becomes borderline verbally abusive. He explains it as “seeing red” and is unable to control what he says and his anger. It’s almost like he is drunk to be quite honest and his behavior switches so quickly. It takes him going to bed and sleeping it off and then he’s a new person the next morning and remorseful for acting “that way again”. These episodes don’t happen daily but are frequent enough for us to notice a pattern. They occur maybe once or twice a week on a bad week, otherwise maybe once or twice a month. He has an appointment in early March to address these concerns beyond ADHD. Does this sound like bipolar or something else? Not looking for a diagnosis on Reddit, just want an idea of where we should be looking."
A good friend of mine committed suicide 3 weeks ago. Just found out Wednesday. Need some love
"Curious if anyone has had withdrawal symptoms and what they were coming off of Welbutrin? I went from 300mg daily and did a taper if 150mg for a week and now am off completely. Didn’t want to come off it but my psych said she won’t prescribe it anymore. Feeling like crap physically today, headache and anxiety."
I’m manic. I knew it but didn’t know it to this extent. I got it in my manic head that my ex and first love is still in love with me and we have a chance to get back together. (He wasn’t and we don’t) and I texted him. Nothing embarrassing. Actually scratch that very embarrassing coz I sent and deleted a message (very subtle I know) and he texted me asking whats up with “  “ this emoji. And I also found out he saved my name as Mia on his phone as in mia khalifa (it was a joke many people make coz of the resemblance) and all out I was so embarrassed coz well he obviously knew why I texted him. And I’m so embarrassed. But also a lot more self aware now.
"I've been with my recently diagnosed bipolar type 2 partner for more than 2 years now. I've seen his extreme behavior, sudden shifts in moods, getting triggered and falling in a loop, and staying silent for weeks. Before the diagnosis, I couldn't make sense of any of this and after the diagnosis, I feel like I have a reason to attribute all this behavior. While I really want to be understanding and calm, his behavior triggers me and makes me feel so restless, and often makes me question if I can even rely on him. Right after the diagnosis, he began taking meds, and I really could see some calmness in him. He was able to think through things when I was making mistakes or triggering him. But because he felt that meds make him 'slow' and 'super sleepy', he has stopped them. I have brought up this conversation multiple times and he says he will take it after some time. I don't know what to do. While I want to be there for him so desperately, I feel that without meds or therapy or any habit change, will make me always feel like I can't fall back on the relationship. It's a super tricky thing that I can't talk to anybody about because I know people will judge him and scare me and whatnot. I know that our being together can't have an ""only if you take meds or work on yourself"" condition, but what should I do if it takes a toll on me? Is it right to push him for meds or let him make that call himself and till that time best be away from him? Or just be there irrespective till he finds a way?"
"I flaunt before going silent,

Master of going AWOL,

Hearts broken when I run off,

Bosses confused by impulsive resignations,

When I get the momentum I just want to leap,

Tear down the adhesives of concern and repercussions,

I learned to swim by just jumping in,

I need no commitments,

No time for worries that cause anguish,

Sleep and eating become a hurdle,

While concerned loved ones ask me to take more pills,

But I just like vibrating the energy that I have."
"Manic? Not me! I say to my brand new 10 week old golden retriever puppy that I impulsively bought yesterday. When I got up (because who am I kidding im not actually sleeping) yesterday morning was I planning or even thinking about getting a dog? NOPE.
But when I picked my kid up from school 8 hours later was there a puppy in the front seat? YEP.

Luckily I’m a work from home, homeowner with a fenced in backyard and have the physical and financial means to take care of this very active dog so I’m confident we will give him a very good home. It was just one of those “oh….” moments. I don’t know the first thing about raising a dog lol thankfully ChatGBT has my back. 

Take your meds friends. I’ve been back on mine for 3 days now after taking a month hiatus because I was “better” (unfortunately I continue to struggle with medication compliance even though it always ends badly). This time it’s a 10-15yr commitment in the form of a dog, last time it was 20k spent in 2 months on nonsense that I didn’t need and don’t use. Both times include very embarrassing interactions with friends and family. 

Im printing out this post and putting it on my med cabinet. Enough of this merry go round I’m not nor am ever going to be magically “better” - if I feel that way it means my meds are working."
Anybody else’s OCD (and occasionally ADHD) go in waves with their bipolar cycle?
"Just a PSA for bipolar folx with history of disordered eating. One of the adverse effects of Abilify is binge eating. My psych did not explain this risk to me when they put me on it despite knowing I had a history of disordered eating and body dysmorphia. They told me it was weight neutral which seems to be a common refrain, but it can cause binge eating in some patients and that is important not to gloss over. I am on the lowest dose (2mg) and have gained 20lbs in about six months on it. I've been struggling to control my eating and am NEVER satiated. My new psych just started me on metformin to try to get my weight under control (I'm still gaining albeit not as quickly) because otherwise the Abilify is very helpful for me. I'm pretty frustrated I wasn't informed about this because if I had known this was a potential side effect of my medication, I would have been able to monitor the situation better and identify it as an adverse effect instead of hating myself and food (super triggering ED stuff). I know other antipsychotics are worse for weight gain so I thought I just had to accept being fat in exchange for being stable, which is something I've seen on this sub, as well. However, that is NOT true and my new psych explained to me there are medications that can help curb the appetite increase associated with antipsychotics like Abilify, including but not limited to metformin. If you are struggling with food on your antipsychotic, please discuss it with your psychiatrist. Maintaining a healthy weight is important to long-term health, and your body image is a mental health thing that deserves attention, too. Don't convince yourself that it's just a ""you"" problem even if you're on an ""innocent"" antipsychotic like Abilify. I was very surprised my psych was so receptive to my concerns because I'm usually brushed off about this stuff even though I'm now pushing into unhealthy BMI territory (I'm short so not much room for me, unfortunately), and I was glad to learn there were options besides going off my meds or switching (especially when the alternatives are worse for this issue or not covered by my insurance). Anyway, just sharing in case it helps someone else. 

p.s. sorry for the wall o'text im on mobile"
"I feel strange and bad. It's been pretty bad for two weeks. Trying to find out what it is and how to fix it. So far, I can best describe it as a feeling of being disturbed, agitated, anxious, sometimes panicked, wanting to escape. Permanent loneliness even if I'm surrounded by people. I've had a lot of suicidal thoughts. I feel very uncomfortable and just want it to stop. I want to be peaceful.

I think it's the medication I'm on but I can't be sure. It was just increased but this problem began before the increase. It's very unpleasant."
"For those of you that will need to be on long term antipsychotics, how do you deal with fear and worry about TD? I know they say that not everyone will get it but I just have a really hard time believing that after the research I’ve done, it seems that 5-6% of people get it each year they are on the drug so wouldn’t that add up to 100% over 20 years? Anyone know of someone who was truly on lifetime antipsychotics from their teens/20s/30s and never ended up getting it?

For those of you who have it, is it really that bad? I try to ease my fears by telling myself if I do get it that it will likely be mild and manageable, and hopefully not too disfiguring. I’ve heard so many scary horror stories of more severe cases though. I also fear that I might already have it as I started getting twitching and muscle spasms in my face after being raised to 10mg Zyprexa 2 years ago. It’s been pretty sporadic and has even gone away for 6+ months at a time but it flared up the other day and since then I’ve been worrying myself sick about TD."
"I'm really struggling recently with feeling that, since the onset of my first ever manic episode (about 3 months ago), I have lost so much of what makes me me. I used to be a badass case manager, able to meet the expectations of a demanding job. I was intelligent and concise, with many unique skills and experiences. 

Now, I'm just returning back to work after being on leave, and I'm worried it isn't working. My brain gets jumbled and I can't organize my thoughts like I could. I'm blanking in conversations with others and failing to find the thread of the conversation. And when I get home all the pent up mania comes out, with racing thoughts and paranoid delusions. In all candor I don't know if I can do the job anymore

With where I am right now it's very tough for me to see any way that I can ever get better, get back to my normal self. It feels existentially devastating to lose the me that I loved. This new me just seems lost and hopeless. 

Anyone have any feedback? How long might it be before I get back to the old me, if ever?"
"It seems like I react badly to every medication. I can't even remember how many I've been on. Is it because I have comorbid OCD and ADHD? I feel like they're not working as intended and I'm essentially hopping from one medication to the next. They cause serious side effects too.

I don't know what to do. I've tried so many. I've only ever been on one mood stabilizer though. I don't really know how many options there are. I'd prefer to avoid lithium if I can due to toxicity. As for antipsychotics, there's only a handful remaining."
"I was diagnosed with Bpd 2 around august. Prior to my diagnosis, I voluntarily put myself into a hospital for mental evaluation. Once they decided I’m a danger to myself, I was admitted into the hospital and sent to the behavioral unit which i stayed 48 hours out of my 72 hours. The psychiatrist at the hospital diagnosed me with adjustment disorder which is why i only stayed 48 hours instead of 72. tbh I couldn’t really explain why i was depressed but i can say a trigger was my best friend putting himself into a behavioral unit at another hospital and it worried me so much that it affected my mental health. 

Fast forward to present time, I really don’t understand what bpd 2 is really. I understand that bpd 2 ppl go into very deep depressive episode whereas a person with bpd 1 doesn’t and also that bpd 2 ppl experience hypomania which is less extreme than a full manic episode. 

What I’m trying to understand is what are the signs that u are going into a depressive episode? What are the signs that ur going into a hypomanic episode? I can feel when I’m getting sad and down but is it an episode or is it just me processing my emotions..

My grammar isn’t the best which I’m getting better at but i hope you guys comprehended what I’ve said."
"So I (23F) have bipolar for two years now. I was medicated at first but then quit. Of course I became miserable and impossible to be around with, so five months ago I started w a new doc to Depakin and Abilify. I work from home and i am having concentration problems since then. I have 900 pages to translate but I only did 20 pages in the past five months. This puts my job at risk. I talked to my doc about it and she said she can’t change the meds since they help w hallucinations and bipolar in general. I also have weight problems(it affects my mental health terribly) and she said these r the only meds that won’t make me gain more. 

I still have a lot of pages to translate and I’m starting a post graduate program for game design soon. So I quit meds, and I can concentrate better now. But I’m slowly going into a depressive ep. I know my doc will tell me to start my meds again and she won’t change the meds. That would lead to me losing my job and may be the opportunity for post grad. 

I don’t know what i should do in this position. What are your suggestions? What meds do you use?"
"My psychiatrist told me I am slipping into mania and wants me to take seroquel along with my current meds.

My family is pressuring me to take the medication too.

It felt strange and almost too true when my psych told me my brain is enjoying and gotten so used to moving so fast lately that I am at first not going to be content or happy when things slow down, because I am currently not used to a normal function at the moment."
""
Anyone take anything to suppress nightmares? I've tried Prozasin and it did nothing. I'm treatment resistant in general when it comes to my Bipolar so if anyone has any supplements they could reccomend I'd greatly appreciate it.
I had a bad psychotic episode with paranoia and delusions and psychosis in 2020 and I’m worried it might happen again. I’m going down off of my sleeping medication and I’m worried that the lack of sleep will cause a manic episode.
"There is a self within me. It experiences the world through the lens that is my brain. My brain interprets the sights and sounds, it creates the emotions, it’s where impulses begin and where drive thrives or dies. The brain is unstable, it’s always changing, always adapting, filled with survival mechanisms that are no longer necessary. It creates extreme highs and the deepest lows. It applies these filters, sometimes based on the inputs it’s receiving from the world around it, sometimes based on past experiences, sometimes on trying to guess the future. Sometimes it feels completely random and sometimes it seems malicious. 

The Self within me is experiencing through these filters. To the Self it is easy to seem like these filters are all there is, that they are the absolute truth and there is no reality but the one they portray. Th Self gets tied up in these and becomes one with them. But there is more than that. The Self is capable of so much more. The Self knows what is best, it has dreams, it wants to thrive and feel and experience greatness. It is capable of consistency, its drive is is a force stronger than anything the brain can produce. When the filters of the brain can be stripped away the Self can shine and lead to positive actions, it can take control of the brain and lead it in a direction not based on habits, on what’s already known, on incorrect emotions, addictions, negativity. But in a direction that will bring us to find peace, to thrive, to love, to smile, to experience hope and see it fulfilled. The Self is who I am and I let it drown in the filters of the brain. I forget it’s there and let it become consumed. Bringing the Self out is hard, I can only do it for little bits at a time right now, but the more I do it the better I feel, the more I do it the easier it gets, the more I do it the less filters of the brain are applied and the more I can see. The more my Self can truly experience and the more it can take over the mind to feel what is real. 

I want to find my Self and bring it back to the driving force of my life. Because it is who I truly am."
"I’ll be honest, Ive attempted to break up with my boyfriend MULTIPLE times. Similar reasons most of the time. It’s mainly because I’m unwell and don’t want to hurt him. Ive been up and down since we’ve moved in together in our apartment back in September. At the time we have only been together for maybe 4months?? Sounds awful Ik but I was in a tough situation at the time. Im 18 and he’s 20 btw. Anyways, since we’ve moved in together I’ve had a lot of problems emotionally. At times I’ll get this feeling I don’t want a relationship and just want to be to myself. When I was hypomanic for a few days I had the urge to sleep with someone else so I tried to break up with him and then when I realized I would lose him forever I just changed me mind? My exact words to him were “nevermind” idk I think I was a little delusional. Anyways, it’s been and up and down with me and my emotions towards the relationship. Recently I’ve been really nervous bc the past two days we’d try to have sex I’d get grossed out but like not by him, more myself? We have sex alot tbh bc I’m very hyper sexual. BUT a few days ago I was reminded of my SA, so it’s possible that’s playing a part. Bottom line is I’ve been very depressed and he’s brought to my attention I’ve been rude with him and very short. I’ve definitely recomiendes it and feel bad. But like he’s been aggravating me. Idk what it is. I just haven’t felt very loving towards him and have been questioning if he’s my guy and it freaking me out. I love him so much and we’ve been through a decent amount together and he’s very understanding with my mental health. But, at times he gives me the ick and I’m just thinking “wtf?” Am I overthinking this? Is it normal to want your partner and then not at times? Sorry for the long post, I’m just sitting here racking my brain at work thinking “WTF IS WRONG WITH ME?!”"
"I'm on 150mg xr morning and 300mg xr night and been on it for for 5-7 years for anxiety (no diagnosis of bipolar or schizophrenia etc, just depression and OCD other than anxiety but happy for experiences from people with bipolar especially if you did it under dr/psych guidance, as I sometimes wonder if I have bipolar mild or something and my psych isn't telling me cause I've also been on Lamictal before and I'm on luvox)

Love to know your experiences and tips

If you were on xr did you change to the immediate release first?

Going to speak to my GP but wanted some guidance from people who have done it

Seems like dropping from high to lower dose isn't hard quickly, but stopping all together is and the xr is harder"
"Do I quit or nah?

He literally talks to his self saying vile stuff about me all day, and its triggering me to mur,,,murmer ;)"
"I go through phases like this.

Depression->loneliness->unbridled positivity->mania->extremely outgoing->meet someone->share unbridled positivity->improve their quality of life with positivity-> get taken advantage of-> get broken upwith/kicked out of friend group/ostracized-> depression.

I always make a friend or meet a girl and things are great but then they literally go on to do better. They meet a new guy or they have reflected on their life and made major life changes that cause distance. Always as if I led them on that path.

The common denomination is always me. Whether it's building up someone's confidence or just always being there and being reliable, I always get ditched. There are more facets to it, but I have no friends anymore and my gf is leaving me. It's the same shit everytime. I'm always left shattered into little pieces until I become Mary Poppins for someone again.

Idk how to describe it. But has anyone else been in this cycle? How did you break it? I wish I could meet my Mary Poppins, fix everything, and then I'd hold on to her for dear life..."
"Hi all!

So my doc has just prescribed me 5mg Olanzapine for a week then up to 10mg after. I’m trying this because I just had a hell of a year experimenting with aripriprazole (Abilify) and it caused me anxiety at a level I didn’t even thing possible (and I have OCD to boot).

I tried Seroquel a few years ago and quit after a week as I couldn’t cope with the drowsiness.

I am only two days on 5mg Olanzapine and I’m already sleeping in til 2/3pm and still feeling tired. I managed to get up at 9 today but an hour later was falling asleep mid conversation with my partner. I have a long drive tomorrow which is worrying me and I’m absolutely terrified of the potential excessive weight gain

What are your experiences on this med and any advice on coping with these side effects? Do they get better over time?"
"I read so many negative posts about these kinds of medications.. Wonder if you can share your positive effects on being on them?

 I'm on Vraylar 4.5 mg now, the positive effects I feel is that I don't have a crazy speed of thoughts going on at all time.. Can't tell if it will keep me from going in a mania due to just have used it six months."
"I understand that there’s a difference, but I called them, my episodes. I do have tattoos done mostly from 2022/2021, and during the times I was getting them done at those times, I didn’t get triggered or anything since I’ve been on my meds and hardly had episodes. But, this last January, I went completely off of my meds about almost close to 2 weeks, eventually realized and now during my days, I’ve having a lot of episodes from the start of every afternoon (yes I got back on my meds that I’ve been taking, didn’t helped as much and yes im in the process of treatment).

But, my point is would it trigger me now, knowing my episodes just come at me whenever? 

Thank you for your time of those read/glanced to my message :)"
"The past 3 nights I’m back to one of my bad sleeping patterns. Regardless of when I go to bed, I am up at 2 and can’t sleep again with horrible agitation and skin itching frustration. Doc gave me ambien but that’s about how much it works. I just can’t keep doing this, I want to rip my hair out. I can’t stop skin picking either. In my opinion, my anxiety and skin picking has skyrocketed since starting geodon. But when I tell my pdoc this she just accused me of not taking it. I have only missed 3 doses in the months I’ve been on it, and it was due to being sick (couldn’t keep them down). I just can’t keep doing this but she won’t give me real sleep meds, only benzos that don’t really work (Ativan and ambien). They have literally no impact on my anxiety and keep me asleep for about 2-3 hours only."
"2 of the 24 hours of a day I don't feel like I'm about to pass out. It has been going on for 9 months. No matter how much my dose is decreased, it only takes like 2-3 days until I am chronically tired again. I am so sick of this shit. Sometimes I am taking like 600 mg caffeine just to feel normal for a few hours. I can't remember the last time I've not been tired. People always talk about the weight gain, but for me, I am LOSING weight because I barely eat, I am just fucking tired all day and no appetite and my memory is probably even worse than during an acute episode."
"I realised I'm hypomaniac about a month ago. I got on to meds but have been unable to quit smoking weed. I was good the first two weeks where I only smoked 1 joint but I'm smoking much more right now.

Unable to exercise any control in this department. It's affecting my ability to get any work done (I work full time from home)

"Around 1am, I looked up tickets to a concert in a neighboring state. They were over $100 and I almost got one. The plan was to drive and see the concert alone and then drive back. I've done this over a dozen times, but I was afraid it would make my bipolar worse. And I don't know anyone to go with. 

So I didn't. Now I'm thinking of putting that money in a money market account, which would be very grown up for me. But I'm kind of upset about missing the show."
"My psychiatrist has made me stop taking my 1100mg of lithum I’ve been on for 6 months. I have severe cystic acne on my face and body and I have had the worst depressive episodes ever. I am BP2

Supposed to have my first day on the job today at something I really wanted to do and now I can't even go into work because I got no f******* sleep. 3 hours yesterday none today and I'm crying freaking out unstable because of it. I tried calling off but of course no one is there so I'm just fucked and forced to quit on day 1. So much for opportunities.
"so recently i've acted in ways that make me think i've had a hypo episode. i was overconfident, way overspending, obsessions, hypersexual, reckless, disregard for people's feelings, etc. for maybe a week or two. also, over the past couple of days i've felt like i've been hit with a brick wall, just living in regret and exhausted and tearful, which is a very familiar feeling after a hypo/manic episode. the thing is - i was able to sleep pretty normally the whole time, or if i was sleeping less, it wasn't noticeable. i do recall a few days when it took me a little longer to fall asleep and my heart was pounding, but that's it. i've never had a hypo/manic episode and been able to get a normal amount of (or any) sleep. the only thing i can think of is that i'm on latuda now, which makes me so sleepy, and i take pretty strong sleeping pills (from a dispensary), but in the past sleep aids haven't worked when i'm having an episode.

i'll talk to my psych of course, but asking you all - have you ever been hypo and able to sleep?"
"For those who stopped seroquel- did the weight gain come off even after having a slow taper off of it? I was just got off 25 mgs and I’m dieting and working out but the scales not budging. So, I’m just looking to hear some success stories of losing the weight gain it caused once stopping and how long it took. Thank you"
"here's something my therapists have never managed to give me useful advice for. on top of the bipolar, i also have PTSD. have been heavily abused all my life, and it's fairly easy to set me off on accident as a result. 

i can shut down the panic response pretty well with klonopin, but nothing I've tried has shut down the urge to kill myself post-triggering. i just spend the rest of my day wishing i were dead. never enough to act on it but if someone triggers me at 9am, that's just the end, my entire day is destroyed. 

anyone have a similar arrival with trauma triggers setting off mood shifts? any solutions that have worked for you to recover enough to have a functional day? tia"

"Why is it always about finding the right med? Or getting therapy? When I’m depressed because I’m bipolar and this illness has ruined my life and relationships and overall outlook on life, I don’t think there is a med or therapist out there to fix me. So what now?"
"When I'm not in any sort of episode, I can drink a tasty cup of tea in the morning just fine. No side effects, no bad feelings, no sleep issues etc.

But when I'm (not realizing) unstable or close to being unstable, if I even have a tea that has been steeped for literally 30 seconds, it induces hypomania which often leads to mania. 

I'm not going to go into all of the details of the episode, as I'm sure many of you have experienced it.

I LOVE my morning routine of cozying up on the couch and sipping my tea while my body wakes up. 

I hate decaf green tea. It tastes like piss. I've tried it several times.

I don't want to give up tea, but I don't want to exasperate or heck even cause mania.

What should I do?"
"I'm reflecting back on a mixed episode I had for a few months last year. 

At the time, I was really depressed. I had surgery that left me bedbound for 6 weeks, and by the 4th week, I was horribly depressed. No motivation, sad, suicidal, self-harming, all of that.

I can't remember if my manic symptoms started before or after I started abusing drugs. I would mix together a few mgs of klonopin with alcohol just about every day, if not multiple times a day (again, it's hard for me to remember, very much due to the drugs I was abusing). I just wanted to get high and have sex... I had *so* much unsafe sex back then. I was also terribly restless; I was exhausted, but then I could only sleep 4 hours per night.

It got to the point where I had to admit myself to the hospital because I was looking up how to buy a gun. 

The doctor that diagnosed me with bipolar I said they didn't believe the drug abuse caused this episode. I think it was at least partially caused by drug abuse, even though what I abused were depressants (paradoxical reactions and all that). I'm not sure what to believe, and it makes me feel like I'm faking it all, or that my condition isn't as serious. 

Any feedback?"
I have tardive diskinesia in my legs where I pace around my apartment and I lost 55 pounds from it in 2021. I’m still on the same medicine that causes it. I take 3mg of klonopin a benzo every day because it’s the only thing that helps. Some days are worse than others. Tell me your story!
"Those of you who have experienced extra pyramidal symptoms from antipsychotics, Have you found one that doesn't trigger those symptoms? Supposedly seroquel is supposed to be one of the least likely to cause them, but unfortunately I am still experiencing them on it. I have already failed Abilify and Zyprexa for the same reason. 

Thanks for any insight you can provide."
I want to hear people’s experiences of what they went through. I had a bad manic episode in 2020 and that had delusions and psychosis. I want to read what other people experienced to see if I’ll need to be hospitalized in the future. I’m only 29.
"First of all, apologies regarding my English, it is not my native language.

I just got out of a meeting with my psychiatric nurse. I'm rather upset about it. I'm feeling incredibly manic right now. More specifically, I feel incredibly wired, I can't tell whether I want to bash my head against the wall or go for a long drug and booze binge instead. I feel like God is talking to me through my environment and is watching me all the time. I'm paranoid, easily agitated and I'm having auditory hallucinations at night. It's horrible, but I want to swim in it forever, it is turning into a sick  mental hostage situation with myself. I don't feel like I'm able to take adequatly take care of myself, I want to do drugs, spend my life like it is a big bittersweet party and I daydream about killing myself. I'm simply not a responsible person right now.

This afternoon I've had a meeting with my psychiatric nurse. I have told him all of this. My feelings, my doubts, my worries. I've showed him before-after pictures of my appartement. How a depression dump fest turned into a trendy, squeeky clean revamped and repainted appartment in 48 hours. I've also told him I don't trust myself, I'm currently not responsible enough to stick to my crisis plan and that I need help and advice. 

He told me that if I want to stay in this mental state of being, I simply should try to stay in it as long as I get enough sleep. He can't give me any tips or advice since ""he doesn't know me that well"" . The only advice he could give was to try cannabis, since it works for some people. In all fairness, that is not terrible advice, had I not tell him previous sessions about how I overcame my destructive cannabis addiction 2 years ago. 

Furthermore, I've told him multiple times that I've alienated most of my friends through my depressions, mania's and psychosis. Yet, he still insists I should just lean on my social network. He simply doesn't have any advice, because he ""does not know me that well.""

On top of all that, I have been on a social care waiting list for a month now. I was supposed to get help for my self-neglect. I usually life in a very filthy appartment, I'm underweight, since I'm usually unable to eat and my anhedonia makes it difficult to live life in general. Well.... he took me off the waiting list, since my appartement looks so good now and I'm actually properly dressed for once.

I feel defeated, like nobody can help me anymore at this point. I've tried so many therapists.  I've accepted I probably won't live past 30. I've lost my social network, my job.... I'm close to giving up. 

Did any of you also go through this stage? If so how did you manage."
"Does anyone have any experience with getting a reading done by a psychic? If so, did you find it helpful?

Before anyone says anything, no, I am not manic. Yes, I am rationally minded, and so I am approaching this idea with a healthy amount of skepticism. I had a palm reading done once (a very short one / free of charge) at a Renaissance Festival, and I found the little she told me to be incredibly spot on. I have never paid for these kinds of services, and I am hesitant to do so, because I do not want to be taken advantage of.

I am not completely on board with seeking help from the realm (whether or not it exists) of magic and mysticism, especially after having had experiences with psychosis. I also do not want to allow myself to believe anything that might bring false hope into my life. At the same time I do need hope, and it seems like even having someone offer compassionate words of guidance may be beneficial in some way.

I have been struggling to clear my head of a past relationship / “situationship” as I have learned to call it, and the following issues I had with being unable to move on. While I am going to therapy, I feel like I’m stuck in the same pattern in sessions. I just wish it entailed less of me having to come up with an accurate way to describe my level of depression each week and delving into past trauma and regrettable decisions, so maybe I am seeking out some kind of magic  after all. Thoughts?"
"My husband was recently 5150'd. (BP 1, currently 22 days into episode) He's at a mental health facility calling me a lot, every hour sometimes. He doesn't stay on the phone for long. He just keeps telling me ""I'm tired, I'm so tired but I can't sleep. I'm so tired mentally and physically.""

I don't know what to say to him. My heart breaks for him. I can't image what he is/has been going through. So am asking what would have helped you or what is something that you wanted to hear or maybe did hear. Thank you for your help."
I have just been diagnosed from bipolar NOS to bipolar type 2 with co morbid anxiety and was just curious of other people’s experiences and medication regimens that have kept them stable
"I either start a new med and it helps my mind but destroys my body, OR it doesn't harm my body but destroys my mind. Right now both are occurring. I feel really bad.

Really feeling like I'd rather just live with unmedicated BP 1 because the meds aren't working. I'm barely on any mood stabilizer and only on an antipsychotic because my doctor believes I have schizophrenia and doesn't listen when I tell him I was formally diagnosed with BP 1."
"Do your bipolar shifts actually come in handy at work? I find I’ve developed over time a “don’t f with me” attitude even during the depressive times so when someone messes with me, I fight back.  

I work in a male dominated field. I went to a location yesterday where this (not anymore) “location manager” was not happy I was there to verify his stuff. He got in my face and told me “you WILL respect me while you’re here.” I guess my laughter in response should have been his first indicator that I am NOT the one. I am not your wife bud. I WILL not be doing that. 

At the end of the day…he was short. Like, really short. We knew he would be. He charged off over $9,000 worth of inventory the week before. I was in the office with our boss and had our ceo on speaker phone. I gave my recommendation for the location to be shut down - more than short, they bring in substantially less than our other locations. He was listening in on the other side of the door and flew in there screaming and carrying on. We’re trying to de escalate the situation and boom. His fist is repeatedly on my face and the next thing I knew, I had him on the floor and my boss and 2 other men pulling me off of him. 

Ceo heard it all and was already on his way. Cops were called, the whole bit. He’s out a job and the company is pressing charges."
"i take vraylar and lithium to manage my bipolar. 


i slept over at a friend’s house last night, and of course i didn’t have all my meds. i only had my vyvanse and gabapentin available to me. i went ahead and took those before heading home to take the rest of my medication. during the hour i went without my vraylar & lithium, i felt more like myself than i have in MONTHS. 


my doctor already suggested i could taper down on the lithium, but i was scared, because it hasn’t yet been a year out from my hospitalization. well, I’m nearing that 1 year mark, and i think I’m ready to taper down. however, i am terrified of having a manic episode. 


anyone have similar experiences?"
"I can’t deal with anything anymore, I’m loosing my mind. I broke up with my girlfriend last year and I’m still not over her, last night she texted and made fun of me because of that. I don’t have work. I have 19 units in college. I can’t even control my sleep schedule anymore. I can’t eat the way that I used to. I feel like everything is falling apart. I don’t want to die but I think that’s the only way. I don’t even have anyone to talk to. Anyone that I talk to tell me that my life is good but the truth is my life always looked good from others perspective.
I don’t know, I hope someone can help me.
Thank you"
"I've been prescribed quetiapine. I think it is the only option I have currently. I stopped taking them for a while and completely fell off the rails. So it's necessary I take them. I'm much better now, I can take proper care of myself. Eating properly, showering, exercising everyday etc. 

The only problem I seem to have is that when I get woken up on them, in the middle of the night which happens sometimes when my boyfriend can't sleep, I end up having a meltdown? I wake up delusional. 

He ends up having to hold me in place until I stop crying or scratching or you know, you get the idea. I think the hallucinatory aspect is quite strong for me. So everything comes in at once. Voices telling me he hates me, my brain not being able to make sense of my life. I've had a hard life, I didn't even have parents but that's just the start of it. So sometimes I still think I'm back in that place. 

I end up waking up feeling ashamed. I want to help myself so he doesn't have to do this at night. He says he doesn't mind helping but you know with bipolar, I've kinda always felt like there was only so much I could ask of my loved ones. 

I was wondering if anyone had any advice at all. It doesn't even have to be about the meds. They're working and it's hard to see a psychiatrist here. I just need advice about suffering delusions. Any insight or personal experience would help so much."
"Started about a week and a half ago. Just upped my dose 5 days ago from 150mg to 300mg after being on 150mg for a week.

First week I didn't feel much, but after the dose change everything feels dream-like. I also feel like I'm mildly high. I have a lot of energy, on the verge of jittery. I also have the typical side effects of dry mouth, issues staying asleep, some anxiety, and lack of appetite. But I'm also feeling emotional and cry once a day.

I really want to stick it out and see if the side effects lessen over time because I like the energy it gives me.

If anyone can share their experience, I would be really appreciate it. Thanks!"
"I don’t mean abuse wise or experienced trauma like that. I actually had an objectively good childhood outside of some extended family drama. My parents and sibling care about me and we are relatively close.

However.

I was born turbulent. From ages 2 to maybe 6-7 I would have insane tantrums. Insane. I couldn’t explain what felt so horrible, but it basically felt like a mixed episode. I wanted to rip my skin off so I screamed all night until I lost my voice. My parents could never understand what was happening because I simply couldn’t explain it besides screaming and saying I didn’t know what was wrong. I spent a decent amount of preschool voiceless from screaming all night.

When I wasn’t having tantrums screaming for the entire night, I would cry myself to sleep in secret. I have no idea why I felt so melancholy at 3 but I would tell myself it was a good thing. I told myself that if I cried into my stuffed animals enough, they would become real and be my friends. I felt completely consumed by sadness at times.

I also had irrational fears. This may be within the normal spectrum but I always had the same theme of fears - of being watched by something I didn’t know. I thought moles lived under my bed and would come out at night to watch me. Yes literal moles lol. I also had a period of time where I was scared that leprechauns were secretly following me. This is normal kid stuff to an extent, but I can’t help but feel I have the same vein of fears now when at times I’m absolutely terrified of being watched at night or feeling followed by something small.

I eventually learned to tame myself. I always struggled with the same issues but I was able to navigate life in a fairly average manner from. ~7-22/23. I will always be a naturally volatile soul but I was largely able to function and use my brain.

As soon as I hit 23/24 I took a nosedive. Got severely depressed then manic and then many horrible mixed episodes and fears that felt quite familiar. Sometimes I have weird dissociative moments where I am back to childhood. I feel sucked in, I feel 3 years old and unable to verbalize it. It makes me deeply uncomfortable to share that because there is nothing objectively wrong with my childhood and I want to protect my family from any of those jusdgements. It wasn’t them, it’s just the way I was born. I feel like I was simply born chaotic. I mastered myself briefly but my brain changed back + some worse items at 23/24. But I feel it’s always been there, and I could feel I was not normal even at 3 years old."
""
I was wondering what's you opinion on seraquel or ability shots?
"The past couple of weeks, when I have driven the cars on the road would start to pulsate forward along with he street signs, and the road as well. I don't know how else to explain it. 
Could someone enlighten me please? It started shortly after starting latuda."
"Hey y’all - found out my ex cheated. Suspicions confirmed. Oddly enough instead of depression, it sparked a hypomanic episode and I’m concerned it could become bigger than that. I have been stable for years (thank god ) but I have forgotten how to cope with and curb these episodes and I’m honestly a bit scared. If anyone has any tips/reminders I’d be very grateful."
Does anyone else have paranoia and psychosis and delusions with their manic episodes?
"I want to hear other's experiences, as I'm sure it's veryy different from being hospitalized for depression. I live in the U.S., where our mental hospital system is pretty horrible. If you also live in the U.S., I extra want to hear your experience. What was it like for you? How were you treated by staff, etc."
I have to stay overnight and I might get admitted to the ward again. Can anyone cheer me up
"I feel like I don’t have the capacity to work anymore. I’m medicated on lithium and seroquel (seroquel as needed) im only working 2 half days per week and as l can’t work 5 days per week.

I still have episodes and my last one I was so depressed I couldn’t get off the couch. My entire mindset changes, I don’t need this job I don’t care anymore, I’m worthless anyway I hope I die.

Then when I’m hypomanic I’m like the most productive person on earth and I have a thousand creative ideas of what I should do, I’m going to be a successful pastry chef! I could be a mechanic!  this actually isn’t helpful and I ended up spending $5000 on a personal training qualification I got too depressed to do when I came down from my hypomanic state. 

So I find myself in this predicament where I do NOTHING and I’m not going to work. I really want to get across to whoever is reading this, that I’m not a lazy person; but I’m not even convinced of this myself. I feel perpetually guilty about this. I’m about to be medically discharged from the Navy and I have no other options, and I’m too discombobulated to try and pull myself together. I feel like I am disabled and I don’t know what to do. 

Does anyone have any help they can give me? How do I find a job that I can do and hold down? Is my medication all wrong?"
"I guess lot of people in their 20s may relate to what I'm trying to say, but me being 26 and I would say majority of my life I've been struggling to build confidence and awareness in life. I mean I don't have that confidence, self esteem, self worth or having that belief like yo, I'm just better as a person next to me. But all my life, I've just been harsh to myself like always judging or overthinking which leads to the feeling of overwhelmed and emotionally mentally drained and exhausted. Part of being alone or something just makes me want to live a sad zone life. Even though I wish Im always happy outgoing active person. But the fear of unknown and constantly doubting myself has made me a weak link. I guess I've always been focusing and putting all my energy into my weakness. Never once I dig in myself to find what good traits do I posses or something. 

I guess I'm always nice and helpful to others and give good moral support but I can't find the willpower and courage to help myself. I always avoid me and til this day. I have no clue why I keep doing this. People say it's only you who can change yourself. Nobody else can. 

Idk what I'm doing with life. I don't feel present. I'm always living in my head and all this thoughts and overthinking lead me to become a procnator. It's like people way younger than me have sorted life out and decide they want to be in this field or make this amount of money. They are taking risks and challenges everyday despite how hard life is. And I'm making all the excuses in world like what??
I ask myself everyday, if they can do it. Why can't I"
"I guess the depression is back. Time to switch from fighting myself to slow down to trying to force myself to do things. I know the more I force myself to slow down the better things are when I’m in that state but that’s so much easier than trying to make myself do the things I need. 

I don’t feel strong enough to do this."
"I got accepted to complete my undergrad but I'm feeling very apprehensive going back. I wasn't even excited or relieved. I'm in a depressed numb state and worry how I'll handle studying when I suffer the most with depression even though I'm type 1. do you have any advice for me? thanks in advance. I'm medicated btw, antipsychotic, mood stabiliser, antidepressant"
"I’ve been having difficulties with concentration, inattentiveness, zoning out and forgetfulness for a long time and it has got worse over the years. Also word recall - gah, that one is very embarrassing. I make mistakes at work (which, as well as making me look like a total melt who doesn’t care about their job, causes a lot of stress and extra work because hilariously I work in a job that is periodically very high pressured and attention to detail and accuracy is a must), I don’t seem to listen or take things in properly and mess stuff up at home too. It’s not imaginary, I was almost fired from a job many years ago because of this.

Admittedly I’m not on an even keel right now (grims flavour) but does anyone have problems with their memory when they’re well? The cognitive crud just seems to persist afterwards.

I take lithium, lamotrigine and quetiapine, only 200mg (instant at night) of the latter, rather than the stupefying doses I’ve taken in the past that would definitely account for dulling. I’m in my late thirties, so too young for menopausal fun and games. 

It’s got to the point where I thought I might have ADHD as well as bipolar, or early onset dementia, I also thought about messing with my meds but after a cursory google it seems I’m not alone in this. I don’t know how much longer I can stay in my current job, which I generally like and pays a reasonable wage. I’m absolutely terrible at it and the fear of making mistakes is stressful and if there’s anything guaranteed to put the kibosh on going to sleep and being productive and accurate the next day at work it’s stress.

I think I need to stop feeling sorry for myself and admit I can’t work to the same degree as other people. I didn’t finish university (several attempts) and have made my peace with that, I should do the same with work. I do the usual stuff to be organised at work and home, with varying degrees of success. I outwardly appear very organised, I dread to think how bad it would be otherwise. 

I don’t have a psychiatrist but am seeing a GP next month and will ask them to make a referral. I don’t know how long/if I’ll get an appointment though because I’m not very unwell.

I just wonder how many people who are stable struggle with their memory. How do you manage it? Is it redundant to point out how crap and unfair this is?"
"I was diagnosed bipolar 1 at 14 after Prozac sent me into a mania. From there I was put on carbamazepine, depakote, etc all of which kept me safe but made me very sedated. 
Fast forward to 19 lamictal changed my life. Moving out of adolescence and far away from my abusive mother helped too, I’m sure. 
I’m currently pregnant with my second baby and some circumstantial stressors have brought on depression and for the first time in years intrusive thoughts. I plan to see a talk therapist but my psychiatrist made quite a few suggestions that I’m not sure what to do next. I’m afraid to take anything that will increase my serotonin (SAM-e) because of my experience with Prozac. I’m also worried about taking Seroquel when I’m already exhausted from pregnancy. But I’ve also never addressed my OCD and it’s becoming pretty uncomfortable to live with. I’ve taken a Benadryl in the past when I needed to stop an anxiety attack. Can I take Seroquel occasionally? Any suggestions welcome. Below were my psychs recommendations. 
-increase lamictal from 100mg to 150mg
-start Seroquel 25mg
-take 2,000mg fish oil 
-take SAM-e"
"I am 48yo diagnosed BP2; my wife filed for divorce about a year ago and I moved out of our house. We share custody of our 12-year-old and things are relatively amicable. Ex started dating right away but I wasn't in a good place for awhile (went off meds) and didn't want to inflict myself on anyone.

BUT I was recently feeling lonely around the holidays and went on a few apps and created profiles, chatted with a couple of people, and then Katie messaged me. My age, very attractive, obviously smart, funny right away. We exchanged numbers, had a nice coffee date, followed by me asking her out again. I had feelings for her fast, which was scary but also made me take a chance.

On our second date we eventually wound up at her place and smoked some weed and made out and it was intense. I wound up spending the night and in the morning I woke up terrified. Surely she would find out I was a sick imposter who paled next to her in every way.

She has a successful career, makes more money than me, has her shit generally together, and is so freaking nice I can't believe it. She made me toast and tea in the morning and told me she likes the way I hold her and kiss her, just basically said all the right things.

I texted her the next day and came completely clean about not being completely over my divorce, bipolar and meds, credit in the toilet, a messy patchwork of jobs making no money, trying to raise a kid, alcohol problems, you name it. Was just totally honest.

I thought that would do it. She'd write me off as a fun time, end of story. But she invited me over again. And then again. She seems to really like me but I still feel like a huge imposter and that I'll just fuck up this relationship--my first after nearly two decades of marriage--like everything else. I'm scared shitless.

I don't even know why I'm posting this I guess it's just looking for some sort of encouragement? I was very depressed in my marriage and now I feel happy but not manic but it's all just WEIRD and I have trouble describing my current emotions to the few buddies I have. My ex isolated me from a lot of my long-time friendships as a control mechanism. 

I have a great therapist, meds that work after taking years to get it right (depakote, effexor, trazadone), and now this seemingly great, new, accepting relationship with a hot woman. Except I worry all the time. Didn't mean to ramble on for so long.

But it's going to be all right, right?

I hate this illness. It makes me question everything."
"Grad school has not been an easy journey for me. The stress really triggers my episodes, not only that, but i’m grieving the loss of my father who passed away a month ago. I’m really struggling to stay afloat, even with academic accommodations (which I still haven’t used because i’m a bit embarrassed). I just needed some tips if you have any or words of encouragement to keep going, because i’m considering taking the summer semester off (which would mean I graduate a semester later). I just really want to do well, you know? and i’m scared I’ll screw everything up"
"I feel revved up in the mornings after 2-5 hours of sleep, but then when afternoon comes around, I start getting depressed and having very negative thoughts. I also sometimes hear things and see flashes of light throughout the day, but I know the voices etc are not real.

"Hi, I'm currently struggling with some addiction issues. I'm medicated with Bipolar 1, but my final cocktail hasn't been determined and it does little for the depression. I've tried out lithium, Latuda and Abilify, but they don't do much for me. I feel dead inside all the time and I'm constantly craving sensation, so I turn to drugs or alcohol, even though it's endangered my life and caused me significant injury among other things. It's just that feeling something is better than feeling nothing even if it kills me. I feel like I've got a black hole in me that can't be filled so I end up doing stupid things to see if that'll work. I was wondering if anyone else has dealt with this and has any advice."
"I'm so scared. Starting in Dec 2021 I went downhill, I thought it was just a depressive episode but it went way beyond that. Not sleeping, drinking excessively multiple times a week, sleeping around, thinking I could get anything I wanted, racked up CC debt. Still not 100% convinced I was in a full manic episode but it was behavior and feelings I have never had before. In Sept 22 I said I needed help and started treatment and lessing my drinking and got back in therapy. I have made progress over the months and feel better. 

A few weeks ago the guy who I was casually dating ended things, we have a long history and I have always wanted more but it was very toxic. I can now feel myself having the same thoughts as last year, Im not sleeping well, and I'm starting to think about some actions to do to get attention and feel something again. I am terrified of going back to the place I was last year but I'm also terrified of becoming to depressed also. 

I just want some opinions or tricks you have done to ground yourself and not let these thoughts take over. I can't lose myself again."
"CW: paranoia, delusions? 

i can’t take my meds anymore because i’m straight up convinced it will kill me. that it’s poison. it sounds so crazy and paranoid but it feels so real to me, you know? like it’s such a reality. my boyfriend is telling me to take my meds because it will take those feelings away, but to me it’s so real and feels like you’d have to eat poisoned food that u know is gonna kill you when you eat it. i just can’t do it and i don’t know what to do. if i told my psychiatrist i feel like she would definitely admit me to the hospital and i really really cannot do that rn."

"Has anyone ever taken ziprasidone. I’m on 100mg a day for bipolar 1 and the side effects are kicking my ass. Tardive diskinesia zero
Libido. Cavities. I’m worried about the side effect it has on your heart. Some people don’t take it because it can effect the beat of your heart. Should I not be on this drug and try something different?"
"Ive been on lithium for a few years and really like it. I haven’t had any manic episodes since being on it and have been stable.
That being said that past few months I’ve been struggling with my mood a lot. Being irritable and little things not going my way will have me spiraling for hours. Life just feels harder these days. I don’t feel manic or depressed how I’ve ever experienced it unmedicated,but i wanna know if other medicated homies experience this.
Does bipolar still tickle your brain on lithium? 
Has anything helped besides med changes?
Thanks cowboys"
"I’m feeling so frustrated and overwhelmed and really need some advice.
Back in November I had to stop taking Seroquel due to weight gain and hair loss. My psychiatrist switched me over to Latuda and I’ve been taking it ever since. Since I stopped the Seroquel I’ve spiraled into a pretty bad mixed episode. My anxiety is at an all time high, I haven’t been able to sleep, and I over all feel worthless.
Yesterday I finally had an appointment with my psychiatrist after making the switch and I explained to her how I’ve been feeling and she completely dismissed my concerns. She told me I should just up my dose and to give it time. I asked her if there is anything she could give me for my anxiety and she said she would have to look into it?? I also asked her for something to help me sleep and she said to try melatonin despite having told her I had already tried it and it didn’t work.
Am I overreacting or is my psychiatrist just not taking how I feel seriously?"
Im currently in what the title states. so uncomfortable and i cant get sleep. in the morning i will go get some beer to help but does anybody have other tips? i wish i just had a girl who i could hug but no
"As the title says. I am having a down episode and ashamed to talk about it. Bipolar 2, and generally rapid cycles. So the shame is because I have no triggers and this could lift away in a couple hours... or days, or weeks, or months. The out of control aspect is making me isolate myself. I also keep measuring myself, I don't know if I am ""bad enough"" to take time off because what if I am worst tomorrow, and need it more? No obvious answer there other than how I should respect that and take care of myself. I know the logic and what I'd tell another person. I have difficulty to accept it for myself, I expect that I ""just"" need to keep pushing. Makes me a horrible person if I really think about it: why do I tell others that their feelings are valid, but I can't tell that to myself? Why are others always the ones more valid? 

Writing it down dows brings some answers. Was gaslight a lot growing up, followed by some parental neglect trauma. Guess it ties up and I should see my therapist soon. 

I appreciate reading you all here, I know I am at least not alone."
"Does anyone else feel like their friends/people only like them because they're medicated? I've been intense my whole life and last year did a lot of hurtful things to people on accident. And now that I'm medicated I feel like a different person in kind of a good way, but I can't help but feel like people only want to be around me NOW because I'm medicated. I don't know if that makes sense but it makes me feel bad because I had no control of my emotions and actions and now that I do I feel super guilty and a bit of a jerk."
"I think I'm starting to feel it, but I've only had one dose, nothing bothers me Alot, but I feel so sleepy"
"um, so heads up, when I searched for Bi-polar on reddit, there seems to. be 2, and this seemed to be the more approachable one, so here I am.

I am not self. dionosing , nor do I have an official diagnosis. Just a prickle of the mind.

I have no clue if I am Bi-polar. The very idea that I have it is kinda scary, but recently, that kinda changed. I guess I will get into the meat of the story.

Manic episodes.

I think I have been getting them, I think. They seem to tick off the boxes of the symptoms online, at least some of them. People were kinda right online. Its like a twisted sense of happiness, at least for me. Its like the world suddenly became more floaty, and brighter. I could have floated and flew if I could. Its like constant music blasted into the ears and veins, making your feet dance even its 4 am in the morning, and nobody will be around. I had to move around those times. Run , walk , skip. No matter what it is, just keep moving. My heart races and my hands couldnt stop shaking. My empathy just drops to 0 and I no longer see people as people, more like objects. The best way I can describe it , its like Hysterical boredom. 

And these, at least for me, are extremely bloodthirsty. When I am under this state, I really wanted to kill , or seriously maim somebody. Like I wanted to hold something and either strangle it, or. just use a knife. Doesn't matter, as long as I end its life. Be it animal, or human. Even if I will lose in the example. Just wanted to. spill some blood, or end somebody's life. Its kinda scary. I have yet to act on these thoughts, but I swore off alcohol , drugs, because I fear that I might actually act like this should I have be given the chance.  But those things only remained thoughts, but they are noisy, and never shut up.

Then, after a few minutes, its gone. 

Thats the weird part. from what I have heard, it has to last for at least a few hours, or a few days. I don't really count this as manic, because not only do the thoughts only remained as thoughts, the epiddes last too short for them to be considered as true episodes. The longest I had was probably about 3 hours, before it just faded into nothing. However, the states just happens randomly, and It can occur Mutiple times a day.

I also don't have the lows part. Or at least, they do not present themselves really obviously or like that.I do have the low thoughts, and the self doubt, and the attributing to being nothing. I do know that the thoughts of suucide do linger for quite bit, but just like the manic stuff, they not only just remains as thoughts, they are usually gone after an hour or two, sometimes within 30 mins. These do not occur so often as. the highs though.

I also do feel really tired, but that is a norm, because no sane person should be sleeping at 7am. Just school work, however. 

So yea, kinda weird things going on. I have no clue even if this is really worth going to the doctor for, since its timings have yet to clock to the usual timings for both high and lows, so I might just end up without a diagnosis. I do still think that they can be eerie at best, and disruptive to my work at worst. I have immediately settled into work, being knocked away from a high because I saw my deadlines. So I am starting to wonder is this even a manic episode."
"A question to everyone in the forum. If you have been diagnosed BP, did you ever take the MMPI or the MCMI personality tests? Was it part of your diagnosis, or have you ever taken either of them post diagnosis, and did it show indicate your bipolar? What are your experiences with testing and diagnosis with testing?"
"And then I'm actually situationally depressed. I am normal or hypomanic and I am like, crap I lost my job, ignored friends, didn't pay rent, didn't clean. All the things I did not care about at all, I suddenly care a lot about. And I messed it all up.

 I'm coming out of the fog and I lost my job as a teacher (used up all my days). I can probably get another teaching job, but I'll just lose that. 

There was just no way I could manage 30 children for 8 hours when I was so heavy, I could barely make it to the bathroom. 

I love teaching and I'm good at it. I was on point, on point. Shower every day, professional clothes, good evaluations, organized.

 I'm so sad. The depression was building, lack of sleep, and I pushed as long as I could. Then it just hit. Could not wake up, get up, feel anything. 

And now I am just looking at the rubble and it's making me depressed in a different way. Like, all the work I have to do to rebuild a life."
"I'm currently taking a low dose of Klonopin to deal with my anxiety. If I don't take it it just gets worse and it's been interfering with my work/home life. 

Are there any meds out there good for alleviating anxiety? No to Risperidone and any anti depressants. Not asking for medical advice, just any meds you've used that work."
I have 20mg propranolol and it says twice daily as needed I take the first dose at 12:50 how long should I wait to take the other dose??
The past few nights I’ve gotten around 3-5 hours of sleep. This is normal for me except when I wake up now I feel like I’m not sleeping at all. I just went through a few week long awful depressive episode and now this. I’m not extremely depressed right now but I don’t feel like I’m hypo. I’m just kind of here. I don’t have an inflated self esteem and I’m so exhausted because I haven’t been sleeping well. I’ll wake up constantly throughout the night and then feel like I got no sleep at all. Could this be early stages of a hypomanic episode? Or just some random insomnia?
"It's probably silly that I don't know how to tell considering I got diagnosed years ago, but I don't.  Maybe because I was doing pretty well for several years, maybe I lost my touch, idk.  

I definitely had a mixed episode starting in either late October or early November.  This much is clear to me (well, after loved ones & friends pointed it out lol).  It was bad.  You can look at my post history and see it was bad lol.  For about a month I was not doing not well at all.  I could not sleep, I had a self-harm relapse for the first time in years, I was dealing with what I'm pretty sure was psychosis (paranoid thoughts), I got put on familial suicide watch because I was acting erratic but not quite to the point of anyone wanting to force me to the hospital.  So, that was November.

December.  I thought I was doing pretty well in December for the first week or two!  My sleep got a lil better (it's always bad but, less bad).  I was still feeling very depressed and agitated but if it was an 9/10 in November, it was like a 6-7/10 by December. I was able to focus on work a bit more rather than constantly spiraling and getting distracted by dumb, weird obsessions. I thought it was over, or at least fizzling.  

Well, January was very bad.  Very very very bad.  Maybe even worse than November bad! Yes, indeed I got put on familial suicide watch AGAIN and this time they did very much threaten me with the hospital.  I swear I'm trying but I'm just not doing well right now and I don't feel quite ""right"" even though I'm not, as of the moment, a threat to my physical wellbeing. Just super agitated, angry (at myself), obsessive, major insomnia, etc.  

**TLDR:** I had a real bad mixed manic episode in November and despite feeling better in late December, it seems to have only lasted for a couple weeks because now I'm pretty obviously bad off again.  I've never had rapid cycling before so if this is rapid cycling, it's new. I can't really tell if the previous mixed state ended or if I just had a couple weeks of higher functioning while still manic.  Honestly, how the heck do you tell?"
Since I hate talking now I have to write an email. I don’t want to but I have to. Ugh I hate trying to explain symptoms I’d rather hide
"As an entrepreneur that constant crisis mode (first that virus and now wars) has pushed me into a mixed episode as my startup really gets torn between all that - especially now that each country seems at (trade) war with each other - while bureaucracy, tax fights, regulation and such is also at an all time high as governments all operate at a deficit and thus are desperate for cash while also somewhat on a power drive!

In 2020 I was months away from an IPO but then we hopped from crisis to crisis. So went from a traumatic childhood and being totally broke to almost IPO and at that point even became a member of the World Economic Forum and then was pushed back into hell by all that.  
I mean some part if the business is still doing very well so it's not all bad but still... it just sucks and I feel totally exhausted.

I am diagnosed Bipolar II and ADHD and start to have a hard time not lashing out at those idiots... there's a good chance that I might despite not wanting it insult some government officials which again will result in penalties and long-term damage... damn how do I handle that... I mean there are things I need to take care of personally and not everything can be delegated.

At the same time I consider myself a world citizen so seeing the world falling apart like this is hard to bear but well can't change that.

Psychologically it's all a nightmare right now."
I have experience with Seroquel. Love the way it made me feel but I learned to only take 1/4 of the smallest dose. I still got tardive dyskinesia symptoms and others so had to stop. Now I have vraylar but have been too scared to take it. Is it similar to Seroquel? Should I expect extreme drownsiness or anything else? I wanna know what to be prepared for as far as if it knocks you out like Seroquel or anything.
"Top 10 rants
1. I am experiencing a higher degree of autistic irritability!
2. I can hear every noise
3. I am constantly overwhelmed
4. My children find it hilarious to make loud high pitch noises trigger irritability, overwhelmed, and annoyance
5. I can’t cope
6. This is all fixable but I didn’t even notice the change due to autism
7. People keep being ignorant I don’t have time for it or people diminishing my experiences. 
8. I am cranky
9. Now I have to be functional enough to talk on the phone to my psych
10. Sorry so irritable overwhelmed and annoyed and cranky"
"Not sure if anyone has experienced this on meds. I'm finding that my brain is acting *very* strangely. 

I feel incredible panic. Very unpleasant sensation of doom. I've been developing random phobias that seem to be stacking on top of each other. I'm so nervous about life and existence. I can calm myself down but can't remove that ""feeling"". The best way to describe it is imagine that urgency of nausea, like the need to ""fix"" something, only its in my brain rather than my body. Anxiety has quadrupled immensely over the past few weeks or months.

I just want to feel peaceful. I haven't been calm in months. My brain feels like it's sinking."

"I went to a psychiatrist with suspicions of depression, adhd, and ocd. I’m currently treated for anxiety and that is going well. But to my surprise, while I had tendencies of adhd and ocd, he informed me I fit the criteria for bipolar disorder (I will need further evaluation to really crack down what’s going on).

I’m just curious and trying to u dee stand what I’m feeling now that it’s been brought to my attention. I recently have been reckless with money I don’t have, craving behaviors to run off and travel or get new tattoos or just ANYTHING. I don’t need sleep, I love to exercise, and my days are filled to the brim with exercise, work, and activities from 5am until late into the evening. But at the same time, anytime I take a break - a rest day or snow day or whatever - I cannot be motivated to do a single thing. Or in this case this morning, I would feel hella motivated to get up and do something exciting and considered calling out of work for the day just because. Yesterday, I left midday and said I’d work from home and then never did. There are more details about my mania, but I’m sparing for the length of the post.

I have had definitive depressive and manic episodes (according to the psych) lasting weeks and months, but right now I feel like I’m manic with rapid and crazy downswings of depression a couple days per week and I can’t tell if it’s like, a mixed mania period or if the thought of working/doing something under stimulating is i motivating and therefore depressing.

I guess long story short, I’m just looking for insight from real people"
"I'm writing this after I wrote the bottom portion. I've scheduled an appt for the psychiatrist early in the morning and I called in sick.

Now to the bad part.

I'm having a brutal past few days. I'm breaking. I'm in so much pain. I can't even begin to describe it.

I assume I'm in some sort of mixed hypomanic state right now. I'm no longer sleeping and I'm experiencing extreme emotions. I've been having paranoid delusions according to my family, where I think people are trying to damage my internet and watching everything I do online.

Edit: I came back to this post and realized that I was hasty to consider physical illness as being viewed better than mental illness, when in reality that isn't the case for most disorders. I'm just bad at representing myself. I acknowledge the stigma is bad for mental illness but was told by a family member that there are many people who understand/care about mental illness, and many people who don't care or won't acknowledge any kind of illness."
"I’m experiencing a bad depression after a massive manic episode in 2021 that lasted for months. During those months I destroyed all of my relationships with friends and family, my finances and my career and got a bunch of tattoos on my arm that I regret every single day. I ended up moving back in with my parents at 32. 

I’m on disability for bipolar now and I honestly haven’t done anything the past year besides smoke weed and scroll on tiktok. I feel like a giant failure and although I know I need to get my life up and moving again, I just can’t. 

I stay in bed. I do nothing and I talk to no one. My life feels like one continuous loop. I feel that I’ll always be a loser. 

I don’t even know what the point of this post is. I just can’t believe that this is my life or that things have gotten this bad. 

I just want a normal life with my own family and a good job. A chance at a husband and kids with my own home and friends to hang out with. 32 is starting to feel too old to acquire those things or the life I really want. 

What have I done to my life? :("
Tonight all I want to do is work on a personal art project. I have work tomorrow and I have so much reading to do for school. I’m resisting manic tendencies with all my might but because I’m spending all my energy doing that I’m unable to do anything else with my time besides scroll. I have so much homework that I was supposed to do tonight but just couldn’t because I’m trying so hard to keep mania at bay. I hate this! I wish I weren’t in school so I could just do my art! Ugh just needed to rant. When you are trying to keep mania at bay do you also find yourself paralyzed?
"I’ve been watching a lot of murder shows recently, and when a person goes missing, something the cops will ask is if the missing person has a history of abnormal behavior that may have made them wander off somewhere. Cops seem to take missing person cases more seriously if someone is perfectly normal and doesn’t have any sort of issues. I always wondered what would happen if I were to go missing. Would my family suggest that my bipolar is acting up? Maybe I’ve gone psychotic again? I may have actually been kidnapped by a stranger, but my bipolar will shine right over that, no matter how many years I’ve been stable. I feel I would soon be swept under the rug if I am not found. Idk, just some shower thoughts. It just made me think that my character and judgement will forever be tainted by bipolar."
That’s about all. I’m not eating more than the bare minimum to keep me functional at work anymore. I will rot and I am okay with that.
"Hi all. I just posted but this is different. I havent been great lately but have been somewhat steady with how ive felt. Earlier i was on tiktok and saw a post that featured a text from someones loved one explaining that something was in the apartment. Then the video revealed the person killed themself an hour later. This turned my stomach and gave me chills and made me extremely upset. I immediately didnt want to be alone, began crying, got extremely paranoid, started thinking irrationally and wanted to do reckless things. It was so sudden.. my boyfriend is stuck at work and I’m just sitting in silence with an awful feeling in my chest and stomach"
I usually take 1 propranolol in the morning after taking my 150mg antidepressant but the propranolol does say twice daily and I never needed a second dose but today I had probably one of the most severe aggressive panic attack and I’m still a bit shaken up I just wanna know if I take a second dose an hour before taking my hydroxyzine will it make my symptoms worse will they cancel each other out? I take hydroxyzine when I’m ready to sleep
"I’mnot doing so great. Haven’t been the past couple years but recently not good at all. Im a 25 yr old female who has probably had 15+ jobs since graduating high school. I didnt go to college. The longest job i kept maybe 1 1/2 years. Mainly leaving for attendance problems. Everytime i go to work no matter where, my chest is heavy and i cant focus or make myself stay long. I just cant do it. And i know everyone is going to say I’m just being lazy but i seriously cant do it. I cant focus, I honestly lack common sense, my family says its a cycle where i get a job, call out, then quit. I cant imagine living and working my whole life. Im not saying i want to just be lazy but I’m miserable. And my family tells me “Life is miserable, everyone hates working” and i get that. But i shouldnt LITERALLY want to die on my way to work rather than go. Its constant. No matter what type of job. No matter what shift, no matter what pay, etc. i honestly cant live my life like this. Im so frustrated and my family is so close to giving up on me. I’m just desperate for even someone to relate in the slightest. My psychiatrist is amazing but she also doesnt understand this."
"Every time when i talk otp just in person, my mind dissociates but idk if it’s dissociating. Like my friends are talking but my mind is somewhere else on focus on something else. Like them speaking is just background noise. Like i hear them but they are like far away. Then i snap back to reality and say “what did u say or did u say something?”. So like what is it?"
"I suffered from a manic episode that lasted approximately 6 months in 2022. I dropped out of school, left home to live in my car, damaged all my relationships with friends and family, got really vulgar on social media, and started reading and paying psychics/tarot readers, and falling for scams. 

Now I’m about 4 months out and struggling to do anything at all. I go to a new school now but I mostly lay in my bed all day and vape. Its like I feel paralyzed and have to build everything from scratch. 

I’m taking Wellbutrin but I’ve only been on it for a few days. I’m miserable."
"I was recently diagnosed with bipolar after dealing with a bad depressive episode and anxiety attack followed by mania when I started Zoloft. I’ve been out of work for several months because of it. I was initially on FMLA, but that ended two weeks ago. 

My bosses are very toxic and difficult to with. In the past years, there’s been had about 60% turnover rate (firings and resignations) in a very small office (less than 10 people). Even though I’ve applied for long term disability, I’m expecting to be fired.

What I’m worried about is how I’ll react mentally. I’ve never been fired before and while this is expected (and wanted), I’m still nervous I’ll dive deeper into depression. I have an amazing therapist and great friends. But I’d love to hear from fellow bipolar folks about how they’ve dealt with this. Any tips or advice you can provide is greatly appreciated. Thanks!"
"For the last year, I've been doing the med dance and trying to figure out what works. 

I've only ever had one manic episode over a year ago,  which ended up with me in hospital. Honestly, I don't even think I was suicidal at the time, I think I was just afraid my wife would leave me. (I had 4 beers, drove the store, had my car impounded - never drunk drove in my life before that).

Anyway, I was thrown on fluoxetine, then lamotragine,  quetiapine, and finally lithium.

My doctor tapered me off fluoxetine which went well, but then I started getting a skin rash, so we stopped the lamotragine. Then I decided to take myself off of quetiapine as it was making me over eat and sluggish, which in turn was making me hate life. I was also massively unmotivated and generally turning into a blob. 

This is all over a 3 month span and ended 2 weeks ago.

So 3 weeks ago I started getting headaches, which my Doc suspected was fluoxetine withdrawl. I didn't start getting then until I started the lithium, so I suggested it could be that but she wasn't convinced. So I stopped lithium 2 weeks ago and still feel fine.

No ups, no downs, no crazy spending. I'm acting more like I used to. Only thing is, I'm still massively unmotivated, eating like I was on the quetiapine, and not entirely sure why.

I'm not depressed, I'm just not entirely happy.

I moved countries 5 years ago and still don't have any real friend group, and don't climb or do anything social which could just be catching up on me now that I've come out of the storm. 

I'll just have to keep checking in with myself and keep an eye out for any mania bubbling up."
"Hi there, I'm female, 26 years old. My depression hit mid-October, after my first manic episode, in which I suddenly couldn't feel any joy, no motivation to do anything, and unable to focus and concentrate on books, tv shows, lectures, and sometimes conversations. I had no desire to socialize or see people, didn't drive, and had a deep miserable feeling of dread all the time. I haven't been to work since September (when the manic episode began). It's now February and I'm still struggling with a lack of motivation to do things, a lack of enjoyment of life, and a miserable feeling that leaves me sobbing my eyes out sometimes. I want to escape from reality all the time and often spend hours reading webcomics on my phone. Although there have been some slight improvements such as my desire to see friends sometimes and my ability to drive short distances alone, I'm still stuck with this debilitating feeling of dragging my feet through life. My parents are very supportive of me during this time and are financially supporting me. I take yoga classes a few times a week and a figure skating class twice a week. On Friday Nights I go to my local Masjid (mosque) to see my friends and play games together. But the rest of the time I drag my feet to do anything else. It's so hard to take a shower and I procrastinate so long before taking one. Even when I do manage to complete things on my to-do list like taking a walk or washing the dishes, I still don't feel any better or accomplished. I'm also faced now with the fact that my psychiatrist no longer wants to sign my off work notes so now I would either have to return to work or quit. And since I definitely don't feel ready to go back I guess I have to quit thanks to my psychiatrist not believing the severity of my symptoms. I've been on 2 or 3 different medications (Lamictal, Wellbutrin, and Lithium) for the depression and so far nothing has worked. I'm in an IOP Program currently and I'm starting individual therapy this week. I said all of this to say, how do you get through this? Is there anyone who has experienced what I'm going through? How did you get out of this pit of depression? I know I have the luxury not to work right now, but did working help you get better or did it make it worse for you?"
"I just don’t know what to do. It’s like my brain is screaming. It’s been 8 years since my first episode and I’m still struggling. I am getting praised at work, I’m exercising, tracking my calories, going to therapy, taking my meds, using my sad lamp and trying so hard but it doesn’t seem like enough. I don’t feel like I can breathe. I cry constantly. I have tried so many meds and ECT and VNS. There’s not much left to try and I don’t feel like I have the energy for it. I put all my spoons on work. My apartment is a mess, I don’t socialize enough. How do you quiet your brain? Night is the worst. I just endlessly scroll. Advice, commiseration welcome."
"I had a ""friend"" that was really shady and used to tell me to my face that I'm ugly and nobody cares about me. So I blocked her on everything. Another reason I did this is because we took pictures together for her snapchat, but she tells me she doesn't have a snapchat. I literally saw it. She always asks me to take videos of me doing dumb things. Am I being paranoid? I would ask somewhere else but I'd get told I'm mentally ill... I have bipolar btw, I'm not just some random posting in a random sub. Does anyone know how to find a snapchat? I can't find it from my phone number."
"Just got my acceptance letter today, it isn't that difficult to get into said college (58% acceptance rate).

It's still a small Victory, though.


I worked hard to recover from a pretty nasty manic episode in 2022.

It took several months, and I was super hopeless, but I did it.

I put in a lot of hard work to be able to achieve this goal, not only the process of enrolling, but *recovering*.

I feel like I've earned the right to toot my own horn a little.

This illness isn't easy to cope with"
"But damn do I not want to have to explain my middle of the night paranoia experience. Every time I think about it sounds even more dumb. 

How do you guys explain paranoia/delusions to your doctors when you're not in that state anymore? Is it easier than I'm thinking it will be? Because I feel like I'm going to sound so fucking stupid. Honestly, I  wish I was just experiencing this stuff while in front of my doctor so she could see for herself and no explanation would be necessary."
"Anyone have a situation where they have been given a BP1 diagnosis by one doc, then a BP2, maybe a BP NOS (I don't know if that still is in the DSM, but it stands for ""Not Otherwise Specified"") or even Cyclothymia?  I have and I am guessing it has been contingent on the situation, my state, what I revealed & who was doing the intake."
"Can someone clear my mind and tell me it actually gets better. Everything is so hard for me. I have never been depressed to the point that I now have trouble brushing my teeth, getting out of bed, eating and more. I am convinced that my body just doesn’t want meds and  they make me feel worst. I want to be normal and I envy people who get to live their lives regularly. I wouldn’t wish this disorder on anybody. My brain is always in a fog. I can’t obtain any information, I forget things I have watched, can’t remember anything but traumatic experiences. And i just think how will I be able to go back to school or hold a job. I feel hopeless and useless. I am ashamed of myself and can’t do anything on my own as an adult. I miss myself before having a manic episode. Life was amazing. I would even say I’d rather deal with mania than be on medications. Every med that I have tried all come with side effects that I cannot cope with. I feel ugly and fat and alone. This disorder is consuming me and filling me with demons. I was so religious and now I do nothing but blame God for creating these illnesses and cursing me. I just wanna die."
"I haven't been sleeping well recently. I still get up early and go to the gym but I have less and less energy every day, and today I'm barely making it by at work. It's like caffeine doesn't have any effect right now. I've had probably 4 cups of coffee, a red bull and a tea and I'm falling asleep standing up. I just started propranolol so I imagine that's a big part of what's going on but I can't function like this. I just want to go to bed. I'm only at work because I feel bad calling in for things like this. But I know I'm going to make mistakes as it is right now. I'm also worried about the long-term effects of this lack of sleep. I'm already dealing with some cognitive slowdown."
"When my symptoms become bad, I start doing what I can only describe as ""tics.""
 
What started as a semi- concious attempt to quiet my thoughts has become random muttering (and occasional shouting) of words that are tiny fragments of racing thoughts. Sometimes I grunt, hum, growl or shake my head as an attempt to push them away. 
It's become more difficult to hide since my life has become more stressful. 

Am I the only one dealing with this? If you get them, are they similar to mine?"
Does you brain need a certain wiring to be capable of mania? I've been hospitalized for mania in June 2017 and August 2020. I've been un-medicated since May 2021. I've been stable and depression free since March 2021. How can I be stable without medication for years and still qualify as bipolar? I've had my current therapist for 8 months who considers me stable too. Thoughts?
"I've only been taking it for a week. Twice a day 300mg each. I am frankly terrified of it. I also feel differently, as if my obsessive thoughts are quieter or almost not existent. When they do creep, I can easily dismiss them. It feels so weird and abnormal and doesn't seem like there is any way lithium could have worked this fast. I mean, I haven't been doing well. I went to the er, got put into a partial hospitilization program, and up until a few days ago, my depression was achingly bad.  
Now I feel ok. Almost like my brain is in neutral. It just doesn't make sense. Can lithium act this fast, am I crazy, or what I most fear is that the lithium will throw me into a manic episode. I know they say it is for regulating moods, but I have always been weird with drugs. I was prescribed a drug to help me sleep, and instead, it did the exact opposite. 

Anyway, I am just scared and need advice is all."
"My bipolar daughter texted me "" I'm having a break down  and I just wanted to talk to you"".  "" please talk to me i only want a father daughter conversation if you still feel like my father"" We haven't spoken or seen each other in years, as far as I know she isn't treating her disorder in any way.

"It's 1130pm here and I'm not really tired. I'm a little wired from work but definitely not manic or anything. I was just curious when y'all NEED to go to bed to avoid triggering anything.

If I go to bed at like 1 or 2 occasionally as long as I sleep enough I should be okay right?"
"It’s 4:30 am and I haven’t slept, I can’t sleep because I am scared. I’m scared to look into the mirror because I might see my stalker. I think he is hiding somewhere in my room right now. I know this could be a delusion but it feels very real right now. The house is creaking a lot tonight because he is here."
"Pharma company says it's not addictive, then why can't I sleep at all without. I'm having the worst crisis of my life. There's possibility of pharma company discontinuing the production in my country and I'm really hooked on it, I was having bad insomnia tried it and now I can't sleep without. Tried to switch to many drugs none worked other than Zopiclone, it worked for a single night, gave me heart aches then the second night I couldn't sleep. My life is a total misery always thinking about these stuff couldn't find a way out, I would kindly get cancer instead of this, or it's very likely imo that I'll develop heart disease, stroke or cancer because of this. If there is a kind God I beg mercy for all my foolish actions, please let me out of this problem so I can live on (I'm only 25 which is very sad:("
"Or even other controversial stores like Fashionnova, Dollskill, etc. Even on Amazon my past searches have been things like “sexy tight lime green jumpsuit for work”


I have only realized this in hindsight, but this is sooo something I do lmao. And I go right to the “sexy” and “club” categories. The clothes I have bought- ummm, not always appropriate for the time and place lmao."

"Hi, everyone. I've started taking Rexulti after an unmedicated mixed episode. Started with 0.5 mg in the first week, now I'm 5 days in with 1 mg, supposed to increase to 2 mg in two days.

Anyway, my mood took a huge change after the very first day. I don't know if it's a coincidence, because it could've been triggered by an event in my life. First week I felt/seemed hypo. I'm not really sure anymore. I've been pretty agitated for the most part, but feeling pretty good overall.

I haven't read experiences of Rexulti causing hypo/mania, since it's actually used for this very reason.

Has anyone experience something similar with this med? Any thoughts?"
"Hey guys I was diagnosed with bp1 in January 2022 after going manic. I'm just confused with my life right now. I punched my coworker a few months ago and now I have charges being pressed against me, I'm on all these medications with side effects that I didn't ask for, I lost a really good job I had, I don't know where I'm headed right now. I'm working part time 3 days a week making 11 an hour sharing a car with my bf...I don't know...I'm so stressed out and so confused with my life I never thought I'd be here and when I tell people I'm bipolar they all say wow I would've never guessed. So what does bipolar even look like? It's like after i got diagnosed all these symptoms emerged. I wish I never went manic it was terrible. It was brought out by an SSRI I was on...how do I even know if I'm truly bipolar..I know no one can answer that but I can't help but wonder."

I recently listened to “the adult children of emotionally immature parents” and I found it very validating and insightful. Just putting it out there in case anyone is intrigued by the title."
"I emailed a new psychiatrist because I’m unhappy with my current one. He asked what my dx’s are and what meds I’m on. I told him and “I am unable to accept any complex issues at this time! “ was his response.

Best part? His bio on psychology today says he specializes in bipolar and addiction. Apparently just the simple kind ? Lol"

"Hi. I am a 25, about to be 26 y/o female. I was just recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder (don't remember the type or if I was told it) and I have been taking abilify which I feel like kind of is helping. 

Before diagnosis I just thought I had really severe depression and anxiety. Which I do. Since college, I have struggled maintaining full time employment, struggled financially, it all makes so much sense now. I am now finished up with real estate course work and about to test into becoming a realtor. However, I will surely age out of my dads insurance before I will pass the test and establish employment/ new insurance.. 

I have been told by friends that bipolar disorder is a protected disability but what does that mean? I brought it up to my dr and either I was too manic to comprehend what she said or she didn't say anything and told me to figure it out? What do I do? Sign up for Medicaid? I'm honestly not sure what that is or if I qualify for it... Has anyone else struggled with aging out of parents insurance? I feel like such a scab on society like I should just have my own insurance/big girl job by now. 

Sorry for any rambling and incoherent thoughts, my brain feels like mush under so many different stressors..."
"I realized that I was diagnosed diabetic quite recently after I started zyprexa, I’m 18 by the way, and am curious. If I switched to a medication I took in the past, that did not affect my blood sugar (rexulti) would of be possible to reverse my blood sugar"
"Rambling post here, but something I've been thinking of.

I've been dealing with bipolar disorder since I was 16, and I'll be 36 next month. When I look back on everything I've been through with this illness, there are a lot of things I regret or am ashamed of that I did while manic or depressed or mixed. Like from my first suicide attempt, the sound of my mother's panicked voice when she found me and I was barely conscious still haunts me. During a manic episode, I cheated on my now husband and almost lost him forever when he's been the most supportive person in my life. He forgave me and we worked it out, but there are times I still feel so much shame and regret for what I did. When I attempted suicide again, I did it at work and my brother-in-law (who worked with me at the time) drove me to the ER. He almost lost his job because of me.

But the thing is, I feel like I've learned from the mistakes I've made and the choices I regret making because of my bipolar disorder. When I'm manic and hypersexual, I don't go looking for sex outside of my marriage. After my last suicide attempt, my husband and I agreed that he would manage my medication so I don't have access to excess medication to overdose on. We take extra precautions when I have an episode, like staying at my parents house while my husband is at work so I'm not alone all the time, or my husband will drive me to wherever I need to be so I can't threaten to crash my car. I've learned over the last almost twenty years how to not always make the same mistakes over and over that might ruin my life.

Does anyone else feel like they've learned from their past episodes or choices they regret making because of their bipolar disorder?"
I'm currently in a loving serious relationship with my partner and I'm always so scared thst I might relapse sometimes. I'm currently just on abilify and on a small dose of it. And I'm hoping I can get off it in order to help me lose weight. Ever since being on my pills I always gain weight and right now I've been being told from my doctors to lose weight and I also hear from my psychiatrist that I should stay on my pills so the chances of me to not relapse are lower. I'm just not happy with my body physically but mentally I'm doing pretty well although I am negative about my body sometimes. It's a difficult situation and I'm stressed sometimes about it.
"Picked a date to end it. Wrote what passes as a letter. Feeling agitated and depressed, never watched a mixed episode start before. Classes are difficult and I can’t focus. Upped my appointment with pdoc, but the meds won’t kick in fast enough anyways.  Family is coming to visit but I’m going to waste it feeling like shit. Want to go home and get black out drunk. Don’t want to think don’t want to feel, Seroquel failed to knock me out last night.
How can I get through the next couple of weeks?"
"I'm prescribed a lot of meds.

This morning, for the first time ever I accidentally took a double dose of all my morning meds. My brain has been scattered lately and I had forgotten which day it was, which is what caused the double dose.

**No worries, I spoke to the pharmacist and he said I'll be fine. He said I'll feel bad.**

The meds are kicking in and I'm having trouble focusing and my brain feels like I'm not all ""here.""

This suuuuucks.

Have you all gone through this?"
"I was taking Lamotrigine for bipolar disorder, I had a change of thought and suddenly stop taking it. That's where my insomnia kicked in. I had days with no sleep, finally i opened my situation to dad and he took me to the hospital, they gave me a shot of some neuroleptic and sent me home, slep a bit. A lot happened, many meds tried, i finally tried ramelteon and it works however it's both expensive and possibly extinct in future (in my country). I cannot sleepwithout ramelteon, before using it I use to sleep a bit but now no.. I don't want to end up insane and kick the bucket out of sleeplessness. My foolish actions led to this, I know but I was young and accepting the situation was not easy for me. I wanna take another pill (tried seroquel, olanzapine (still taking it), risperidone, atarax, unisom, valdoxan..) and live on but as this goes on I may end up d3@d"
"How many people here work in health care and how do you cope with the stress of it? I used to be a nursing assistant (a very good one at that) but my hospital burned us out. Nothing was ever good enough. I wanted to off myself most days. Until the day I became a patient in my own hospital. Shortly after I was diagnosed bipolar I had a breakdown at work and from my own hospital I was transferred to inpatient pysch for SI. I have been thinking of going back per diem. I’ve been out of health care for over a year. I do miss it. The patients. The caring. The love. But not the stress. I’m worried that if I went back, I’d have a breakdown again. But I’m medicated now much more stable. But even thinking about being back stresses me out. I probably shouldn’t. Anyway just wondering who here works in health care and how do you cope with the stress?"
Does anyone feel like we have lack of common sense to do things?
"No trigger but just sudden random anger growing inside of me. I want to punch something, throw something yell. It hits randomly. One day it got so bad I stabbed my bed.  I feel it physically first. I feel myself tense, heart rate jumps then it floods my mind."
"Day 11 of depression. Reached out to my psychiatrist and she isn’t responding to any of my messages. She’s been worthless for as long as I’ve been with her but I haven’t had the energy to find someone else. I’ve dealt with this for 15 years and the work of finding the right doctor became so exhausting that I just settled. But I finally have an appointment with a psychiatric NP on Thursday. Though I’m weary of going that route as I haven’t had good experiences with NP’s in the past, but they’re the easiest to get into . 

I just don’t fucking understand how someone can choose to be a psychiatrist and then not listen to their patients. Prescribing the wrong meds then refusing to stop them despite multiple suicide attempts. After a brain scan, i was told my meds were more than likely making my condition worse, still refused to stop or change them. It took a psych hospital stay to get me off the antidepressant and low and behold, i stopped exploding. I would much rather have this steady depression than the violent outbursts i had while on the antidepressant. But i know there are other meds that work! I really want to try Vraylar as I’ve heard nothing but good things about it. She refuses. I have received multiple Bipolar 2 diagnosis from different psych hospitals/IOP’s and she refuses to give me a BD diagnoses.  

Dr. K, you are a bag of shit, terrible at your job, and I wouldn’t be surprised if you’ve lost multiple patients to suicide. I hope you get fired soon. If i would have died blood would be on your hands. Grievance form incoming. 

(Will be sending her a “more professional” email informing her I will no longer be working with her, and pointing out why. Just wanted to get some more “unprofessional” feelings out before I do so.)"
30 mg abilify 400 mg lamictal 900 mg lithium
I’ve been taking olanzapine for awhile and I’m starting to lose my motivation to enjoy things but I feel like it’s not too bad. Do you have any tips how to get out of it other than with meds or therapy?
"My depression started at the end of last year. I was having trouble socially, I was also having trouble with not being able to work because of mental illness. Im lonely. With these emotions and a lot more emotions combined, I have become really depressed and suicidal. I’ve also been having trouble sleeping. I get 5-6 hours a night when I usually need 8. Im in college, I’m also having trouble with keeping up with the work, and I’m having trouble with having the motivation to go to class. I am on meds but none of them have worked. I’ve tried seroquel, haldol, buspar, Latuda, abilify, lexapro, Geadon, and Zoloft. Now I’m on Caplyta and Zoloft. I’ve been taking it for a couple of days, and I’m still having trouble sleeping.  My psychiatrist has kept me on Zoloft for a year and it hasn’t done anything to improve my mental health. I also need to find a new psychiatrist, but only a few take Medicaid. 
What do you all do when you’re having trouble sleeping? How did you all that went to college/school after high school pass while struggling?"

"I’ve been taking this business class and the first few weeks have been finding your strengths who you are etc. but I have zero clue as to who I am. 

With my constant episodes and everything I dont know which one is real and what I truly act like without bipolar and it sucks. I don’t like making my whole personality about my disability but I dont see any other way when it comes to defining who I am.

Does anyone else feel the same? How do I find out how i actually act and who I am?"
"So, basically, all antidepressants i have tried have sent me into psychotic mania ( Wellbutrin and sertraline mostly ) tried brintelix and started to feel even more anxious than I already am, couldn't sleep at night, freaked out and stopped taking it. Wellbutrin straights make me KRAZY. But the thing is, without antidepressants I'm mostly depressed all the time. Im on lithium and Seroquel and still rapid cycling moods and having great irritability.

Any one with the same problem? Thoughts?"
"I’m fat and sick of it. Vraylar 3mg has helped my symptoms (rumination, excessive crying, racing thoughts, decreased need for sleep, irritability) for the last 3 years, but I’m wondering how much it’s worth staying on if it’s keeping me obese. Anyone have any success losing weight once they quit it?"
"Omg Im so happy to be home. It was torture. Normally they have two wards, one really strict for at risk patients and one more lax, but the lax one was under construction so it was everyone together. I haven't been around people that sick before and it made my anxiety skyrocket... people screaming for hours, attacking staff, cops coming to restrain them and put them in seclusion.. this was pretty much daily. Other people were just yelling at you or talking to themselves constantly...

I realize being home though my depression isnt gone and I definitly told them what they wanted to hear to get the fuck outa there.

On a side, they changed up like all my friggen meds.. now my main antipsychotic is abilify... anyone have exp with that?"
"Hey guys, I’m 9/10 weeks on quetiapine 200mg twice a day.
Currently tapering off Venlafaxine 187.5mg (one more day of 37.5mg before off completely)

Starting 30mg vyvanse on the 8th feb.

Suspected bipolar type 2

I feel withdrawing from Venlafaxine it has kick started a manic episode.

Will the quetiapine make me more aware?

I’ve felt euphoric, more sociable, drinking more, spending more secretly and openly. Sex drive higher. Which are all great hypomanic. 

Until now to feel more suspicious of people talking about me etc. Started thinking on Saturday night, my friends ex boyfriend (he used to be an top IT guy and he’s quite vindictive) has hacked my phone because my best friend has been saying things that make me feel she has heard my conversations on my feelings. Thankfully I have a friend who reassured me it’s really difficult to do and my best friend assured me that he wasn’t good with phone technology and my friend told me I didn’t have to sell my phone and he said if o was really unsure he could wipe it and not to change my passwords.

Feeling like the dinner ladies are off with me. However I have awareness of this for the first time, could that be the quetiapine? 

I have called my psychiaritrist to speak to her today to see if this is normal for withdrawing from antidepressants and whether cause I’m on quetiapine, it shouldn’t get any worse than it is?

Many thanks,

Kez"
"Hi, making this post because i am wondering if any people with Bipolar have had a similar experience to me.

I am a first year college student currently being treated for depression and cptsd, and currently getting assessed for ADHD and potential autism. there is a family history of severe mental health issues but it's unclear exactly what because my older relatives refuse any help or treatment which is making it super difficult for doctors to treat me. I believe its very possible my mother could have bipolar but it's impossible to know for sure because she refuses all mental health treatment and i am now no contact with her.

Last week i was perscribed mirtazapine by my doctor after trying fluoxetine, sertraline and venlafaxine all with no improvement.

The first week i slept loads however i felt like my depression was cured, i got all my motivation back planned loads of stuff and did loads of work, i also felt restless and irritable and like i was being driven by a motor. however after being on it for a week i am having nightmares again all night and feel incredibly depressed again and i am unable to keep up with all the plans i made in the first week of mirtazapine.

I have heard that antidepressants can trigger manic/hypomanic episodes and i am wondering if this sounds like it could be mania/hypomania or if its similar to the experience any of you guys had on antidepressants. Because i dont know enough about it.

It feels like a very unique reaction to antidepressants and i feel quite alone in this experience 

It could just be I did too much and burnt out but idk

Seeing my doctor on friday for a follow up so i will discuss this with her, but any other insight would be appreciated and would help with the appointment !

not sure if this is the right sub but

Thank you!!"
Last night I couldn't sleep. I finally fell asleep for a few hours this morning before work. I had a wild dream in which I was a prophet of god speaking gospel. Today I am physically and emotionally irritable but am not under the same delusion from my dream. I'm worried this might be the onset of something. Probably not. Probably just need to sleep.
"I didn't sleep from saturday to sunday and had an absolute blast Yesterday at a concert. And got assured that I acted pretty rational and actually focussed when driving etc.

But how would a ""normal"" person function?
Will they just be depressed and scatterbrained?

I'm wondering if non-bipolar people can experience something similar to hypomania and how they feel after short and long periods of no sleep."
"I am a guy, 28 years old. I have a very close friend suffering from BPAD for past 6 years. We have dated and I have been cheated on twice. I forgave her, but she took a step back as she understood that she can't be committed in this state.
I happened to stay at her place last month and she went through a hypomanic episode. I was abused, threatened and my collar was held in rage multiple times. I got super anxious but I never raised my voice. She herself feels very guilty about it but can't help the rage and aggression. 
Her doctor got her on Quetipine 200mg and she has been able to sleep since then. Her therapist has asked her to isolate herself for sometime so that she removes her trigger points and becomes self-dependant.
I have been asked to give her space. But when I move away, I get shouted at for not giving a shit. So we get back in the same cycle. Leaving her by herself puts me under a lot of guilt. I don't know what to do."
"This is really annoying.

Medications - valproate, pristiq, zyprexa, sublocade.

And it's always worse at night."
"I swear they are the only thing allowing me to eat on some very hard days. Obviously I am not saying you should heavily rely on them, but being able to prepare a quick  500-calorie powder shake is allowing me to breath a little."
"I skimmed through some of it at my local bookstore. The author, Bessel van der Kolk, seems to have an interesting perspective on trauma informed care and how psychiatric labels are given to patients who exhibit symptoms that are more specifically related to experiences with trauma. Someone might end up being diagnosed with an illness such as bipolar disorder for the purpose of treatment, even though medication can’t really help with the underlying issues, as it is used primarily to numb the effects.

Curious what you all think, especially if you can relate and trauma has contributed to your own experience with mental illness. Should mental illness be considered to be a response to trauma for some people, and if so, should doctors treat it any differently?

Edit: Thank you all so much for the feedback. It’s really wonderful to have a community to reach out to about topics like this. I should do it more often with all kinds of reading  ~ sometimes it’s nice when we can relate over similar interests rather than focusing so much on the relatability of our diagnoses and difficulties of living with an illness. I appreciate you all."
"The depression is hitting harder now for some reason. I've run through my usual list of depression shows I play in the background - things comfortingly entertaining but not too energy consuming, Bob's Burgers is a good usual;.

"I can feel myself falling into a depressive episode. I wanna fucking cry and scream, I don't want this. I was manic a couple weeks ago and then after being on Geodon I mellowed out and lately I've been ""okay"". Now I'm starting to feel like I'm starting a depressive episode and my episodes get so severe, it's horrible. I don't want to go through it. Medication has managed some of my symptoms but definitely not all of them as I have been diagnosed with other disorders. Medication has never lifted my depression... idk what to do."
"Since being diagnosed with Bipolar, have you been diagnosed with anything else??  Like have any other Psychiatrists or psychologists tried to diagnose you with another mental illness in addition to or instead of Bipolar?  How did that go down?"
"Strangers across the globe coming together to support each other is so heartwarming and beautiful. I have vented on here, shared my anxieties, my failures, my small success stories. It just makes me feel soo supported, like someone's got my back. Just restores my faith in humanity.

"I (F25) have been dating this wonderful woman (F24) for around 6 months. My gf was diagnosed with bd type 1 years ago.

I deeply care about her and I’ve been educating myself about the bipolar disorder and asking her questions whenever she feels up to it.

She hasn’t experienced a manic episode in a while but has been in a depressive episode since December of last year. She has a hard time opening up to people and her depression is high functioning so it hasn’t affected her abilities to do her job much.

Our conversations have changed since then, sometimes we have short conversations and sometimes she doesn’t reply at all in a couple of days. 

I’m worried she has been spending too much time in her apartment alone, I asked her if she wants company but hasn’t reply yet today so in the mean time I’d like to know, during a depressive episode, do you prefer to be left alone or have a love one visit you?"
"I’ve cut so many people off I’m ashamed. And due to my depression or just personality quirks, I’ve been cut off myself. When I look back on the rich friendships I’ve had I have want to cry because it’s no longer… 

How do I continue to live with myself? I feel like life only is going downhill from here."
"I was diagnosed with bp disorder type 1 about three weeks ago, I’ve always had suspicions but now that its “real”, I have been thinking and it pains me to know that my life is an episode. Everything I do revolves around me being too happy or too sad

I can think back to a lot of moments in my life, and realized that it always has been an episode, I wish I didnt know sometimes

I’m afraid what people in the future are going to think of me, the meds have been helping to keep me stabilized but I am feeling really depressed, numb almost

Has anyone else gone through something similar?"
"During mania in particular, have you ever become a completely different person in a short period of time? Suddenly have disinterest in things you were known for being obsessed with? And if so, did you come down and go back to your old self eventually?"
"Hey all. Hope you’re having a good weekend.

Writing because I started Lithium in November and since then, I haven’t had a single creative thought or urge. Every time I think it’s coming, it just fizzles out into nothing. It’s hard because I was working as a professional photographer for the past year and photography was my entire life. At this point, I haven’t picked up my camera in three months.

I went to a meet up for photographers last week and I felt like a fraud. Everyone asked why I haven’t been shooting and said they can’t wait for me to get back into it. I didn’t know how to tell them that I just don’t have the urge, the passion, the ideas…. At all.

I should add, this isn’t the first time this has happened. I’m likely autistic and I do have special interests that come and go over time, especially during depressive episodes. In past lives, I’ve been a writer, a musician, a YouTuber, and more. I go really hard with a hobby and obsess over it fully until I completely burn myself out and can’t do it anymore. I’m wondering if this experience of having and then losing a creative outlet is also common for bipolar people.

What would you do in my shoes? Do I force myself to take photographs? Or do I wait out the depression? Do I find another creative outlet in the interim? Is this likely the lithium, the mood episode, the autism, or all of the above? 

Will I always feel so passionless? I’m hoping that come spring, my mood will even out and I’ll feel creative energy again but maybe that’s wishful thinking.

Any tips? Even just shared experiences would be appreciated."
"Sometimes I am the tire in the rut,

Long hours while the tire keeps spinning in the same spot,

Food becomes repulsive and sleep interrupted,

Like a light of my mind has been dulled,

Just going through the motions,

And I’m exhausted,

Hesitation, as I hate being that burden,

Nothing stellar when you’re the crater for others to dig into,

No autonomy or ownership,

Just simply exhausted,

And I’ve had enough,

Not wanting to be others submissive target to get their rise from."
"a thing i regognize when i am manic i give a shit what i eat, i try to eat plantbased but when i am manic I dont give a shit what i eat and then i eat much too. it is really wierd."
"Switched from an antipsychotic to Lamictal on Monday. I’m on 25 mg and in another week supposed to go up to 50 mg. I was already prescribed Trazodone 50 mg. I usually only take one but the last few nights I’ve been taking two because I keep waking up in the middle of the night and not be able to fall back to sleep for one to two hours. Even though I’m taking two now, I’m still waking up. I’m thinking about talking to my doctor to increasing my Trazodone even more. Is there any way to combat this? I really want to stay on it. No side effects other than this and I’ve noticed I’ve lost a couple pounds since stopping the antipsychotic."
"Guess what? We made it through North America's darkest time of the year! The sun is staying out longer and we will slowly start being less depressed.

"I’ve been sick for the last three days, throwing up and not able to keep anything down. I’m still taking my meds (lamotrigine and buspar) im able to keep everything down for about two hours after taking it each day, and then I throw up. 

I’ve been feeling more anxious/depressed these last few days and I’m not sure if it’s because I’ve been sick or because my meds haven’t been working because I’ve been throwing them up. 

I took my meds around 330pm today but I’m feeling sick again. Should I take half of my dosage afterwards to be safe since I’ve been getting sick for three days now? I’m getting nervous that it hasn’t been entering my bloodstream enough/in time. 

Idk. Anyway, I’m gonna go throw up now."
"hey! I just started taking Invega (paliperidone) a couple days ago at night before bed (3mg). It’s okay so far and I know being tired and drowsy is a part of getting used to the meds and adjusting. It’s just like when I wake up it is so hard to wake up and get up because I’m legit just so goddamn tired. I like how I’m actually getting sleep, but it just takes a long time to wake up and get going. any advice or does it just go away within the next couple weeks? I do have adhd too so I take adderall usually but for the month they wanted to focus on BD for rn before we start the adderall again. help hahah"
"Nothing, absolute nothing

and I feel amazing."
"Sometimes, due to whatever reason, I end up missing a dose; I end up feeling a bit different and more “jittery”. It’s temporary until I take my next dose. Not an actual episode obviously just a different feeling.

Does this happen to anyone else or is it just my ‘mind playing tricks on me’? 

     (I take Lamictal and Olanzapine every night, Bipolar 1)"
Married 8 years and been together since high school. She kicked me out 10 days ago. I'm having panic attack after panic attack every day. I'm prescribed ativan but don't have enough to take multiple times a day. I'm also on lamictal and latuda but I suspect the latuda is making my anxiety worse. I have a doctor’s appointment tomorrow. Any advice?
"So about a year ago, when the lockdown ended and I had to go back to school, I went through a completely reckless period that would bounce between me doing dangerous things or thinking about doing dangerous things to crying for no reason and wanting to kill myself because of any little criticism. Then it went to me being pretty quiet for a few months until the past couple months where I’d get depressed and then be ok. Then the last few weeks, the depression was so bad that I’ve been paranoid that everyone hates me and is just pretending to like me. I also felt completely numb and was very close to offing myself. But now I’m great and I want to do all these things and be productive and actually have energy. I’ve also been working over 10 hours a day half the time and I go to school. But I’m worried that this whole situation isn’t normal. I’m 17, and I want to get tested for any underlying issues, but my mom won’t let me. Thoughts?"
"Hey guys, i want to tape quetiapine because i take for a month and im day by day worse by that i mean im permanent restlessness during the day and im groggy too, it s hell, my doc is with the head in air and is not ok, how can i tape safely? Right now i take 50mg for sleep at night"
"I’m on vraylar and depakote and it has been working really well for 2 years. I was also on lithium which I tapered off of a couple months ago. But for weeks now I’m feeling wired. I’m like grinding my jaw even during the day. I feel a little amped up but I’m still sleeping a lot. I definitely don’t feel manic. I can’t tell if this is worth contacting my psych, probably? I just don’t want to mess with my meds right now. Anyone else felt this way?"
"I have been getting extremely irritated by the smallest things. Is this a normal symptom for you guys? I was diagnosed with Bipolar 1 a little over a year ago. I stopped smoking weed and drinking and I realized how much those things helped with calming the irrational anger. I feel like I’m going crazy which makes me feel even more angry. 
I was hospitalized due to this exact thing, I blacked out after getting in a argument and I came back home to my house completely wrecked. I don’t want to do that again."
Anyone else? My doc said that to me
"I think I may have bipolar disorder and I didn't truly realize I had it until a couple summers ago and this past summer. I'm hopefully gonna have a psych evaluation soon. My mom has bipolar ll and I've experienced a lot of trauma, so there's a very good chance I have it. 

I think summer of 2020 was the first real hypomanic episode I had. I lost my virginity to this guy I had went to high school with and he sold me extacy and we smoked and I ended up having sex with him. I remember mentioning a condom, but my purse was in the living room and I guess he just didn't wanna take the time to get it and just entered me without my consent. I went with it tho, as I was very high and it felt good for a boy to be so into me. (I was severely bullied about being chubby, so I have a lot of insecurities). I ended up having sex with him again that night and took plan b the next morning, even tho he pulled out. I was aware enough that I needed to make sure I didn't get pregnant, thankfully. He ended up ghosting me. 

August 2020, I met a guy on tinder. I didn't personally know him, but I knew of him as he was only about 3 years older, my cousin went to high school with him, he seemed chill. I went to his house a couple times. We fooled around a bit. (He fingered me and I gave him a handjob) One night after that, about a week later, (he only ever invited me over in the night time. I should've known better) I went to his house and we smoked some weed. He ended up pulling out a bottle of vodka and offered it to me. We drank it together, but I got way more drunk than him, as I'm 5'4 and he's a big, stocky 6'2 guy. I remember kissing him, but it goes black and then I remember it in flashes. Him on top of me, heavy. He was extremely big, I wouldn't have let him if I had been able to resist. My cervix hurt so bad and I told him it hurt and he just kept going. I woke up later and had to pee. It was painful and when I wiped there was blood. I said goodbye to him and just left. I texted him later to ask him if he had used a condom, he said he did the FIRST time. I don't remember a second time. At all. I wasn't conscious. I didn't realize what happened to me was rape until I told my friend at the time how it went down and she was concerned and gently told me that it sounded like sexual assault. I ended up blocking him on all socials and I haven't spoken to him since. Now that I'm clear headed, I feel so violated. I hate myself for putting myself in that situation, but that whole summer I was doing stuff I wouldn't normally. I tried acid, extacy, shrooms, almost tried cocaine. I was definitely not myself. 

Now last summer, my air conditioning was out and I think it got so hot, that I kind of went manic, or at least hypomanic, as I was still able to work and perform tasks. I didn't feel euphoric though, I felt like crawling out of my skin. I ended up posting nudes of myself on a different account on here, SEVERAL times a day. I talked to men I would NEVER talk to normally. Perverted men. One man was 61. 

Yeah, I know, fucking gross. 

I watched porn constantly, masturbated several times a day to the point of injury. I was anxious and my thoughts were constantly racing. I didn't sleep much and I was very irritable and snapped at my mom a lot. Now, after slowly coming down and entering my depression, I feel so ashamed of myself and my behavior. The kinks I got into that I would never want in my right mind, letting men treat me like an object, like that's my only worth. 

I truly feel like I have bipolar disorder and so does my mom. Hopefully, I can find out soon what's wrong with me and get myself help. Thanks for reading, I'm sorry it's so long, I just needed to rant. :)"
"I’m up and down every week!

Every since September of 2022, I’ve had constant ups and downs. One week I’m great and motivated to do life and the next week I’m depressed and hate the world. I stopped my vraylar for a month and went into a terrible depressive (borderline suicidal) episode. That felt awful. So, I got back on my meds and once I got sick of the months of insomnia I went to my psychiatrist and got prescribed Wellbutrin, (1/18/23). First week on it I was very depressed, afterwards I was feeling fine and now I’m back to down. Yesterday I had a crying spell bc I whole heartedly believed everyone around me was making fun of me or judging me. I know bipolar comes with up and downs but every month/week seems a little much and honestly draining. I haven’t had a manic episode, thankfully, in over a year but the depression and anxiety is very much still present. Any insight on this topic or advice would be great. For reference, I am 18 and was diagnosed at 15."
"I don't really believe in astrology but some people do and though it might be interesting.

Don't forget to take your meds and stay hydrated."
"I'm wondering: what's it like being newly in love or seriously crushing on somebody while hypomanic to you?

ETA: I'm asking because I myself have had very obsessive crushes which I know think could maybe be because of undiagnosed bipolar disorder, cause I was experiencing hypomanic symptoms during the first few months of all of those obsessive crushes since I was 16."
"Hey!

So I was taking Latuda 60 mg and was sleeping around 10 hours a night and it was messing with my work schedule. Today I made the horrible mistake of taking it in the morning thinking that it would be better than at night but I had to battle sleep by drinking coffee. So, I went to the doctor and they lowered my dose to 40 mg. The pharmacist says to wait till Sunday night to take it because I already took the 60 mg today. Does lowering the dose reduce the amount of time you sleep with Latuda?

Thanks!"
I feel like such a bad excuse for a person and that I'll never get my shit together. I don't feel like I matter and everyone would be fine if I didn't exist
"So what do y'all listen to when manic? I'm trying to self care atm and I'm listening to mlp, adventure time,and songs to induce happy ness and staying sane. What songs remind you of your bipolar rage,happy ness and intense emotions? Music suggestions? Atm I'm listening to lil dark age ""just know that if you hide it does go away"" I'm getting therapy and meds soon I'm trying to get better so I don't get hospitalized a second time. I have a few days off work. I had something traumatic happen I was s/a and it triggered mania in me along with sleep deprivation and other things. I feel like I'm in a state of hangover kinda? I'm aware and it's like oh shit the black out wave is gonna come if I don't sleep and self care. So I've been trying to get better. I feel impulsive, instense emotions, easily irritable and like I have a desire to get better cause I love my loved ones and I have to keep going and live healthy. I don't wanna be like a alcoholic bipolar I know. I'm 21 afab and there also afab but early 30s. I just got diagnosed in 01/01/22ish. So yuhhhh music would help"
"I am very curious about this because I have only had mania 2 times and it has been due to antidepressants and once with a pain narcotic for migraine (I felt a bit hypomania but I suspended immediately). The constant that I have is seasonal depression in winter and anxiety-insomnia in summer but it doesn't even reach hypomania. Maybe it’s more hyperfocus-alert due my adhd.

*TW drugs*

I used several drugs (also psychedelics) long time ago when I was young and they didn’t cause me mania or psychosis and currently I have 7-6 years that I don’t consume any drugs. 

* PLEASE don’t take my experience as a reason to use drugs, every body is different. also I used it before knowing the diagnosis.

I’m very intrigued about this topic. I am not denying the diagnosis because I know that only one mania is enough, but I guess it would be good if there was more information for us bipolar people with only antidepressant-induced mania.

If you know something relevant about this, I would like to know your thoughts.

Thanks !

**Edit: For future documentation of this topic and if you want to continue investigating about it, an user on the comments found this article from 2020**

**[Antidepressant-Associated Hypomania: Navigating Clinical Challenges](https://www.psychiatryadvisor.com/home/depression-advisor/antidepressant-associated-hypomania-navigating-clinical-challenges/)**

Here’s the introduction: 

“Antidepressants ‘have the propensity to destabilize mood, precipitating both hypomanic and manic episodes’—**a phenomenon called antidepressant associated hypomania (AAH).** Although this condition is most frequently associated with bipolar depression, it has also been reported in unipolar depression and in non-affective conditions, such as anxiety disorders. The potential for AAH has made antidepressant use controversial in patients with bipolar disorder (BP).”"
How do you all deal with hyperfixations/obsessive thinking? I don't get it as much after finding meds that work for me but I am on a lower dose rn because I'm pregnant and I'm finding that I'm having repeating thoughts/ideas I can't get out if my head.
"Im only doing this for people who don't seem to care 

I don't want to tell them because I'd feel manipulative

But at the end of the day if it was my choice I wouldn't be here"
I feel like I'm always putting on a brave face for the people in my life. In the past when I wasn't doing so great people have closely monitored me and now I live in paranoia. I'm so afraid of that happening again that I pretend like everything is perfect even when it's not. I don't know how much of what I'm doing is for other people. And I'm scared I wouldn't be able to stay stable if I wasn't motivated by fear. I hate living this way.
"Does anyone else feel like describing getting stoned on weed as getting “high” is incredibly inaccurate? 
What I mean is this: I feel high when I’m hypomanic or manic, which is also when I don’t feel grounded at all. Weed feels very grounding, like it takes you closer to earth; which is why getting stoned makes sense, but not getting high."
I'm just starting out (switching from seroquel) but my meal times are sooo random. The pharmacist said peanut butter on a slice of bread would do. What's a quick and easy 350 cal snack/food you eat with yours? Any other advice about starting this stuff would be great too. Thanks in advance!
How to escape?
"Backstory: I was diagnosed Bipolar 1 at 15. I had my first depressive episode at 10 years old and started Prozac at 11 but was having manic and mixed episodes by 14. I ended up going to a therapeutic high school and spent over a year in a PHP program prior to transferring there. 

I’ve been in therapy continuously since I was 10 years old. I was hospitalized once at 16 after dissociating to the point that I became unresponsive and couldn’t swallow water even to take an Ativan, and twice more in college related to suicide. The dissociation would make me separate from my body where all I could do was scream while my mom and brother would hold me. The time I got taken to the hospital I was just unresponsive staring at a wall laughing “inappropriately”. 

In college I ended up doing 20 shock treatments and it was a rollercoaster but by the end I found a good medication cocktail and graduated with 3 majors and went on to law school. Law school was rough but I graduated that too, went on to pass the bar, and am now a 4th year attorney. 

I’m 29 now and have a great life. I take 13 pills per day every day, go to therapy once a week, psychiatrist once a month, massage 1-2 times per month, sleep 7-8 hours per night, meditate regularly, and exercise vigorously 5-6 days per week. 

I have a happy marriage, two kids (twin boys), I own my own home, have two nice cars, and have a great career as an attorney that puts me in the top 3% of earners for my age. I’m doing two half marathons this year and hopefully a marathon. 

I have bipolar 1 disorder. It sucks. My moods trend toward mania and hypomania nowadays. It’s been a few years since I had depression. My meds change from time to time to address the swings and work well. But I handle myself better than the vast majority of people with or without manic depression. My coping skills are top notch. No one but my close friends and family know about my illness. 

I spent many years learning how to be mentally ill and the past decade learning how to be normal without pathologizing myself. It’s a constant battle, I’ll always be this way, but finding the right meds, internalizing the skills I learned in therapy, finding the right coping skills, and living a healthy lifestyle makes a huge difference."

"Basically what my title says, but for context. I'm newly diagnosed, and now slowly seeing where I had shown signs of bipolar in the past. 

Anyways I had a hallucination of a bunch if spiders crawling out from a corner in my room. And I've been depressed as ever the last few weeks now, is this normal? 

I also am just realizing I've been seeing shadow people, like at work mostly. I'm new to the whole hallucinations thing."
"Idk if anyone has read it, but there’s a biography by a psychologist, Kay Redfield Jamison, who studied mood disorders and bd and also experienced it too, called “ an unquiet mind”. That literally saved my life. It provided me with a deeper sense of understanding and inspiration that the shit we deal with—there’s a future. I’m deadass, I fucking hated reading. But this book has made me feel the most understood I have to say it is beautifully written yet also affirmed with its research. It provides a perspective from the healer and the healed."
"I know we often get the question of how many medications do we all take, but I am curious about how many of each type we take.  So, if you are comfortable sharing, how many of these are you prescribed and take on a regular basis?

* Lithium:
* Anti-convulsants:
* Anti-psychotics: 
* Antidepressants:
* Benzodiazepines:
- Stimulants:
* Other:"
"i ran out of my lithium for like five days last week and it completely messed me up and now my depression is back again and i cant fall asleep but i feel so tired and slow and really suicidal, idk what happened tho cause i got them back and ive been taking them, and usually they kick in pretty quickly. i take antidepressants as well but they dont work as well for my depression than my lithium does so i think i should up my lithium? i just feel weird texting my psychiatrist at 2 am  

i mean she allows it shes like ""you can text me anytime"" but still ive never done it before lmfao

also cause i rlly want to be on as little meds as possible, i already have health anxiety and it gets worse the more meds or higher doses im on"
"so basically to keep it short, I really needed my friends and they really just didn’t respond or ignored me and then a couple days later text a random message of their day…like am I a jerk for not wanting to respond? Like not ending anything and plan on keeping the friendship but 1. Wanted to give space but 2. It’s like bro I was at my lowest point and I needed you and didn’t bother with it. If they didn’t have the capacity, them communicating that would have been understandable. And the one I’m talking about like was talking to me a couple weeks back about how her job was super chill and she is just chilling. So not like she’s extremely busy. I get it people have stuff going on, but Like is it okay to just kind of give it a few more days to kind of just even it out? Not necessarily out of spite but like also just like kind of show like I’m lowkey just disappointed and am tired of that? And Ik someone is gonna say, why don’t you talk to them abt and be honest——it’s not worth the confrontation, I dont want trouble ya feel. I just like wanna know is this justifiable to feel this way?"
"This is my first week on it and I feel so out of it. I feel like I’m not in real life, like I’m in a movie. Did it do that for anyone else when they first started it?"
"I have bipolar disorder and ADHD, and a few extra problems. I've been with my boyfriend for 3 years, shortly after I was getting help. I was upfront about having bipolar disorder since our first blind date. Shocking he stuck around. He's been really supportive and understanding as best as he can considering he doesn't really understand what bipolar disorder is like for me, but he really tries. 

He likes a really clean house, and I do too. I feel into a ""normal"" depression (meaning not super bipolar depression) and kinda gave up keeping the house clean because I had no energy left. So I just couldn't keep up with the house work. It actually took a toll on our relationship for a while, because he was getting frustrated. Finally I admitted that I was still depressed, even though I stopped taking my antidepressant because I just didn't want to take it anymore. 

Once I snapped out of my depression, I got into my ""cleaning away the depression"" mode. Finally our relationship was getting better he was so much less stressed out coming home from an already stressful job, and was happy again. I'm good at cleaning. I cam spend all day cleaning the laundry and putting it away and making the bed and clean the bathroom. But my ADHD doesn't see the dirty dishes and the messy livingroom. He has a hard time communicating what's upsetting him. 

Our relationship was getting so much better and I didn't want to lose it. I finally came up with an idea to help him communicate with me and give me a way to prioritize what needs to be cleaned. He has a giant white board full of his to do list. I like making to-list, mine are really just step by step instructions on what to do so I feel more accomplished. I thought of this great idea. I clipped my to-do note pad to his white board with a pen and a dry erase marker, and wrote underneath it ""baby this is upsetting me. I need you to"" and then number 1 and 2. And told him from now on I need him to write one or two things on the white that he needs me to do, but only 2 because I don't want to get overwhelmed with too much stuff. 

It's really started helping alot. The white board is actually right outside our bedroom so it's the first thing I see in the morning, and I'm able to see what he needs from me. No more confrontation and fights and constant reminders that I inevitably forget about because I got distracted. It's really helped his ability to communicate with me and for me to prioritize and know what the problem is. 

Success in baby steps!!"
"I know that hypo is lesser than standard mania, but even when I'm not in the middle of an episode I'm yearning for one. When going through my diagnosis, I hit every marker for experiencing mania except for the ""risky decisions"" part. Yeah I'll make impulsive decisions, but they're ones I'm always grateful for when I look back. I worked up the courage to message a long time friend, to ask if they want to collaborate on art or play a game, to go to the zoo, suddenly decide I'm gonna cook a proper meal for dinner, etc. I also have ADHD and have found that hypomania is the only thing other than crushing deadline pressures that motivates me, and it's a pleasant force vs the anxious pressure one. I think back to how much music and art I made when it was very frequent in my early 20's and look back longingly as I near my 30's with a creative draught hanging overhead. A small part of me hopes that my psych and I can land on a med combo that helps with the lows but lets me still get some of the hypomania, but I'll take anything if it helps with the constant anxiety I have."
Having to find a job that is compatible with my sleep cycles. The moods. The anxiety. I really struggle knowing when does it stop being such a bumpy ride?
"So I live in a cold .ill be starting meds soon . Long story short I was S/A by a friend who got me drunk and they both partner sa me. So. What advice would y'all give to me? I just saw my Dr. He says I'm going thru a manic episode cause I'm resistant to melatonin and cold syrup to sleep and I'm getting insomnia but I so bad ly want rest. It gets noises at night sometimes and also. Myania was triggered by hormone contraceptives, stress,another unmedicated bipolar, matience coming in and out my home for construction. I don't wanna say too much and be identified by others. But yeah I feel anxious and jumpy what can I do to do better and induce sleep?any guidance could help I'm taking a few days off work for sick days/ I'm not on the schedule till the 7th? It's weird. I need money but I also don't wanna blow up. That and I feel forgetful. I want to sleep. I wish I wasn't s/a. I wish the neighbors weren't noisey so I could sleep."
"The album ""Baby take my acid"" by Lincon and Penelope Scott. It only has 2 songs on it but thats all I need to feel how bipolar it sounds to me.

""Baby take my acid"" is a happier sounding song but the lyrics are filled with self struggle and self loathing, admist the happy tones. I think these two verses feel so at home. ""If your not doing anything can you still call it trying to get better?""   ""And every explanation to myself of any glimers of hope start sounding suspiciously like every other lie I've ever told."" 

""Everything is wrong"" is the second song on the album and really encapsulates for me what stagnant depression feels like. Like its always there. And while the lyrics express everything that is wrong, I can related to naming off things in my life that are wrong.


Im a big Penelope Scott fan. Ive listened to all her music and the unreleased ones too. Shes my favorite artist. Howver shes more of a small note in the songs. Lincon takes the show here. It might be byus but yeah."
"i am now 3 weeks into lithium and adderall, which like... major props, i am not allergic to either of them, so i'm pleased about that. so i now know of 3 psych meds i can take that i am not allergic to. but allergies aren't everything, and now i'm hitting the fucking wall.

obviously we all understand the concept of depressive crashes after mania, so there's a percent chance that i'm having a bad reaction to the lithium and a percent chance that i'm just swinging into depression because i'm swinging down from my months long hypomanic state. in either case, this is a massive fucking problem.

i am not experienced in dealing with depression. i have had mixed episodes from time to time, but never depression. i've always been in some way elevated. and thus we end up with the issue.

every time i reach a certain point in medication, i start to become increasingly suicidal. i'm currently at the point where i will still have positive moments here or there, because i'm only about 3 weeks in, it seems after a month is when i start to get really bad. eventually i may reach a point where all i will be able to think about is ending it all, like my new favorite hobby just becomes suicidal ideation.

i am... cautiously hoping the adderall will keep me from falling into that pit, but it mostly just seems that now i am emotionally destroyed but able to make myself do things despite that. i'm not any happier, i'm still just as suicidal, but now i have a little ""oomph"" to let myself keep up with my daily tasks. i figured maybe being able to function would make me not feel as sad.

now i just feel very quizzically depressed as i cry and do my necessary tasks anyway. i am still starting to think multiple times a day about killing myself. whenever anything goes wrong, that gets amplified, but i can just be minding my business and suddenly realize that it would be far, far better if i were fucking dead already. i'm trying to figure out if there's anything i can do to sideline this issue before it gets to the horrible state that i expect it's heading towards again.

i still have some mild hope that this is the worst it'll get, that the adderall will somehow keep me from falling into the same black pit that lithium put me in the last time i tried it. but it also makes me wonder, how the FUCK does anyone survive getting medicated down from a manic episode?

if in theory, you're ""supposed"" to be depressed post-hypo/mania, how the fuck does anyone make it out the other side to stable? i want to be able to stay on meds long enough to see if i even \*can\* stabilize, but i get to the point of ""i can't be alone in a room with myself"" \*far\* before i get to anything resembling even mild stability. basically the best i seem able to do is stop meds, wait for everything to go back to how it was, then resume meds and have a brief window of like 2ish weeks where i'm both functional and non-suicidal.

then the suicide kicks in, gets increasingly more all-consuming, and i eventually have the choice to quit my meds or risk that i'll kill myself.

i mean, everyone can't fucking have to be hospitalized for months while they stabilize, can they? i can't fathom anything keeping me from killing myself once i get to that point \*except\* for being hospitalized and physically or chemically restrained. it gets so bad that i start planning, something i have \*never\* done when not medicated, and then i just... quit the meds at some point when i realize what's going on. because i'm naturally hypomanic, this has so far never ended in me becoming more depressed, i just swing right back up and within 1-2 days the suicidality is fully gone and i'm ok with being alive again.

which of course saves me in the fucking moment but makes it prohibitively difficult to get medicated if i cannot even reach stable without first passing through ""so violently suicidal that i know exactly where and when i'd like to do it."" is this just what happens to anyone who starts medication from an elevated state??

obviously i'm like, trying to fucking resolve this shit, but i've got no idea how to get past the suicidal stage. has anyone figured out how to skip the violently suicidal stage when you first start meds? would it be worth asking my psych to try antidepressants concurrently with starting the lithium, like we decided to attempt with the adderall? or is the suicidal stage just gonna happen no matter what, and people usually get hospitalized? i cannot be hospitalized, i am too physically disabled to find another job if i lost my current one. so i have to figure out how the hell to resolve this outpatient.

which is i guess what i'm trying to do. figure out if i can resolve this before it gets to the point where i'm afraid of myself. because right now i'm not in crisis, but i am NOT having a good fucking time.

what the hell am i supposed to do about this??"
"I’ve noticed a lot of people say they crash into depression after a manic episode, but does anyone experience the opposite?  In my only full manic episode I was crushingly depressed first, then flipped to mania practically overnight.  It took months to fully come down from the lingering manic symptoms, but I didn’t become depressed immediately afterwards like I’ve seen mentioned here."
"Ive been on medication since kindergarten. It wasnt for bipolar but for adhd. I was diagnosed at 11. Since then I have been on so many medications I feel like i might be immune or something. Ill be steady on medications for a while and then as soon as I go off of them for a day, Im instantly manic. As if the whole time my medications are a placebo. I know it sounds more of a manic thought, but when I ask people I knew or know, they all say the same thing."
"The person I decided to have kids w is the worst choice ever. No matter what I do I will always have to deal w him, I’m so tired I can’t even explain. He does nothing but blame everything on me, we are divorced and it still doesn’t help. I can’t support my kids alone, he does instacart for a living, I can’t have my kids full time bc I don’t have a home for them and he does bc he lives w mommy and daddy. Can I please be relieved of my place here on earth  I work at an oral surgeon office and I still don’t make enough to pay rent. My credit is shot between him and my own bipolar escapades. I came from a dark child hood and I just want it all to stop. I’m turning 40 3/6 and I just don’t wanna live anymore"
"I took a break from weed cause we're tight on money and my tolerance was accelerating;

But my wife comes home and starts downing alcohol, cause she ""feels guilty for taking too much of her prescription today"" so my mind convinces me I should also be mildly medicated; It was the excuse I was waiting for. Her fault haha.

She gets clingy sometimes, especially when I'm manic, and didn't want me to go out to the weed store, with a handful of reasons why.

""i'll give you the good manic D later tonight"" (you know what i'm talkin about...) had me on my way, and now i have a bag of Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps in a rundown rental in Anchorage.

How did I end up with 4 kids watching moose eat the shrubs through the living room window. i guess it's normal here. They have a lot of kids cause there's nothing else to do!"
"I'm diagnosed as bipolar for about three years and my meds do work - but I think it would be helpful for me to have some kind of talk therapy or counselling also as my mood can often be influenced by outside stressors. If I ask the psychiatrist they will just tell me to ask my GP for counselling and honestly that is not his personal strength. So if I'm looking to self refer, is there a particular kind of counselling I should be looking for? Anything that is helpful to you particularly?
Thanks"
"The past few days my sleep has been particularly bad. One night I woke up and it sounded like something fell to the floor in my apartment. Couldn't find what it was. Happened again last night. Still saw nothing that appeared to have fallen from anywhere. Stuff all where it was supposed to be.

But also... last night I just started to lose my shit a little. Out of nowhere, I seemed to have forgotten I have a smoke detector on my ceiling. The light from it was FREAKING me out. And I couldn't think of where it could possibly be coming from.

Then someone must have pulled into a driveway behind my place, like they always do, except this time when I saw the light move across my ceiling I was pretty sure it was something related to the other light it was like... idk, in my apartment with me, but somewhere I couldn't see. And the car light looked like it turned red. I don't know if that actually happened or I was imagining it, but both light sources appeared to be flickering really fast so it was honestly a little trippy feeling for a moment.

I was wide awake, so this wasn't a dream or that state of being in the middle of falling asleep. I was wide awake and gripping my blanket up close to my chin and telling myself that if I closed my eyes long and kept them closed, nothing would happen to me. 

Why the hell is this happening? If it was psychosis related to my BD, wouldn't shit like that happen during the day and not just at night?

The only issue I've ever had during the day was feeling disconnected from everything around me, and that it was all fake and I was alone in the universe, maybe in a psych ward somewhere and my life is just one long drug trip... etc. This felt much different. And I was terrified. 

If you read this far, thank you! I know that was a lot."
"Living with bipolar is like walking on a tight rope 
Squeezing every muscle in your body and praying you don’t fall
To the left you have a cold, bottomless pit of depression. You know if you fall that way, you’ll be crumpled at the bottom of the pit, crushed by your own sadness until it feels like it might kill you. 
To the right you have fiery mania, and the warmth is tempting for a minute. But you know if you fall that way, you’ll succumb to the fire and burn up until there’s nothing left. 

Living with bipolar is not being able to trust your brain. 
It’s wondering if every feeling means something more. 
It’s watching your own every move to look for signs of a switch, terrified that if one comes on, it could overpower you before you even notice. 
It’s looking in the mirror and seeing a stranger. 

It’s forgetting the worst things you’ve done until the moments you are crying on the bathroom floor and every mistake comes back to you like a tsunami of all the things things this disease had made you do. What it’s taken from you. What it’s taken from the people who love you. 
It’s knowing those things will never come back. 

It’s hating yourself and feeling sorry for yourself at the same time. 
It’s being so overwhelmed with your emotions you feel nauseous. 

It’s crying spells, and uncontrollable fury, and the biggest belly laughs you’ve ever had (where no one else gets the joke). 
It’s realizing that the people around you can support you and love you, but they will never understand you. 
It’s knowing that you’ll hurt them, over and over again. 
It’s wondering if everyone you’ve ever met would be better off not knowing you. 

It’s your darkest secret and your biggest weakness.
It’s knowing you’re wearing a bomb vest at all times, and praying in every moment that it doesn’t go off without warning. 

It’s lonely and terrifying. It will take, and take, and take and never give you everything back. 
It will make you fatter, slower, weaker and dumber. It will take everything that used to make you special and light it on fire, leaving a ghost of who you used to be. 

It’s pills every morning and every night. Pink pills and white pills and blue pills and yellow pills. You swallow them every day and wish they would fix you, but they only keep the dark parts of you hidden, sometimes for a little while. It’s leaving the drugstore with 4 orange bottles after the cashier stares at you and clearly wonders how someone so young could be so fucked up. 

It’s knowing that you’ll always have this darkness inside you, and even when it gets better, you’ll spend every day terrified of yourself. 

It’s knowing that you are a cancer. Your presence makes everyone else worse off, and worried. It’s knowing that just by being in someone’s life you sign them up for dealing with your symptoms, whether they know it or not. 

It’s wondering how anyone could ever love you. It’s worrying every day that people will get fed up with your problems and decide to leave. It’s knowing that you are “too much.” 

It’s knowing that it never ends, until it all ends."
"Hey. I'm wondering what's your experience with Lamotrigine regarding Lamotrygine. I was diagnosed bipolar in July after I made some crazy shit during hypomaniac episode. Before I was treaded for depression (Vortioxetine 20mg) and anxieaty (pregabaline 150mg). I had long history of unstable behavior and switching from being super active to very depressed, but reached for psychiatrist hepl during episode of depression so it was first diagnosis.

I have started Lamotrigine with 25mg, increased dose by 25mg every two weeks untill 200mg. It was fine for some time. Effects wasn't super strong but I felt better, more stable I would say. There where some short depression episodes back then, but wasn't so strong as before.

It was fine until I started to take around 125mg/150mg. Then episodes of irritation and anger started to happen (few days up to one  week every month). Little things, which  wouldn't cause such reactions before, started to trigger anger. During bipolar episodes I was usually self harming  (substance abuse,  etc.) or hypersexual and irresponsible during maniac. Never irritaed/angry because of minor stuff. Right now I feel urge to destroy things if I canot find some item or easly getting angry with people if they disagree with me, which I try to suppress by isolating myself.

Another thing is I started to feel like my brain is not as active as it was before. I'm rather intelligent person, quick thinker, usally able to make rapid decisions and corelate various facts. Right now I tend to forget words, events and easly loosing focus (even during watching movies, reading). I'm not native English speaker and had bery hard time to write this post, but it happens even with my native language. However, not sure if it could be caused by lamotrigine or e.g. extensive pregabaline use.

On top of that my libido dropped to zero, which I consider sometimes to be good after my hpersexuality caused me a lot of troubles. But there are times when it's problematic, as I'm in relationship right now and feel disgusted by idea of sex with other human beeing. My sex activity right now is occassional masturbation.

I'm pretty confused right now. I will definietly request lowering dose at my next appointment with psychiatrist. I'm even not sure if my assesment is correct or I'm making things up. Please share your experiences, it would be super hepful for me."
"Hi there! My psychiatrist wants to add Vyvanse to my med regimen (currently just taking 3 mg abilify). The reason for this is to treat weight gain I have had since starting Abilify and quitting vaping. I have developed some unhealthy eating-dieting habits in response to this weight gain (restriction followed by cravings and binge eating). It's so frustrating. 

I'm a little scared to take the Vyvanse!! I'm really medication sensitive and scared it will give me anxiety or psychotic symptoms or trigger mania. Anyone have any experience on this combo?

Sidenote: Other than the weight gain I am SUPER happy with the Abilify."
"So we went to the pharmacy recently and they have this new policy now which not only affects me but like a whole bunch of people. They said they dont carry name brand medications anymore. So we have to ask to order it at the pharmacy, then we have to wait a few days for the orlando location to send it over to my location for them to call us back and finally get it. They said it could up to two weeks for them to get it from orlando. So we have to let them know like 2 weeks early. 

Whats even up with that? Have any of you had this same problem with the pharmacy? Its ridiculous."
"I feel like my brain is fried. I am a project engineer and I struggle following along with the conversations. My job is to understand tasks and set the timeline/stage for next steps, but I feel like I can't even keep up with the conversations anymore. It's like I zone out after each second. I had a manic episode in 2021 (\~2 months) then another in 2022 (5 months). Anyone else feel like this? It's really stressing me out because my manager asked me to step it up."
"With my medication regimen, I have to balance some mild symptoms with my stability.

Case and Point: My depression and mania are controlled; however, I still have racing thoughts.

I recently started sessions with a new therapist to talk about issues that I have never addressed in the past and have been dredging up shit that I have not dealt with in years.

These sessions are helping me, but my racing thoughts are now composed of the traumatic shit I am working through.

I could kill the racing thoughts by getting back on an antipsychotic, but I know I will become a zombie and be constantly sleepy, which with my job, I cannot do.

Has anyone else dealt with this?

Thanks!"
"hey yalllll

I finally have a in person pcp visit today after waiting 1 year. This is not my psych doc because I am still waiting on a referral.

My question is I have been on these medications for almost 2 years consistently and I have not had any labs done since. I feel like my body is off.

Effexor 150mg, seroquel 200mg, lamictal 200mg, buspar 45 mg.... What do I need to make sure my doctor tests for as far as labwork? Really want to take advantage because I don't know when a referral will come through. Of course I dont trust a PCP to adjust meds so it is just lab monitoring."

"So I’ve been struggling with this for a while but it seems to me that it is peaking ever since last year. It has brought issues to my family and relationship life. Today was a explosive episode day. I blew up with my parents which of course I regret. At the end of the night I wanted to speak to my partner of five years to make me feel better about something that was basically my fault ( the whole parent thing), but he didn’t want to speak when I wanted him to be there for me. He never picked up my call. this only made me more furious and caused me to explode again. But this time on him. I lashed out on him and called him 27 times. He texted me that I cannot keep blaming him for my outbursts and anger. It hurts me so bad now that I’m coming down from my outburst. How can I try to separate my relationship from my mental issues ? The last thing I want to do is lose my soulmate or belittle my family because I am angry and clearly suffering."
"I’m so fucking depressed, I can’t believe it. I thought the anti depressants had spared me, but apparently not. Coming down from a manic phase lasting 9 months. I hit the ground hard and everything hurts, but I don’t know what to do. 

Im getting forgetful, sleep half the day away(or more), I’ve had the same clothes for three days, my house is getting filthier and filthier…

What the fuck do I do here? I don’t wanna get so bad I loose control, and end up offing myself. My poor family would be devastated.

Cause I’ve gotten that bad before.

I just don’t know what to do. I can’t shake this. All I can do is lay around and think of sad shit."
"It's like my worst nightmare. I'm thinking of just cutting down what I have left and weening off of them. I'm trying to keep my head together but I have no income and I've been living on savings. I don't want to get off of them, I was in very bad shape only 9 months ago before I started them and almost attempted multiple times during mixed episodes and I'm scared of all that coming back since these meds are working. I'm still in bad shape but so much better than then. 

What's the cheapest way to get meds in the US? I'm not even from here so I've been using those subscription things where you check in and pay 45 monthly and then pick them up and pay for them in the pharmacy. There must be a cheaper way? My head is a wreck and I've been so irittable over this and sorry if this is all word vomit but I'm finding it hard to even think straight rn"
I need advice. I’m planning to move to live  alone in 1-2 months
I just wanna know because it seems like every aspect of my life is based around overthinking and bipolar. It never stops for me and its really hard. Ill overthink myself into panicing when im sleeping too.
"im not sure what subreddit i should put this in but i want to know if this is a thing or like a form of self harm or smth

but like im suicidal all the time, no matter what my mood is. the only time im not is when im around people that i enjoy and im happy. sometimes that ideations switches tho? like from depression i hate being alive suicidal and impulsive i feel empty and like nothing is enough suicidal. idk if that makes sense?

but basically when its the impulse one its rlly hard to deal with (i mean the depression one is also hard but yk), like its just a gnawing feeling that i can't quiet down until i actually attempt, and then i end up feeling better in the hospital lol. idk if its cause im understimulated and need some sort of thrill, if its escapism cause the mental hospital kinda feels like an escape from the real world, or if its smth else? i mean i think its mostly the thrill part, but i dont have any other ways to seek these feelings safely that dont cost money lmao so idk what to do. 

ive talked to my psych abt it but she says as long as im not going to actually attempt then its not the biggest concern, i know i wont cause im scared of the consequences like permanent damage and losing my job, and when its thrill im seeking having to stay at a place with nothing to do fucking sucks, so idk"
"Hi, I’ve always wondered why I don’t get as many responses when I post. Should I take down my picture to hide the fact that I am a black woman?"
"I get really jealous of everyone around me. They're married, getting married, have kids, families. They own nice cars and their own houses. They're laughing and happy and sharing stories of their lives and they are everything I am not. They have everything I don't, and it feels like I'll never have that. 

So I'm sitting here angry and trying not to cry about it and it feels so stupid. I want people to be happy. I really do. I shouldn't feel like shit because they are."
"The manic is here and the manic hates me. It sees me a threat to it’s parasitic existence it has on his mind. The mania likes to take over. It likes to make him an asshole and ruin everything he’s worked so hard for. It knows I want to squash it. It knows I’m right. So it keeps fighting me back. It thrives off delusions, conspiracy and selfishness. 

The fact is mania only has a short time in the grand scheme of things. And I’m going to watching it slowly fizzle out. It doesn’t care that depression is around the corner. The deep sadness and emptiness it leaves behind. It got what it wanted. It broke everything it could while it had its chance."
"Curious.

Don't know what it is?  Google away!"
"Surprisingly not manic or hypo.
More so just getting depressed more often. 

The problem is I keep continuously waking up throughout the night and early morning so I don’t get a solid nights sleep. It’s been like this for weeks now.

My psych prescribed me ambien but it made me too groggy. Same with trazadone. 

It sucks because his schedule is completely booked so I’m not going to get to see him until the end of the month. My med manager said I could go to urgent care, but I don’t feel in immediate danger or anything.

Like I’m functional enough to go to work and do school, but my exhaustion level is starting to make it harder to operate on the level I normally am at."

"I’m not sure if anyone else is seeing a bunch of Lindsay Clancy sympathy posts (especially on tiktok) but I keep coming across them. The overall sentiment is that we should have sympathy for her because she was suffering from post-partum psychosis and sadly murdered her 3 children. 

It’s probably terrible but I feel sad. I feel like were so vilified for our mental illness. Were held accountable for all of our actions, even in psychosis. Even when were out of touch with reality and it’s not our fault. 

I keep my illness a secret from most people because of the stigma. We’re constantly told “mental illness is not an excuse for XYZ..” and it’s not. But why are we now picking and choosing? Why is this sympathy not extended to others suffering from mental illness? If one of us committed a similar crime, social media would be flooded with “accountability” posts. I don’t know if I’m alone on this but it’s difficult to witness.

If you disagree or want to give a different perspective please go about it in a respectful way. I’m open to hear it."
"I have been diagnosed with bpd, cptsd, bipolar 1 disorder, unspecified anxiety disorder, panic disorder, adhd, and I probably have autism according to my social worker. And my dad constantly tells me that my meds must not be working bc I still have symptoms. It is so infuriating. He has no understanding of how medication works. And idk how to explain to him that just bc I still have symptoms does not mean my medications are not working. Before meds I was a complete wreck, I still am, but not to the degree that I was."
"I was part of a bipolar group in the UK on fb. I was on here nearly every day supporting others, and sometimes posting about myself. I've really come to rely on it when I'm struggling and I've been kicked. To my knowledge I've not done or said anything offensive. I've been given no explanation. This was one of the few places I felt I could freely express myself and now its been taken from me."
"Don't think this is the right term but is anyone elses bipolar a if I didn't tell you you wouldn't know?

I have type 2 my hypomania is something I can suppress but have the symptoms (more creativity more ideas, become a bit bouncy, irritated by people doing the smallest thing 

I've never done anything wild I just don't tell anyone, even psychotic symptoms I keep to myself even though they feel real and I think  there real I don't tell anyone (don't worry I don't tell people about obvious problems like the mold that grew on the carpet in my room I don't tell anyone anything)
My fiance is the only one I tell these things to"
"I started working at a call center about two weeks ago. I am VERY GOOD on the phone, I learned from my last job. I have a good phone voice and I'm very empathetic and patient with people which is necessary for the particular thing my company handles. After training my desk was moved and I sat near a more senior coworker who talks at me while I'm on the phone, telling me what to say when I am not struggling, did not ask for help, and most importantly, when she has no idea what the person on the line is saying. This throws me off (obviously) and two of my calls yesterday were completely ruined because I couldn't hear my client while she was yelling at me. 

Yesterday afternoon I had my first therapy session since moving and it forced out a lot of traumatic experiences and my new therapist wanted me to share all of my suicide attempts. I haven't attempted in over two years which I'm proud of, but looking back on days where I couldn't make it two months without trying to kill myself really brought my spirits down and has forced me to do a lot of thinking/moping. I didn't sleep much last night because of this.

I came in this morning and on one of my first calls of the day, she's yelling at me again. And she's relentless. If I don't say what she wants me to, she keeps going. I held up my hand and mouthed stop. I kept trying to hear the person on the phone and she kept yelling. Finally I lost it and I snapped ""can you stop?"" with the client on the line. I hung up, ripped off my headset, and stormed out knowing it would be the end of yet another job. I cried in the parking lot for about an hour because I've been given this fresh start and I've fucked it up already. My supervisor came out and told me she understood and offered to move my desk. I didn't get fired and she said I'm phenomenal on the phones. But when I came back in everyone was staring at me. I had a pretty decent second half of the morning but got flustered easily and ended up dropping calls when trying to transfer. I just can't deal with people staring at me and judging me it makes me so anxious because I am not usually like that I'm usually very calm and kind but I just couldn't take it. I'm just so upset and embarrassed I don't want to go back after lunch break but I don't want to let this bug me too much. With all the recollection on horrible days I feel like I returned to who I was then. 

I just need some comforting words right now. Sorry this was a lot, thank you for taking time out of your day to read my whining. I hope you all are having an alright day and taking care of yourselves."
Has anyone ever went from low functioning to high functioning after getting stabilized properly?
"Context:

In a particularly low moment I joined my sister's church because I felt hopeless and alone, now that I'm getting better I find myself backtracking, i know they are understanding about depression and anxiety but that's as far as it gets.

I'm currently struggling to be truthful when it comes to talk about myself, i don't want them to find out, I'm terrified to feel exposed i don't know how the pastor and the congregation will react.

Is any of you christian? Have you left church since your diagnosis?"
"I’ve Sabotaged everything from family and friends to bills and my career. I’ve lied, cheated and stolen. I feel ugly on the outside but lately I’m feeling ugly on the inside too.

I wish I believed that someday someone will love me. I wish I could love me."

"Hi all,

I got diagnosed late 2020 and have already lost track of every med I’ve tried and the times I’ve gotten really sick. So I made a [Planner for Bipolar People](https://docdro.id/VxJMheF). It has a daily tracker, a episode log and tracker, a medication log and tracker, a hospitalization log and tracker, and even dangerous behaviors tracking.

I really wish someone else had made this but I couldn’t find anything for people like us. You can edit the thing with Adobe PDF editor. 

I really hope you’ll use it."

"I'd like to hear from you if you see yourself healed one day in the future or if you prefer to not even imagine such a scenario. Doctors rarely talk about recovery and treatments are not really intended to cure this disease but just to avoid the worse effects of it.

I tested positive for COVID-19. My primary care doctor is recommending Paxlovid but it interferes with three of my medications. It weakens Lamictal and Wellbutrin and should not be taken with Geodon (I take generics). My primary care doc said to stop the Geodon cold turkey for five days to take Paxlovid. I think it's a bad idea since I normally can't sleep without Geodon. It just feels like a bad cold at the moment. Has anyone had to take Paxlovid? What was your experience?

Ive been taking 25mg of Lamictal for a week now and just noticed these small dark marks on my arm with a bumpy texture. Its the only place Ive seen them so far and they bleed if I scratch them. Is this maybe an allergic reaction? Im in the process of contacting my doctor to check it.
"Ive been noticing that frequently after feeling horrendous, I feel amazing shortly after. Something really bad happened a few days ago, it would probably cause a suicide attempt if i wasnt on meds. I sobbed, felt like the world was ending for 2-3 days and now I feel great. I feel even better than before this whole thing happened. It's not like I resolved anything, I just started feeling great. 

I can't tell if this is a bipolar thing or if everyone experiences this."
"I teach 4th grade. I have a group of students who are friends, but have drama constantly. Their relationship is fairly hot and cold, and the power dynamic of the group shifts often, leading the girls to gang up on/exclude each other. Lately, they keep calling each other bipolar. “You’re bipolar” “She’s bipolar”. Etc. I spoke with them about it, but I am curious as to how you would explain it to a child (9/10)."
"Hey all, I just wanted to shout out to Dr. Tracey Marks on Youtube. She's a psychiatrist who makes mental health education videos and she's been on a tear right now with her bipolar disorder-related videos and youtube shorts.

So many channels out there endlessly regurgitate the signs and symptoms of bipolar disorder, but she's putting effort into EXAMINING what happens in the throes of an episode, and what the long term consequences and manifestations are. She just put out a video today about [""predominant polarity""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMBJjV1tLoA&ab_channel=Dr.TraceyMarks~) in bipolar disorder. I learned something new tonight! Check her out! And yes--YouTube has verified her as a licensed doctor!

(I have no affiliation with her channel, this is not a promotion of my own goods or a solicitation of any kind, just an awesome resource I wanted to share with the community.)"
I know my bipolar makes me an emotional person at times. But I’m tired of the blame being constantly passed off as 100% my fault. I acknowledge when I’m wrong and apologize when I’ve acted out of line. I feel like my illness is just an excuse for him to never take accountability for his own actions.
"I [25 F] have been dating/talking to my ex boyfriend [25 M] (ill call him M) for almost 11 months now. We have so much in common not only in our past but also dreams for a future. We both felt that the other person was the only person we have ever truly connected and loved. Honestly we just felt like we were immediately two pieces to a puzzle. 

I noticed a pattern early on, long periods of depression and long periods of manic behavior in M. Even though I studied psych in school, I thought that I had no right to say anything because I am not a doctor.

In the last few months there have been 3 clear incidences of what I would call possibly a psychosis episode. He became someone different. There was a clear change in how he would speak or type. It was like a complete switch. The one episode that was in person, I literally saw his eyes darken and it was like he truly didnt know me. And although normally M communicates at a high level, his responses to things I said, didnt quite make sense or fit in the conversation we were having. 

I wont go too deep into detail. But what M says during these episodes are basically things like calling me a whore or a compulsive liar or describing me as unattractive or crazy. Its like he truly believes that I had sex with a million people in his head and that I cheated on him or something of the sort. Says that he never loved me etc. 

Also, to note, he was just barely diagnosed as bipolar at the beginning of this year. Because he went to therapy immediately after his second episode with me, that was really bad. So I feel like there is no way he is cognizant yet of how to really live with bipolar, as it was very shocking to him. 

Also, after an episode, he has never love bombed me or acted like it was okay for what he did. In fact he was distraught, said what he did was disgusting, and said that I deserve better etc. 

I know that technically what he has done would be considered abusive. And I dont condone the behavior. But I just feel like he never had unconditional love(which I know for a fact). And he is trying to hurt me to prove that I dont love him unconditionally. And prove that I am a bad person, so he can feel better for how he treated me during episodes. I want to believe that he really does love me and doesnt mean it. But maybe I am delusional for thinking that… So I am asking you guys, as people who live with bipolar, if he actually believes everything he says during an episode? Or should I just discount it? 

If you think further information about our relationship would help, please just ask! I just dont want to abandon him because of mental illness. Everyone deserves love and I cant even fathom how hard it is for someone with bipolar disorder to really live."
"How exactly can you tell the difference between having a good day(s) and being hypomanic? 

Also.. once you’ve figured out your hypomanic, then what? Is there a way to cut it off or do you just have to accept it and hunker down? 

That same question also goes for mania. If I feel manic, do I check myself into a facility? If not immediately, is there a way to refrain from hitting extreme mania/psychosis? 

Also.. I noticed on another post, that there are different *types* of hypomania which I was not aware of. For example, one user mentioned “pre-menstrual” hypomania. Are there really classifications for hypomania? 

After a year and a half I think I’m finally starting to accept this personally, and keep moving forward. So please help me understand through your experiences, stories, articles, links, and so on.. thank you!"
Hi I’m a 24F and I’ve been taking 1800 mg of lithium in a single dose right before bed . ( my psych said it was cool) It’s working  well for me but a lot of the post I see about taking  lithium talk about taking it in two doses … even my google search . is it weird taking like that?? Especially for “high dose?
"I know this is a very controversial topic... I go clubbing every weekend and often en up taking party drugs too (usually speed). I am extremely stable and don't overdo it, and was wondering if anyone else shares similar experiences without negative side effects?"
"I've noticed that when my kids come home from school or my wife comes home from work, I get temporarily agitated, annoyed, short-tempered, and sad. Generally, it will bounce back within the next hour. Does anyone have that? Solutions?"
"* post was removed from r/bipolar with no explanation nor option to contact mods, but since I'm guessing it was about my saying he should be medicated without mentioning this was determined by a psychiatrist - it was determined by a psychiatrist. Numerous times. I could have edited that into the post there but they never even mentioned it as an option. 

It's probably best to start by saying he's not a bad person. I've known him for most of my life, and he'd gone through several full makeover personality changes, but certain core features remained. Every so often, we'd stop talking, and it's be years before I was willing to forgive him again. Originally, he was super judgemental of me, mean, and possessive (despite having no romantic or sexual interest in me). Then he became dependant. I naively helped him with the relationships he ruined via obsessive behaviour and outspoken rage, and still he'd always end up blaming me for his issues. Then, a few months later, he'd be in a bad mental state again, and would call to have me pull him out. I'm the only friend he comes to with this because he knows I can't say no to a person in pain, and I actually know how to help. And I wouldn't mind. But he uses me. While I help him with everything, all he ever helped me with was with getting rid of shitty men, which really did help, but he did that out of envy. Again, not out of desire for me, but out of actual jealousy of the amount of time I spend with them instead of him. 

Last time I sent it off, it was because he started a thing with my ride or die best friend and ended up being obsessive with her and letting his rage out on me, to the extent of inducing flashbacks and a full blown meltdown. I had a friend pick me up and informed this dude (whom I no longer saw as friend) that he can talk to me when he gets medicated, and not a second before that.

A year passed. A dangerous person we know was under investigation by the police, and the dude knew where the guy lives, so I gave the police his number, to which he responded by lashing out at me for daring to give the police his number, despite the circumstances. That was betrayal to me. He had physically protected me from this person before and was still mad that I needed his help making sure that that monster doesn't hurt anyone anymore. At this point, he was dead to me. 

Yesterday, he called me. He asked for a recommendation for a psychologist. I gave him the name of my Pdoc and told him to talk to him. A few hours go by, and he's yet again contacting me, asking that I be a shoulder to cry on. This time I refused. I told him he'd gone too far last time, and I need to know that there's something more serious in the works than just psychotherapy if I'm going to get back in touch with him. That I don't hate him, and if he is medicated I'd consider letting him back in. That's the last thing I told him.

I've had flashbacks of this toxic ass friendship ever since he called. Had trouble sleeping despite Seroquel. I kept my boundaries and didn't comfort him, and it feels bad. Worse than the disappointment. The guilt is just debilitating. I just want to have a quiet life, and I'm so fucking tired of this incessant fucking noise."
I am bipolar 2 and saw my cats toy move on it’s own the other night. I have eliminated any logical cause for that and am wondering do I have a spirit or was it a hallucination?
"I don’t feel sad and I don’t feel happy. I’m sitting at work and people are talking around me, I find it mildly irritating but not completely bothersome. I feel absolutely nothing at all. I feel incapable of feeling joy. I am walking with shuffling feet and I feel like im made of lead. I don’t even want to make eye contact with anyone. 

I’ve just been in a depressive episode for 3 weeks and I felt like I was coming out of it yesterday but now im not so sure."
"Hey guys, I'm here because my husband is diagnosed BP2 and he's been really going through it for about a year. It started right after his birthday a little less than a year ago when he bought himself a ""luxury"" car and it's been progressively worse as time goes on, especially when this car has issues and something breaks. I've talked to his psych and they've adjusted his meds, but it only worked temporarily. We've been together for years and we were fine before all of this, but now he's become incredibly aggressive and just plain cold. He that's to leave constantly and essentially treats me like a roommate while talking to other women all over the internet. I have no idea how to navigate this or what he's even feeling, but I do know that he's been more depressed lately and it's caused him to be even more cold and aggressive towards me. I don't want to lose him because I love him more than anything, but I'm pregnant and I need to have a safe home for this baby. I just didn't know if anyone could give any insight on how to handle this because I just don't know what it's like from his perspective so I don't know how to fix this."
Has anyonebactually gone through any testing to confirm?  WhT information is there that shows any damage and what kind of damage?
I realize this disorder gets worse with age and it terrifies me. I'm so scared what I'm gonna be like when I'm older... I'm 27-years-old now and have other mental health disorders. I'm just scared it's only gonna continue to go downhill and I'll never be able to live the life I want to - being on as many meds as I'm on also scares me. I don't want permanent liver damage but I also cannot be without my medications.
"Those of you with a period, what do you use for birth control?

I was on the pill for several years (before bipolar symptoms) but switched to the mirena IUD. After the initial pain it was working quite well but for the last month I’ve had really severe cramping. It’s to the point where I don’t want the mirena anymore. My cramps were never this bad on the pill. Only problem is, it would seem a lot of our bipolar meds have interactions with forms of birth control. 

I’m taking lamictal and have the option of lithium if I need to try something else."
"I’m a 47 yr old mother of 2 boys. I’ve come to the realization that I am not a likable person and for the life of me I don’t know why. I am polite and kind but still I have not one single friend. I also have come to the realization that it is too late for me to do anything with my life I can only make so much as an accounting clerk which is $20-$27/hr which I cannot survive on and support myself or my boys. I’m currently living in a room. I lost my place of living and in turn lost my 50/50 visitation with my boys who need me more then ever. Because of this I have lost my child support. Their father makes 3 figures but only looks at the facts and says it’s nothing personal. I have no family, no friends, no way of making more money, and no way of getting my boys back. My current job that I have been at for only 4 months started out rocky due to my homelessness and the stress revolved around that. My two bosses do not like me (and this is just not in my head). I have nothing and no one. The only thing I do have is my two boys and I’m utterly letting them down with no hope of being able to fix it. Now my bipolar depression is kicking in full swing, I can’t eat, sleep, work, think. I cry 24/7, in panic mode constantly and have absolutely no one to turn to. I know how I sound utterly pathetic.. just as my father told me.. but it is true my life and me are pathetic so what’s the point!"
