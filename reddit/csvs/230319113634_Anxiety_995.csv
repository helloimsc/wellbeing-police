Make sure you get a good brand from a health foods store! Shouldn’t be more than $20 or so. Walmart brands have a lot of junk in them. 

My anxiety is severe and unrelenting. The only thing that helps is Ativan & benzos scare the shit out of me so I’ve been scared cause it’s the only thing that works. No chance this is placebo because I wasn’t expecting it work on my anxiety, just had planned on getting mag anyway as I know it’s a helpful supplement. 

This will work. I’m not saying it will cure you! But it works. I take a small amount in the morning and a full 400mg at night. Finally.. I can sleep without an awful sleep-med/antipsychotic hangover. 

Of course it may not work. But please! I implore you to try this. I’d love to hear other opinions & experiences as well!",1679182872.0

He is of the belief that it’s all just big pharmaceutical companies trying to make a profit, but for me these medications genuinely help, I tried so many other things first including natural supplements but nothing has helped like my antidepressants do. I wouldn’t care about his opinion except if we have kids together someday and my kids were struggling with mental health (it runs in my family, everyone in my family is on some sort of psychiatric medication) then I’d be open to my kid getting on medication since it’s helped me so much, but he would obviously be against it. I guess I’m just trying to figure out how I can make him see that they’re not evil drugs, they’re the only thing keeping me alive right now. I need to figure out a way to explain it to him so he can be at least open to the idea of our kids using them if we have kids together and they struggle in the same way.

So I’m going through the grief of that. I’ve had cats since 2009. Now they are all gone. I feared getting them in the first place as I knew they were going to die so I knew I’d stress and worry and I did the entire time. And I got them out of grief. A relationship ended and I knew I’d prefer animal company over human as relationships with women caused me grief every time. But now I realized I had a routine around cats and now I have nothing to do other than work. I’ve never really had an interests. I’ll probably exercise more now and have more disposable income once I repay my huge vet bills. Just right now my life feels so empty but also relief as if I don’t get another pet I won’t have to go through the inevitable grief stress and anxiety of losing them again.,1679140791.0

I was up for 2 days drinking a lot of caffeine and vaping while finishing up some projects that were due soon for school. I went to the hospital and they said everything was fine with my heart. I think it was a panic attack from no sleep and too many stimulants. But ever since then I feel like my death is imminent. I think about tall the damage I did to my heart by drinking coffee almost everyday and vaping constantly for a few years. I was out running today because I want to strengthen my heart and take care of myself now but I got a few sharp pains of the left side of my chest. Now I’m scared I’m gonna die and the heart anxiety is at an all time high. I’m seeing a cardiologist rn so that’ll give me some peace of mind but do you think the vaping high nic vapes for a few years and drinking coffee everyday destroyed my heart? I can’t stop thinking about it and it’s killing me. I feel like I am going to die relatively soon from the damage. I am harboring negative feelings for my friends because they got me on nic.

Constant anxious thoughts and regular panic attacks. I started working with a psychiatrist and slowly figured out a medication regimen that helped me.

But then more and more I started feeling like I had no energy to do anything outside of my basic daily tasks, followed by ruminating on how I'm not doing enough to be fully well. I realized that now with the anxiety at bay, depression has found room to worm it's way back in.

I'm in the process of finding a therapist and my psychiatrist suggested I try Wellbutrin to help get my energy levels up. But they said they're only concern is Wellbutrin can increase anxiety. I filled the prescription and plan an taking the first one tomorrow. From what they described I think it can help me, but I'm so worried about it setting off my anxiety. I'm hoping my current meds (buspirone 3x daily and Klonopin, taken rarely now, as needed) will combat that.

I thought the Zoloft didn’t help it but maybe it did and I just had too high of expectations because I can confidently say it was so much less bad on Zoloft.

Now they've come back mildly and at a time when I was severely stressed and depressed. My mind went straight to pancreatic cancer. Now I'm having other symptoms like gas, piercing pain left side of my rib, greasy stool that sometimes is broken up. These are all symptoms of pancreas issues. Went to the doctor to get bloodwork over a week ago and still haven't heard back and I'm terrified they found something and are doing more tests while I wait. He keeps telling me it sounds like anxiety and IBS. But I haven't heard of either causing broken up fatty stool. Also scheduled to see a GI doctor  but I have to wait 2 plus months for that appointment.

""I think you just want a mental illness so you can use it as an excuse"" 


In general she seems to have a lack of understanding that anxiety isn't always something you can just deal with and it can be extremely crippling.
This has built a lot of resentment between us and I really try to see her perspective but especially in times when I'm struggling it hurts that I can't reach out without feeling ashamed or that I might be judged for being weak. 
I've lived with GAD and social anxiety since I was young and I wish she could see that what may be a normal part of life for most people are a big accomplishment for people with anxiety disorders - such as going to work, going to the shops alone

I've had this issue for a while now. Every time I go to get my blood pressure checked, I get a spike of anxiety. It then results in an incorrect reading, which then makes me anxious because it's high and I'm desperate to know what my normal blood pressure is. Basically when I feel the arm strap inflating, my heart rate rockets up from resting to 110bpm. I've felt my heart rate at rest and it's around 65-70bpm when I'm properly relaxed. My last readings were: 150/79 and then 135/74 on a second run taken immediately after, but my heart rate was around 120bpm due to anxiety. My doctor noticed this and told me not to worry (he knows about my anxiety) but obviously I am worried.

It should be lower, I'm 27 yo and not too unhealthy or unfit, I drink at max once a week and I don't smoke. I'm not expecting perfect but also not that high. I wish you could estimate what your blood pressure is at your normal resting heart rate.

I do have a history of general anxiety disorder, particularly focused on my health. I used to worry a lot about heart issues, I'm better now but this is one of the last things that I can't seem to shake.

Does anyone have any tips to calm me down when I'm getting it checked? I've tried deep breathing, it doesn't work. Closing my eyes works a little bit, but not much. Hoping that someone who has the same issue can impart their wisdom. Thanks!",1679193523.0

Personally despite years of therapy and consciously knowing this is not true I have caught myself multiple times believing subconsciousness old ideas that anxiety = some form of weakness. 

To prove this idea false to myself I made a goal using things I already do: exercise and cold exposure (Wim Hof Method). My goal was to break some fitness world records in sub freezing temperatures wearing only shorts which I know is a little strange. 

Anyways, I was partly successful. Out of the 8 records I tried to break in 31 degree temps I was able to do 3. If for some reason anyone is interested in seeing the proof (a nutty man exercising in his backyard in the winter) it's on my You Tube Channel [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ7b\_dYi3LiPJvsECHRo8HA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ7b_dYi3LiPJvsECHRo8HA).

I'm a little self conscious about posting videos of myself working out but since I have been inspired by others sharing their achievements while being open about having anxiety I figured the risk was worth it. Also, if anyone wants to see someone with anxiety that is a truly elite athlete I would recommend the documentary Eddie- Strongman (2015).

Also hopefully this goes without saying but I am by no means a bad ass. I wish I was but I still struggle with anxiety and when I go to the local gym I see tons of people much stronger than me. 

If anyone else has stories of things they have accomplished (not limited to exercise) despite their anxiety please share them! I'm always looking to be inspired.",1679161616.0

I have found myself fundamentally in the same position I was in two year ago, it’s a tough pill to swallow but it’s ultimately down to my lack of foresight in moments when I should be more disciplined.

Where do I go from here?

I have to it is imperative! That I practice more self discipline and focus on building up my self worth, I have to first see myself the way I want others to see me. Respect myself, Love myself Push for realistic goals everyday, Consistency is key.

It's completely bogus. I've never had soap poisoning even when I've never really rinsed my dishes all that much, nor do I know anyone personally that has ever had soap poisoning from soap residue on washed dishes.

It's funny how anxiety can make the most ridiculous/impossible thing seem so likely and so dangerous in an attempt to protect, when all it really does is make me look like a dickhead for being scared of dish soap.

It's even more intriguing how I can be self aware that it is ridiculous, but my instincts will still try to convince me otherwise.

For example,
I “saw” a clear bag of caramel cremes on a table at work, when I was walking up to the table they still were “caramel cremes” (caramel with white centers in clear wrapping with red on the twisted ends.)
When I looked down at the table to grab on, IT WAS RED KETCHUP PACKETS.
This is just an example the 5 times I remember  the past 2 1/2 months. 

Main topic of each thing that “happened” but never happened in real life
- a man walking the side of the road
-caramel cremes
- let the dogs outside (went to call them back in and they were never out there)
- sat my makeup bag on counter from bathroom (physically remember grabbing it and putting it there)
- facetimed accidentally at 4 am one of the people at work that is causing the biggest amount of stress in my life. (Turns out that never happened when looking at my recent logs a few hours later)

I've been suffering with a lot of anxiety but last year I started to suddenly develop chest discomfort and all sorts of weird physical symptoms (sometimes all of them at once)

During day almost no problem, I would feel great, but as soon as night falls, everything gets out of hand almost everytime. I can't sleep, getting awake by what I though was my heart stopping, trembling, feeling weak (but not tired) nausea but I never end up vomiting, head lightness and dizziness, muscle tensing in the jaw neck and back, all that but my heart is not getting past 90.  I've tried everything, relaxation, psychologist, changing sleep schedule and habits, eating lighter (specially the evening) exercising, going out with people to change my mind, now I'm even moving out because the sole fact of being in this apartment scares me. 

I went 2 times to the ER, no problems found, 3 times to different doctors, no problems found. I'm just sitting here every night, feeling what my brain think is my heart failing me while being helpless. 

When everything happens it's always the same cycle, the morning I'm fine, I do have headaches and now constant jaw pain but it doesn't scare me, I don't even understand why I was in such a bad state during the night, but when it's between 9 to 10pm up to 7am I'm convinced I'm gonna die, that that's the end, that my heart beats to fast, to hard,missing a beat, feeling these jolts of adrenaline spreading through my chest by  heat waves, feeling crushed,  jaw, neck, back hurts, getting tension headache, my mind is a mess, I want to cry, to scream to run away from my own body . All of the doctors that I saw suggested that it is anxiety but every time I can't help but think it's something terminal. 

The thing is I had anxiety and panic attack before, but this, it's completely different. Before it was only my mind so I could ground myself back, now I don't know what I'm feeling and it's scares me much much more than anything I had in my life before.

Am I alone in this ? Does anyone else experience this  ?

51,Involuntary head jerks,1,11v6yqb,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11v6yqb/involuntary_head_jerks/,0,"  Since December of 2022 I have been experiencing jerks from my head that are all day every day. They are subtle no, nod, left, right, or even just make me blink. 

  For context I went through a very stressful time through 2020-2021. Got sick early in pandemic that wasn't Covid but I didn't know that and obsessed about my symptoms and treatment. Led my mental health spiraling down for a long time. Developed a very spacey feeling like I was out of it or my head was full of a pressure that didn't hurt or feel like a headache. It was like a brain fog. Like my head just felt full. This feeling would happen every other week, to every other day, to everyday 24/7. It took a span of 8 months of constant anxiety and stress before it got to a 24/7 thing. My sleep became unrested no matter how long I slept and I had vivid dreams everyday that were usually bad by end of 2020. Developed sub-clinical hypothyroidism by end of 2021. No family history. 
  
I spent this entire time inside my house trying to figure out what caused the 24/7 head spacey feeling. Got MRI's of brain, other imaging, blood work and they all were normal. I noticed a pressure feeling, again not a headache, would build up if I had to focus on something or use brain energy for a extended amount of time. I did nothing to mitigate stress like running, meditating, going out with friends or just living my old general life. By end of 2022 I noticed my head pressure build up would lead to what felt like a headache which never happened. This went on for 2 weeks in December before one big pressure build up and a headache happened and my head suddenly jerked. I have since been getting these involuntary jerks everyday. I've gotten terrible anxiety over it since then because I hate it so much and scared this is my life now.

I've reflected hard on everything and think this has all been chronic stress and anxiety that's made me feel this way and my brain just finally had enough. I wanted to see if anyone here had gone through something similar and were able to heal from similar symptoms I have listed. Thank you for any feedback.",1679188344.0

Now, I  just want to say these thoughts or scenarios are not  always negative!  I’ve tried looking up if other folk have thought/felt the same as me and  most are asking for advice for thoughts for negative scenarios!  Mine are both

It’s for anything. For my self, friends family. It’s like I safe guard myself. Positive negative. And I’ll go down that road of, if ‘this’ happens then ‘that could happen. Like it’s a tree and it branches off.   I do every possible tier that convo could reach. And i bear I mind if other people could intervene in that moment and I imagine what they could say. All these branches of possible outcomes. But they are positive as well as negative. It’s like a play a devils advocate as well, sitting on the fence! I don’t like confrontation, arguments but I think what if this back thing happens and I think of how it pan out, what would folk possible sake to anything. ………and this all come to me in just seconds. It’s in my head. I’m already two jumps ahead pre-empting what could be said. 

Now, when I do it when my own anxiety is nuts. I understand. For me as much as it is mentally exhausting even though I do it naturally. I see it as I ‘Super Power’! May sound funny but I do, because I feel I’ve already prepared me self!  (I’m not all negative I’m a hopeful person, ( at times) but I’ve prepared my self. ) I feel I helps me as  my anxiety it’s bad

But I worried because I do it with my friends when they tell me about their issues and I construct every possible scenario for their issue. Like I’m preparing therm. But then scaring them that could possibly happen. When I might not but I can’t help myself, my mind just goes there and I’ve thought all of this in my mind in just seconds!

Has anyone else thought like this because I am getting worried and it’s exhausting. I think too deeply.

I have lymph nodes that are palpable in my throat and neck (the posterior cervical ones I think?) and one under the jaw near throat. Not sore but feelable and not on my left side. My ear has had pains randomly in it for 3 months too. I have horrendous neck pains and pinched nerves and I think something it’s screwing with my circulation in my spine somewhere all the way down to my butthole because I get feelings of bubbling down there but ain’t nothing occurring. I get lightheaded a lot. 

I’ve been on Amlodipine for a year and wierd side effects started 6 months ago. Very tired randomly and I get the chills. Now this isn’t everyday but it’s dam close. 

I’m also an alcoholic for last 2 years and drink 4-6 drinks a night I missed one night because I had stomach bug. 

Does it sound like kidney failure, lymphoma , oral cancer that I don’t see?

Or because Xanax helps then that “auto” means anxiety. Which I don’t believe. I think it can help nerves or muscular issues too. Could it relieve cancer symptoms 

I see my doctor in 4 days. 

Listen I’m a nut and need psychological help. I know this but it won’t stop me from posting like a madman on here because these sensations and pains are real.",1679172081.0

I've had anxiety for most of my life, but one thing I've improved a lot in these past two or three years is I get over bad anxiety days much quicker than I used to, but this most recent bad day I cannot seem to shake.

I'm currently 4 days since I started (now I'm on **0,5 mg** and next week I'll be on 10mg). 

Before taking lexapro I was already experiencing so much anxiety in many forms: extreme overthinking about death, **so many heart palpitations**, squeezing heart feeling, (therefore, I couldn't stop associating those symptoms with my arm and jaw pain to heart problems), **very tight throat and constant feeling of choking.**

The thing is, for my **heart concerns**, I did at least more than 6 EKG's, blood tests, X-Ray, and I never got anything weird. Always anxiety. I currently can, in a way, identify it as a muscle cramp in my chest, since I can really tell how tight it is. 

Now about **tight throat**//globus sensation//globus pharyngeus concerns, I did an esophageal transit and even another throat evaluation by putting a camera (?) through my nose and throat. Nothing was there. I've been with this problem on and off for like 10 years. And due to that, I kind of ""forgot"" hoe to eat, since every time I swallow, I swallow gas(?). To be honest, I don't trust those diagnosis. I feel like what I'm feeling it can't be just anxiety. I literally cannot swallow. This has to end.

But I truly feel I'm choking. ***I truly feel*** how the food gets stuck. And since I started taking lexapro, my symptoms **have worsened up**. 

It feels impossible to swallow **even** mashed food. I have so much reflux. I feel so dizzy that it leads me to so much **derealization**. **I can't stop thinking** about death, even though I try to do stuff like drawing or something. When I try to sleep, I suddenly **wake up with so much anxiety**, disoriented, and overthinking about *""how I was very close to dying, maybe I have heart problems or breathing problems etc etc""*... In other words, **I feel paralyzed**. I've been sitting the whole day, I feel so dizzy. If I think about food, I get so scared, and I even feel like throwing up. I don't have energy to move. I just want this to end, I want to live.

Have you ever experienced any of those symptoms? Is any of you on Lexapro aswell? Did all of this stopped for you? How can I make this to stop? How can I be more relaxed? What are your thoughts?

I have come out of a severely sexually abusive relationship which was 10 years long. Talking Therapies suggested that I’m suffering from PTSD. They’ve put me on a waiting list.

I need to stop, but I’m incredibly impulsive with taking it. I don’t recognise myself when I look in the mirror, so I know I need to take back control.

I am thinking I should start by taking 300mg*3 this week. 
Then alternate between 300mg*3 & 300mg*2 the following week.

Perhaps divide the dose across the week the following week. Eg) 200mg*3

Also got an amazing job offer in the same week after being terrified of interviews.,1,11utp9t,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11utp9t/finally_took_the_plunge_and_passed_my_driving/,1,"Just a short story about some recent successes to hopefully motivate other people like me towards their goals. I've experienced very bad anxiety for most of my life (I dry heave a lot of mornings for example, wake up in a cold sweat in the morning, fixate on the worst outcomes, have horrible thoughts come to me at random points in the day, can never relax, etc...) to the point where I put myself into a comfortable box that I know the bounds of to try to avoid it. Part of this box meant staying in a situation that I knew and that included not driving. To the point where I avoided possible opportunities my whole life because of it. I'm 31 for reference.

In the past year, the bounds of that box broke. My partner divorced me, I was guaranteed to lose my job the coming year (visiting faculty). I had to face all of my fears at once. Living completely independent, starting the job search for real with the possibility of rejection and also driving. It's been a long road that has led me to suicidal thoughts I hadn't had for a while, quite literally feeling like I was given six months to live.

 I failed my road test the first time, applying to places was mentally exhausting and made feel like I was dying for weeks due to my perceived lack of self-worth. Lying on my bed as anxiety reeled over my body like a wave. I had already messed up again for the umpteenth time. The beginning of this week felt like the beginning of the end as I had an interview with a really cool place lined up that I didn't feel qualified for, waiting on results from another interview and had my driving test coming up again.

Before my interview I quite literally projectile vomited my egg sandwich back up and felt like I was going to die. Luckily an hour beforehand I was able to pull it together and focus on my message about myself. The interview seemed to go well though and I'm waiting to hear back. They reached out to me, so it's a weird situation but for people job searching, make sure to make connections. Connections matter way more than cold applying to places with decent careers. During that interview, I was sent an email with an offer for another job which was also a really cool place and career goal of mine in higher education. 

This morning I went and took my road test. Guy was cool, we mostly talked the whole time, easily passed. Now I have a driver's license like it was no big deal after losing a lot of my life's possibilities in the past due to avoidance. The anxiety has lifted for now and I feel great. I know that it will come back, but proving to myself my own self worth has been amazing for my mental health.

My suggestion to younger people who are dealing with anxiety on a similar level to mine, please seek help, from friends, family, a therapist, whatever you need to do. Don't limit yourself like I did because of it. Even if it feels like you're dying you have to try. Job interviews aren't that bad. Completely fail? Those people move on with their workday and forget about you by days end. Apply to a place and never hear back? Just keep looking and improving your applications. Started driving late in your life and feeling embarrassed by it? No one cares actually. No one in my life has ever given me crap about it (except my ex). Start small, drive in a parking lot, find an instructor/family member who is understanding of your mental blocks, etc.  Focus on why you are scared and attack those issues first. A lot and I mean a lot of people go through it. I will still suffer from it; I will never be able to drive somewhere without anxiety. But at least I have the option and you deserve too as well. 

Don't let anxiety limit you to the extent that I did. It's incredibly hard not to and its one of the hardest things to do in life, but it is worth it. I will still continue to do it and it is something that I will have to manage my whole life. But it is worth it to try to manage it. No matter how old you are, no matter how much you feel like you have wasted your life, you still have time.

137,Looking for Calmness (TW: panic attacks),3,11ujuy2,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11ujuy2/looking_for_calmness_tw_panic_attacks/,2,"TL;DR I struggle with anxiety. Suggestions for coping with anxiety/panic attacks are welcome. 

I’ve struggled with anxiety pretty much my entire life, I started having panic attacks around the age of 6 when my great grandmother passed away and I learned what death was. I would wake up screaming for my mother and she would come in and try to sooth me and say that I didn’t need to worry about dying because that wasn’t going to happen for a long time. I definitely should have had therapy as a child but that wasn’t something people regularly did in the 90’s and even if they did we didn’t have the insurance for it anyway.

I grew out of those particular panic attacks but then when I was middle school someone who was a grade under me died in a car accident. Ever since then, I was probably around 13 at the time, I have been diagnosed with anxiety and panic attacks. 

Though throughout the years the severity of the panic attacks has gone up and down, it seems to only be getting worse lately. I’ve been taking the antidepressant I am currently on for awhile now and feel it works well at stabilizing my sad/happy emotions but the anxiety has never gone away. I know I am in desperate need of cognitive behavioral therapy but I hate driving and can’t get to the office for in person appointments. I have tried virtual therapy that is covered by my insurance but where I live only has one available provider and the lady called me the wrong name the whole time, and I don’t want to have another appointment with her. I occasionally check to see if any other providers are available but so far no luck.

I think what has been making my anxiety worse is this past July I was diagnosed with a form of type 1 diabetes, called LADA, and am still going through the motions of learning how to live with that. The endocrinologist said my case is atypical since diabetes doesn’t run in my family.

Another stresser, I’ve also gone back to college to get a second BA, this time in graphic design, because I haven’t been able to find a job with my MA in art history (shocking, I know. /s). The program is online and while I do enjoy it, I know I don’t handle the stress of the coursework as well as I could.

I eat well, exercise regularly, stay hydrated, and try my best at meditation. I’ve also started journaling. I have a good home life with my spouse (no children) and a support system via my family (though they do live in another state). I feel I’ve tried all the things to help ease my anxiety but nothing seems to work.

I’m tired of feeling so wound up all the time. Besides being physically healthy, all I want is to feel calm. I can’t remember the last time I felt okay.

If you read this far, thanks for listening. If you are also struggling with anxiety know you are not alone. If anyone has some genuine advice on how to cope with daily anxiety I’m more than happy to hear it!

Much love. <3",1679133312.0

Sound familiar?

Welcome to Imposter Syndrome. You’re in good company. Nigella Lawson, Michelle Obama, Lady GaGa and Lily Allen have all shared their imposter syndrome experiences publicly. But what is this demon?

It’s an umbrella term, under which lives one or more limiting beliefs such as those generalised ones above. They may be accompanied by more specific beliefs. These are typically formed rationally in childhood and, as children, may serve us well. For example;

· I need everyone to approve of me. 

· To be a valued I must succeed in everything I do.

· It is not OK for me to make mistakes. If I do, I am bad.

· I can feel happy in life without contributing back in some way.

· Everyone needs to rely on someone stronger than themselves.

· I shouldn’t have to feel sadness, discomfort and pain.

· Someone, somewhere, should take responsibility for me.

What would your own list look like?

However, time moves on and things change. As we become adults, our childhood beliefs serve us less well – and the resultant behaviours may be incongruent with the situation we are in. This leads to the conclusion that one of the things it means to grow up, is to develop out of our childhood beliefs and adopt a new set of beliefs that will serve us better as adults. This progression follows a broad pattern of developing from dependence as children to independence as young adults to interdependence as mature adults. 

Our overall set of beliefs are developing all the time. However, most of us will carry some of our childhood beliefs with us in to adulthood. Most of these will be innocuous most of the time but some of them will, sometimes, impede our performance as high functioning, inter-dependent, adults. As adults, we benefit from identifying our limiting beliefs, and growing in to more valuable beliefs. 

By way of an example, a common limiting belief sitting under the Imposter Syndrome umbrella is ‘I must compare myself to others’ which can be re-framed to ‘I live my own life on my own terms’ or ‘I have a unique set of character strengths, as do others’. In turn the re-framed beliefs can underpin valuable affirmations such as ‘Because I live my own life, I enjoy the successes of others’ or ‘I choose to celebrate my successes without reference to other’s accomplishments’ or ‘The fact that I choose to live my life authentically means I only compare myself against my own standards’. 

A standard element of working with PERMA hypnotherapy is developing a high degree of self-awareness via exploring your characters strengths, values, beliefs and limiting beliefs which paves the way to defining your identity. In turn, this leaves you ideally placed to choose your own best future. 

Working with a hypnotherapist is particularly well suited to personal development in this area as – by its very nature – it opens up the pathways between the parts we know and recognise as ‘us’ and the deeper levels of our wisdom: ideal for when we need to take those big steps forward.

In the colloquial sense, not the DSM sense. I've had panic attacks before and they were bad. The first time I thought I was having an asthma attack and going to die, and the second time I was hyperventilating to the point my vision was going and my fingers were getting all numb, and they were bad, but still tolerable. But when I was far younger I used to have extreme anxiety around sleeping by myself that persisted for years, despite my family minimizing accommodations and imposing consequences like all the books say to do. That feeling was probably the second-worst or maybe even the worst feeling of my life. I spent years in constant fear because of the struggle that would come at bedtime, to the point that I was willing to do something extreme to avoid it. All the books say that anxiety can't harm you and you must learn to tolerate it. And I do that most of the time. But whenever I do much as think back to those years when I was younger I get overwhelmed and wind up cryin for ages. It's a massive pain.

166,I've always had health anxiety. Then my little brother died of cancer at 29.,3,11ufo00,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11ufo00/ive_always_had_health_anxiety_then_my_little/,2,"I was a bag of grief for over a year after. I've come out of the fog, and though I still cry nearly daily for him, I could get back to life, until recently.

My health anxiety is through the roof. My newest thought today is that I have ovarian cancer because I've been bloated a lot over the last 3 weeks. However, I've also been taking iron pills and just got off antibiotics for a sinus infection.

My brother never had anxiety or worried too much about anything. Watching what happened to him has obviously left me with some serious trauma.

I feel unable to get through life the last 3 weeks, worse than while I was in serious grief. I can barely leave my bedroom because being anywhere else in my house amplifies my anxiety. I can feel every little pain or itch or nerve pinch. Every muscle spasm. My fitbit is both helping and not helping.

The only time I feel a bit better is when I walk a mile or two at a quick speed on my treadmill. But I just feel sooo incapable as a mother, a wife, a student, an auntie, a daughter.

And then when I try to convince myself it's just anxiety, my anxiety goes ""but what if it actually brain cancer(sinus infection), congestive heart failure (weird flu we got last week), breast cancer (pimple on my chest), or now ovarian cancer?""

I've never taken any prescription for mental health. I've coped with depression and anxiety my whole life but I finally feel incredibly overwhelmed and like the quality of my life is absolutely suffering. I cried into my husband's chest tonight and he was wholly supportive of me.

I don't really know what I'm looking for with this post. Solidarity? If anyone can relate?

Essentially in 2016 I was depressed and hopeless and was charging my credit cards just to get by because I felt like I had nothing to live for. During that time period I met my girlfriend (now wife) and had a renewed sense of wanting to live. I forgot all about the debt and didn’t address it, so fast forward to today and I now have two judgments against me. Without these judgments I was paying off my debt using the snowball method. These judgments threw me off the rails, worried about my wages being garnished, bank account being levied etc etc. I’ve consulted with several attorneys and some have suggested bankruptcy. I keep getting told different answers from each and finally paid a $500 retainer to get the ball rolling. The issue is my anxiety is so bad I don’t trust that this is being done the right way and on top of that it has made me have to stop paying the debts I was current on. I feel hopeless, I am barely eating or sleeping. In the midst of this this has caused a lot of tension in my marriage, and that in turn has made my anxiety even worse. Within this time period as well I was transferred to another store by my job.

I had to take a leave of absence from my job doing surgery because I had panic attacks in the middle of operating. It was bad. I thought there was no way I would ever NOT be on Xanax. 

At my worst I was taking 3mg of Xanax per day. I was drinking myself to death to self medicate on top of that. My life was falling apart. I was depressed and suicidal. 

Eventually I stopped doing surgery altogether. I stopped drinking. I think so much of my issue was depression and surgery now being a trigger for my anxiety. Luckily I was in a position to take a time-out in life. I started taking an antidepressant. Then another. Then another. I finally found one that worked. I now do real estate. It helps me feel a little more freedom and not as trapped as being in surgery wearing a mask, gown, gloves, and not being able to simply walk away for a few moments. 

2 years later and I still don’t drink. I take my antidepressant each day. And I have gone from 3mg of Xanax a day to .25mg of Clonazepam when I need to. Today I sit here (on the toilet) and I haven’t taken anything for anxiety in 9 days. It has been 12 years since I have gone this long without taking anything. 

My point: I went through a period where I thought there was ZERO chance I’d ever be back to a somewhat normal life. That I wouldn’t be taking a ton of anxiety meds. There was no light at the end of the tunnel. I assumed my life was over. Be patient. It’s hard, but try to take things day by day. It does get better.

He begged people not to tell me, but they all told me. When I asked him, he told me he had a girlfriend, and cut off all contact with me. He didn't even want to be social media friends with me. They broke up six weeks later, and literally the day they broke up, he started looking at my social media all the time. Like, literally everyday. And on multiple platforms, too. He knew I was looking at his social media too, and we played this weird little cat and mouse game. But for the better part of a year, it was clear he still had residual feelings for his ex. He would do things like trying to follow her on Twitter, but then unfollowing her when she didn't follow him back. Four years later, he's back. He Dmed me on Instagram and apologized for what he did.

We're dating now, and we only just had our third date. The spark we had picked back up immediately. He's definitely a lot more mature and communicative. However, even though he clearly felt bad about the way things went down, I don't feel pretty enough for him. I don't think I ever will. I know I'm a fairly attractive woman, but I don't feel like he finds me attractive. He's a very good looking guy himself, and people say that I'm prettier than him. But I feel like he's always going to find his ex more attractive. He literally threw me away once. I was so thrilled when I found out he was into me all those years ago, but when he cut things off with me, I would spend my time looking in the mirror and thinking, ""if I were prettier, would he have chosen me?"" Not to mention, while he was stalking my social media, he wasn't over his ex. A part of me feels like, if he really did find me so beautiful, why would he try getting back with her? If they did get back together, would he have left me the way he did the first time? Also keep in mind, he didn't reach out for four years. Not four months. Four years.

Like nothing’s right, my life is going nowhere, I have X and Y and Z on my to-do list that have yet to spend any time on, the list just goes on and on and on.

I take zoloft (have taken Celexa too before), they help for a little while until they don’t.


It’s common for people to experience these at night as there’s no distraction and many other reasons like fatigue, etc
But I’ve had it since I can remember. In middle school, nights were dreadful to me. I HATED having school the next day. School was always freakin scary to me. 
I hated it so much.
Don’t know when it started disappearing for a while, but I’d started going out drinking and talking to people every single night for couple years before last year where I had to stay home and save money.
Last year I also had a horrible break up with a bpd girl (im 24m) that likely contributed to the increased anxiety.

So here is my problem that pretty much has my life turned upside down: MY HEART RATE. That is my only fear. My fear is my fast heart rate not slowing down. I’ve had three different panic attacks that lasted 5-7 hours with a fast heart rate. All three times I had to go to the ER to get help. If it wasn’t for my worry of not being able to bring my heart rate down I WOULD BE FREE 💔💔💔 If only there was something that could fix this I would be okay… the anxiety still exists no matter what but I could live with that. It’s just that one single fear that keeps me away from doing the things I used to do. Traveling, socializing, working out to my full potential :( that is all. I’ve gone to the doctor, ER, & I’ve gotten many tests done and everything always comes back normal.

How did you get back into exercise when your main fear is a heart attack? I recently got my blood work done, and have high cholesterol despite being normal weight, so i have a real need to exercise but am still afraid of the sensations I feel when exerting myself...

I’m incredibly happy when I’m around him, but every time he leaves, I can’t help but feel anxious. He’s the one who broke up with me and for me it was rather really unexpected.

He did also say I have a valve that’s a little smaller that could cause me chest pain from time to time, but that it’s also insignificant( it’s a condition that mostly women experience).

A few months ago, my anxiety suddenly worsened, and I developed emetophobia and my health anxiety shot up in severity. I've been on medication for a few months right now and my dose has been raised twice, but I feel like I'm still incredibly anxious.

At night, I'm scared to sleep because I worry I won't wake up. I have to take some fast-acting medication and distract myself until I fall asleep. I hate it. I worry I'll have a heart issue or unknown condition that will kill me suddenly and I'll have no control over it. I have uncontrollable imaginary images of my family finding my dead body and mourning, and it scares me so much. I'll cry for ages at nighttime over the idea of dying in my sleep and not knowing it.

I was previously depressed, but now that it's begun to lift, I have such great fear and anxiety over death. It makes it hard to function throughout the day, as I worry about dying from performing basic activities. I constantly need reassurance that I'm not dying. When I really try to think about it rationally, I'm not scared of death, and I think it may be peaceful. But I can't do anything and I always get heart palpitations and suddenly think, ""This is it."" My health anxiety amplifies it, and any little symptom suddenly becomes a hidden lethal condition.

I'm terrified to have hobbies, enjoy life, or collect things I like because I'm worried that once I really begin to enjoy life again, death might come for me and I won't be able to love anymore. I hate going places and I feel so guilty when I do make a mistake towards someone because I worry that I'll die and I might never be able to make it up to them. I hate thinking that I could die when I'm not ready. I can't enjoy life because I'm so scared of finally living happily and then losing it.

I want to be able to live my life, but I can't get over the fear of my death. Does anyone know of any books, resources, or methods to help me achieve peace? I don't even need it completely gone, I just need to be able to manage it.

TL,DR: I'm a teenager with anxiety that has recently become severe. I have health anxiety which has morphed into death anxiety and I'm constantly worried that I'm dead/dying. I have panic attacks thinking about my family finding my body. I can't function because I fear my death so much.",1679088391.0

As in, even if it was one sentence i left it halfway and continued on the next line (copying exactly what my teacher wrote) and at the end my teacehr was super confused as to why i did this but i was shaking and couldn't answer. It use to happen all the time for these kinds of small things and this is just an example. I know this is a pretty weird scenario but i hope someone can tell me what kind of anxiety it is.

Results are okay, I need another round of antibiotics but nothing life threathning or dangerous.
That helped out a bit until my left nostril started bleeding,not a lot and briefly but enough to make me panic. Now I am laying in bed and I managed to convince myself that since today went well something must be off,it feels like a blurr.

Nothing has really made much of a different. Lexapro kiiiinda kept my head above water but the name brand stopped being covered.

Now I'm on shitty state insurance because I can't keep a steady full-time job. I also get therapists who can't seem to help and then move to a different office mid-treatment, an office that doesn't take my insurance. Or psychiatrists who do cruddy things like rushing me off meds to try something else and insisting I just ""tough it out"" when things get rough.

I currently have a well-meaning therapist who may or may not know how to help. And a new psychiatrist who suggested adding Buspirone to my Paroxetine (the replacement for Lexapro that I started a number of years ago), instead of trying to change my Paroxetine out for something else.

Adding something *to* my main medication was alluring because if anything goes wrong I'm guessing I can just stop the added medication and balance back out on my main medication.

But yeah.

Just took the first Buspirone. Along with my nightly Paroxetine.

I really hope this works. I really, *really* hope this works. Because nothing else has and I honestly feel like I'm running out of time.

The next day though it came back, at first a dull ache throughout the day, and at night it was an awful sharp pain that lasted for minutes, like someone was poking my heart with a pencil. Again I was like, okay I’m really gonna die this time. Might as well come to terms with it. The sharp pain has been less severe but still consistent all day. I feel like death is coming, I’ve spent all day trying to accept my dying. I feel like I can’t go to the doctors because they didn’t find anything before.

I’ve never posted here but I’m really struggling and I’m not sure what to do. I’ve suffered from anxiety for as long as I can remember, but over the years I’ve become pretty good at managing it. A few years ago there was a mass shooting right down the street from my house. Without going into the details, the incident left me mentally scarred and I struggle trauma issues related to this. Fast forward to this week, we had to fire an employee on Monday because they continuously did drugs at work and they hardly ever showed up, plus he seemed to have gang affiliations. Yesterday he sent some texts to some of us, including me, telling us all to suck a d*** and things like that. But immediately after, he sent a text say “I have murder on my mind” and this completely messed me up. I started freaking out, my heart felt like it was going to beat out of my chest, I felt like my mind was crumbling, I started hyperventilating and crying and I had to leave. The police took a statement from my boss and basically said there was nothing they could do about it. The owner of the company is now saying he’ll hire an armed guard for next week and decided to put me in charge of it even though I told him I’m not mentally in the place to handle this. Still, I pushed through and sent him all of the info and now it is up to him to get the guard. I’m terrified honestly. Even today, the guy who made the threats sent random emoji texts in a group chat and I have no idea why. The guy is clearly deranged and I recently found out he has been arrested over 10 times, usually for domestic violence and things like that. No one at my work is taking this seriously and I’m honestly terrified to go back. I was told whether there is a guard or not, I’m expected to go in Monday as I am “setting a precedence for these types of situations by not being at work”…shouldn’t we not be coming in until the the literal threat of murder is dealt with? Honestly, I’m freaking out and I don’t know what to do. I don’t even know why I’m making this post, I’m just so stressed and I can’t handle it.

250,What Helped Me Break Free,4,11ttgts,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11ttgts/what_helped_me_break_free/,0,"Background, I had my first panic attack when I was 5 years old. From then I had random anxiety attack that increased in frequency into adulthood. It was mostly health anxiety, feeling my heart skip a beat and then having a full on panic attack. I went to multiple cardiologists who insisted I was fine. I went to the ER multiple times only to be discharged and being told I was fine. I began to think it was a healthcare provider conspiracy, maybe there truly was something wrong that they weren’t seeing and I was going to have to die to get my, “I told you so,” moment. 

My anxiety was effecting my job, my (previous) relationship, and worst of all my ability to parent my 1, 2, and then 3 children. One day around 2 years ago, my Uncle, who is a former Army Ranger and Cop sat me down and had an intervention like conversation with me. He told me that he too has anxiety, and that he takes something for it everyday. I never knew this about him. He told me that he could tell my anxiety was having a negative impact on my parenting and that I owed it to myself and my kids to get help. 

I ended up going on a 20MG dose of an anxiety med, daily, which I still take (of course) After a few weeks, the intrusive thoughts just… were no longer there. Also, when I would feel a heart skip, I’d just tell myself ok cool, it’s all good and then… nothing. I couldn’t believe it. I was pretty skeptical of taking a pill and it working but… it did. I also started therapy along with the meds, and just as important, I started Brazilian Jujitsu for exercise and cardio. I also have a non benzo as needed anxiety med if I’m really feeling anxious, and honestly… just having that on me is a big help because I know it’s there. 

I’m a single parent now, and I can and do take my 3 kids places by myself and have a good time. That would’ve been UNTHINKABLE just 2.5 years ago. 

I know there’s no one size fits all for this shit but hopefully this helps someone.

- as needed med in case of panic attack

- routine cardio intensive exercise

Basically I️ have had anxiety since my preteens. It was severe social anxiety from 13-17, then became more general. However, at 31 it has become social again along with the general anxiety. 

I️ have been a fashion model for 12 years. It was my safe space, and as crazy as it sounds being in front of the camera did not ever trigger anxiety for me. In fact it did the opposite, and I️ felt free there. However, one day out of nowhere my anxiety seemed to hit this peak. I️ haven’t ever been medicated besides self administering the supplement L-theanine,  and had added Gaba a month earlier. I️ was on set on camera and a song played that I️ recommended that was funny and embarrassing, but we all were sharing those types of songs. Suddenly I️ get a full blown panic attack. Shaking, can’t even smile for the shot, heart RACING, feeling faint; I️ ran out and put my hand on my mouth to make it seem like I️ was sick. 

When I️ returned I️ made it seem like a stomach issue. “Oh, something from lunch just made me get horrible acid reflux I’m sorry.” I️ fought my way through the last hour battling another panic attack. In all honesty I’m suspicious about the Gaba and haven’t taken it since, but they haven’t stopped. 

Since then I️ can’t be on camera without one coming. My current therapist recommended me to consult a psychiatrist who has given me Propanol and Ativan. I just tried the propanol today and I’m hopeful, because she only gives me 7 every 6 weeks of the Ativan, which works perfectly. Unfortunately she will not give me more Ativan because of my families addiction history. 

It has made me feel so desperate and powerless. I️ had a toxic childhood and I️ feel like it’s come back to haunt me. I️ worked so hard to fight my social anxiety for years and thought I’d largely conquered it. I️ hate that it’s come back and it’s worse than ever. I️ love my job, and now I’m having to fall back on other jobs to get by. I️ booked a lot of things this month and don’t have enough Ativan to get through all of my shoots…and yes, I’ve tried meditation, focusing on other objects and battling them. I work out almost daily, I️  do my best to eat well and to use positive affirmations. This is the first time in my life that it’s been this physical. It is instant, no matter what I️ do right when I️ walk on set. 

Has anyone else had this kind of experience? If so did you overcome it or find something to manage it well? Since it’s my first day trying Propranolol I’m really hoping it helps. No adverse effects so far. But I️ haven’t tested it on the job yet.",1679095295.0

My mind went to that of a rabid bat biting down on it (I've no idea how large bat bite marks are, though I did hear someone might've contracted Nipah virus this way) 

I dropped it immediatey and washed down my hands with the diluted soap at the dinner hall bathroom TWICE, though I felt a droplet of water hit my face in the process (to make matters worse)


I'd already read through in the last online and went through it again an hour after this incident, which only affirmed my fears and made matters worse


Rabies on saliva when exposed to dryness and sunlight dies out within an hour. At room temperature in the absence of sunlight.... It can live for 120+ hours according to a pubmed (I believe that's what the site was called?) paper and various posts online on other surfaces


The bananas would be stored away in a shed from what I assume. They wouldn't be exposed to sunlight right? And the insides of a banana are obviously not dry. If a rabid bat were to bite down on it, the rabies in its saliva would NEVER have died out by then


I'd taken another look at the banana after dinner. I didn't touch it so I couldn't see the other side. The concavity did look like a bite.


I've no idea, as stated before as to how big bat bite marks are. The Internet states they consist on puncture wounds on human skin, but what if the bat chowed down on the banana for a good while? I've seen other pics where they chew through fruits like guava really well so such a pit isn't something I'd put past a bat


I don't even know why this happens to me. I was already on an edge since the last 2 years I'd been at this college owing to the bats that fly around at night and the stray dogs in and around the college. I constantly assess their behavior to see if they're off, a tell tale sign of them being rabid


Much of it is due to my family preventing me from accessing evidence based medical care (as opposed to naturopathy or homeopathy) well up until an year ago. As such, my health anxiety is deeply ingrained into my psych. I've royally screwed up my last few doctor visits, the few that I had

Please, is there any way out of this mess? Am I getting something about this wrong? I'd take any relief, any evidence that contradicts what I've said, that convinces me this wasn't the result of a bat bite, to keep my mind at peace. I haven't had an episode this bad in a good while


Edit : Made before I sent the post. I'd also realized at the time that I'd picked out a spoon from the spoon tray (immersed in lukewarm-warm water usually). People would've picked them with the same hand they used to pick the banana. If the saliva transferred over to the spoon tray and then over to the spoon, I'm fucked. I have cuts all over my mouth due to braces that I'd started wearing 3 months back. 

Saliva could easily enter through my blood via those gaps considering rabies can transmit through saliva coming into contact with gashes and scratches on skin, let alone the musocsal membranes + cuts in my mouth. Yet another reason for my anxiety to ramp up




I'd resorted to asking chatgpt out of desperation. It opts for circular reasoning (given it's an LLM, I don't expect anything better). I'd assumed it being a trove of knowledge from around the Web would know SOMETHING that could contradict what I said. It doesn't address my points,  shoots out responses that are easily countered and which are not addressive of points I've made

I (25f) find it really hard to be myself due to my social anxiety. My anxiety is rooted in the fear of embarrassing myself in front of people by actually being myself, which I believe may also be an issue for most of you. I’m scared of being myself because of these “quirks” that I have. I’ll try to explain it as best as I can.

So, my brother describes me as an “overly expressive” person, which I believe was supposed to sound like a good thing. What he means by this is that I make very accentuated facial expressions when reacting to certain things, some of which I’m not even aware of until he reenacts them to me. And he bursts out laughing whenever he does it. He does this with expressions I make when I’m mad, scared, or surprised. I know that he might just find this funny and amusing and mean no harm, but I do get offended sometimes.

He’s not the first person to point these things out. People constantly mention how fast I blink and how much my hands shake (due to my generalized anxiety disorder, yes I have been diagnosed) and it hurts me. As you can probably tell, I’m a very sensitive person. What bothers me most is that these are constant reminders of how “weird” I can be in social situations. Two events I remember clearly are:

– I was at a movie with a couple of friends. I got really “into” the movie, to the point I had my mouth agape. I didn’t realize I was doing it, until my friends started commenting on it and laughing and mimicking what I was doing.

– During a social gathering, I was part of a conversation which I was super absorbed in. While I listened to the other people talk, I started being “expressive” again while in my element, until I looked at my Instagram stories and realized a group of friends (the same I was at the movies with) had recorded me and posted me on their stories. They probably found it funny or something. I asked them to delete it, and they did.

I try to brush this off and justify it with the fact that I may be overly sensitive after all. But this worsens my social anxiety to the point where I’m hypervigilant about myself in public. And, as you know, this just makes me more anxious and self-conscious. I’m scared to meet new people. But what hurts me the most is the fact that, if I do let go of the self-consciousness and “accept” myself, I’ll be 10x weirder. I don’t want to be known or remembered as a weird person.

Yes, there’s a disconnect between who I am and who I wish I were. Yes, I know I should be unapologetically myself and authentic and all that, but I’m scared. I don’t feel like a normal person. It’s hard to feel like a normal person when people laugh at you when you’re being yourself.

As I write this, one of my friends just texted me asking if we can go out for my birthday tonight. I don’t know her in person and I’ve been putting off irl meetings because of this very issue. I’m scared that she’ll just be another person who finds me weird or points out another quirk I didn’t know I had.

I wish I was confident and sure of myself. I wish I could talk to people normally and not be afraid of being who I am. And yes, there are worse things to worry about, like my dad says, but this is honestly breaking me and ruining my social life. I’d appreciate it if any of you could give me any advice. Any words. Anything. Should I just say fuck it? And if yes, how?",1679063733.0

It seems to me to be fast acting: I'll start to feel tense and worried and then I'll remember to take my pill and next thing I know I'm feeling better.

However, the literature for Buspirone suggests that it is a slow acting drug that you need to build up in your body over 2-4 weeks, similar to an SSRI. If that's the case, why do you need to take it 3x a day? My psychiatrist seems to disagree with this fact: when I asked him the same question, he said you take it 3x a day because it only lasts a few hours. And if you Google ""is buspirone fast acting?"" you will find plenty of sites that say the same: it's a fast(ish) acting drug taken on an as-needed basis.

I’ve been dealing with a breakup recently and it’s been the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I F18 currently in my last year of college in the same classes as said ex M18. Things were bad at first after the initial breakup. He is very manipulative, and nasty in his ways and the whole time we have been broken up he has proven that time and time again. I was insanely stressed throughout, I had to take time off college because I was physically ill with stress, vomiting, diarrhoea, heart palpitations. It was like a constant panic attack for weeks. Things started to settle, things became civil and he started being nice and speaking to me again. Throughout this whole breakup I was adamant I didn’t want drama, I was happy to be civil/friends. All I ever asked of him was to refrain from talking about his new relations with other girls- I assumed he would have the respect to do that just like I did for him. Needless to say that didn’t last long and he began making comments insinuating things. It obviously bothered me but there was nothing I could really say. I have had my best friend of years with me throughout this, weve known eachother since we were in year 7. I couldn’t be more grateful, she’s had my back through everything. We started getting close with another girl in our class, she’s a bit older than us and we never really spoke before this. I had always been quite wary of him being around her when we were together, I always assumed it was my insecurities. She’s blonde, slim, pretty, drives. And I never trusted it. But anyway, we started getting close, she invited me and my best friend to her house we stayed the night, got some food and then went shopping the next day. This was about 3 weeks ago?? Then on Tuesday, I was stood at the bus stop with my best friend talking about how I feel like something was going on with her and him. I’d had a feeling since the breakup tbh. I had told people this and EVERYONE told me I was just being paranoid and she wouldn’t do that to me. And some other girl in the class chimes in and says he has been telling the whole class but me and my bsf that he has been involved with her and they’d slept together. My heart SANK. Stood at the bus stop having a full on mental breakdown. I knew, I knew I wasn’t crazy. Even thought it hasn’t come from the horses mouth I believed her. I was ready to go in guns blazing on the pair of them, especially her. She sat there and watched me cry over him. She sat there and told me need to leave him and that I deserved better. She BAREFACED lied to me for weeks. And so did he. Literally days before this he has spoke to me and said he still cared about me, he doesn’t have it in him to be a cunt to me, I’m not an easy person to get over, he messed with my head for what? My bsf took my phone and told me she’d see what was going on first. She rang her and put it on speaker, and as soon as she opened her mouth I knew she was lying. Now me personally, if someone rang me saying that I’m being accused of sleeping with my friends ex and the whole class knows, I’d be livid. She was calm as a cucumber, like she knew it was coming. My bsf asked her outright and she said “whatttt… nooo…I wouldn’t do that…I’ll ring him”. She denied it to my face. I’ve been nothing but respectful to him. I don’t know what I did to deserve this. A few weeks after we broke up I ended up sleeping with one of my old friends with benefits, more convenience than anything and tbh I didn’t even want to I just felt like this was what I needed. I was wrong I felt 10x worse than I did originally, I told this girl and she cheered me on anyway. She has now told him and he’s saying stuff about my body count and telling everyone. Why is that anything to do with him? And you were the cunt and now you want to air my business to everyone just because I don’t wanna speak to you? The stress is something I’ve never felt. I don’t know why, everything he’s done everything she’s done. I just don’t understand why. I want someone to tell me what to do, what is wrong with me. Why can’t I just move on like he has? Why am I sat here killing myself with stress while he acts like I never even happened? I feel like there’s something wrong with me. It’s not normal to feel like this for so long and nothing to work. I know everything people are saying is true, my head knows that. My body just won’t let it go, I’m worried about my weight. I’m at a good place with it now, i just genuinely can’t eat. My stomach is too tight, I’m too anxious. I’ve only got a few months left I’m just not sure if I can do it. I’m sick of being treated like this, I haven’t said a single word to him, even when he’s been saying stuff to me. I don’t wanna lower myself to that. I don’t even care about them sleeping together anymore I just want to be left alone, I don’t bother you so why do you go out of your way to be nasty to me. I just need someone to tell me what to do. How do I stop this feeling. It’s consuming, it’s affecting my health now and that’s what’s worrying me. I could probably deal with the  anxiety but not this intense, not the no eating or sleeping, and not the feeling like my heart is going to give in.",1679082355.0
283,Went to the ER last night and the ER doctor suggested anxiety is the cause of my symptoms. I have some questions to see how people have dealt with symptoms,2,11tv36d,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11tv36d/went_to_the_er_last_night_and_the_er_doctor/,4,"Hello all,

So, I have been experiencing these symptoms for a few weeks now and the ER doctor ran metabolic panels and what not and said there is no medical reason for these symptoms and that I'm probably experiencing some anxiety:

* Eyes feel strained/twitching for weeks. 
* Muscle spasms in my legs and triceps kind of like tremors but not like cramps. 
* I can feel my pulse through my body, but my blood pressure is unaffected, but my heart rate may go up.
* I'm constantly hungry, not like a craving hungry but like my body has been physically busy and needs fuel.
* My body feels like it is in a very low level of fight or flight with shakiness but I'm still in control and I haven't lost strength as I lift weights daily and there has been no impact there. 

I kind of realized a couple months ago that I was experiencing a lot of stress and wasn't sleeping a lot due to a lot of things at once, medical concern that resolved itself, everyone getting laid off, taking pay cuts, general mid-life crisis things I suppose. I felt like I was mentally over it but then talking to the ER doctor a bit I may not be. For instance, I didn't realize it but I couldn't tell you any details about any shows I've watched or video games I've played because my mind is always thinking about our bills in the house and getting out of debt. 

My biggest thing was telling the doctor if I'm distracted, I don't feel the twitches or eye strain, only when I'm sitting back down and being still, un-distracted. 

Are the symptoms I'm feeling typical of those who have felt anxiety? How did you work your way around it? I think it is difficult for me right now because I'm not fully realizing what's going on or addressing it properly, but I'd like for it to physically stop.",1679068604.0

I quit alcohol 9 weeks ago and I have been in a big spiral the last 4 or 5 weeks. The early mornings have been the worse. I wake up in a full adrenaline rush out of a dead sleep. Doc put me on Hydroxyzine which recently has helped. But this morning I woke up at 5am and could feel the adrenaline spike but it didn't send me into a full blown attack.  I've heard magnesium can help balance this? Any one have experiences to share? I bought magnesium citrate calm powder yesterday to try.

I just started a new treatment trajectory after receiving my new diagnosis: panic disorder with agoraphobia. I like my therapist and I trust her. She is having me do all kinds of exercises at home that fall under the umbrella of IE. I‘ve been doing the exercises now for a little over two weeks, and I find I am getting more and more annoyed at them. They are supposed to mimic the feelings I have right before a panic attack and since I‘m doing them at home, in a safe environment and only for a short time, they are supposed to help me get used to the feeling and teach my brain that the sensation will stop at some point. For those of you who have tried this technique, did it work for you? How long were you busy using this technique? Would you recommend it? Did it have any negative effects on you? After your treatment, were you „cured“ of having panic attacks? 

I‘m mainly just looking to talk about it with someone who has done it or is doing it right now, to exchange our experiences.

I get incredibly anxious, and shaky, and I don’t feel safe or confident being a driver or a passenger. Advice? 


I’ve been a passenger in multiple car accidents through out my life. It took me a long time to even get my permit (age 18) and even longer to pass my license test after 3 tries (age  22). I failed my license test multiple times due to panic attacks mid test. Well, I had gotten my license in April 2021. Everything was great, I didn’t need help with transportation anymore! I no longer felt like a burden. Then in October of 2022 I got in my first accident where I was the driver, and my car was totaled. Unfortunately I was at fault. I was at a stop sign and I guess the driver behind me thought I sat for too long and blared their horn at me nonstop until I panicked and hit the gas (loud sounds are a bit triggering and bad sensory for me). I suffered a lot of emotional trauma. Since then I’ve nearly been run off the road 2 times and I’ve had a front row seat to witnessing 3 other car accidents directly in front of me. The most recent being yesterday March 16th around 5pm, 2 cars collided in front of me and came about a foot away from slamming into my car as well. I’m struggling horribly to feel safe and confident when driving, or even just as a passenger. Due to this anxiety I’m the most annoying “back seat driver” and it irritates my husband but he understands. I constantly point out that the light is red, I tell him “you should be in that lane instead”, I get super upset and scared when someone tailgates, honks, recklessly speeds, weaves in/out of traffic, or flashes their headlights at me, I gasp/jump/cringe if I don’t think he’s slowing the car down fast enough when approaching a stop, I get really anxious in heavy traffic, around road work, and unfamiliar areas. It’s often bad enough that I will use google street view to map out exactly what my route looks like, and what the parking situation looks like so I can try to avoid a panic attack (I usually have a panic attack anyways). Also, ever since totaling my car, whenever I hear a car horn or loud sounds while in a car I get vivid flashbacks and an instant headache. I am afraid I will ruin or lose all the progress I’ve made with driving. Tips/advice/coping mechanisms are needed and appreciated, would also like to hear that someone else understands how I feel.",1679072507.0

I'm   a 19 year old male from Serbia and I've been experiencing panic  attacks  or anxiety attacks when trying to sleep in bed for the past few  days.  I've been awake for three days now and I'm really struggling to  sleep.

Every  time I try to lie  down in bed, my whole body starts feeling weird,  my  heart races, and  the left side of my body feels numb. It's like I'm   experiencing  pressure or cramps, and it's hard to move my left arm and  leg. I also   feel tingling in my left side of the body. It gets very  hard to breathe  while  falling asleep; I feel like the bed is moving or  that I'm  falling down  in some rare cases, but I quickly panic and wake  up by  the influx of  energy every time. I start shivering, but it feels  very  hot in the bed  all of a sudden. The usual way for me to stop  this  is  to play video games with my boyfriend and talk to him or to  listen  to  music, but it's hard to get rid of the symptoms after trying  to lie   down and sleep in my bed, as they persist even after I leave my bed, but   they usually start to slowly fade away.

I've   tried meditation and relaxation techniques, but they don't seem to be   working. I feel like I'm half awake and half asleep, and it's really   affecting my mental and physical health.

I  have also been monitoring my blood pressure, The last time I checked  after a panic/anxiety attack, it was 168/85, which is concerning for  someone my age. I have been feeling a tingling sensation in my heart and  chest, and I am worried that these symptoms are related to my high  blood pressure. I am not sure if my panic attacks and anxiety are  causing my blood pressure to rise, or if there is an underlying medical  condition that I am not aware of. I would appreciate any advice or  insight on how to manage my symptoms and potentially lower my blood  pressure.

I've already been to the  hospital and had several tests done, including an EKG, a blood test,  and an ultrasound of my heart and abdomen. However, all the tests came  back normal, and the doctors couldn't find any underlying medical  conditions that could explain my symptoms. They suggested that it could  be related to anxiety or panic attacks, but I'm still not sure. I just  want to find a solution and be able to sleep peacefully without  experiencing these scary sensations.

In  addition to my panic attacks and anxiety, I also experience symptoms  that suggest I may have ADHD or OCD or something else. I have most of  the symptoms of those. I have never been tested for ADHD, but I believe I  might have it. It's also worth noting that I have anxiety almost always  or very often but it's usually mild. I feel like I'm trapped in my own  head and can't get rid of the racing thoughts. I'm starting to wonder if  I have an anxiety disorder that needs to be addressed.

I'm   reaching out to this community because I'm hoping someone can provide   some advice or support. I don't know what to do, and I'm really scared.   I've never experienced anything like this before.

I graduated from   UNI in january of 2022. I still seem to struggle to find a permanent job. I have been working some months, but not the whole time. 
I know I sound like a nagging manchild, 
I feel like I am to damaged of materials, loser and a dissapointment to my family and friend. 
I cannot live life like this (what life is this?) but I also do not know how to break this bad cicle. I just put blame everywhere else and I don't seem to do better, I just fall in the same loophole again. 

I got a new job three weeks ago, but I don't seem to feel comtable with that particular working place, its customers, managment and coworkers. Maybe I just do not like my profession, or maybe I do. I feel kind of split right now, and I really am thinking about thoughts like if life is really worth it all. I called out sick the past two days and I just cannot stop thinking about this. 

I still live at home and struggle with loneliness. If I can not hold a job and later buy an own home what worth do I have? Will I find a loved one, travel and live a happy life? I can not see my self happy living life solo, I did that and hated it. 

I still live at home and I can see that my family is starting to give up on me and I do not know why I panic, this is my own wrongdoing and I am a loser. 
I lose time and youth and I am a burden on my closest family and one friend I have sticking around since high school. Please don't see this as me feeling sorry for myself. I just have to vent and I cannot even be in my own skin right now. I feel alienated from society like I don't have loved one to talk about my deepest fears right now. I want to experience lifes both good and bad.

I probably should sort out that I got a mild aspergers diagnosis in my early 20s. I went my whole life with this being unnoticed. I did struggle with social interactions and cues but they are not as a big of a problem now. I can speak to people (both new and old) without problem. But I see that my anxiety about other stuff in life makes me look reserved uinterested and confused when I interact with people, such as now. 
I think what is a typical behaviour in me is that I HATE new routines and sudden changes. I do not deal with stress well, which I should work with now as I did with my social issues before.",1679052044.0

The problem is, I'm starting a new job this Monday, and I need to be fit enough to get there and not have panic attacks on site. I'm obviously terrified, since I've never been able to hold down a job, and I had been looking for a few months, so I really need to do it right this time.

I'm thinking of seeing a psychiatrist again after two years, but I don't exactly trust them with their understanding of doses and meds, mainly because my organism being hypersensitive to side effects is something they never take into account. Which is why I'm taking to Reddit here. In my country, oftentimes you can go to a psychiatrist and tell them point blank which medication you need and they'll prescribe it to you, and I believe this to be the better option than going in blind and risking a lot in terms of physical health.

My ideal (and I mean ideal) anxiety medication would be :

\- something that I could take during the day to calm anxiety attacks when I feel them rising, but that wouldn't make me drop dead and lose the little energy I have (and yes I had tried tiny doses of previous medications, I fall asleep extremely easily on these meds)

AND/OR

\- something that I could take in the evening, which would help me fall asleep TO A REASONABLE EXTENT, because last time I was on meds to sleep they would make me sleep 12 hours a night which is wildly incompatible with a 9 to 5.

Are there any names you can think of ? Ideally with the least side effects, especially since I am very much devoid of energy a lot of the time and I can't afford to lose what little I have.

TL;DR : Going to go to a psychiatrist to get anxiety medications prescribed, I don't trust them to believe my body is hypersensitive to side effects, looking for a name of the tamest thing out there to go into the appointment asking for that.",1679065583.0

I’ll try to keep this short, but for the last few months I’ve been sinking into a very deep depression again. It’s getting to the point where I don’t want to socialize because I feel like I’m a bother to everyone and I’m better off not there at all. I feel like friends keep me around out of a courtesy, but probably plan things without me when they can. 

I have high functioning anxiety and depression, so it’s not impacting my ability to work (hopefully never will). I’ve been with my partner for 3 years and he is very supportive, though we’ve had a breach in trust a couple times and makes me wary to fully trust.

I’ve stopped initiating hangouts and conversations with people because I wanted to see if they would reach out to me first (I’m usually the first). Well, that has only shown me that nobody ever engages with me.. its really making me feel annoying, bothersome, weird, unwanted, etc.

Lately I’m feeling like I’m not worth having around at all, and it’s scaring me. I wouldn’t end my life, but it worries me when I feel such intense hatred/shame about myself. I used to be so social and outgoing, now I keep to myself because I think I probably bother people. 

I don’t have many friends who have similar interests or hobbies, so it was always tough hanging out and feeling “fulfilled” in that respect. I know a handful of people who have one hobby in common with me and we all know each other, but again, I feel like I’m a loser or weirdo to them.

I’m a 26M and about 2.5 ago I was sitting at work after working 23 days in a row of night shift (not my normal schedule) and my heart was beating very fast and I felt like I was going to die. Confused, face went white just didn’t know what was happening. They called the fire department and I had a very high blood pressure but was released and went home. That seems to be my kicking off point. 

Ever since that night I have had this intense fear that I’m going to die. I began having headaches every day that I can only get brief relief from, random aches and pains in my arms and legs. Waves of adrenaline paired with that flushing feeling over your body regularly through the day. When I get a weird symptom I start to worry that this is very serious and start looking into what it could be. I know this is a bad move and have been trying to avoid it. 

I went to my doctor and they ran some blood tests. I have pretty bad cholesterol that I need to work on and a slightly elevated liver enzyme but nothing else was abnormal. 

My blood pressure fluctuates from a normal range 120/80’s to as high as 167/103 I measured tonight. 

Fast forward to todays ago and I was at home, felt my heart pounding and had some pain in my chest and arm that was coming and going. I was convinced I was having a heart attack. I went to the ER and no heart attack. Blood pressure was super high when I got there and was totally fine when I left. Good news. 

Yesterday we found out that that our baby stopped growing at 8 weeks and there was no heart beat so we have to plan to get it removed. My wife has been a mess for obvious reasons so I have been trying to be as supportive as I can be through this process and also try and deal with all of this which I’m not handling well and need to deal with so I can be there for her. 

Tonight I began another headache at the base of my skull on the left side that was intense. Waves of pain shooting through my head and neck. Worked myself up into thinking it was a stroke thanks to ole google. Heart rate and blood pressure were very high but haven’t had a full panic attack. 

Currently laying in bed scared to go to sleep and have been hoping it gets better so I don’t convince myself to go to the ER again. I have a follow up with my primary next week and haven’t officially been diagnosed with anxiety or anything. I don’t really want to be on medication if it can be avoided I just want these pains and constant panic/stress to go away so I can work and go back to normal.

So I’ve been out of full time work for coming up on 5 years now. In these 5 years I’ve attempted 4 different times to hold down full time jobs that I applied for and was hired for and failed at all of them. I believe 3 weeks was the longest I made it at any of the 4 before I had to quit or was fired for missing days due to panic attacks and all the rest exc.

I had my monthly facetime checkup with my psych aprn who scripts my meds the other day and told him how horrible I’m doing (I’m currently in therapy again as well have been for 4 months trying IFS therapy) and he said he thinks I should def apply that the attempts at working look good in my favor exc. 

It’s just based on everything I’ve researched and heard even ppl with great documentation and severe illnesses exc get denied and somes appeals even eventually get denied as well. I also worry that since I’ve gone though so many therapists I only have one long term mental health professional I’ve been with and that’s him…this aprn I see who does my meds and I’ve been seeing for 8-9 years now. 

I mean maybe that’s good enuff since he can provide all the diagnoses and records of the million meds I’ve tried exc. I guess I can list out all the shrinks I’ve seen including my current one altho as far as them being able to actually talk to them if that’s even needed idk I mean some of them are from way back. 

I’ve been diagnosed with Gad, SAD, cptsd, panic disorder, non specific depressive disorder and ocd so uhh ywah  I’m pretty Fkn bat shit lol and I’m def disabled I mean I’ve tried to work I want to work I don’t want a hand out but I’m desperate now. Savings are dwindling and while my older sister helps me out here and there knowing my situation with 100 bucks here 100 there which I feel so pathetic about but am grateful for but it’s just not enuff.

I don’t wanna be on disability forever but idk at the age of 33 after everything I’ve tried for so many goddamn years now I think I may be fooling myself holding on to any illusion of hope for a future for myself, and that includes ever being able to work a job again of any kind. I couldn’t even Fkn do a work from home job I was having panic attacks from being so overwhelmed logging on to my laptop in my own fucking living room for Christ sake.

Anyway I guess you didn’t need the whole life story sorry so basically just wondering if anybody here who is familar w the system or who has applied and been accepted or denied or whatever knows if it’s worth a shot. 

I know I said I’m a desperate so it would seem like duhhh of course irs worth it but at the same time I am so fucking exhausted mentally n physically 24/7 and have such little to nonexistent will and energy to do anything that I would feel like such a Fkn jerkoff if went through with all the paperwork and the gettint a lawyer possibly and the auto denial they basically do to everyone and then the hearing before a judge and just the massive headaches I know would lie ahead 

Tl;dr: familar with applying for mental health disability? With the system in general or you personally applied and we’re accepted or denied know if irs worth it or it’s rly just really low chance of approval even w a lawyer and good paperwork and diagnoses and doctors backing me up exc…

I need you advise really... i am 35 year old male, I always think that I have a health problem, it started like 13 years ago, when I was diagnosed with migraine, I thought I had a tumor in my brain, the dr. Assured me it's a migraine, but I went into a state of anxiety for months, starting to have the same symptoms as the brain tumor, went to the same Dr. Many times, until the point that he told me, you have a mental illness, I am going to order an MRI for you, just to assure you, and to stop seeing you again, so I did it, it was normal as expected, and so everything was fine again, even my migraine had gone. 

I married a wonderful woman who is a GP, and had a beautiful  baby boy, everything  was fine for me, until almost a year ago, I had a sever case of covid, so my wife told me let's run a full blood test on you, so I did, everything was fine except my liver function tests, they came up Slightly elevated, went to a GI dr, and he told me that it was because of Covid, but nonetheless, I am going to run some scans and extra blood tests, it came back fine, but here is the click, I didn't go back to normal since that incident, maybe my body did, but my mind didn't, I was in constant fear that my liver is having some kind of problem, and i actually started having pain  in that area... against my wife advise I went to another GI after several months, who ran, many lab test on me including scans. all came back normal, and he told me it's an IBS pain, didn't believe him, went to another GI the most expensive one in town, who ran more tests (blood, stool, scans), and came back to the same conclusion its an IBS, so since my liver is ok, i moved to another thought, i might have colon cancer, so that other day i told my wife who i might remind you is a Dr. Herself  that according to the internet,  i might have a colon cancer, she is not even speaking to me anymore, and told me that i am not the same man she used to know... I am spending so much money, time, thought and quality of life on this, I am not the man I used to be, I am measuring my weight every day for God sake, looking at my stool like a wierd fuck to see if anything abnormal is happening..

Just back to back to back horrible news and I'm holding on for dear life for no reason other than I don't want to hurt people and I've never really struggled with those dark thoughts before, not really. It's been a really really rough handful of years, I have 2 chronic conditions that give me constant headaches one of them being constant migraine. I can't find any relief whatsoever. I've been moved from neurologist to neurologist and no one could help me and they all gave up on me, that of course was over months and months and for a few of the neurologists it was years of coming to appointments just to be sent away again in the end and referred elsewhere. I can't work or anything so I'm just trying to cope and survive. Right now actually I'm doing ""homework"" type stuff for my new neurologist. I learned last month that my illness and pain is passed the point of medication right now and the plan right now is for me to study and read and have my neurologist be my cohort and try to figure it out together. I was actually trying to do my homework and take charge even though that news was really painful to learn and the last chapter I listened to before I broke down it said ""one patient took 12 years to feel better and to get relief"" and that made me feel so beyond hopeless and like what was even the point in trying anymore? I also suffer from anxiety issues. They've been slowly getting worse when I've been under more and more pressure and it's been hard to feel okay. I have a psychiatrist that took months for me to get into but she only deals with medicine and hasn't been helpful to me with my anxiety unfortunately. I didn't know that she was a psychiatrist until I actually met her of course but I've been doing all that I can with the medicine given and it's not helping very much I don't think. I'm terrified of getting addicted to xanax so even though atm I'm in a constant feeling of intense and overwhelming anxiety I'm too scared to take it because I don't want to abuse what I've been given. I've been having nightmares and intense dreams every single night for 6 months now. I dread going to sleep every night and I'm already dreading it tonight. I have a permanent ball of anxiety and hurt in my chest and stomach lately. This is embarrassing to mention and seemingly random but important and I hate that this happened to me but my house ended up getting  bed bugs. My boyfriend was grossed out and refused to see me and we had an extremely strained relationship for the last month and a half of our relationship. He wouldn't compromise at all and he wouldn't even try to talk to me on the phone. It was excuses after excuses. He broke up with me this Saturday. At first he said he needed to work on himself and needed to grow and needed to do it alone and his mental health wasn't good at all. I begged and begged and embarrassed myself trying to fix it and make everything okay. It didn't work. I was devastated and sick and have been since then. I made a horrible awful mistake and messaged him Tuesday night because I had an intense vivid dream mixed in the middle of the nightmares where we were able to fix our relationship and when I woke up that day it really messed with my head. I messaged him and what he said broke me in half and threw me on the floor. He told me he might actually be gay. The whole time we were dating I knew he was bisexual and I'm not straight either so it never ever bothered me and I tried to be supportive. Him saying that really has made me feel sick. I have issues and trauma around things not being real with people and not being able to trust that people tell me the truth and being lied to and me loving someone while they felt like I was just there and he knew that. I feel way pushed past my limit. My brain has been repeating that phrase from his text over and over and over again, I'm so exhausted from crying and trying to not think of it. Every thought is about that and it makes it hard to breathe every single time. I have extreme trust issues and I try really hard but things like this keep happening over and over again and I sometimes think my brain is broken or wired stupid because these things are so traumatic and life altering to me ig because I'm so sensitive. After days of questioning my reality and handling yet another instance of me loving someone who didn't love me or care about me I'm at least comforted by the knowledge that I don't think he wasn't physically attracted to me during our relationship. He was very sexually forward and liked my feminine features and when I wore skirts and when I wore lipstick and eyeliner and he'd get really turned on when we were just cuddling on the couch together very innocently or when I would run my nails across him anywhere. I'm not sure why that part mattered to me as much as it does but he was a big deal in helping me be able to be intimate with someone so the knowledge that it was all fake almost legitamately killed me. I think he is confused and tired of dealing with people who have a lot of feelings and he himself struggles with apathy and numbness so he thinks dating strictly boys will be the answer. He never dated any guys, only girls and I have a feeling he panicked at the thought of never getting that experience and bailed on me. I'm not at all okay right now and I cannot see the light. I don't really actually want to die, I just want things to be okay and maybe even great one day and right now I cannot imagine one scenario where that's ever ever going to happen for me. I have so many things going on that are out of my control and I'm struggling to breathe. I'm sorry if this is messy and all over the place hehehe that is my state right now. I moved back in with my parents for the time being and I emailed a therapist and I'm trying to set therapy up but I physically feel like I'm dying inside I'm in such emotional and mental pain. I'm hurting more than I thought was ever possible. Please if anyone has anything nice or uplifting to say or any advice I'd gladly appreciate it.

&#x200B;

Alright this is gonna sound very weird, but for the past 2 or 3 weeks I have started experiencing what \*sounds\* like a voice or whisper, but very quiet and \*\*very\*\* short-lasting. It's not at all throughout the day - again it's very, very short instances - and I don't even think its been happening daily, it happens at random times. At first it was just a little weird but I figured it was probably just in my head and ignored it, however it recently has started to scare me when it happens, hence the reason for this post lol.

&#x200B;

I think the first time it actually scared me was when I went grocery shopping last week. I thought I heard it very quietly, but then, unlike the other times, it was like I \*kept\* hearing it for like, 3-5 seconds. Yeah, I know that's not a lot of time, but its creepy as hell and like I said, prior to this it would be super quick moments that I was able to convince myself I didn't hear, mostly because they were so fast. This instance actually scared me, like gave me chills and made me get very anxious in the store until it stopped.

&#x200B;

And like, recently its almost like I can sort of hear the whispering morph into my name being whispered. The problem is, its usually very quick and quiet so its super difficult to tell. That being said, rn its very late so no one's up besides me and it happened again, but this time it really sounded more like my name than any other time I've heard it. It was like a voice whispered my name.... Again it really scared me, however at the moment of writing this I'm pretty much chill now, so I'm not like terrified by it.

&#x200B;

Now here's the thing, I can't tell if I'm really hearing stuff or if it could just be my body misinterpreting noises from the environment, you know? It's usually very quiet and quick, so it is hard to tell. I still think it could / probably is just in my head, but because of how it's been happening out of no where for the past 2-3 weeks and seems to be getting somewhat more distinct, I am a bit anxious about it.

&#x200B;

Oh and there's something else but I doubt its relevant. For the past year or year and a half, I've been getting instances where it feels like bugs are crawling on some part of my body, usually at night. I actually feel it on my legs now, on my upper right thigh. When this happens I try to convince myself it's just my body playing tricks on me, or that it's simply my hairs rubbing against something, but it \*\*genuinly\*\* feels like small bugs crawling on me, so I do sometimes have to check bc it just feels too real and I need to be sure.

&#x200B;

If it matters, I am 21 years old and a guy. I do have anxiety issues/ some other struggles with my mental health, and about 2 weeks ago I started my switch from Zoloft onto Viibryd. Not only that, but because I've known for a long time that my dad sees things that aren't really there (shadows, angels, ghosts, etc.),  I have already had some anxiety for a while about \*seeing\* stuff like he does when I get older, because \*that\* sounds terrifying; a year ago he was telling me how he had a hard time sleeping one night bc shadows were walking around his bed. Aside from this info he shared, I've only heard him tell me about him seeing stuff during the day so it's not like he just dreams this stuff.

&#x200B;

I \*\*seriously\*\* think it might just be my body playing tricks on me. Like, idk maybe I'm hearing quiet noises and for some reason my brain has started to interpret them as a voice? If this \*is\* the case, I imagine that being anxious about it will just make my brain \*more\* likely to interpret these noises incorrectly.

&#x200B;

Can I have some advice? Would you just try your hardest to ignore it when it happens or would you try to listen intently?",1679045134.0

It's my very first job, and I've had little to no prior work experience so of course I didn't expect it to all be perfect. But it's only been 3 weeks since I started and everything seems like it's just gonna keep going downhill. The workload is not too bad; I mostly just have 3-4 classes a day, some days even lesser, and I have no classes on Fridays which gives me time to do planning. My colleagues are great, super helpful and super welcoming. 

The only issue is the students. They're super rowdy, often very rude to me and other teachers, and they don't listen to instructions like when I ask them to complete tasks etc. The worst is that they're super noisy and disruptive in clsss, and almost never sit still, even when asked multiple times. Now they're around 11-14, and of course I understand kids that age just aren't fully matured yet and will act out. But it's been really taking a toll on my health in the past 3 weeks; their sudden outbursts give me panic attacks cause I can never anticipate them, and the noise and movement in class gets me so overwhelmed and overstimulated I just blank out. 

I've tried asking my colleagues how they handle the issue, but it hasn't been much of a help. From what I found out, most of the other teachers just ignore them or have an unimaginable amount of patience with them. I've tried warning the students with consequences, detention, exclusion from certain class activities etc, promise of rewards if they behave, but the thing is I feel like the kids just do not care. They don't care if I send them to the reflection room, or threaten them with telling their parents, or try to talk it out with them. 

Over the past 3 weeks I've had a panic attack/nervous breakdown nearly everyday, and it's been exhausting. I'm worried if I keep this up, my health will get worse, and speaking from experience, it could land me in the hospital, which is not what I want. I've brought this issue over to admin, but they say they can't do much for now either. I love teaching, I love education, but I'm so afraid and sad to face the reality that maybe it's not for me.

Despite this, I was able to graduate college in August of 2022 and secure a job in October of 2022. Due to my anxiety, I opted for a remote job. 

Despite being a remote job, I even get intense anxiety before and during virtual meetings. My job is now transitioning to a hybrid schedule, meaning I would have to go to the office often. This is extremely overwhelming to me. I still have a hard time just managing to go to the grocery store so I can’t imagine going to an office work environment. 

I just feel like I need time for self care and that I shouldn’t be working at all until I get my anxiety to a manageable level as it does impair my abilities at times (my brain fog and tension headaches are terrible, aside from the constant panicked feeling and nausea). 

My biggest concern and why I rushed into getting a job so quickly is feeling like a failure or that I am letting my family down. I also worry about finding another job in the future, my coworkers hating me, not having a good reference, or just never getting better mentally. 

I really feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. Should I suck it up and force myself to be uncomfortable or take time to heal and prepare better for the future?",1679023722.0

So anyways, whenever I bring my toddler into his class and the educator is standing there greeting them, my son will run behind me and hide. He refuses to go into the room and will start the have a meltdown if I do anything to try and encourage him. He’ll stiffen up and cling to me for dear life. If his brother is with him, he will walk right in no problem, but won’t even make contact with the educator.

Ever since I started going to college I’ve been feeling massive anxiety at one point or another. At first it was just minor thoughts about homework or classes that sort of just went away, but ever since I had a major panic attack at my old job in front of many others, I’ve been fearing for myself and my health for a while. 

Anxiety attacks have been hitting me hard this school semester especially. I’m an art major and I think I picked the worst selection of classes to get through this semester, in just the first few weeks I was tasked with drawing insane amounts of thumbnails for assignments as well as a 20 page essay before midterms. The grind hasn’t really stopped.

I’m on spring break currently and visiting my parents and it’s given me a bit of solace and comfort seeing them again (as well as my cat, haha.) but even then, it’s been hard to destress even when I’m in a space I find the most safe from life outside my hometown. I almost had a panic attack just from simply sitting down and eating with my family.

I used to be such a fearless person… I used to be in plays, I did one-act, I’ve spoken in front of large audiences at certain events, all without thinking of the worst possible outcome. I don’t know when I started to over-catastrophize every little thing I do now, but dang man, it’s taken a bit of a toll on me. My heart area kinda hurts a little bit now. The only times I don’t feel anxiety or feel panic attacks about to occur is when I’m hanging with friends at college, putting myself out there when I can because I think it helps. But even then, I sort of forget the people who have my back and end up singling myself out and catastrophizing when I have panic attacks in class or when I’m alone.

I’ve tried a lot of things. I’ve taken meds before, but none seemed to really do the trick. Hydroxyzine made me sleepy, fluoxetine made me want to do absolutely nothing, and Zoloft kept me up all freaking night with zero sleep (I started taking it around midterms, probably the worst time) so I called my doctor and quit it after just 4 days. I’ve tried the breathing exercises and rationalizing, they work at the moment of the attack but it sucks having to do them repeatedly whenever something comes on. I’ve tried journaling my thoughts, but it’s just not working all that well. I wish I could just go back to being the person I used to be, free of intrusive thoughts and the burden of panic disorder.",1679022885.0

&#x200B;

first of all let me start out by saying I have pretty severe dysgraphia so my grammar and especially my punctuation aren’t going to be the greatest. Some background information on me I am 26 years old (m)  I have been diagnosed with high functioning autism ADHD,ODD,OCD,depression,severe anxiety,dysgraphia and I have never been form diagnosed with either one but I’m pretty sure I have Dyscalculia and body dysmorphia, needless to say living with all of this has made my life quite tough. The first five years after high school were horrible and the worst years of my life I came very close to committing suicide.

I had to deal with three close deaths, I had to deal with the fact I couldn’t drive because of poor hand-eye coordination, a failed job,COVID, family problems, and my best friend since the third grade decided out of nowhere he wanted nothing to do with me anymore and then I had a family friend who is 63 years old calling me in the middle of the night drunk and laying all his problems on me, and plus I was being put on all kinds of new medication and I got put on some antidepressant that caused me to go from 172 pounds all the way up to 250! I had never been fat in my life, and I was pretty ripped in high school and being at that weight made me disgusted with my self I can’t stand to look at pictures of myself when I was at that weight it makes me sick. Last year comes and things had really settled down in my life I started working for my Dad which has been great because it allows me to work from home and at my own hours, plus this year I have gotten back into working out and have gone from 250 all the way down to 205! I’m nowhere near my peak I was in high school. But I’m a lot better than what I had been, but out of nowhere last Thursday I just started to feel down and very anxious, and feeling like a failure at life I always feel this way but usually it’s manageable but it’s just been so extreme lately. I just keep thinking about how I’m a 26 year old man still living with his parents I can’t drive and I am just physically repulsed by my appearance I always have been and getting fat sure has shit didn’t help me with that. My parents like having me live with them and I love my parents to death, but it makes me feel bad because of how society views a man my age still living at home  and not being able to drive, your seen has not a real man and basically scum of the earth. And I really try not to think about this but it depresses me that I have never had a girlfriend and most likely never will and that my only sexual experience I most likely will ever have was some creepy gay guy at school sexually harassing me and that I will most likely die alone. I mean come on what woman is going to want to be with a loser like me, I’m a pathetic excuse for a man and emotionally weak and in my opinion I look like something out of a horror movie like Wrong Turn or The Hills Have Eyes or something. The thought of my Mom,Dad,Aunt,Uncle dying terrifies me being alone in this cruel hard world makes me sick. And one thing I keep thinking about is I remember back in middle school learning about Chris Chan (if you don’t know who that is trust me you don’t want to) on the internet and vowing to myself to never end up like this guy and in some ways I feel like I did end up like him just not as bad. I probably could go on but I think I’m just going to stop here if you read all of this thank you, I mean my life’s not all doom and gloom I’m going out of town next weekend and I am looking forward to that. I just needed to anonymously vent I guess because it has been rough these past couple of days. And yes I know there are people out there who have it way worse than me, also I’m sorry about any poor punctuation or grammar.

His situation has become worse in the last few weeks. He thinks people have been following him and he's been thinking some other people want to kill him. He's on medication, but it seems the meds have actually made it worse. He had to spend one night in the hospital because he had a hugely severe crisis last week. He has a very supportive brother who's paying for his treatment, but his mother is the devil on earth, she thinks this whole situation is because he's lacking god in his life (she herself barely attend churches or seek good whatsoever) and she actually beats him up when he has crisis. 

They are very poor and only his older brother pays for everything in their house. His mother doesn't work and neither his wife, they both abuse the kids (17, 19 and 23 years old) often. The older brother stands against her and won't let her harm anyone when he's home, but he works all day to provide for the family. 

I told them to leave the house and go live by themselves but the older brother (who's also a good friend) told me that if they left her mom, she would probably live on the street, and she's also a suicidal so he doesn't feel like abandoning her is the right thing.

The poor older brother is going through hell right now. We work in the same place and he's unfocused to work and to study, but he can't afford to lose his job, otherwise everybody would be on the street.

I've tried emdr and really didn't like it though I am going to give it another go.  

Biggest sources of anxiety are my job (teacher and it is not a good fit for me) and family stress caused by my older brother bullying me since childhood.   The bullying has continued although he is nearing 50.  He joined several foster parent groups (he is not a foster parent, I am both a foster and adoptive parent) and bashed my parenting ability and status as a single parent.  The bashing was pretty bad--he created aliases to do this and he vehemently denies it.  I can stay away from him because he lives out of town but my parents seem to be pushing us to be closer together.  

I have been a self mutilator since age 7.  Specifically, I punch my legs, bite my hands when in the ""red zone"" of frustration or anger.  Nothing seems to help.  I've tried all the ideas and suggestions out there on the internet.  I'm afraid to admit the self mutilation to my counselor as I worry that it would affect my status as a foster and adoptive parent.  

Any suggestions?  I am working on finding a more suitable job, but the family situation really sucks.  Parents are old school and just want us to get along.  The only thing I can think of is severely limiting the time with them.  I wish I didn't take the anger out on myself.  Even if my brother or parent are being obvious a-holes, I blame myself.

Quit last October after a hospitalization for electrolytes. Used to get liver pains after binging. Since then I’ve had debilitating symptoms of heart rate spiking, abdominal pain, brain fog, feeling faint, loss of libido/erections. Also have diagnosed OCD.

My mind has immediately gone to liver disease/cirrhosis. I’ve seen two GI docs now who have done two ultrasounds, one including a 2D shear wave liver elastography, and abdominal CT scan which have been read as normal. And they have both told me they don’t think I have liver disease. However I’m looking at the images myself and thinking that I see some irregularities that look like cirrhosis/shrunken liver.

I cannot stop thinking about dying/having cirrhosis. My family and friends all think I’m going psychotic from worrying about it because I feel my physical symptoms and my mind automatically goes to liver disease, and they think I’m crazy for doubting the doctors. I can feel/hear liquid noises in my lower abdomen when I press on it and I think it might be ascites. I have read multiple stories online of people who had normal scans and blood work and still turned out to have cirrhosis (uncommon I know) and I’m convinced I’m one of them.

I am 18 year old male, currently going to school and working, normal stuff. I have been dealing with this for a while and doctors doesn’t seem to care anymore, so if anyone has any input it would be really appreciated.

Around last June, I have started to deal with this strange sensation on my entire body, started on left hips and spread to head to toe, literally everywhere, mainly in left side still.

It is very hard to explain because it kind of comes with all sorts of feelings, but best way I can explain it is this prickly/ticklish, water dripping type of feeling following certain parts of my body. As mentioned it started going around my hips, then back, legs, then recent my neck and face. It also causes small muscle twitches/pulses on those places.
This mainly happens during the night. 

I attended Physical therapy because doctor thought it would be a good idea, and I noticed my left leg and left side of my body is somewhat noticeably weaker than my right.

I can’t really say it is painful, but extreme discomfort. I have tried Gabapentin very long time which helped for my first time taking it, and ever since it stopped working, but at least I can assume this is nerve issue.

I have taken every test known to book, from blood tests, MRI, CT, and even colonoscopy which couldn’t explain this.

My neurologist has mentioned that stress can cause this, but I have also heard this for a lot of things. However I did some research and some people seem to experience this as well, so I figured I would post here.

Im a 24 year old guy. Around 8 months ago I became Ill. Constant, extreme fatigue, leg pain and weakness, paleness, hair loss, and a plethora of other symptoms. Since then I have had general blood tests which all came back fine and a sleep study which showed mild apnea. I have been using a cpap for months with no relief at all. 

I have had a history of anxiety… specifically health anxiety. With this as my history I am not taken seriously by doctors, friends, or family. But this time I am seriously ill and desperate. I have done a lot of deep diving and I know that what I’m going through isn’t health anxiety. I know whatever is happening to me is something going wrong with my body and nobody believes me. I can barely function due to the severity of my symptoms. 

I have no support. From anyone. Financial or emotional. Every time I try to talk to my parents they get angry at me and tell me it’s all in my head. My friends are dismissive and don’t really know what to say. Every time I see a doctor they are stumped and don’t really know what to do. Nothing physically wrong has been found. I have yet to be tested for autoimmune conditions, lyme, neurological things, etc. but doctors are booked months in advance where I am. 

I cannot take this. I wake up every day feeling so horrible. With no answers and no one to even talk to. I have lost a tremendous amount of weight and am close to being underweight because I can’t eat enough. It’s terrifying to look at myself in the mirror. It’s terrifying to know that I have to wake up tomorrow and try to function like a normal human again. I am trying so fucking hard, but the weight of everything is too much. 

As a result, I am having terrible thoughts. I have contemplated s******. I don’t want to, but the pain of living every day is too much. Every waking moment is spent in extreme fear and despair. I just want to be healthy again. I want to figure out what’s wrong so I can get treatment and start feeling better. I want people in my life who would support me and help me through this. Why is this too much to ask for? 

I am desperate and scared. I am teetering on the edge and I’m going through this alone.

I'm 23 years old, last I checked I weighed 400 pounds (pre diet) so I know it's possible for those things to happen, but I'm very young and I have no family history of early onset heart problems of any kind. Hell my dad ate worse than I did into his 40's before finally getting his shit together and he never had a heart attack or stroke even now at 60.

I'm having multi hour long panic attacks all day, heart palpitations, some chest pain that will go away after I calm down, and that's enough to scare the crap out of me. I keep scratching both sides of my face and smiling like a madman to make sure I'm not having a stroke. I'm at the point where my quality of life is in the shitter and have no insurance to go to the doctor...so yeah I'm having a great time 😅",1679015398.0

My apologies if this has been asked before. 

The person who I’ve been dating for a few months broke up with me about two weeks ago. I just found out that they have already met someone new, and they are head-over-heels for this new person, and is already talking about  living with them. 

Since finding out this information, I have cut contact with my ex (I know, I shouldn’t have been in contact with them in the first place, but… lesson learned). 

When I found out about this new person in their life, I spiralled into a full on anxiety attack. It’s been a few days now, and I find myself having intrusive thoughts about my ex and their new relationship. 

Like, I’ll be minding my business, trying to focus on something else/distract myself, and BAM! A thought will pop into my head like “does he hold her hand? He didn’t hold my hand very often,” or “what do they talk about?” Or even just a vision of them kissing or having sex will pop into my mind. Just randomly (or so it seems). And then the rumination starts and then I can’t breath anymore. 

How can I break this cycle? How can I stop the intrusive thoughts and the rumination? Any and all advice is welcome. 

(For context, I have GAD and attachment anxiety. I’m in therapy, and I take a low dose of Effexor too.) 

TLDR: I found out that my ex moved on very quickly after breaking up with me, and I can’t stop having intrusive thoughts/ruminating about their new relationship. Please help me.",1679015326.0

My work day now feels pretty stress-free and I don't feel mentally exhausted after work like I used to.

I'm autistic and also have general anxiety, 24M. I need routines to function and I don't respond well to new environments and people I never met. Apparently for most people, new environments and life changes give some anxiety, but for me, it's a big shock, it feels like the world is about to end and I am going to have a heart attack.  

When I say I need routines, I mean it, like military percision. I knew exact how long it took to get to work down to the minute, how long it would take to get ready, and the minute I had to wake up. I would wake up at that time, get ready, I'd park in the same spot, listen to the same music on the way there, and give myself exactly 15 minutes to eat the same exact breakfast I ate every morning, and I did this for years. This probably sounds insane to most people, but I have to in order to keep my anxiety in check, any major changes make me feel super anxious. 

Now I work somewhere that is 40 minutes away in a town I never been. It's very stressful learning from trial and error how long it takes to get there with traffic, how early I need to go in order to have time to eat breakfast, where everything is, and getting used to my new workplace. This job requires me to bring my own lunch which I literally never do, so I'm trying all kinds of new things trying to figure out the best way to do this from pre-packing, buying something ahead, etc. 

My first week hasn't been pretty, again, not the job, it's the process of getting ready do to the job. I haven't been eating until I get home, I'm too anxious to eat breakfast or eat lunch, I just eat 2 or 3 mouth-fulls and that's it. I sit in my car feeling like I'm going to throw up from the anticipation of walking inside. 

I feel fairly relaxed once I clock in and okay enough when I leave, but my brain gets worked up thinking about the stress of being on time, eating, what to do for lunch, getting ready, traffic, and other surprises it just stresses me out so bad for absolutely no reason. I try to go super early to make it feel better, but that seems to just make it worse as I have more time to overthink and I feel more tired.

Hopefully it will get better next week. I'm already getting used to my coworkers and job well enough, I like it so I'm good there. I'm going to try laying out my clothes, lunch, breakfast, and things I need the night before and hopefully that should relax me a bit.",1679014059.0

So the thing is I am bisexual, and have been in love with a (straight, I guess) guy I'm friends with since high school. Through all these years we've been friends, now about 8, I've tried to hold my feelings and just go along with a healthy friendship, but sometimes I just couldn't. There were many events where I showed him some kind of love, and he seemed to correspond. 

Eventually, we got closer and closer and started calling each other cute names, hugging whenever we could and going over to one another's house right after school (even though we weren't at the same class). So I acknowledged my feelings for him, and when I told him, he said absolutely nothing. We kept the same behavior as before, no changes at all, not even when he was dating girls.

When we started University (different majors) we got into a weird dynamic where we sometimes would see almost every weekend and treated each other the same way we'd been doing for years, and then we wouldn't talk at all for a month or so. Also, he was one of the few people I hung out with during the covid lockdown (On Valentine's Day).

I've got to admit that controlling myself when I was with him was very hard, and I'd sometimes have a behavior that now I would label ""invasive"", but that I didn't stop at the time because he never told me, even when I asked him, he told me it was alright, and he didn't feel uncomfortable.

In November we were roommates for a week during a school trip, and a few days before it ended, he was having a shower and thought I was spying on him, which I wasn't. He got really mad at me, didn't let me say anything at all, and stopped talking to me since then. When we got back home, I once again tried to talk to him but he just left me alone and that made me very angry, so I stopped trying.

I thought that distancing myself from him would sort of erase my feelings for him, but it's almost April and I feel exactly the same about him as I did when we hung out almost every day. But now that he's graduating, he got a job nearly 1000 miles away from our city. And now it's not just the love I've been feeling all these years, but the fact that we had a falling out and haven't fixed our friendship, he'll be leaving very soon and my time is running out.

I've been having constant anxiety attacks, feeling down and stopped enjoying things I used to after I found out about his new job. I reached out to him and asked if we could meet before he leaves, but it seems that he just doesn't want to. 

What angers me the most now is that I had a weird behavior back then and he said nothing, and the time I didn't have that behavior, he thought I was having it, and that's all it took to destroy the friendship we built.

So here I am, venting everything I can't say in person, and hoping he changes his mind so I can be at peace with my feelings.",1679010745.0

I went to my Dr yesterday and she prescribed antibiotics and recommended I see a dentist. Today I woke up and the pain was almost totally gone but now my face on the side of the absess is swollen. 
 I don't have dental insurance so I did what I could and went to a free dental clinic (barely got in).  The dentist didn't even LOOK inside of my mouth, and said according to the xrays I have an absess.  He said ""You've taken a few doses of your antibiotic so it should have worked by now so your swelling tells me it's getting worse.  I'm prescribing a 2nd antibiotic and we will drain the absess and pull the teeth in 10 days""

I was in shock.  I asked if he could drain the absess now, as the swelling was very uncomfortable and I am scared to have bacteria inside of me like that for long.  He said ""the swelling makes it hard to numb you, so we will let the antibiotics help the swelling first. And I can't tell where the absess is"".  

I opened my mouth and pointed right where it is, telling him ""It's right here, I can feel it"".  He replied ""Yeah...."" then left the room. 

I have not been able to stop obsessing over this.  I am absolutely TERRIFIED that this absess will spread and give me sepsis or spread to my brain or bones etc.  I called every dentist in my city and they either don't accept new patients or are booked for emergency dental. 

I keep thinking my throat is closing, or my head hurts, and i panic thinking I'm going to die. My mom who lives in a diff city had this exact situation (2 broken teeth with absess) and the dentist immediately drained the absess and pulled her teeth, saying an antibiotic isn't going to fix it.  Her swelling was worse than mine. 

I feel defeated.  I'm seriously wanting to cut this open myself.  I am terrified.  I can't focus.  I can see me swelled cheek in my vision so it's not easy to ignore.  I don't know how to get my anxiety down!

In fact, 90% of my ER visits in the last 10 years have been due to severe bouts of anxiety and panic. Every year I get my physical and included I get bloodwork done to include a heart workup.

Yesterday I went to the gym I started the day before I did 5 minutes on the cycling machine the day before on a light intensity level 2. YESTERDAY HOWEVER, I did 30 minutes non stop on intensity level 10 ! So as you can imagine it was a lot. I am slim Male with no health conditions and I was listening to a podcast about health anxiety and exercise and it helped me get through it but then when it was over and I stopped I think in my mind because I was sitting still and having a really fast heart rate and out of breath it instantly just switched from this is normal with exercise to BOOM INSTANT PANIC ATTACK thinking the dizzy/lightheadedness was from a serious condition ( I have had my heart checked in depth 7 god damn times lmao and they were all perfect) so it’s definitely not. I came to the conclusion I was lightheaded and kinda dizzy because I was deep breathing after doing exercise so that’s probably why. But I still worked myself up even more when I felt my heartbeat in my neck ( AGAIN NORMAL) and this just set me off I went into the toilets and for 10 minutes deep breathing trying to calm myself down. In the middle of trying to calm myself down I felt dizzy and lightheaded and when I moved my head it felt dizzy (probably because blood pressure rises when ecercises and panic) but I was thinking OMG I have to walk back to my car and I don’t think I can do it while walking straight and not passing out and then I felt my heartbeat again going fast and I thought back to two years ago when I was on a treadmill and my heart was beating at 194 BPM just because exercise was intense but I was thinking it’s going to give me a heart attack but I searched it up it doesn’t just explode when I gets to 200 lol. Anyway I calmed myself down and did feel weirdly proud of myself for doing exercise that intense but the anxiety is still lingering today and I’m just thinking what if it’s something bad.

I had joined this group of friends at the end of last semester. We all got along and everybody seemed cool, and they welcomed me with open arms (even celebrated my birthday with me). Things we are well and good until I noticed a change. There was a person in our group, let's call him John. John had recently had a bad experience with some of the people in the group and decided to remove himself from it, blocking everyone and leaving without much of a thought. I didn't get along with John that well so I thought ""no big deal"" until I started to become the group punching bag. I stopped getting invited to gatherings, they would gaslight me as a ""joke"" and they say things like ""I can't believe you thought we were telling the truth."" It went so far as two of the people in the group pretended to date and would touch each other to make me feel uncomfortable. I asked them to stop but they would just make up new things to lie about and I would end up being the butt of the joke. Then it got a bit worse, the lying continued and the jokes would start to get mean. They called my mom a pig, they would call me retard ""affectionately"", and would say a lot of mean things behind my back. Now, to anyone that hears this it may seem like a no brainer, but there was a genuine side to the friendship. They cares about me and made sure I was ok, they still invited me to some things, they would do small little nice things for me too, but I don't know if it constitutes me leaving them. I un added everyone's socials, and only left my number for them to reach me. I would really appreciate some advice, I have social anxiety and misread a lot of things.",1679003199.0

I'm not looking for empathy here just maybe some advice on how to fix this. So about a month ago it was just me my sister and my boyfriend alone in the bar besides one scumbag guy that kept trying to talk to us, we eventually found out his mother was a good friend of our mother and my sister decided to entertain him. He started to get handsy with me and my sister I asked nicely if he could keep his hands to himself and he got hostile and started squaring up to my bf as he couldn't fight me or my sister. 

My boyfriend got angry and got up to leave, I chased after him and pulled him into the womens bathroom (very stupid I know) but I panicked and was doing my best to de-escalate the situation. Little did I know the barwoman was watching us and followed us in, I told my bf to be quiet and just follow me out literally 30 seconds after. She was stood outside the door and caught us red-handed and it just looked bad on our side as I do understand 1 you shouldn't bring a male into the female bathrooms and it just looks like we were fooling around or taking drugs but luckily there was cameras and it does show everything that happened and that we were in there about 2 minutes exactly. 

Got kicked out obviously and I rang and apologised explaining the situation the owner told me to call into him sometime to talk about it. I did so today to be immediately screamed at the he wasn't entertaining me and to leave because it wasn't his decision but the barwomans for me not to return.

 I've to call back Sunday for security footage because my sister went to the police over the scumbag guy basically trying to kidnap her after we left that night and drive off in his car. The barwoman and owner will be there that day. 

Is there anything I can say or do to help my situation, I've been going here my whole life since my own christening to confirmations and communions im always quiet and respectful, tip every single time, help clean up messes made by others even bring my own glasses and bottles back the bar and until this had a good relationship with all the bar staff.

 I'm shocked one little mistake could have me banned for life. Any advice would be appreciated. Again im very aware of what I did wrong and not to do anything of the sort again it was a stupid mistake made out of pure panic in the moment.",1678999013.0

I'm 33 and have a long history of anxiety/perfectionism since I was a small child.  A lot of think links to my upbringing and over the years I have had therapy and medication to help me work through it.

I last had therapy about 5 years ago, and my therapist at the time advised me to consider medication again. I was reluctant, but did in the end start a course of Prozac and it really did help me immeasurably.  Everything seemed to make sense and be so clear, my anxiety stopped and I felt amazing.  This, combined with the therapy really helped me make sense of why I felt the way I did.

Fast forward 5 years and I felt ready to stop the Prozac.  I have done a long-long taper over 6 months and took my last pill in December 2022. 

We're now in March, and I have had what I would describe as a 'freak-out' which is very typical of how my anxiety would manifest in the past.  I made a mistake at work, and ended up a guilt/shame/anxiety spiral that I'm finding very hard to move past.

I've been off work for 2 days and the anxiety/sadness is coming in waves.  

I'm really scared that this is a relapse, and I essentially cannot function without the Prozac. This makes me feel so broken and only deepens to anxiety-hole I find myself in right now.

I went outside for a break and played some piano music to see if that would calm me down, It didn’t.

The feeling got worse and then I noticed that well, I don’t normally feel like this and things are starting to not feel real almost like a dream. Panic set in and all my emotions for the next few hours would rapidly change from feeling happy, to extremely sad and crying to then scared. I called my girlfriend and her dad who is also my boss and I took the day off. She was comforting me the best she could and I could barely put a sentence together as speaking felt extremely difficult to do and even walking felt unreal, nothing felt real.

It’s the next day, I still feel weird and my eyes still feel like they are not normal if that makes sense.

So today I watched squadrons and ds3 videos instead, found them overwhelming as well. Felt like everything happening on screen is too much, and focusing seem painful and tiresome. Formulating a sentence now feels like so much resistance, I get hot flashes just small talking with my parents. Everything was way worse, so much worse that I can no doubt realize a difference, so my mental decline is finally confirmed. 

MY BRAIN IS DAMAGED. This gives me the opportunity to finally focus, on one and single task: the recovery of my brain. 

The takeaway? My brain has deteriorated significantly, and it requires special care 24/7, top and only priority. Everything else fucks off, be a monk, Meditate, read, music, exercise like hell, no video games except hommVI, no primal suggestions, no primal orientation, no !Unrealistic Expectations!

Guess it's a good thing, sealing the deal and moving on, and set up a realistic set of expectations. Only then, when said expectations are met, will I experience true Gratefulness and bliss.""

This is an excerpt from my diary today, I've finally acknowledged that the years of extreme pressure and daily non-stop anxiety has turned me from a top performer to non-functional.

Growing up I had a fairly traumatic childhood and have had anxiety since I was a kid. I would bite through my lip, chew my cheeks, rip out my eyebrows all before puberty.  At 11 I developed an eating disorder and struggled a lot with my emotions but never had a real diagnoses besides the anorexia and GAD.  Fast forward to my early 20s, I put myself in rehab and was doing much better. My ED has been in remission for 7 years.  Over the past 5 years, maybe longer I’ve developed a tremor, which I have had internal tremors since I was in my late tees early 20s, I’m 31 now. The tremors are exacerbated by my anxiety but are almost always there. My skin Burns!! All the time! My shoulders, my back, down my arms. It feels like it’s coming from inside my skin. Like my pores are opening and letting some toxic substance out.  Now I’m having occasional lights in my vision, like glowing dots of rain or floaters and for the past couple of weeks my toes have been going numb and yesterday my partner noticed my toes were much whiter compared to the others.

Does anyone else have problems like this? I feel like with my years of therapy that I’m pretty okay mentally until put under A LOT of stress, which I feel is normal. I don’t know, maybe it’s just my anxiety but I feel like more is going on.

The room feels very long. My heart races so fast, I feel like I am TERRIFIED. I can tell when it is coming on, I just get a weird feeling and then BAM. It honestly just feels like I am remembering a dream. I get these visions of people but not anyone specific, doing things that I can’t put my finger on. When it’s happening, I think “yup, it’s always the same thing” I’m envisioning. But when it’s over, I can’t really remember the vision. 

I don’t have to be upset for this to happen. Don’t have to be by myself. I can very calmly tell my bf or whoever “panic attack is coming on”, just sit there quietly while it’s happening, and then im still not crying or anything when it’s over. I just say to myself “wow, that was weird” and I feel tired. 

When I’m having these visions I know they are not real, I just don’t want anyone to think I am hallucinating. 

Everytime I have one I just go with the flow. Because for the few minutes when I’m seeing this dream vision thing, I want it to go on as long as possible to see if I ever figure it out. But it’s not like these people are scary men I’m picturing. I had one this morning and I think, but can’t say for sure, I was picturing like high school kids. Idk. It’s SO hard to explain. But whoever it was, it’s always the same person/people. It just feels really familiar when it’s happening. 

Is this a panic attack? 

It started happening when me and my first long term bf broke up. I think he thought i was just immature, trying to make up things for sympathy. In the middle of fights, I’d get really scared and tell him a vision was coming on and I needed help, which would be weird to hear in the middle of an argument. But I’m 35 now. I just had this happen to me for the millionth time, all alone. It’s not for attention. It’s not when I’m upset. 

Just asking because I recently was diagnosed with epilepsy. Is this an aura? Or a panic attack? Why does my body feel more anxious than my mind? It’s just strange to me that I can be with my bf and say “hold on” have a panic attack while remaining silent, then just say to him “I just had a panic attack” very calmly. That doesn’t seem like what a panic attack is. I’m picturing someone crying, shaking, breathing hard. Maybe I just got used to them.",1678982839.0

I have a really hard time expressing my feelings. The symptoms I lost below, I haven’t been able to explain it during my past therapy sessions. I’m planning on writing these down and giving it to my psychiatrist in my next visit. I desperately feel alone and want to know if anyone experiences these issues. 
__

In the middle of a conversation I will just zone out. I get quiet and feel a lost of energy and just want to be alone and notice I start speaking very quietly basically like whispering. I don’t know why this happens

I seem to always make things about myself in conversations it’s the only way I know how to relate but my friends have noticed and they say it’s quite annoying 


I take a lot of things literal and don’t know when someone is serious or joking 

Everyone says my humor isn’t funny and quite confusing, I guess the way I see things are very different to others.

I find it so hard to do simple things. My room can never stay organized. First, it takes me ages to bring myself to clean and then a few days later it’s suddenly messy again and it’s just an ongoing cycle. The problem is I see the mess and I really want to clean up but I can’t bring myself to do it. And when I finally do it , it makes me feel so exhausted. L

I can be very decisive and impulsive. My friends have mentioned a lot how I say things without thinking and sometimes it’s blunt and quite rude. 

I also forget what I had just said like a minute before moving on to another topic. 

I have trouble recognizing people’s facial expressions and tones. Sometimes I can’t tell whether people are happy or upset with me. And people always say it’s hard to interact with me because the things I say they never know if I’m joking or serious because my facial expressions and tone are out of sync.


I go through so many phases of hyper focusing on things and it’s something I can’t stop thinking about until I wind up losing interest. And I ramble on about it and talk about it as much as I can with friends and family. It’s quite embarrassing but I can’t help myself.

When I get excited I flap my hands and jump up and down. I know it looks childish so I try not to. 

When I’m stressed I need to fidget with my fidget toys but they don’t seem to help much. The way I can explain it is that I feel like I have electricity running through me and there’s no way to let it out. I feel irritable a lot of the time because I don’t know how to explain how it feels inside my body and brain. 



Sometimes I randomly feel like I need to cry  

Big crowds overwhelm me, not because I’m scared of people it just feels like too much going on around me with noise,  lights and people. 

I like to plan things ahead of time. I don’t like when plans are changed.

I get attached to people so easily like a child and I hate it so much

It’s very hard for me to finish any assignment up until the last minute. No matter if I enjoy it or don’t the only thing that pushes me is until the last few minutes it’s due.

I started on Celexa in April 2022 because i was having a lot of panic attacks and severe anxiety. After starting on Celexa (20mg) everything has been pretty okay, my panic attacks and anxiety were almost completely gone and i felt normal again. Although the fear of having an attack never left, i didn’t actually get the attacks anymore.

Just about 5-6 weeks ago i started noticing some anxiety spikes again and random chest pains, which according to my doctor isn’t my heart. Last week i started to experience these weird brain zaps that occur right before the moment i fall asleep, they zap me fully awake and when im close to sleeping again it happens another time. Very strange, i never felt something like it.

Yesterday i had the exact same thing, the brain zaps, but also some sort of lucid dream. I was laying in bed and couldn’t sleep and decided to go downstairs. As i was walking downstairs i suddenly stopped and thought to myself; wait, im not on the stairs, im laying in bed.. I was fully conscious at that time and decided to see what would happen if i opened my eyes and i did and just saw my room again. Call it a lucid dream or a hallucination, it was one of the strangest things ever. 

My doctor said that i should taper down the Celexa with her help after a year of use, and im approaching that time now. I’m getting the idea that the Celexa is turning on me for some reason, because i’m getting all these weird symptoms. Is this possible? Does anybody know what is going on? I think about quitting because i’m no longer in the bad situation of last year that got me on the SSRI to begin with.

Please note; i never started Celexa due to depression. Only because of anxiety.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.",1678968083.0

She was upset with me posting to Instagram a year ago (so I've stopped posting), once spiralled and thought I was gay because she'd never asked me my sexuality (despite being with her), found an old tinder profile (she looked because her friend thought she saw tinder on her bfs (not me) phone (and I did delete the account (I thought I had)), and recently after an argument, got upset with me for saying I was going to get a ride with my dad because she thought I was avoiding her (despite the fact we would have spent the day together). With all this, I don't know what to do or act, I never know what is going to upset her, so I'm just asking how best to approach this, do I say I'd like her to speak to someone?

I’ve started a new job this year. The stress has been pretty insane. I never sleep through the night anymore, losing 2/3 hours easily when I wake in a panic attack. The hours are long, client facing, and very physical. 

I’ve been pretty brutally called out by a superior for lackluster overall performance. Not poor, but not 10/10. 

I want to step up, but I’m so fucking tired. I’m at least one staff member short and that doesn’t look to improve anytime soon. I’m attempting to do several jobs, and I’m doing them all poorly.

My partner is emotionally drained at this point. They’re the only thing that matters to me and I’m ruining our relationship. I come home completely self-obsessed and anxious, most nights spiraling into trembling panic attacks ruminating on work and what I failed to achieve. They try and try to support me, but on week 3 of nightly attacks I’m sure they’re as worn out as I am. 

I jumped to this career from a 15 year place where I was comfortable but miserable. This was supposed to be the change I needed, and I’m failing. 

My thoughts are deteriorating, my relationship fraying, and Im only going to get more stressed as the nice weather greets us.

Anyways something a user commented on my sister's channel really scared me, let's call this user 'person'


Anyways the encounter went as follows:

person: you'll cringe when you look back at this

my sister: everyone cringes at their old videos!

person: I'll eat your entrails

my sister: I don't know what that means!

Then she showed me this comment from the user and I decided to use her device to comment and scold this person in filth.

the person then replied:
I'll eat your guts

I proceeded to scold that guy in filth and then just reported this person, being the protective brother that I am.

Spoiler: I'm sorry I don't have the screenshot because at that moment I was horrified and decided to report the user and delete my sister's channel before things get worse.


This has never happened to me or anyone I've known so it really creeped me out, my little sister means the WORLD to me.

561,carpet beetles have ruined my life,132,11roo19,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11roo19/carpet_beetles_have_ruined_my_life/,92,"Gosh I feel so embarrassed saying my this, but I hope that since this is an anxiety forum I won’t get laughed at. If you don’t know what these are, carpet beetles are tiny bugs that fly into homes and lay eggs, which grow into these hairy tiny larvae worms that eat natural fibers (clothes, coats, carpets, etc). They’re super common, and it’s been studied in pest control surveys that about 93% of homes have them. 
Back in November, I found 3 larvae in my closet on my clothes. And from there everything fell apart. I went fucking insane, I cleaned so much my room is flammable and it’s covered in insecticide powder. I sprayed everything in cedar essential oil. I can’t touch a single cloth item without having to check it for the larvae. Everytime I feel a slight tingle in my clothes I have to check it too, even though I’ve never found one on me. I think about them all day long. For a few months after weeks of excessive cleaning rituals I had peace. I didn’t care about them much. And then, I started finding the adults instead of the larvae. I sealed my baseboards and I think that was the problem. But I can’t stop. What if they laid eggs? What if there’s gonna be more now? What if I can’t ever escape them? I hate them so much. They make me sick. And the worst part is that I’m so logical through all of this. I know it’s stupid. I know they’re such a small deal and probably the most measly tiny house pest there is. I know I hardly have enough to even call it an infestation in ant capacity. I know how common they are and how almost every home I’ve ever been to has them in at least one dusty crevice or old box. And yet I can’t stop the response. I can’t stop the lightheadedness and the rituals of having to check every single nook and cranny with a flash light every single day multiple times a day. I guess maybe I just need reassurance that they’re so silly, so dumb and harmless. But I don’t even know if that’ll help.

Edit: A lot of people are commenting to have an exterminator come out for peace of mind, and I’ve thought of it, because we have one for the outside of the home, but there’s a few small problems. First, if they come out for a quote they’re not gonna find anything. If you check any nook and cranny in my bedroom it’s clean, there’s not even any dust because I’ve cleaned so much. I only find them because I look obsessively, and I’ve found only ~20 TOTAL beetles and larvae since it started. 
Second, the exterminator can either spray or fumigate. But, there’s nothing to spray, seeing as every nook and cranny is clean and empty. As for fumigation, that’s an option, but it’s a complex and tedious one that is also expensive, and can damage my clothes and personal items. If there is anything I will have to remove from the room for the job, I will worry one got away. 
I appreciate the advice but I also need you guys to know that I don’t think there is anything that can make me feel better about this in terms of cleaning behaviors. I can have an exterminator smoke bomb my entire room and belongings, and I’m still gonna worry that one got deep enough into a crevice or item of clothing or purse to be unaffected, will crawl out again, and start everything all over.",1678863280.0

I’m a 24 y/o and I have had death anxiety since I was a very little girl, not sure why as I didn’t lose anyone at a young age to maybe trigger this, however it’s always been something I’ve been absolutely petrified about. I used to wake up screaming throughout the night telling my parents I’m scared to die. 

I can usually go about my day fine without thinking about it, however the thoughts enter my mind when I get into bed and try and fall asleep. The same thoughts circle my mind of “one day you’re going to die and never come back, ever” “everything is just going to end, your world will go black and that’ll be it” “you can die at any point in your life, I could be 30 and leave this earth” 

It’s really weird thoughts like the above that torture my mind constantly. I am absolutely scared sh*tless of dying. It is terrifying. I always thought maybe I would think differently if I was religious as I’d have something to believe in after death, however I’m not, so this makes it a little difficult for me as it is just me and my thoughts. 

I go through weird phases, I can not think about it for weeks, months even and then all of a sudden it’ll come back and I struggle so much to get rid of it again. I lost my grandad a year ago today, I was absolutely devastated and it really scared me how quick we lost him from his diagnosis. (He had diabetes and we saw his feet were really swollen so we advised him to see a doctor, he goes and has an appointment and further tests are done and they find out he has liver cancer, no treatment can be given and he’s going to get put on end of life care) this was a HUGE shock to us as he’d literally been feeling fine, and we thought his feet was due to his diabetes. 3 months later we lost him. It scared the hell out of me how your life can just be taken from you so quickly. 

My death anxiety got super bad for me after that, I watched him get buried and I went downhill massively. I started worrying myself as I was finding myself on google searching crazy things like “what happens to your body after you die” and even more disturbing things that I won’t type on here about what happens to the body after. It’s like my mind had this obsession of wanting to know what happened and what will eventfully happen to me one day, and I got so freaked out by it. 

I know death is inevitable, all you can do is try and stay healthy and prevent it for a while. I just need some help on how to cope with this horrible death anxiety as it gives me horrendous panic attacks and I’m finding myself bawling my eyes out every night over it. 

Any advice would be massively appreciated, I hate having 0 control of my body at the minute, my anxiety is all over the place.",1678928617.0

Has anyone taken SSRI’s when their sibling has bipolar? I’m super anxious about it.

Hi, my sibling was diagnosed with bipolar around a year ago and has had multiple manic attacks quite severe needing hospitalisation. 
I have anxiety and migraines. My anxiety is usually about fear of getting a migraine as they’re quite debilitating. 

My GP and neurologist have recommended SSRI’s, firstly Lexapro which I started on 5mg for around 2 weeks and then got really nervous that it would bring bipolar out in me (I don’t think I have bipolar, I’ve just watched how it can destroy peoples lives and was scared about doing the same to me given the family history).

579,Advice on insomnia and anxiety,1,11smhgi,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11smhgi/advice_on_insomnia_and_anxiety/,2,"Hey everyone, 

So really quick - I've been having issues with anxiety for quite some time now and I notice that it's starting to affect my sleep. I'm excessively tired during the day, but I think it's due in part to the fact that I can't fall asleep at night or have difficulty doing so (I don't want to induce my anxiety by thinking it might be a medical condition, but instead I'm trying to be reasonable and am attempting to believe that it's really just me not having great sleep). 

Basically every time I'm falling asleep, my hyper-sensitive anxious brain will realize that I'm falling asleep and that my breathing is slowing down and I'll jolt up because of the fact that I recognize this. So this loophole will continuously happen for a couple of hours until I can't take it anymore and I do end up sleeping.

Has anyone else had this happen to them? And if so, how do you manage it or how have you ended up treating it so that you do end up getting good sleep? 

Thanks in advance all!",1678949023.0

Bur here's the problem. I also take 20mg of lexapro. My doctor said there's no interaction between those medicines, but I read somewhere that rizamelt has serotonin.

I don't have other symptoms right now, and I'm not sure if my anxiety is just exacerbating the symptoms. Not sure what to do.

If your story is similar to mine, I would like to hear it! I have generalized anxiety disorder along with panic attacks.

2 years ago, I started drinking the antidepressant Sertraline and for the first time in my life my condition with anxiety not only worsened in the first month of taking it, but also appeared some terrible thoughts. I wanted to harm myself, although in the normal state of mind without drugs this never happened to me. To hide this side effect, doctor prescribed Lamictal, and it worked, but not 100% sure cause I barely remember those days. I took antidepressants for half a year, I have few memories for that period of time, but the fact that after the antidepressant I went to psychotherapy, suggests, that the antidepressant did not help much.

I more or less coped with anxiety, recovered from panic attacks, BUT recently I had a relapse. I had some severe mental breakdowns, so my doctor prescribed me Escitalopram without covering the side effects and it was one of the worst weeks of my life, again from the antidepressant suicidal thoughts, I could not drink more than 5 days, I live alone, and it is very difficult for me to survive the first month side effects.

there is little information on the Internet about how antidepressants change our mood, and I don’t know what to do, the doctor is telling me to continue taking the medicine, but I don’t like how it affects my mood and brain itself.

This is the second drug that worsens my mood that I feel like I'm at the bottom. Who faced it? Should I continue?

I am also undergoing therapy, I feel better, but sometimes there is a relapse, and the doctor says that I definitely need to take the drug to avoid recidivism. Or is there any other medication not antidepressants that helped you to go through the anxiety?",1678929311.0

I legitimately don't think I could have sex with a girl without that fear killing my mood, either before, or after by giving extreme regret. 

I'm not making this post for support, as much as I am for discussion. I'm perfectly happy with being CF, and I'm even going to get a vasectomy sometime soon to cement my life choice. I've never wanted kids, and I want to leave my reproduction in my hands.

Now, onto the fear itself. I never realized it was such a bad fear, but I noticed that any content related to parenthood started to give me actual panic attacks. I had to block a ton of content on TikTok because of that. 

It was at that point that I realized how bad my fear had gotten. Essentially, I'm so afraid of the thought of parenthood, I'm essentially gay until I can get snipped. 

Now as bad as that sounds to most of you, I'd already planned long ago to go down this path regardless, and nothing will change that. I just want to know, how much of it is theoretically related to my anxiety disorder?",1678924357.0

The visual distress began to worsen and I started to have a bit of a loss in the vision on the bottom of my right eye. Obviously worsening the entire situation.

635,Am I simply surviving and not living?,2,11s5cls,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11s5cls/am_i_simply_surviving_and_not_living/,0," 

Hi. I \[25 F\] feel like I am not living the life I dreamed of as a child.

When I was a child I was very imaginative and would express myself in art and making stories, my friends and family loved me for it. At highschool I became a writer in my school and my classmates loved reading my stories, along with that I started trying to make animations along with the stories I created about them. College came and I had to make a choice, to take a program/degree that is aligned with my interests or to take one that would ensure me financial stability. I'm asian and live in a third world country under my parents who make minimum wage. So you could have guessed what I chose. I went with a degree that I had 0 interest in but had a lot of career oppurtunities and a nice salary - TECH/ENGINEERING. I excelled in it but it still felt like it wasn't my calling. At that time I felt like I was just trying to prove some thing to the world / to my parents?

10 years later after making that decision, I'm working overseas as a data engineer and making a pretty decent salary. (But I don't have any assets yet). I am also living with my boyfriend whom I met at college as we took the same program. I hate my job as it demands a lot from me and it doesn't spark my creative side. Lately I felt like my creative spark is gone. I seldom draw anymore. I don't write. I used to imagine a whole ass movie in my head before I sleep and now there's just nothing. My creativity has totally left me and realizing it right now is making me sad. I am so miserable and guilty because I should be thankful that I get to eat 3x a day and have decent work.

I thought being financially stable would be so rewarding but everything just feels so bleak. I wake up, I work, I sleep and it repeats. I know that I can use the money to sustain a lifestyle that I want but I don't even have a lifestyle or even a hobby that I enjoy anymore. On my off days I just lay down in bed or the sofa and watch tv and just wait for the next workday to come. I feel like a robot. And I'm scared of dying and regretting the time I wasted. But at the same time I am also too tired to do anything. There's this fear of doing anything wrong that would lead to me being 'unsuccessful'. If it all sounds familiar to you- yes I am diagnosed with anxiety and depression and been to countless therapists but nothing's changed. I feel like I'm in a cycle and I want to change but I cannot because the risk of losing everything I have right now is too great.

I wish there was a piece of paper that would tell me what I need to do to be finally be able to feel like I'm alive.",1678905985.0

He’s great and I don’t hate him, but living with him has caused me some serious anxiety.

Here’s some backstory, we knew each other since grade 6, and has been friends ever since, I’m shy and reserved, he’s more confident but he gets angry easily. In grade 8, when my anxiety starts to develop due to puberty and such, he said some mean things to me because I was quite annoying/cringey back then, and that scarred me ever since. Now I always try to avoid making him angry, and whenever he slightly raise his voice t start to have a mini-panic attack.

He’s good at cooking so he cooks for both of us, meanwhile I do the dishes and cleaning, I honestly would like to learn how to cook, but I fear that watching him might annoy him and cause him to shout at me. 

I honestly don’t know how to confront this myself, it’s ridiculously bad for my mental health since whenever I get a panic attack I feel horrible for the rest of the day. We’ve been good friends since then, I can see that he has been trying to not get angry at me, but deep inside I’m still so so afraid of him getting angry at me.

Today when he finished making dinner I might have not paid attention and let him call me out for it, he has an angry tone and said it quite loudly. That was enough to throw me into a panic attack, dinner was quiet today, as I was too scared to start a conversation. As I wash the dishes I contemplated that I need to do something about this, I can’t just feel anxiety whenever I’m at home. 

I’m honestly too scared to talk to my friend face to face about this, but I want to confront him, I know this is Reddit and all, but what should I do? I don’t want to hurt my friend, and when he doesn’t act/look angry (which 50% of the time he is) I honestly enjoy living with him. I want to put in some efforts in order to communicate and make things clear, but I don’t know how.",1678872021.0

If I don’t take Xanax tomorrow, which I feel I shouldn’t, would that mess with the tests a cardiologist would do, too much?

They said since I had my exams in January, it was probably anxiety again but I'm gonna do more deep exams. They didn't even analyse me that day, just gave me medicine to take for anxiety and that's it.

My question is, could this be any heart desease that is not being detected by the exams? Like a blocked artery or something. Because this is very strange, I can't even do my normal life, I feel weak, I have tachycardias all of a sudden :(

I wasn’t noticing any significant changes when I ate. Outside of these random occurrences, it was not bothersome.

However, last week, I was sitting at my desk and I had another episode where I had saliva go down the wrong pipe. It startled me, especially since I was just sitting at my desk working. Afterwords, I became very aware of my saliva and the swallowing mechanism. It felt like my mouth was constantly filling with saliva and I was having to manually swallow. While this was annoying and very uncomfortable, in the back of my head if figured I was hyperfocusing on my swallowing. At times when I was distracted, I felt like my symptoms were less.

Over the weekend and into this week, I started noticing eating also became uncomfortable. I started to feel like I was going to choke when I would eat or drink certain things. I feel foods/liquids sometimes move too quickly through my mouth, like it’s headed for my throat and I am about to choke. Twice this week, I had a piece of asparagus and water move toward the back of my throat, cause me to cough, choke a little. Both times I was fine within moments, but it frightened me.

 I am now very anxious eating and fearful that I have something serious going on. I just don’t know how I have gone from eating fairly normally, to feeling like I am choking. I am also starting to wondering if my previous episodes over the last couple of months were signs that I have something going on. Of course when I tried to do research, the first things that popped up was ALS and MND. I am not sure if this is neurological, structural, or psychosomatic. 

I am also feeling discomfort in my chest after eating and having a tickle in my throat. I never noticed these symptoms before. Again, I just don’t know what is going on.

So for context I’m on discord, and one of the people I know in one of the servers I’m in has brought up the idea of meeting each other in person for like a lunch or dinner (they live in the city I go to college in). 

The problem is though is that I’ve always been weird about this sort of thing. It might stem from a fear of actually seeing somebody  for what they look like (and vice versa with them seeing how I look).

Another component to it is the fear of being catfished. Like this kind of fear had been instilled in me by my parents, but I’m worried that whoever I’m going to meet is not gonna be who I talked to online. I also don’t wanna get like kidnapped or something but that’s an entirely new can of worms.

The peculiar thing is though is that I have no problem doing this sort of stuff with people I know purely in person. Like I’m not the most social person in the world, but I’ll happily go to a restaurant or sports event with people I know from school just fine. It’s just that meeting somebody I know PURELY from online just scares me.

So what sort of tips do you guys have for overcoming this fear? The person who wants to meet me is pretty set on meeting with me, and only needs my ok to actually set a time. I don’t wanna ruin my relationship with them, but I also don’t know how to get over this anxiety about the situation. So what should I do?",1678912080.0

It could easily be that he is a body builder and he’s on his cut right now, towards the end of it, but he’s always been light headed or not feeling great, not spacey.

Not sure how long they’ve been like that but it’s been at least two months. My PCP couldn’t even feel them? But I do. Tylenol helps a little with shrinking. 

Have periods of daytime sleepiness but can’t sleep. I will literally nod my head on the couch 5 times a day randomly. (I’ve been waking up at 2 am for work 7 days a week for 10 months, no clue if that plays a role)

I’ve had itchiness or tingling feeling around my mouth and chin for 3 months (Xanax gets rid of it for a bit)

I get a tickle or itch that makes me cough once in a while in my throat , especially when falling asleep - for last couple of months. 

I get body chills. Like goosebumps or shivers randomly during the day. (Not everyday but close to it)

I lost 38 pounds frond April 2022 to December 2022 by eating less and eating healthier (I’ve gained 9 pounds in the last 3 weeks eating like a pig) 


Had CMP and CBC done in November. Everything was in range except WBC was 12,100. PCP wasn’t concerned since it always seems to be up. (I suffer from anxiety disorders; arthritis, high BP and more)

I have been on amlodipine for 17 months.
Gabapentin 5 years
Xanax 5 years 
Been drinking alcohol daily for 2 years.

Does this sound concerning if so what could it be ? If not what could it be ?

I have had too many panic attacks to count but they have mostly caused things like shortness of breath, slight disorientation, chest pain, fatigue and light headedness. They were still bad and the frequency with which they occurred prior to meds, every day, was hard to deal with. I have improved immensely after starting anti depressants a few months ago.

I have however now had three events over the last three years (one before a diagnosis and meds) where the panic attack goes to another level. And it always starts with my stomach.

Each time I begin to feel heartburn, then nausea both very intense. Within minutes I go from totally fine to sweating bullets, extreme heat in hands, feet and head, hyperventilation, total disorientation and loss of motor functions, inability to communicate, diarrhoea, vomiting and eventually passing out.

The latest one happened yesterday, and I’m still recovering from it. I feel extremely tired, stiff and sick in my stomach.

I’ve asked doctors about this and they say these are very intense panic attacks but what is the link with my stomach / gastrointestinal symptoms?

As it was after hours  (6PM), I was the only one there at the time. The police responding treated me like a burglar, and it was not a gentle treatment. I received a scuffed up face and some bruises. This happened during a snow storm btw.

I live in the northeast where we received a little less than a foot of snow the last few days. No big deal. So I’m snow blowing out my driveway yesterday and my drunken neighbor’s dog is loose and harassing me. This happens constantly and I usually just let it go because the dog doesn’t actually bite me or anything. At least twice a week the dog is out in the streets while it’s owners are tying one on. It’s just annoying. But enough is enough. So I call animal control. 

A little while later, the police show up. They are a little impatient about the matter and nothing really happens except I feel super anxious about them asking me for my personal information like DOB, phone #, etc.

So I feel just way out of it the rest of the day and I intellectually understand it’s some PTSD triggered by the interaction. It’s all good until I’m at work this morning, listening to some music on random. This Passion Pit song comes on that was popular back when the initial interaction occurred. Boom - I have this panic attack. 

Thankfully, I’m alone in the office for now. I work my way out of it - it’s nothing new - I have tools for this sort of thing (Thanks mental health professionals!). I intellectually understand why my brain did this but boy could I have done without it.

721,how do i find the courage to get help/therapy?,1,11ru2jd,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11ru2jd/how_do_i_find_the_courage_to_get_helptherapy/,2,"before anything, this isn't me trying to self-diagnose myself with anxiety, it's simply something i've thought about for a long time as there are a lot of hints that i might have it

i think the way i mentally/emotionally feel unwell must've *started* at some point in 7th grade (2012-2013). as i didn't know how to really handle it, i never bothered trying to do something about it until 9th grade in 2016 when i decided to meet our middle school councelor. we just had one single meeting in which he told me i was just imagining things. not sure why but i convinced myself that it was true until i decided to meet our high school councelor in 2017, this time she understood that i *actually* wasn't feeling well after all but i didn't have more than two or so meetings with her for reasons i can't even remember

my last year in high school (2018-2019) i went to the school nurse instead as i drastically lost an insane amount of weight in a short period of time. between our meetings i went to make tests at a health center and when i told her that there physically wasn't anything wrong with me she understood that this weight loss was one of the results of me mentally/emotionally not doing well. she was genuinely worried about it and wanted to help me but when her way of doing it was to give me a time limit of one month to seek therapy, i got way too anxious to do it and just in general didn't feel ready. we had our next meeting after that month had passed, she got mad that i didn't seek help without letting me explain why and shortly after i graduated high school

tldr i went around 7 years without getting 'proper' help and since i didn't never did anything about it i gradually felt worse and worse as time passed

by the time i graduated high school in 2019 i'd become so used to procrastinating at least *trying* to get help, or pretty much got so used to feeling too scared to do it thinking that meeting someone would just end up the same way as it always has. so now it's been 10-11 years without seeing someone, at this point i feel straight up terrible on a near daily basis and i've only become even more scared of reaching out for help (side-note this might also be because of possible social anixety as there are an insane amount of hints of that too lmao)

honestly i just want to talk to someone about my health and find out if i actually would be diagnosed with anxiety, not for the sake of 'having a label' but because i want to know where i stand, if i'm actually just imagining everything after all, and if there overall is something i can do/get some sort of help to not feel as bad as i'm do today

one last thing that's stopping me from doing it is that i have a feeling of where the *root* to all the issues i have lies and that too i'm just awfully scared of confronting. like *that's* something i don't want confirmed because i just straight up don't know how i'll process it. ultimately i still know though that the bare minimum i can do is to at least *try* but after so much time has passed with me getting used to pretty much not do anything about it i don't know how to do it

How do I cozy up to this so I can live free and really enjoy life

I was referred to a OCD specialist as a kid but as a got older I tackled a lot of my anxiety and got to a point where I could function pretty normally.

Right now I see so many videos of people doing adventurous things that I’d want to do but I’m way to scared to do. Ppl do like backpacking trips or back country snowboarding, and these are normal people, not crazies doing these things but they are able to do these things. 

Me I’m too afraid that if I go backpacking I’ll break a leg, or have some sort of medical emergency and be too far away, or I’ll get into a car crash miles and miles away from home and die in a strange place. 

It’s not like I’m totally afraid of adrenaline. I loveeee to skate and especially snowboard. I’m quite good at both (not exceptional by any stretch), but people who have less control of their boards go wayyyyy bigger than me and do really sick tricks, whereas me I have the skill needed but am too afraid to try. I really want to have the same bravery as others, I think I would have so much more fun. When I can muster up courage I’ve done things that get cheers from the chairlift riders

A problem is I form fear responses really easily. Weird enough I have a pretty good pain tolerance. I can fall suppeeeeer hard and not be hurt or break something, also though I’ve broken bones and not really realized it. The problem is after I take one of these falls I get terrified to try it again and it sets me back, whereas others who actually feel hurt preserve and land the trick.

Last snowboard session I got scared from something that didn’t happen to me. I was snowboarding with my friend and we were doing small jumps, but it was icy. He hit a jump, but caught an edge and broke his collar bone. After that it ruined my courage for snowboarding that day, and I packed it in an hour early. My friend I was boarding with didn’t try to make me feel bad, but I could tell she was kinda disgusted with my cowardice, she wasn’t scared after friend got hurt. When I got home even my mom told me I’m kind of a wimp

This is a lot of TMI, I just like to vent but my question is how do I accept that the things I want to do may injure me or straight up kill me, but still persist in a measured way? I’m good at measuring but persisting is hard cuz there’s always the chance I’ll die doing these things.",1678879439.0

I recently started taking creatine probably about 4-5 months ago, I saw positive physical results within a month or so. But over the last 4/5 weeks I have been experiencing extreme anxiety/panic attacks and feeling as though I am in danger or something bad will happen when being the tiniest bit out of my comfort zone I mean even being alone in the house with nobody to go to if something goes wrong.

This is something I’ve never experienced before and I’m not sure what has brought it on, it’s like it came out the blue, it’s effecting my life, for example I feel as though I can’t drive too far from home incase something happens and I’ve recently cancelled a holiday to Budapest.

As a result of this and with doing some research creatine is something I am going to stop taking to see if it is indeed the creatine consumption, if anyone is interested I can can update on how I feel after a week off it, but I’d also like to know if anyone else has experienced this or anything similar with creatine.

I love him a lot, really a lot (being so attached to him makes my emotions, my feelings are x10000) and my anxiety too...

I'm someone who is (ADHD (diagnosed) + autism doubts) HE knows all about it of course he's very nice about it!

In 3 years, he has enormously endured my fear of telling him ""I'm afraid of losing you, that you're leaving me..."" It's always been the same fears on repeat for 3 years!

When I'm anxious, I always want us to talk together for hours and hours.. but talk about what? - About the same fears, I can talk for 1 hour about why I'm afraid he'll leave, why I feel he's distant with me (when not)

He put up with all that a lot, for at least 2 years he tried to reassure me a lot, to help me... but he sees (and he knows it doesn't work) and he's right... he told me ""I love you, I want to stay with you, I don't see myself with another boy etc..""

&#x200B;

But deep down, I believe him but somewhere in my head it doesn't work... He tells me all the time ""Do you think that if I didn't love you I would still be here?""

For several months I see that he has given up since he knows he can say all the nice words in the world to me, it will start again.. He told me that he was exhausted, that he would like that it stops and that we enjoy our relationship together, that I am happy...

Because when I'm anxious it shows, I can't hide it, I'm sad, I'm going around in circles, I'm isolated in the room and as he says to me ""You suck my energy because you're afraid of to be abandoned is an irrational fear.

I would have liked some advice from you... YOU should know that I hardly ever go outside... I am very shy, and I'm a little afraid of people's eyes, I don't go to the gym because of that, I spend my days working behind the computer and being sad/anxious because I'm afraid he'll leave me, so my head is only occupied with that..

I'm looking for support, especially advice that will help me.. I had seen that some people managed to fight anxiety by giving themselves goals, day after day...

I do not wish to have therapy, I have already tried and I have been humiliated several times by the person who I thought was going to help me, but just told me that I was a ""victim, that I gave up because of obstacles in my life""

He doesn't talk to me anymore about his problems of his anxiety, because when I did it I wasn't here for him, or I made him understood that's not the right time for it, I feel horrible about that, he cried a lot.

Now it was more or less confirmed this all happened through their computer so I should be cleared, but what scares me is that delivery drivers get the customers phone numbers on the receipt just incase we struggle with some funky locations and need help from them.

i have this constant intrusive thought of ""i'm god,"" like EVERY SINGLE THOUGHT IS FOLLOWED BY IT unless i'm heavily distracted. i'm not even religious and it's sparking up weird religious thoughts which worries me, but the worst part is that i'm experiencing emotional numbness right now so i'm worried that i'm going to start believing it, so it's genuinely constantly on my mind + evolving because of my overactive imagination (my sketchbook is my bible, etc.) i know i'm not some supernatural being or anything, i'm just a 17 year old kid, constantly battling this one specific thought. i continuously have to rationalize, analyze and push away this thought. accepting it in any way is probably the scariest thing to me right now. i'm beginning to be convinced i actually believe this thought and for a split second i accept it but then immediately push it away because i don't want to believe it and start doing things like telling people i'm the second coming or something and start doing whatever i want cause i think i'm immortal or something. i am still able to function normally though,

the only reason why this thought popped up is because i constantly read schizocd posts for 3 months straight and everyone brought up the fear of delusions and noted a common delusion in each post, being people believing they're god. this also goes hand in hand with my fear of mania/bipolar and just losing control in general. i am also constantly i'm checking myself to see if i said anything about me being god or something and even get intrusive urges to just blurt it out to my family and friends. i honestly just want my memory erased so i can forget about the past 3 months and return to my normal self, this is excruciating and i would love to be sedated for a good 5 years or so, just so my brain can completely reset or something.

i've posted on this sub a lot but hopefully this is my last post as i'm getting better at distancing myself from reddit and other online forums, also i've been seeking therapy and other services for OCD. any advice/stories about the backdoor spike and numbness after getting over a theme would be great.",1678852363.0

756,Pet related anxiety?,3,11rgxiz,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11rgxiz/pet_related_anxiety/,0,"Hi all!

I've experienced anxiety before, the most prominent times being in high school and after my first break up. But since then, my anxiety has only peaked to making me almost non-functional when related to my pets. I'm a vet nurse, so I see a lot of illness. I have bunnies, and for those who don't know, bunnies are extremely delicate pets. Everything from their teeth, to spine, to GI tracts, to feet are so, so complex. Gastrointestinal stasis (GI stasis or ileus) is their #1 concern, which means their GI tracts have essentially shut down, which will kill them very quickly. They require 24/7 access to hay/food to maintain a steady, continuous in-and-out of food and fecals. If they don't eat within an 8 hour time period, that's an emergency and fatal within the next 24 hours. 

So, with that being said, both of my bunnies have had stasis previously, one more than the other. My youngest has had stasis once, last July, and it was terrible. Stasis requires around the clock care, from subq fluids, syringe feeding every 4 hours, gut motility meds, pain meds, gas meds, massages to move the gas, etc. It's a lot, and knowing it can go downhill and kill them so quickly is terrifying. My youngest wouldn't swallow her special food when syringe fed, she was in so much pain it would literally drip out of her mouth and make her so stressed out she would groan and do anything to get away. It took a week soul-crushing treatment, and since then I've had a lot of anxiety regarding her. 

I've spoken to others, talked through it, written myself letters trying to explain why she's currently fine and if anything did happen, I was the most capable person being a vet nurse to make sure she was taken care of, etc. I've meditated, done breathing exercises, etc. 

The letters to myself initially really helped. It felt like the biggest relief off of my back. And at any point where I felt that smidge of anxiety, I'd just reread the letters, and it helped immediately. But two months ago I started taking wellbutrin and also started birth control a few weeks later. I got off the wellbutrin because it didn't seem to help me (I was on it for weight loss, not depression), and I've been having nightly, horrific anxiety to the point I'm going insane. Checking her constantly, like literally keeping eyes on her at all times and watching her every move to ensure she's not showing any signs of pain. I stopped the birth control, because I feel as though that may have contributed to the sudden anxiety. It's only been a few days, but god, I'm suffering. My chest feels as though it's going to explode. I'm waking up during the night to be able to check on her. I feel like I can't leave the house for too long or else I'll miss something. Like, I got them a cardboard house last week, and she's favored it recently as a place to sit, and now my anxiety is focusing on her and telling me she's sitting in it because she's in pain/uncomfortable/wants to hide. 

The few times the anxiety has steered away from her, or I've been able to convince myself she's fine, it's just sitting there and makes it hard to do anything. My heart is just racing. 

Please tell me I'm not alone. I don't know what to do.",1678841813.0

For the last month or so I’ve been having these terrible bouts of anxiety which are causing me chest pain/ fast heart rate/ SOB/ etc. Once I’m able to talk myself down, I feel completely better. I know this is anxiety because it never happens when I’m with my boyfriend where I feel safe. When this happens, I start to convince myself that I’m having arm pain or neck/jaw pain which ultimately ends in me scouring the web to see if there’s a chance I’m having a heart attack. I’m on hormonal birth control & have a history of vaping, so I also always go to the thought that I have a blood clot and am going to die. This is SO EXHAUSTING. I am so scared to do ANYTHING. Does anyone have any advice on how to calm down or control myself when I get like this? I’ve had anxiety for almost 10 years, but never this bad. I genuinely don’t know what to do, it is ruining my life. Please help me.

Ever since my first panic attack(Late October of 2022), I’ve been experiencing night sweats without any fever or fatigue. I was never like this through out my life. I haven’t really put much thought into since my other anxiety issues have been taking over my thoughts through out these past few months. I don’t take any meds yet & I’ve been improving slightly without them. However, a couple of days ago just when I was feeling much better, I woke up in the middle of the night with a sweaty shirt. I usually just brush it off and continue with my business. These events tend to happen even when I feel like I’m not really worried or anxious. Then again, I’ve recently developed anxiety so idk if it’s my subconscious mind. What threw me off this time was seen my forehead with sweat on it. The thing is, they don’t tend to happen if I’m wearing a jacket or sweater. Like it’s fucking weird. I immediately did my research at three in the morning and I haven’t been the same since. My anxiety has skyrocketed again. I’m already scheduled to talk with my doctor later this month but now I literally can’t wait much longer. I’ve gotten blood work done three times in the ER. Usually my results come back okay. My WBC came as mild leukocytosis but that was due to my panic attack during that time. It usually drops once I’m calmed. Can anyone else relate?",1678848874.0

I started at a new school back in august and since my social anxiety is through the roof, I was super excited when this girl (I'll call her Dee) came up and started chatting. She is now the closest friend I have in school.  It turns out we like a lot of the same things and want to pursue very similar careers in performing arts. But when you put us next to each other, it's like night and day. Dee is very extroverted and loud. She bounces uncontrollably when she's excited, and she's not afraid to sing in front of the entire school or butt into a conversation. I am very quiet, reserved, and anxious. Almost everyone in our grade finds Dee's constant energy off-putting and annoying, so they don't want to hang out with her.

So here's the problem. I'm starting to get annoyed too. She won't leave me alone. We constantly meet up outside of school, and whenever I tell her about some movie I watched, she always suggests we watch it together. The two of us sit at lunch, but it's gotten to the point where we don't talk. Whenever she speaks, a wave of irritation overcomes me. But I can't just leave her, since her feelings might be hurt and I'll feel guilty. She doesn't deserve that, because she's one of the nicest people I've ever met. But there have been several opportunities for Dee to get to know other people and she's thrown them away every time because she's so obsessed with following me.

Whenever I think of Dee, I feel immense discomfort, because, on paper, she's everything I want to be. A kind, social, multi-talented artist who is completely confident in her abilities. And as many times as Dee compliments me, I feel like I'll never have half her level of confidence. I know that one of you is gonna tell me that maybe she's struggling and her entire attitude is a disguise, but I've known her for long enough, and if that were the case I would've noticed the cracks.

Now I realize that if  I were confident and outgoing, I'd probably be treated the same way as Dee. Dee might not let it affect her, but it would definitely affect me. I like to be alone most of the time, but I also want to overcome my social anxiety and make new friends. I feel like I can't when Dee is always on me, which triggers all these insecurities.

I've tried to talk to my therapist about it but it's different than when I write it and I need more than one source of advice. Please Help.",1678847487.0

I’ve suffered with anxiety my whole like and my boyfriend has been nothing but supportive since we’ve been together. I’ve been on bc since before I met him. About 3 or so months into our relationship we started getting intimate and sex became a regular thing. We’ve always been very careful and always been on birth control and used a condom. However around january i switched my birth control for unrelated reasons. This required me taking a pregnancy test. For some reason this set something off in my head and ever since I’ve been scared to do anything intimate at all. My boyfriend is very supportive and is trying to help work through this situation with me but even though i know logically that there are little to no chances i cant stand the thought of pregnancy. Hes spoken to me about this and assured me that even if anything happened he would stick by my side and find a solution for us but even still it feels like my anxiety is protecting me from getting pregnant. Even just the thought of getting horny now makes me panic to the point where i cant even make out with him. He is trying his best to understand and support me but i also know that he has sexual desires which i cant bring myself to fulfil. I dont know if i want to overcome this anxiety because it feels like it’s protecting me and i would almost prefer to spend my life without any sexual activity if it meant i didnt have the risk of getting pregnant. I know that it’s a crazy low percentage but even any small percentage makes me nervous. I dont know why this happened because we were perfectly fine doing things before. There was even a time where the condom split and i didnt panic about it. Is what i’m feeling normal? any advice?,1678843622.0

context is i'm a high school senior (f, 18) who broke up with a boyfriend 2 months ago that goes to the same school and keeps coming back to me. he's very angry at me behind my back (he rants about me w my friends) but asked me to be friends and basically begged me to be there for emotional support when he needs it. recently he said he's been having violent thoughts whenever he sees me, and has been telling my friends to block me. anyway that's a whole other story, but essentially i feel really stressed and on-edge near him. 

every time he dms me, basically confronting me abt the relationship that ended, i instantly feel a rise in heart rate and start to feel really really cold (esp hands). i also have full body tremors that go on for a solid while (15-30 mins or until i feel less stressed). i also feel really worried and anxious and i would love to ignore him but my mind can't focus on anything else.  i also have been having sleep paralysis and i've always suffered from insomnia tbh. when i try too hard to sleep my mind is racing and i see bursts of colors and i feel really active

it's not just his messages that trigger it but i also feel this stressful response before going on stage for performing or before exams, but to a lesser extent. i'm also wondering if it might be social anxiety, as i've always been a shy person but realized that recently it's been preventing me from doing normal things. i've been performing my instrument for most of my life but recently developed stage fright. i also physically cannot use my voice in certain situations like when i want to participate in class. idk i just find it impossible to raise my hand even tho i rly want to. i also find it extremely tiring to hang out with friends so i've been avoiding that. even the idea of going on vacation is not as fun as it should be. when i go on walks outside i feel stressed when a car drives by or if another person walks by. i'm scared for college because i feel like i won't be able to make friends and i'll hate it there. 

other potential symptoms that i've had for basically my entire life is picking at my lips until they bleed and also feeling like something bad will happen soon(esp when i'm happy).

It's causing me to regress and spiral into a person I thought I would never be again. Is this just life? Every night I lay in bed afraid, when I'm not numbing myself with benzos (I'm trying to stop, I know).

I watched the Last Of Us episode where Joel says every night he feels like he's failing in his sleep. This line made me cry because it resonated with me so much. 

I would never kill myself, but I would love to go to sleep and not wake up again, just so I don't have to be afraid anymore.",1678772381.0
810,how am I supposed to avoid or work through triggers when just living is the trigger?,4,11r5fzn,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11r5fzn/how_am_i_supposed_to_avoid_or_work_through/,15,"My anxiety has gotten to the point where it's physically painful. I know that once I'm out of bed I can go about my day and at least fake it until I'm back in my room and alone, but just the step from my bed to outside my door feels like I'm trying to jump a canyon.

I live with my parents still, I've tried to move out several times but can't find anywhere inexpensive enough to be affordable, even working as much as I do. Just facing them, even though I know they won't judge me or that I've done anything to be judged, is painful.

I'm constantly afraid of nothing, or the thought of what could happen when there's no rational reason to believe anything could go wrong. And I know it's irrational, but even when I try to take time for myself I feel guilty or scared because I feel irresponsible for just wanting a day where I do nothing. I'm in a constant loop in my head of wanting to take care of myself when it gets bad, but then feeling afraid of either doing so, or actually doing it and feeling more afraid of what someone may say.

I shake, I don't sleep right, every day all I can think about is crawling back in bed, but then I panic because I know if I fall asleep then I'll just have to wake up and be faced with that fear of walking out of my door.

I've reached a point where I'm afraid of everything, people and living makes me panic, even being around the people I love is frightening. The only thing rational about that one, or at least the only form of anxiety I experience that I can understand is that one, because I don't want the people I love to see me like this, or feel upset if I have to walk away from them.

My head pounds, my chest feels heavy, I want to get out of bed but can't without shaking, I'm so tired of it. I'm literally sick of myself. I want to push through, I want to fight this, and I hate the fact that when I do, I'm in constant mental pain that bleeds out into my body and makes me feel horrible.",1678798770.0

I can't take my mind off the fear of the spasms coming on suddenly in future interactions with no way to control them.

I’ll add context first; my partner isn’t currently working (got laid off), and lately he’s been acting stupid and funny, which he’s not always like. One day I get home from running an errand, and he was…normal. He wasn’t being silly, he cleaned the bathroom and bedroom, he was just different. This was the first set of alarm bells for me. 

Now for what happened. His phone was flat and I was being nice by charging it for him while he played his tablet. If the tablet goes flat, he uses his phone instead. The charger is on my side of the bed, so obviously his phone is there. Now that his phone is charged, his alarm goes off. It went off this morning, I reached over to turn it off and noticed a message from a familiar person, a woman. I was too tired to process it, but it clicked just before. This wasn’t anyone, this is the woman my partner has brought drugs off in the past (he use to do drugs a lot before we met). I thought to myself, why did she message him? I turned his screen on, and her message said “pay me please”. Everything has clicked. The reason he went from being silly, to calm and doing all this cleaning for no reason, I’m pretty sure he went and got drugs. He doesn’t have money which is probably why she sent that text. To clarify, I haven’t looked through his phone and I won’t. That’s the message that’s on the screen. I’m not 100% sure that’s what happened, I’m probably jumping to conclusion.

I even had a major panic attack two days ago.

Now, my anxiety often revolves around my health and is often triggered by believing I am ill or that my presence is jepardized by something or someone. As a true hypochondriac I am always hyper aware of my body and cannot stop paying attention to it, waiting to notice any weird sensations.

10 days ago I started feeling a bit stiff at the area of my neck and lower head (i do an office job where stiffness is not unusual) and I started obsessing over it, stretching, exercising, putting warm compress etc. The more I started paying attention to it the more painful it got, and eventually i started feeling that soreness all the way in the head. 

I have been so anxious for 10 days and I was not able to get rid of it the common ways (exercising, walking, socializing) 

Eventually i started feeling fatigued and altogether I cannot stop thinking about worst-case scenarios and cannot stop believing I am terminally ill.

Now my question guys is how to be able to differentiate between physical symptoms and anxiety symptoms?
I have been to multiple therapists and honestly none of them were able to help much. 

I feel like even if all of this was only anxiety induced, one day I won't visit a doctor cause I will think it is a false alarm, as always

I have had anxiety my whole life, but in the latter years of my life I’ve noticed my anxiety is usually based around health fears which I see is a pretty popular on this sub so that makes me feel a little less alone at least. The only other anxiety base for me that lies outside of health is that I have a hard time driving, but we can save that for another post for another day. 

I have more often than not have been getting random heart palpitations. These palpitations have not caused me any pain, but are quite annoying because all they do is send me into further worrying the longer they last. I have been getting them more and more in the last year and I’m curious if this is something I should waste my time getting checked out because I rather not waste my money if I get told it’s nothing/ an anxiety symptom. 

My heart palpitations can last days, not continuous but on and off at random intervals. I use to think it was connected to my caffeine consumption but anytime I get these I quit all caffeine cold turkey and it doesn’t seem to make them go away any faster. 

Just curious on how many others experiences these and how to deal with them effectively. They don’t seem to be connected to any specific stressors or events and will often start up as soon as I wake up.

Nobody here smokes and our back porch isn't really where people would knock to come in. The butt was on the porch though. And I've been home all day every day for weeks bc I homeschool one of my kids. Whoever left the butt did not knock. Somebody is always home here.

Then today I noticed a stick leaning against my porch window. It was 100% not there an hour earlier bc I was looking at the butt through that window an hour earlier. The way it's laying is completely vertical and it looks carefully placed. If my cats found a stick on the porch I have no idea how they set it the way it sets. 

I took a picture of it, but can't post here. And I'm feeling really unsettled with the combination of the cigarette butt and now the stick. I'm definitely having my partner set up a camera tonight. I don't understand why somebody would put a stick there like that. I'm 40 years old and have like one friend and she would not do something like this to mess with me.

Sorry for the long post!

I’ve recently been going through a severe flare up of panic/constant anxiety that makes me unable to sit still and want to harm myself. 

I was totally fine up until this point - I had seemingly one intrusive thought of “life is pointless” toward the end of the week of working from home while my son was on school vacation, and it immediately snowballed into a panic attack later on with other intrusive thoughts of harming myself, derealization the next day, and then this constant panicky feeling ever since. I feel like I can’t sit still because I’m physically uncomfortable, time is literally CRAWLING, and I can’t really distract myself much.

I went to the hospital and they told me they think it’s Akathisia from a med I’d just gone up in dosage on about two months prior, so we cut that med out completely about 6 days ago now. I’ve been having waves of panic/severe anxiety still. But I’m wondering if my depression was kind of there getting worse without me really knowing and just showed up in this sudden burst of anxiety? It’s been a very long, gray, cold winter too.

I’m terrified to take any meds for fear of making the supposed akathisia worse, but I’m also scared of not taking something for my depression/anxiety because it could make this last way longer than it needs to.

Usually my depression shows up as lack of motivation to do anything. And if I do feel anxiety, it’s incredibly mild and easy to manage. I’ve been loving my job, was having really no stressors in life, going to therapy, on good meds, really happy, and then this seems to have come from literally nowhere!

I’ve been almost obsessing over trying to figure out what caused it to happen, otherwise I can’t do a whole lot to fix it.

I have a lot of anxiety starting work both when I work from home and when I go into the office 2 times a week. Some of this may be related to my last job that I had to quit due to my mental health and a toxic work environment. I’m on my first month at my new job and it isn’t toxic at all. I do also get anxious when I meet with my boss. My old boss really shook my self esteem and confidence and was down right mean to me. My new boss is the opposite but I worry I might not be doing enough. 

I get crazy anxiety when I’m working from home and my husband leaves for work. He gives me snuggles and reassurance but it doesn’t seem to help. It has made him at least 30 minutes late sometimes. Once he is gone I am fine. 

Similarly, when my husband leaves to see his long term girlfriend (polyam) I feel so much anxiety. Once he is gone I am okay even if it is multiple days. I don’t want to have this transition anxiety because it makes him feel really guilty which I don’t want since I am 100% okay with their relationship. 

Growing up I always had anxious stomach before school even though it wasn’t bad when I got there. 

It is the same when I’m going out to see people. I have a ton of anxiety just trying to get out of the door. It is also little things like I have so much anxiety thinking about getting in the shower even though it is fine once I’m in there. 

Does anyone have any advice for helping to manage this anxiety? I am trying to switch from gabapentin from klonopin but it isn’t going perfectly.

Despite having graduated from a film school, I have no professional experience to speak of, and this has made it extremely difficult for me to break into the industry.

The film industry is notoriously competitive, and it can be difficult to get a foot in the door without some kind of previous experience or industry connections. I find myself constantly worrying about how I will be able to build a career in this field when I am starting from scratch.

I am passionate about film and editing, and I know that this is the path I want to take in life. But the reality of my situation is daunting. I feel like I am running out of time to make something of myself, and I worry that my lack of experience will be a roadblock that I won't be able to overcome.

It's frustrating to have dedicated so much time and effort to my education, only to find that it's not enough to land me a job. I know that there are many others in the same position as me, but that doesn't make it any less stressful.

I am determined to find a way to break into the film industry and build a successful career, but the anxiety of my current situation is ever-present. I hope that with persistence and hard work, I will be able to overcome this hurdle and make a name for myself in this field.

I have been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), and as a result, I find that my worries are present at all times. GAD is a mental health condition characterized by excessive and persistent worry and anxiety about a wide range of different issues.

Living with GAD can be extremely challenging. It feels like my worries are always in the background, just waiting to bubble up and take over at any moment. Even when I'm not consciously thinking about something that worries me, I can feel a sense of unease and tension in my body.

My anxiety can be triggered by almost anything, from small everyday concerns to major life events. Sometimes it can be difficult to pinpoint exactly what's causing my anxiety, which can make it even more challenging to manage.

I know I'm not the only one who has to deal with this, if you have it too I want you to know that you are not alone and I understand you. ",1678798674.0

What can I actually do to SEE and FEEL some real actual change.

Then it hit me like a ton of bricks.

My unconscious mind came up with a solution I was so desperate for, because it's like that. When you really are desperate for something - the deepest part of your mind (the unconscious) comes to rescue you.

So, you're reading this. You're anxious. You're stuck. Right? You feel like you're basically in this spiral of anxiety.

Now, some of you have more severe anxiety while some of you have more moderate and others light anxiety.

Regardless, what can you do to really see some change no matter the severity of your anxiety?

I have an answer for you and you're gonna love it - try it and tell me it doesn't work.

Now this is what I call ""Holding Your Feet To The Fire"" - what this really implies is that when we are anxious we are escaping the fire, right. But with this you are FACING the fire.

Why?

Because anxiety is a flight response, but it's more complicated. Anxiety is more like a fractal... in the sense that it's an infinite loop. Let me give you an illustration of how this works: 

I am anxious about ABC => I shouldn't think about ABC => I am more anxious now because I am trying to not think about ABC => ABC keeps popping into my mind, I need to STOP thinking about it => ABC is carving a larger presence in my mind, I CANNOT stop thinking about ABC => ABC is getting stronger and I keep pushing it out but nothing is helping => ABC is dominating my mind => .... on to infinity

Does this infinite loop sound familiar to you, at all? It should.. because this is the root of anxiety.

It's an endless spiral. An abyss. It's a no-mans land. A fractal... leading nowhere.

There is ONE KEY theme here => pay close attention: The Key here is AVOIDANCE.

It's so paradoxical.

You would think avoiding negative thinking would help... IT DOES NOT. It LITERALLY SENDS YOU STRAIGHT TO THIS HELL SPIRAL.

I mean think of it - how many times has avoiding negative thinking actually helped you?

So now we have to go back to the premise of Facing The Fire - we must face it without reservation.

Face it head on. 

Literally. Every. Single. Negative. Thought. That. Comes. In. Your. Head. Surrender. To. It. And. Face. It. Head. On.

You can do this in sessions and eventually prolong it.

For example, go lie down in bed for 10 minutes.. put on some music - and in those 10 minutes I want you to face every single thing in your mind head on.

The rule is you must NOT avoid it, push it away or resist in any way.

Then go for 20 minutes.

Then do 30 minutes.

Then 1 hour.

Then 2 Hours. 

The point is.. you're going to so fundamentally change your biochemistry because you have stopped running.

Eventually what happens is anxiety runs out of fuel. It simply cannot exist. There is no threat.. and how can there be a threat? You're accepting everything in your mind. You've stopped avoiding thoughts.

Anxiety will be a thing of the past.

Remember the Franklin D. Roosevelt quote: ""The Only Thing We Have To Fear Is Fear Itself""

THIS applies to you. Let me reword it for this case - the only thing you have to fear is avoidance.

Avoidance will send you into that spiral of hell... within your own mind.

It's time to stop avoiding and start facing your mind. 

And I'll be honest... this process of facing your mind is not going to be pleasant. It's going to be painful. It's going to be tormenting.

But this is a gradual build up. Remember - spend 10 minutes then 20 minutes. Work your way up etc.

But you know what's even more painful?

Spending the rest of your life in fear. Now it's time to escape anxiety but FACING the thoughts in your mind.

I cannot be more clear. You have to, you must stop avoiding your mind - that is a path that leads no where.

Disclaimer - I am not a psychologist. I am someone who has anxiety and has a fair interest in psychology simply sharing a revelation my mind had out of the blue. Like I said, out of desperation I wanted an answer and my mind just came up with this. I'll be honest I wrote this non stop. This wasn't really planned but free flowing.

Hope this helps because this helped me a TON. Now there's finally a way out of this hell hole of anxiety ,and I'm sure you can appreciate that. :)",1678758180.0

I could take some (for lack of a better word) special meds, which were prescribed to me in case i had any panic attacks. Ive only had to use it once so far, it did work splendidly, but i am reluctant to take it right now. Thats is because i think it may be a medical condition.

I went straight to google as per usual and found that eating disorders can cause heart problems. The eating thing is fairly new to me, so I don't think it could already be causing damage?

When I exercise it's fairly normal, and goes up to about 120 safely, I don't get any chest pains or anything.. Should I be concerned? This has been bothering me a lot.",1678788293.0

As a result, since then, I have a constant thinking in my head - the op of the head.

It goes up and down according to how much I use my brain (I know how to think/meditate and all that). So if I am watching a movie, no sensation. If I am trying to think - I get the tingling.

I feel like I have been lifting too much, something broke and I need to heal and try to lift again.

I’ve already booked a doctors appointment. It was some nausea and heart palpitations at first. Then I got shaking, chest pain (as if someone was holding a heavy object on my chest) shortness of breath, and dizziness. I work in busy food service so my job is somewhat stressful and a few days ago during a really busy evening I had to completely stop since all of these symptoms came up along with a headache, eventually I threw up in the bathroom and went home. My boss told me I should take some time off. I’ve been under some stress lately with personal issues but I’ve never experienced anything like this before. I’m worried it might be a thyroid issue, or heart disease but my family doesn’t have any history of that but I do take birth control which increases my risk of those two things. My symptoms have been getting better over the past 2 days but the palpitations/chest pain isn’t subsiding.

I had been barely leaving the house, which I'm not sure was anxiety or just habit, but after a big (15+ year) breakup I had to increase my hours to afford to live. This meant going back to the office in person and to start going out socially again. I quickly got comfortable again with going everywhere. Occasionally there'd be a sick person on the tube or on the street but there would just be mild tutting in my head that they were out and about. 

Today I arrive at the office and my colleague who sits next to me is looking really unwell and he says he has a cold. I think I answer quite awkwardly and then go and get a coffee/sit down and start work.

He is FULL of cold. Sniffling and spluttering and coughing it starts as annoying and eventually begins freaking me out. Eventually after a big coughing fit I try my best to be polite and say he really should be at home if he's so bad. He shrugs and says he needs to be in a meeting. I tell him it's quite upsetting me and I'm going to leave the office to work from home.

I'm in tears by the time I'm at the car because just knowing I was going to be right next to someone so unwell and sharing doors/kitchen with them was a guarantee that I was going to fall ill too and that thought sent me into a panic.

I really wanted to stay in the office since I have meetings too and there's a big lunch celebration for closing some business. I have no idea if this was a disproportionate response or not but I knew I couldn't sit all day next to him.",1678785376.0

So I have been dealing with anxiety for fucking FOREVER now and it sometimes makes me really suicidal. This week (march 6 to 12) has been absolutely awful and it hasn't gotten any better. I find myself crying alone almost every single day, I haven't been eaten much (maybe 3 full meals in 5 days) and my sleep has been horrible. Even when I sleep 8 hours or close, I still wake up tired as hell and it lingers all day. This is a mental prison and I don't know what to do with myself anymore!!  
Sometimes, anxiety would give me physical symptoms like awful back pains, migraines, nausea, vomiting, itchy skin (just me??), chest pains, to name a few...  


Even with all of this though, I sometimes feel like without my anxiety, life would be strange..  
Is it because I am way too used to it that it would feel unnatural to not have it anymore? 

I've read posts in the past of people 'in recovery' from their bad anxiety (CONGRATZ to all of you going through this!!) and I sometimes think to myself that it must be a little weird and unnatural (or unreal) to not feel that way when you have for so long. I sometimes feel like it's a part of me or that I deserve it in a way.

Even thinking about recovering myself or getting into meds or therapy, there is still this back of the head thought that life will be too strange without it.

Anxiety does rob me from a lot of things, but I also feel like it helps me stay conscious of the bad things that may potentially happen in the future. Like if I didn't have this anxiety, something may happen right under my nose and I didn't have the overthinking or the paranoia that would've maybe stopped it...

Usually, she was cursing them out for something, even if it's something my parents had spent that same day doing stuff with her for hours.  She also always complain of something hurting and needing her ""nerve pills"" (Xanax, ffs) very often.  So my father, mother, uncle (Dad's bro) and his wife have been chatting for days about the next move.

She finally hurt herself.  She said her neck hurt but every time previously that she said that, it was just a ""Crick,"" as we say in the south, in her neck.  Just muscular stuff that would heal in a couple days.  This time, they did the same diagnostic routine but found that one of her upper vertebrae was broken!  She had fallen in the floor then called people.  My dad got there, and found her like that.  She was living in an assisted living place and they hadn't found her yet.  So it had pretty much JUST happened.  EMT came and got here and she continued on about her neck on the ride to the hospital.

She's been in the hospital for days.  My parents are about ten minutes down the road, versus my uncle and his wife, who are several hours away.  So my Dad, along with being the oldest sibling, kind of had to take on the role of the person who chats with hospital staff at 4:00 a.m. about her freaking out (and taking her Philadelphia collar off (no one knows how??????), because he's the closest.  My uncle's wife (my Aunt, although I have a hard time calling her that after this series of events), has apparently been interjecting stuff and suggesting diagnoses along with treatments because my Grandma is in a ""rural"" hospital.  My aunt is a stay-at-home-mom, not at all affiliated with any sort of hospital or something like that.  I've been hospitalized 20 times for Psychiatric and a couple physical ailments.  I know how hospitals operate and have a base level for what to expect.  Two of those hospitalizations were in my hometown, where my Grandmother is.  They were AWESOME!  And they are partnered with the best University hospital group in the country so...  Ugh!

It is so sad to see.  I've held myself together well.  My parents, and even my doctor, (Psychiatrist) who I saw about half an hour prior to this posting, says I am processing this stuff really well.  But I don't know how much more I can take.  It's breaking my heart.  My Grandma always loved me, told me I was beautiful, and capable, and that I'm special.  My mother's mother was the opposiste, leading to eating disorders amongst other things.

How can I support my family?  Because my Grandmother keeps taking her collar off, they are paying someone to sit with her when they are unable to.  They cannot afford it and my father and mother will be the ones paying for it, not his brother.  I have no car, or *I* would be sitting with her.

As of last night, they have strapped her arms down now, so that she cannot take the collar off or move her neck in any way that could paralyze her, at the very least.  It breaks my fucking heart!  She doesn't really know what's going on.  She just recognizes people and panics depending on if they do what she wants, sit down with her, or what.  But as to the context of being in the hospital and why, she doesn't get it.  They are now considering sedating her as well.

I would love some virtual hugs.  This stuff is crazy.  And it hurts to know other people have felt similar things.  :/",1678738698.0

But my mind immediately begins to wonder if he has just changed his mind and wants to stop seeing me 🙃

Has anyone else dealt with these thought patterns and found a way to overcome them? I feel like they mostly stem from insecurity (he’s so cool and I’m not, I can’t believe he wants to hang out with me, etc etc etc) but they become very real and physical feelings in my body and it sucks.

Well recently instead of just gagging, I’m just throwing up now, small amounts, around 3 times a day if it’s a bad day, or once if it’s a good day. Today I threw up in the trash can in class and in the trash can at home, so 2. 

The things that seem to trigger it are:
- talking about it
- thinking about hospitals (just had bad experience)
- getting too full triggers my gag reflex
- drinking too much liquids makes it easier to come back up
- anything else that used to make me nervous like thinking about presenting stuff 

It’s weird because other that that, I don’t really seem to have anxiety. When I filled out the anxiety checklist at my drs, I usually score quite low for anxiety. I don’t get why low anxiety is giving me such severe physical symptoms. I’ve never had an eating disorder and don’t think I have one now. Any ideas?",1678763766.0

This one effect has been the most troublesome for others to understand. People who don't suffer an anxiety disorder can sort of wrap their heads around some of it because everyone feels anxious or panic from time to time. But for me to tell people, ""I can't get excited...it reminds me too much of anxiety..."" That right there always leaves others dumbstruck.

Good God I wish so badly I could feel excited about \*anything.\* But I cannot. The pulse of adrenaline immediately kills that feeling of breathtaking joy and turns it into breathless fear.

I can kind of remember what feeling excited was like. As a child, I would get giddy with expectation. It seems like that emotion would be a really nice bit of punctuation to drop here and there. It would be a welcome change to have an exclamation mean something other than dread.

After class I went to see some friends and caught the bus home (which was fine). However whilst I was waiting for my dad to pick me up from the bus stop I felt really derealized and I’ve just gotten home and all my sort of anxiety symptoms that I get when I’m stressed are coming back - dpdr, numbness in feet.

She has been on this new prescription for 4 days now and she still cannot sleep even though some of these drugs are sedating.

I am really forgetful, anxious and I hesitate a lot. I doubt myself a lot. I can’t make decisions. All of this happens at once when I am out in public. And this causes me to mess up a lot at work.

It is so hard to let it go because it’s really all I have to communicate to people, I don’t talk to anyone at my job, I’m really uncomfortable and nervous. 

My point is, I cry really easily when I mess up and when everyone is frustrated and I mess up and everyone is more stressed. It’s awful. I don’t cry everyday, but once or twice a week I will cry. 

I really like everyone I work with, I just don’t know how to get myself in the present, focus, and communicate with confidence. All I do is panic and mess up. And it frustrates everyone.

im so scared lmao for a stupid reason. i still want a phone and yeah im happy and excited to be getting one... but the permit test is sooooooooo overwhelming (i don't even have the manuel yet)

I almost want to tell her how I feel (that I think I’m falling in love lmao) but I think it’s way too early.

I understand that’s totally selfish because we are absolutey not dating or anything, but at the same time I think it’s reasonable. At least until we see where things go. I have already deleted dating apps in an attempt to put good intentions towards the situation for the universe.


However, all that glitters is not gold and I believe this is a big contributor to the anxious feelings im having. She’s pretty well off (social media influencer) and im a 9-5 worker.

He misses days at work cause he can’t stop worrying and puking.

Simple things like just walking past someone else would make me a nervous wreck

Two days later, hadn’t thought about the course or anything 


I had to go into town - and I noticed that my anxiety was completely gone  


For the first time ever I was able to walkthrough and amongst other people..and feel completely fine ? 


Not even a hint of any nerves or a care about if people were looking at me or anything and even tho I was noticing it in real time it didn’t change 


Someone even struck up a conversation with me randomly about something and I handled it fine - was able to look them in the eye and just keep going with the conversation it was crazy

Fast forward to now I'm doing a lot better actually but I've learned anxiety has always been there. I've always been anxious and it became full blown when I became stuck in a loop of panic attacks for hours around Christmas. 

The funny thing is now is it feels like I'm saying goodbye to an old friend. Anxiety has always been there and now I'm learning to be without it being there always. Honestly I cried.

Not sure if I’m reacting to my past trauma that I’ve recently been dreaming about that I must not have fully worked through like I had hoped I did or vicariously subconsciously picked up on my coworkers energy from their mental break the other day and it somehow got to me/influenced me as an empath and I just have to ride it out until the feelings pass.

I had generalized anxiety before all this and the psych ward was horrible for me. By the way what is a way they could release you early from that place, does not signing anything work? For future referance when I might get trapped again.",1678743680.0
966,Is Potassium Deficiency the Culprit?,1,11qmi1q,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11qmi1q/is_potassium_deficiency_the_culprit/,1,"Long story short, 2 years ago when I started having anxiety I went to the ER thinking I was having a heart attack. After all the tests and EKG the doc said the only thing that wasn’t normal was my potassium level. He said it was only slightly low. He told me I was free to go and that he thought my issues were stress related. 

I sought mental help and was on antidepressants for about 1.5 years. 

Fast forward. I attempted to wean off the meds and within four months started to relapse. The anxiety was just as bad as before. I went in to my primary to get more blood drawn. All normal… EXCEPT potassium, again. My doctor said that this was odd as I wasn’t taking anything that would deplete my potassium levels. She started me back on antidepressants (Sertraline to be exact). 

I was discussing this amongst some of my friends when one of them asked me to talk to her more. As I opened up she told me that she was having a very similar experience. She also had a slight potassium deficiency. 

Her and I are in different age groups. I am 29f and she is in menopause (probably early 50s). I was wondering if anyone else has had this experience. Perhaps there’s more to it or maybe it’s just me overanalyzing.",1678743178.0

I’ve taken Ativan 3 times a day for months and don’t have one complaint never raised my dose either, I’ve never felt more sane and at peace with my body and mind since starting Ativan. I was heading down a very dark path wanting to self medicate with alcohol if I didn’t get something that actually worked for MY brain prescribed long term. So for me the benefits outweigh the risks, sure I’m dependent but I don’t view it any worse than someone needing blood pressure meds to function because my anxiety was that severe. 

My 2 cents, sorry but I think the medical system needs a serious overhaul with these medications. If used properly the therapeutic benefit doesn’t really go away that much and there are some medical articles that prove this. Sure it won’t work as good as occasional use where you can really “feel it” but that’s the self control part to not take more and only your prescribed dosage.

I am seeing a new sub doctor, he is a psychiaatrist. I am worried that I will never be able to be prescribed anxiety medicine that works or given chance due to the fact that I am taking suboxone and labeled an addict \[ or in recovery\] . I am willing to get off of the suboxone for my anxiety. So my question is, if I go to a new psychiatrist after this one to get my medicine. Will he see my history of going to suboxone clinics, deem me an addict, and never prescribe benzodiazipines because of this? I understand them not wanting to prescribe them together in most cases. But what if I am off of suboxone, and yet my history shows I have been in treatment for addiction. Will my psych refuse to give me needed medication? What wil they see? I am so stressed and I cant even function, when I come off of the suboxone I do not go back to oxy or any opioids, I mainly take it just to have it nowdays, and have came off willingly multiple times. I just want treatment for my anxiety and none of the drugs they have ever given have touched it. It feels they hit outside, external, but never calm my turmoil inside, leaving me worse than before and making me focus on the thoughts. WILL i ever have a chance at being prescribed medication I know for certain is the only thing able to make me a functional member of society, I do not have to take benzos every day, just when I need them. I have been prescribed Klonopin before as a teen, the doctor said he had no problem keeping me on it, then next visit he lied and said he never said that. Anywho.

During COVID breakdown in 2020 in my country we stayed home from school for almost two years (my 2nd and 3th years of high school). I've never had anxiety problem in high school, I'm currently in my last year and I have good grades.

But after the lockdown I started having this problem, my body shakes in unusual situations. I'm not ""psychological"" anxious, but my body is? 

For example, I was an activist for Fridays For Future. During a demonstration I talked in front of 100 people. My speech was fluid, my voice too. But my right leg was shaking like a fucking excavator. As I said, I wasn't afraid, just my body shaking.

And that's an example. It happens a lot, like 70-80% when I have to do ""something new"", especially if I have to interact with people. It also happened in my first day at work, as a waiter, it was embarrassing.

I also have to say that my mother is a very stressful person, staying home means having her complaining of everything. My best prospective is to leave home in 1 year and living near my Uni with a scholarship. Otherwise, I'll have to wait 5 years until I'll finish Uni. Whatever, the good news is that during Uni I'll stay out from morning to the night due to trains and lessons schedule.
