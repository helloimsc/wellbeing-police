3,I desperately need a break from my own mental hell,370,11i24md,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11i24md/i_desperately_need_a_break_from_my_own_mental_hell/,81,"I am so sick and tired of constantly ruminating about mistakes and feeling like shit 24/7. I need a break from my own mental hell because I'm just so exhausted. My grades are dropping because I lack motivation, and my anxiety keeps me up, so I'm constantly sleep deprived. 

I've made so many fuck ups and I wish I could turn back the clocks and just be a kid again. I used to be so happy, and I miss the life I had when I was a childish little girl that wasn't so fucked up and my biggest concern was the colour of my lipgloss.
I mourn the life i could've had.I wish I had if I just had a little more guidance growing up, a mentor, or perhaps someone just to stop me from being such a recluse 

I've lost all those years, and although they were happy, I didn't cherish them, and now they've literally dissolved right in front of my eyes, and it crushes me to think back

I think about my mother alot and how much she used to hold and hug me before and tell me that everything was going to be okay and I mourn that too  because I'm older now and our relationship just isn't that anymore.

I constantly worry about the future and ""what ifs"" my future looks so bleak, and with the things I have done, I don't know how I'll ever be normal again. I want a do over so bad, but it's all gone.

I AM not a strong soilder, nor am I resilient, and I don't pretend to be. My daily mental anguish is debilitating, and I feel myself cracking under the pressure. I CAN NOT ENDURE. The thought of having to live live this is disgustin,  and I'd rather die,  but I can't do that to my family, especially my mother
My past is filled with pain, and I wish I could relive it yet start over at the same time. My present is filled with ENDLESS worries about the worst possible outcome. I fear that if people find out about the horrific skeleton in my closet, I'd be disowned, looked at with disgust, and more. And I can't deal with that. I'm not strong, and I can't power through it. I'm sensitive, and my life wasn't supposed to be this way. I will be and AM at my wits end. My future just looks like endless suffering until my parents die, and I can off myself without the knowledge that I'll be leaving my parents who have sustained me for years in pain.

I just don't even know anymore. I've tried sleeping tablets to try sleep days away, but I can't. I've been feeling this way for AGES, and I am JUST SO DONE. I feel like a fraud. I just need a break. I'm still a late teen, and it'll take months of being on a waiting list before I'm even CONSIDERED for some kind of help. I seriously don't know

-Insomnia the night before work. Like falling asleep at 3am if I’m even able to sleep (I work at 6am)

-Nausea/Throwing Up before & at work as well as the night before

-Chest Tightness/Hyperventilating before & at work

-Shaky hands/fingers constantly when at work or on the drive there

-Crying the night before, the morning of, & on the way to work 

-SWEATING!!!!

Anyways

What I’d like to know is how can I just RELAX. I’ve found THC works until the 2 hour ware off mark and we’re back to throwing up. I’ve had panic attacks at work and my manager is getting annoyed that I can’t just be normal. help me be normal please??

New to the group but I am suffering with this intense fear that I have contracted hiv. I (f 23) had a condom break a couple of weeks ago with a casual partner (m 25) who told me that there was no chance he had anything as he was regularly tested thus I didn’t get Prep. I am new to casual sex, recently out of a long term relationship and I know now casual sex doesn’t suit me 😅

I got a few individual spots on my chest last week - each very small and I had an std test but the doctor didn’t test for hiv as they said it wasn’t hiv (didn’t look at my chest). The spots are a little itchy. Tonight I woke up sweating. I am also gluten intolerant and accidentally ate gluten today so it could be that but my anxiety is really intense worrying that it is hiv. I know that hiv is treatable however I am feeling a lot of emotions. Does anyone have any advice on mitigating this fear as I do not think I can even test for hiv so soon.

February of 2022, I experienced a devastating pet loss (chicken died during surgery). I can't even type more about it because it broke me and I can't even go near those memories.

April 2022 my boyfriend left me for someone else while I was living with him, 5 hours away from where I've always called home. I had to continue to live in the house while he dated this new girl. End of April, I attempted suicide. It was a serious attempt, but I was found and survived.

Parents came and moved me and kindly, the pets I had accumulated while living with my ex back home (three chickens, three ducks)

A few days after moving back home, one of my ducks, who was a duckling, died in my arms as I begged her not to die. She had been ill when I got and I nursed her back to health but it seems the move was too much stress for her. I'm sobbing as I type this. The guilt still eats me alive. I now am obsessive over my animals' health. All I do is worry and watch for signs of illness. I panic at the slightest possible sign of something being wrong and just spiral from there. 

A few days after my duckling's death, I am fired from my work from home job due to the absences I've had at work throughout all this.

In June I meet a woman who is a nurse practitioner. My parent's best friend developed wernicke-korsakoff syndrome and they had met her at his doctor's office and hired her to care for him overnight. She befriended me and got me involved with life again. I hadn't gotten out of bed since moving home...she got me out of the house a little bit at a time....and slowly I became myself again and she became one of my best friends. In August, she got me a job at the doctors office she worked at.

EMDR therapy with my therapist also helps me from May-August.

Fast-forward to December. She randomly decides to quit her job at the doctors office. 

January comes. I discover she doesn't have a medical license and alert my parents. We discover she has an extensive criminal record. Doctor we worked for had hired her just as an office manager we find out. She lied to everyone...patients, friends....we discover she has opened several credit cards under the name of my parents friend who she was caring for and was accumulated about $20,000 on them. Needless to say, our friendship ends.

Things are crazy at work for awhile and then get better. My coworker becomes the new office manager. At first things are great, but then they change. Last week my coworker and I approach the doctor we work for with some issues we have with the office manager, including her yelling at us in front of patients.

Doctor basically doesn't care, tells the office manager everything we complained about and she becomes extremely cold towards me and the next day, cuts my hours in half. Instead of 8-4 I now work 12-4. Doctor explains he can't really afford a third person working there full time. The next day I see a post on our office's Facebook page looking for someone to work full time. I send the office manager a text about this...asking her what the heck is going on. I then message her and the doctor and say I'd like to request my new schedule in writing along with the reason for my hours reduction in writing. Office manager agrees but her response is nasty.

I'm terrified to go into work on Monday. I'm terrified of everything. The anxiety of having to find a new job (I can't live on this salary and am pretty sure I'll be fired soon). I can't relax. My head is pounding. I can't sleep. Every bad thing that has happened over the past year keeps replaying in my head and I feel like I'm cracking or coming apart at the seams. I've broken down crying three times today.

I have a virtual appointment with a new therapist tomorrow night and am trying to hold on but the anxiety is eating me alive.

I don't know what I'm looking for. I just needed to get that out. I'm just so scared of my manager and what she'll do to me on Monday.",1677981441.0

Today is a bad day. Lots at play so I will try to sum it up as best I can. 
- I have generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder and depressive disorder.
- Transitioned onto new meds (with my doctor's assistance) and am at the first stage of new meds, a very low dose.
- My hours got cut at work and I am in deep financial fear and distress
- Had a big fight yesterday (and again today) with a friend/romantic connection who meant a lot to me. It is quite possible that the friendship is over, which devastates me because not only do I care about him, he is also a peer in my primary profession.

I have spent the day in tears, having panic attacks and depression sleeping. My body and my head hurt from oversleeping, I'm shaking from the anxiety (and low blood sugar - I have no appetite), and the fear is overwhelming.

I have had days like this before and I've always gotten through them, but this one feels different. Because of the argument with this friend, the loss of our potential romantic connection, and their proximity to my career success, the fear is at a new level...on top of the fear that I may lose my home.

I've never bothered making any friends, or any connections outside of my daily life. Everytime I'm told to talk or just try to it feels like am about to vomit, like I suddenly want to start stabbing at my arm. In these situations I think I'd rather be dead.

I've thought about a lifestyle where I don't need to talk and I could just communicate through other ways. My family says a world like that is impossible to imagine, so I don't approach them about my talking problem much, but I know it's probably not normal.

There is this pit of sadness that never goes away, even when im happy.

I feel like im always talking in my mind and I forget to talk out loud. Since I was a child, age 4 is my earliest memories, I've always felt existential dread. I would lay in bed and pray for every person I could think of because if I didn't they might die and it would be my fault. Then I'd wonder what is life after death, what is life if the earth explodes, what even is life? It never ended. I would have crazy thoughts about family members and hurting them and then feel like the worst person in the world for thinking that when I didn't want to think that. I'm 25 and am still like this. I've always been a control freak about order, doing things a ""proper way"", and I've always had to have everything even. I would cut my eyelashes as a kid if they were longer on one eye. My sleeves have to be evenly stretched out. My socks evenly rolled. It never ends. I hyper fixate like a MF. I will literally sit and paint for an entire day without eating, speaking, or leaving my position. I braid my hair 24/7. Tiny braids, the same piece over and over. I can't stop until it feels ""right"" ?? I'm so negative. I'm my own worst enemy. I believe that all my friends hate me, my boyfriend doesn't really love me.

&#x200B;

I just can't seem to actually calm down since when I do, I get anxiety about it, and then since I get anxiety from simply calming down, doesnt that mean I can never calm down? It hurts so much. even when I take something like lorazapam I think ""Oh this is the go-to for dealing with anxiety, if this doesnt make me feel better, than nothing can make me feel better."" And before you mention that different meds work differently for different people, I feel as though the problem is purely with my thought process so i dont feel like any medication will truly work.

I don’t really know how to put this into words but I truly am absolutely done 

I am the only male (20) in a 5 member family with 3 sisters and a mother. My dad works abroad and does not live with us so it is up to me to do everything a father does.

My sisters are a real issue.

One of them (18) is actually from hell. She goes around the house cussing people out and fighting (physically) with her sisters and her mom. She’s cussed me out personally, my religion, my manhood, she broke my glasses, she threatened to choke me with a rope, she’s punched my mom in the stomach infront of me, and so on and so forth. This has become an everyday thing now. Why don’t I do anything? Well, I do. But my mother stops most of it, I’ve talked to her every week Atleast once for the last year and she’s so deep into her hypocrisy that she’s managed to believe that SHE is the one being abused, abused how? Don’t ask me. I’ve thought of many things. I don’t know what to do, I can’t sleep at night because of it. And in the morning her and her other sisters are usually breaking stuff around the house or fighting to the point that I can’t sleep. Took her phone once as a punishment and 3 mins later she chocked me full force with her long nails, left a scar and couldn’t swallow for 2 days. I can’t believe your siblings can do this to you? I sometimes just wish she would disappear. She’s very aggressive both physically and verbally, very manipulative and wants to force everyone to do exactly what she wants. Now it’s rubbing off on her youngersister which is 16 , her 16 year old sister called me a motherfucker for taking her phone after she broke a painting that she has broken several times before after an argument with her mother . I now have chronic pain in my chest, can’t sleep, don’t eat at all and always very anxious. What happened to girls being. So loving and gentle ?Someone help me.",1677988255.0

Just started a law degree but it’s such a struggle to even go to uni due to the anxiety. I made it in every day last week but needed to take beta blockers to make it through the day. 

Main other symptoms are: 
Derealization (probably due to the anxiety)
Jaw clenching 
Fear of leaving the house due to possibility of panic attack/derealization

Tuesday night, I finished my anatomy exam and began feeling kind of weird. Like this nervous energy. Didn't think anything of it and tossed and turned. Went about business as usual as I've gone sleepless nights before. Tried to sleep Wednesday night and couldn't. Heart rate randomly went up to 150 and I thought u was going to die. My ex had panic attacks so I knew what was happening. Pretty much since that point my mental health has deteriorated. I feel like I'm going to jump out of my skin, mood swings, restlessness. I can't stop obessesing about the fact that I can't sleep and that I'm insane. 

I haven't been able to work or go to school since Wednesday. I can't shake this constant feeling of TERROR. Everytime I try to fall asleep my heart pounds out of my chest and I cry. I just want to go back to how I was feeling last weekend. When I was enjoying this cute date with my gf and sleeping full 8 hours. I've only talked to her once this week because I can't even get the courage to talk to her.

I have an appointment with my doctor Monday because I went to a mental health clinic and they can't get me into the psych until the end of the month. I'm scared that I'm going to go insane before Monday as I'm a nervous ball of energy. I really want to sleep. The intake counselor kept asking me bipolar questions when I told him about not sleeping and panic/restlessness and now I'm terrified of that. Like I'm not spending money, feeling euphoric, I don't think I can talk to God or do I think I have special powers or anything like that.

As a result I stopped going out with friends, hanging out with coworkers, didn't pursue higher learning, and stuck with a simple job. I,like many, made a sort of ""persona"" that I had which made things easier. This was all over the course of a few years starting 5 years ago.

For some reason I got it in my head that I was ""better"", rather than hiding from my issue. But me thinking that may have actually made me get better. At least a little. This past 2 years I started hanging out with more people, went to a small party/bar or 2, kicked it with new friends and coworkers, normal people stuff. Sometimes there were hiccups but I powered through most of them. A few panic attacks and close calls but I usually could use willpower,acting, and chewing gum to curve em and go unnoticed. Mostly. Chewing gum helped me keep my nerves. A *lot* of gum.

Past 2 weeks I decided I wanted to experience stuff I missed out on so I enrolled in school, made vacation plans with a friend*, am pursuing a management promotion in my line of work. When I took a second to actually assess everything I had committed to, I had the fattest series of panic attacks I've had since I was 18. I feel like secluding myself in my room, which I have done for the past day and have been on edge non stop lmao. Part of me wants to go back to my previous avoidance of issues but I also really kind of enjoy a lot of my almost normal life and prefer not to lose it again. I think this is progress?

Along with birth control, we usually use other sources of protection, which I won't go into detail about. 

I'm also scared of the idea of, when I do get sterilized, what are the chances of an ectopic pregnancy? Like, the sterilization fails?

I hope other people will decide to share their stories here too- I wouldn’t typically post about this but it was surprisingly helpful to say this out loud and feel like someone was taking the time to listen.

I shared about how loan forgiveness has enabled me to pay off my own unexpected medical bills, and how student loan forgiveness would allow me to dream a little bigger than my current day job. It has been a goal of mine to buy an old laundromat, fix it up, and turn it into a clean and peaceful place where anyone can go to not only do their laundry, but get connected with local community resources to support themselves and their families.

This, in honor of my mother who unexpectedly passed away of an undetected, treatable disease during my first year of college. She was the first woman in her family to earn a graduate degree (As of last year, I am the second) and a single mother who did whatever she could to keep us in good schools. Often, that meant moving from one old apartment building to the next, and schlepping us to the equally run-down laundromats nearby. Working two jobs to raise us while still paying off her own student loans, she would take her lunch breaks to pick us up from dance classes and soccer practices during the week, and spend her Sundays carefully separating the pink and white leotards from the dark ones and treating the grass stains on our tube socks in those old, dingy laundromats.

I remember the day she paid off her student loans, she literally skipped to and from the mailbox when she dropped that last check in the mail and announced it proudly with happy tears, then said her usual little prayer before attempting to start the truck and drive us home- There were a lot of deferred car repairs and doctors appointments during those years.",1677983020.0

Anxiety runs strongly in my biological family. I also have the “fun” accurate diagnosis of PTSD that stemmed from a head injury that I got this past year. My anxiety and PTSD seem to run hand in hand at times when I’m feeling unsafe in my body and that’s something I have finally been noticing and trying to implement ways to help myself live a healthier life. 

Lots of people in my life at varying degrees know I have anxiety. It’s quite noticeable for folks that aren’t strangers. I recently moved away from a city I was living in for the past few years. I’ve worked with a few different therapists and am planning on getting some more intensive residential treatment for more help with my anxiety and trauma as soon as I get on insurance here. 

Where I used to live, I unfortunately was harassed/stalked by people, mostly by anti LGBTQ folks. When it first started happening, it was terrifying. I shared this experience with my therapist at the time but they didn’t believe me because they knew I have clinical anxiety and thought it was just my anxiety. Well a year passed on and I still was being stalked/harassed by people. I finally started getting believed about this harassment as other community members have started literally seeing this happen to me. Eventually the security on public transit started looking out for me when this happened and I had to really go out of my way to avoid certain routes to try to prevent this harassment which wasn’t always successful. I know this wasn’t always my anxiety because I just moved to a much larger city and I don’t feel anxious around people at all here. No one has been following me and I know for sure that I’m safe here.

It's both my dad's and my grandma's birthday (on his side, my Nan) this week. As such, my sister called me tonight to ask if I wanted to come out for brunch tomorrow. This would involve picking me up earlier. It was possible we would visit grandparents afterwards, but uncertain.

ii) It takes a while for me to get going; I have bad executive functioning and time blindness, as well as procrastinating and avoidant tendencies.

It would be hard for me to rest knowing I needed to be up, because I'd be afraid of being late and her getting mad at me.

iii) I've got a cold atm--had to see the doctor earlier this week about a referral for an ENT since I've had nasal inflammation for a \*year\* now with 10+ colds per year--and this is another reason I need sleep/rest.

iv) While I don't have anything against her and do love her, things are a bit awkward, we don't really have much in common except being family and childhood memories, but we're both adults now and she has her own family. 

v) It's also my best friend's 30th this weekend, so we went out for a meal and drinks tonight, and we're doing it \*again\* with different friends next weekend. I was a sleep deprived mess, and my sister called while we were waiting for food, which stressed me out a bit. Dad also didn;t text back until a while after sis texted, so it looked like I was messing my sister around. She can be pretty pushy and I assume everyone is mad at me over text unless they're explicitly expressing positive emotion. It's a kind of paranoia.

vi) Finally in a week's time, I'm going on vacation with my girlfriend, and I'm still not fully ready. I kinda need to do that this week, ideally before my friend's birthday party which would be the evening before (so I might have to skip that too.)

So all that said, I told my sister thanks for the offer but I was seeing Dad later, it was a bit short notice and probably too soon for me.

Saying No felt unnatural. I admit to feeling like I've done something \*wrong\*. It was comparable to RSD, just this...unbearable, gnawing sensation that I'd fucked up. Made the wrong decision--that \*any\* decision I made prioritising myself first in this context as in most, was making rhe wrong decision. There was a level of shame at prioritising sleep/rest over a family social, and I almost changed my mind on what I'd said to Dad and agreed based off of that feeling. Feels like I'm avoiding something. I felt like I wasn't showing care for my nan. I already didn't really get Nan a real gift, cos of the time pressure and trying to find a good one for my dad and friend (which I did, fortunately). Also felt like rejecting my sister's bonding offering (and like, it is a bit, but the well is poisoned, I think I've heard them shit-talk me before.

&#x200B;

To complicate things further, my mom has asked me to call my grandma (other grandparents) because she's freaking out since my immunocompromised grandpa is sick again. I was planning to do that sometime in the afternoon before Dad picks me up.

&#x200B;

Overall I feel like I am too overwhelmed and need to rest (ironically it's now quite late, since I've been worrying about this since sis called, lol.) However, I will hate myself if this decision causes e.g. my sister to stop inviting me to places, or if my nan dies while I'm away. I also wondered if complaining about it to my girlfriend would lead her to cancel the holiday and dump me.

All of this leaked out at the pub tonight.

How do I cope with this crappy feeling? There's a very real, if maybe below 50%, possibility that this will lead to a bad social situation where people are angry at or disappointed in me, stop inviting me places, leave my life.",1677989549.0

Then she continued to try and become a milf when milf.com was a thing, she would even show 11 year old me her profile. She got rid of my dad at age 7 and convinced me he was evil so I never had a dad. My mom throughout the years would then try to marry rich people and disabled people and get money from long distant relationships. She was engaged to many people I never knew. She’s currently using a disabled guy for his money and house, he just bought he a $40k car.

My mom lied to me about everything my entire life even her hair color she dyed for over 24 years. Why lie about such things. I grew up so poor and she’s using my child support money for vanity. 

My whole life I thought her “cancer”would come back, slept feeling depressed and alone with anxiety every night as a kid. I found out it was all lies a few years ago.

Yet she would always act caring and loving my whole life. It’s the worst mindfuck on earth. I feel so..don’t even have a word for it. Just off.

I’m 28 now and haven’t lived with her in years, she still acts nice and sweet when she texts me once a month and it kills me inside.

I’m terrified of marrying a women and having kids one day. I don’t trust anybody. Why would a mother happily do so much damage for vanity and money?

UPDATE: Well I talked to my mom. She basically continued to spin words and her apology was ""I'm sorry you feel that way"". Also what a fucking coincidence next week she is getting new breast implants, I'm hoping she doesn't fuck over the really nice guy she's with right now, he calls her babe but she tells me they are just friends. I'm pretty depressed right now, she kept saying ""I do love you"" in this blank tone. Before I kicked her out of my car she in an angry tone said ""I'm sorry about lying about cancer i okay"" then says she'll be really upset if I'm no longer in her life. I was a little harsh on her I told her I don't love her anymore. I'm just glad I got this off my chest after so many years. However, I have no idea how I'm going to move forward.

Can barely get out of bed.,2,11igsi5,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11igsi5/health_anxiety_is_preventing_me_from_living_life/,2,"I am a 20 year old male. I was always health conscious growing up. I started working out consistently in middle school  and tracking macros everyday. I just moved around a lot to different schools. I moved schools a lot  so I had to make new friends and I became friends with people that were low key bad influences on me. I unfortunately succumbed to peer pressure and started vaping at 16. This habit continued on and off until graduation. It’s weird because in the moment I would have NEVER started cigarettes because all of the scientific literature out there linking it with cancer. I guess my mindset was “vaping is safer than cigarettes so it can’t be that bad”. I wasn’t aware of the cardiovascular effects or anything. After I got addicted I just kept doing it because there were shops all around me that didn’t card. Fast forward to college and I was vaping damn near everyday all day whenever I was in my dorm room. My addiction was so bad. My roommates were also all nicotine addicts as well so it was just never ending. Now I’m a sophomore in college and I finally quit for 3 months now because I went to the ER for a stimulant induced panic attack. 

Ever since I quit tho I can’t help but look back and freak tf out. I vaped pretty heavily the past 2 years and on and off the 2 years before that. I got one chance at life and I feel like I kind of ruined it. I developed daily tension headaches and my right lung has felt weird for 2 months now. It feels like a pressure. My mind is telling me I’m going to get lung cancer sometime in the future and I ruined my life. If I don’t get lung cancer I’m going to develop heart disease from all the nicotine I’ve been putting into my body. Idk all this health anxiety is making me depressed and I can’t get out of bed anymore. I just don’t know what to do. I’m mad at myself and I feel like I’ve let myself and my family down.

67,My story.,4,11i9uxn,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11i9uxn/my_story/,3,"I'm 24. I'm a girl. Okay I forgot even how to write. I have been in my shell lately, just working and I have been struggling with anxiety disorder. I see people talking about how it's all in your head, and you just need to stop being lazy. Okay I believe this is not true. Sometimes I can't even stand up and go shower. I have grown in a toxic household, narcisstic dad and a mom who was a people pleaser and didn't care about us much until very lately when she found herself alone and her husband filed a divorce. We grew up to be independant though. And we didn't cause troubles. I am a middle child, so I was the person handeling the responsibility and I didn't ask for much, I studied, worked part- time, knew how to manage the little money I had. Though with pressure and things, I was very anxious and depressed, I felt I wasn't living. I didnt feel apprecitated or loved as a child, and I was looking for things to hide my pain, hopefully I spent lots of time reading and listening to songs, and watching movies. I didn't really have friends. And I felt so lonely, I was in bad relationships on and off and I was with a narcisstic bf for at least a year because I felt dependant. 

Okay, I'll try not to make this so long, I just have so much in my head, so if you kept reading till here, thank you, I believe the next part would be a bit more cheerful. 


Even thogh stuggling suffering with anxiety, depression, and didn't get any support from parents as my dad wasn't present and my parents are not that much aware of mental health, though my mom would say, just stop being lazy and go clean your room. In my head, it was a dead end, I didn't have a clue about my future or what I wanted to be, I was so sad because I was lost and was never stable or orgnized, I got easily distracted but mostly, I was so sad because my life didn't have a meaning. Even though I wasnt that socially active, I am curious and I kept wanting to learn. I had dreams when I was young. I remember wanting to be someone. I wanted to be a teacher, I wanted to dance, I wanted to have my own home and bake my own bread, I wanted my cheets to smell like lemon and I wanted coffee and I wanted to read and take a walk, I wanted to be sane in a world I knew from the start, was madness. And didn't make much more sense to me. And Finally. I wanted to be loved by someone. 


Years passed I graduated highschool, then college, I don't know how time passed by. I didn't give up. I was happy because I felt that even with nothing. No support, no money, I made it. But was still depressed. Things were still foggy and I couldn't stop being anxious because I was always on survival mode. My head is trying to protect me from things that does not even exist maybe. 

I was working in retail after graduation. Then I had a part time job as a teacher. I was happy. Of course, I was still living with my parents. And of course, they took credit for all my accomplishments as good parents who raised their kid right. What would I expect. After about a year, things moved pretty fast, and then covid came, then lockdown. And then I quit my retail job and the school year was over. So I didn't really know what to do next. 

My next chapter is that I found another job. Still kept living with my parents. My brother moved. I was still anxious as they kept expecting things from me. Like money and not to get home late etc. I was never happy and I wanted to move alone. I didn't have the power or the knowledge to do things independantly. 

Today, I 'm in my own appartment, I have a nice view, and a kitchen and an electric over and a bath. I can pay my bills, I do my own laundry. I was so sad yesterday for reasons. Even though I know I have accomplished things in life. Its seems like a fantasy since my whole life I have been sad and poor. It doesn't seem real to me, that I am capable of doing things. On my own. As a child I was told a women will always need a man, and my brother had so much more freedom than I did and this made me feel really sad. 

I still can't find pleasure in life and this seems absured, I was working on learning things, managing my money, making ends meet, doing groceries. Not buying things I do not need. Watching the movies I never found time to watch, and being self sufficient. I don't want to consume, I want to create. I need to make a meaning for my life and make my 5 year old version of me proud.


What I can say is. The good thing is I have changed a lot. I am trying to think for what's best for me. I stopped self distructive habits. And I stopprd blaming myself much. The past 23 years, wasn't really my fault. But of course, depression doesn't really disappear like that, after years of trauma, self-loath and being treated like shit. Being compared and not having anyone to support you. I began to think that the roots of my entire sadness is that I needed to be loved as a kid. To not be left alone without a meal at scholl. And to not being laughed out because my clothes were funny. I think I am sad because child me needed just a hug and someone to say, i'm proud of you, keep going. You'll do good. 
What I heard instead is hateful things, domestic violence, and lots of verbal abuse. For the smallest things I did. I wanted my parents to tell me i'm beautiful and they were proud and tht they loved me and protected me no matter what. Unfortunately, they didn't. I guess I can't change that. What I can do is to just love myself. To be proud of myself and to take care of myself. I don't have another choice. 

So yesterday I was in the same loop. Still stuck in my own head, and I just chose not to make a meal and slept hungry because I had no energy to move. I am writing this because I feel good today and I wanted someone to congratulate me like I am 5. Just for waking up, doing my laundry, making coffee. Washing my face, brushing my teeth. Washing the dishes. Walking to the grocery store, buying food, and veggies. I bought potatoes, and unions. I can't believe it. I bought that, with my money, to go to my appartment. Wear the clothes, that I thrifted or bought, by my own money. I am so greateful. I am trying so hard to make that little 5 year old proud. And i'm trying. That's it. I'll keep on trying. Always.

But I don't remember much after that, but I remember in 2019 the frequency became more and more. Eventually happening every single day. I remember specifically, March 2021 where I had the worst panic attack of my life. It was a cloudy morning, which always gets my worst anxiety. And I checked the website [timeanddate.com](https://timeanddate.com) and saw it's been 10 - 15 minutes since nautical twilight, but I looked outside and the clouds were still a dark orange. I screamed for my mum and eventually the whole house woke up with me running to every single window looking for the slightest hint of blue I could see. And of course it rose and I sat on the couch with my dad crying. And just this morning It was clear outside, but I still had a massive panic attack of 189BPM. I thought the glowing on the horizon was the same even after 20 minutes. But It was because of the constant checking. This fear has destroyed. my. life. I lost all of my motivation and can't do the simplest of tasks. And of course, this fear occurs every single day. And now I'm worried this will never end since I'm now 17 and still fear this.

Been suffering from an anxiety flare up that's pretty similar to one I had back in late 2019 and going into early 2020. Got so bad to the point where I went to the ER (again) a week ago  and they actually gave a shit and did an ekg, blood test, chest xray, etc. Everything came back normal and I was told that I just have GAD on top of insomnia, which I  believe, but some days the bad brain thoughts like to get loud and try to convince me otherwise that it's more than just those two.   


Regardless, last night I had some chest pain under what felt like my left breast, sharp, but fleeting. Happens every so often and know it did back in 2019. Today, I woke up and took a (deep) breath in and felt it around the same area and think I started to have a small panic attack where the chest pain actually began to give me some mild discomfort in the center of my chest. Ate and drank something and now it's gone, just feel kinda weak afterward.  


I know it's likely my anxiety, yeah. But just wanted to ask for clarification since it's been so long that I'm not sure how I felt back then vs. now. TLDR: Can anxiety/panic attacks give you mild chest pain/discomfort that alleviates with water/food and leaves you a bit weak? Thanks.",1677955375.0

This bad anxiety stuff really started in December of 2022 when I had a bad UTI that I thought was a kidney problem (I’m a hypochondriac). Even though I was told tons of times it was a bad UTI, I couldn’t help but keep wondering if it was kidney failure. I kept thinking about it all day and everyday. It got so bad I had an anxiety attack that I thought was something worse. I couldn’t breathe, my heart kept dropping, my left arm was numb. Ever since that day (even after going to the ER for what I thought was a heart problem, but was actually a bad anxiety attack) I keep having bad anxiety. My blood test and everything were good. I had an anxiety attack everyday since then. Even lying in bed, I get a rush of adrenaline that makes my body hot, heart drops, and it causes my body to feel weird and tingly. I even went to the ER the other day because my chest was hurting and my left arm was hurting, but EKG and chest x-ray were fine. I will note that my thyroid hormone levels are a bit high and I wonder if my anxiety is because of my high T3 levels. The high T3 levels have caused my anxiety to be worse though because of a possible hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism causes cardiac arrest, which I know is rare but still, anxiety doesn’t help your mind. I’m on two anxiety meds right now, but my anxiety convinces me there is something wrong.

I'm so lonely. The few friends I have barely talk to me, generally only sending memes to each other. The one I'm closest to, I feel like I can't tell because I just feel like a huge burden and that all I'm doing is complaining... and for the last month that's mostly been just sending a cat picture like once a week. another, it's basically a one sided relationship now, we went from talking so much to him only talking to me when I break down because he hasn't said a word to me in 2 months and I ask if he even likes me as a person, then he'll talk for a bit that afternoon or night or whatever, then disappear again until I break again. I send him stuff on discord or whatever that I think he'd like, and get no reaction, even though I know he uses it regularly. Beyond them, it's a miracle anyone interacts with me... 

I need some interaction, but no one cares. I'm so depressed and anxious and I'm just a wreck. It's to the point my medicine isn't helping AGAIN and my doctor keeps saying we're running out of options because when we do find one that works, the moment it's not working as well she switches me instead of trying a higher dosage or whatever. I'm too anxious to try to get a therapist because I can't get myself to get on the damn phone long enough to get an appointment.

I lost my job a few months ago and felt like I didn't need therapy anymore because stress at work and relationships were the main topic of our sessions.

I really liked my old therapist - I went through a few and she was by far my favorite. She was a great listener, she really challenged me, and was the only therapist that would actually stop me and cut me off if I was rambling too much. This helped because I realized it was always good to hear her side of things and her opinions/insights on certain matters. She even gave me worksheets and I like that kind of stuff.

It's been a few months because after a while I didn't want to pay for therapy if I didn't have anything to talk about. She also doesn't take insurance so $200 a session is a lot for me, so I found a new one. She's good, better than most and has a phd. My first session with her was amazing. She asked me so many questions to get to know me and it was very natural. I usually have nothing to hide since I've been through this process so many times and I'm an open book. But, for our second and third session I just don't like our interactions as much. She's always a few minutes late and doesn't say anything when she hops on zoom. She just stares at me, doesn't say hi, and is like expecting me to just start talking?

It feels very uncomfortable and kind of transactional? I get maybe I'm supposed to come to her with a list of things to talk about, but sometimes I just don't know what to say or where to start. I know I have a lot of things to work on and work through with my anxiety, but any advice on where to start? Should I be prepared for sessions or cancel when I don't have anything to talk about? Also, I don't like when she does ask me questions like ""oh, what is it that you like about your boyfriend"" and then I answer...and then she doesn't have anything to follow up on.

I know that’s not a good coping mechanism, but some nights it was exactly what I needed to lighten my night. 
Anyway, I used edibles and carts for a few months with no problems, then, all of a sudden, started getting intense paranoia and panic attacks. We’re talking really bad— resting heart rate over 170bpm, extreme fear of death and dying, racing thoughts, inability to concentrate, intense paranoia etc. These panics would be so bad that i couldn’t even lie down to sleep or even distract myself. I have a really solid set of coping mechanisms, but none of them are useful during these attacks. 

Now, after doing a bunch of trial and errors, this happens about 80% of the time when I feel high (which to me, isn’t worth it at all. A good high 1/5 of the time is not the vibe). 

Anyway, I haven’t used weed in months, and I do want to get back into it as a calming sort of thing. My anxiety and depression is not nearly as bad as it used to be, but it’s still there. So I know jumping off my meds for weed is not worth it at all.

Dear Journal, Entry 1-My anxiety
I've been nervous for as long as I can remember. As a child, I would shake a lot when new things came up. I always thought that it was because I was excited. My parents didn't seem to notice, but I was a really shy and quiet kid. It was only as an adult that I realized it was anxiety. Sadly, I can remember symptoms as far back as the fourth grade. 
Now, my life is much more complicated than homework and school yard bullies. I'm always anxious and have frequent panic attacks. My medication and therapy do help me some, but most of my daily energy is burned up by useless worry. Every day is a battle. Some days, I don't do so well. Other days, I feel like a victory in itself. 
My last panic attack was pretty brutal. It was one of the first times I started thinking I needed help. I need to reach others like me. The worst thing anxiety does is make you feel isolated. I can't be the only person in the world who gets so overwhelmed by dinner out that they run to the bathroom and puke. Honestly, it's gross, but my symptoms are what they are.The last time I hugged a Denny's toilet, I swore I would tell no one. But I came out of the bathroom all covered in sweat,my face all red,and still shaking from the panic. What happened in that stall was more than obvious. 
Usually, my bad thoughts get too overwhelming, or something triggers me into a panic. From there, any symptoms, from chest pain to hyperventilating or breaking out in sweat, to name a few, can happen. I just feel so alone after having a panic attack. And sometimes even a little gross after. 
So if you've ever had uncontrollably shaking,felt like you couldn't breathe,or got too close to a toilet, you and I probably have more in common than you thought.",1677961399.0

The last time I went for one of these, it was mostly them chilling and haging out with some BBQ food but I barely contributed to the conversation and mostly sat by my date, not moving from my seat for a few hours since I was utterly terrified of doing something dumb. They're a very different vibe from the people I usually hang out with, and I'm just very visibly shy when it comes to people I've never really interacted with before.

I haven't really interacted with his friends since the last gathering, apart from joining calls with them once in awhile. My date is aware of my social anxiety issues and he's been really considerate and never pushes me too much, always encouraging and giving me opportunities though :) I wanna go, mostly to see him (lol), but also to meet his friends AND not be the weird partner that avoids the other's friends all the time. 

I'll probably be that quiet person in a group again, but I hope they don't find me weird for it?? Or should I just not go and say I'm busy with work that day?? Or maybe try and talk and then regret later??

I 30M am still new to dealing with anxiety. It’s an experience I didn’t have until a little over a year and a half ago, and I’m doing my best to learn as I go and deal with it. It started as (and mostly remains) health related anxiety, but recently I feel like there’s been a little shift in what sets me off. It’s almost as if my anxiety before being diagnosed was a symptom rather than the problem itself. It was like smoke, this ever present formless shapeless whisper of a feeling. Now that I’ve given these feelings a name and a face it’s almost worse. It’s like I turned the symptoms I felt from being anxious into a monster in their own right. Recently I’ve been less afraid that my heart would randomly stop, and more afraid that the anxiety itself will get me when I can least afford it. This is where the feeling of shame starts to creep in. 

This past October I married my high school sweetheart in Mexico. She is an amazing woman and I love her with every fiber of my being, and she has been as supportive as you’d imagine while I deal with this. But it’s undeniable that it’s put at least some strain on our relationship. There are times when I just can’t bring myself to be the person I was just a few short years ago, and I know she sees it. We have always been people that enjoy going out with friends, trying new bars, restaurants etc. Just being social in general (my wife even more so than I). But now there are days when I lose the battle, and I can’t be everything she fell in love with. A few weeks ago for example, we were are a party for a member of her family and I absolutely freaked. Why? I have no idea. 
I was so uncomfortable, my stomach was in knots, and I was trying so hard to hide the shakes in this room full of people. I had to lie and say I had eaten something bad just to get out of there. Then, just a few days ago I took her out to a restaurant to celebrate our anniversary, just a normal dinner with the two of us. I found myself in the bathroom trying not to puke and shaking like a bird again. Another panic attack seemingly from nothing. These aren’t the only times things like this have happened, but they’re extreme examples. Most times I just hint a few times that I want to go home. 

I’m left feeling so pathetic. Like I went from a partner in life to dead weight dragging someone I love down. I want to be the man she fell in love with. I want to be the friend everyone made plans with. I want to be the person I was before. But I can’t deny this fight has take a little out of me, blunted me a bit. And I’m different now than I was. I wish I didn’t feel weak, like a coward, but I do. 

I know logically I’m not being fair to myself, and that I shouldn’t feel this way. But my lizard brain doesn’t see it that way, and I just can’t get out from under the feeling that I’m becoming a burden.  I’m just at a loss for how to cope with it. 

Anyway, I just wanted to vent. If someone here feels the same way, you’re not alone. Thanks for listening, hope you guys are kicking anxiety’s ass!",1677959802.0

Long story short, for context; 

The last several months were rough for me, going through something with a close friend. Eventually I learned I was being gaslit and straight up lied to, and I haven't spoken to my best friend of 20 years, also my roommate, for a whole month. 

She not only decided to move out, but decided to ask the landlady, without informing me, to terminate our mutual lease - which left me in panic mode before talking it over with the landlady and coming to an agreement where I can just keep the apartment for the remainder of my lease. Can't get a roommate to replace my friend who's leaving, because no one I know is willing or able, plus the rent would go up, so I'm going to stay here myself. My rent is essentially doubled now but I'm realizing that no longer putting my roommates needs before mine, I'm saving SO much on gas and groceries.. after some planning, and panicking, I realized I CAN do this on my own. 

So that brings us to today...
This is the last month she'll live here, we still haven't spoken since the end of January, and when I got back home from groceries, after thinking (because she actually woke up early for once and showers before I did) that she'd be out of the house... Instead she's here with her replacement friend, who is also at the center of a lot of the drama and manipulation that happened between my friend and I...  And it sounds like she's finally starting to pack some of her shit. 

Why is this a progress post? Because prior to January, I would have become overwhelmed, anxious, sad, angry and just broke down in my bedroom. But between therapy and antidepressants, and working on myself, and accepting the situation for what it is, I'm okay. 

Yes, there was an initial reaction of ""ugh, what's HE doing here"" when I saw him as I walked to my bedroom, but it was over and done with in a split second. 

I put away groceries, I changed into my comfy house clothes, I played with my cat, played a video game, had a snack for lunch and don't even give a shit about either of them. Why? 

Because I'm looking forward to the 1st of April when the apartment will be mine, when I can rearrange my furniture to fit MY needs, the way *I* want to. It's about damn time I put my own needs first, rather than wasting time, money, and energy on someone who's never been grateful for all I've tried to help them with. She's the one who fucked up, she's the one who's going to move to a most likely worse situation, and she's the one who's going to lose out on all the friends we had because she decided to be just as cold and distant with them too. 

I'm tired of living with the anxiety I had, trying to salvage a friendship that wasn't worth salvaging. 

So yeah, progress. I'm in a much better headspace these days, and how I'm handling this little surprise breach of my safe space is proof of that. I'm proud of that. So hang in there guys, if I can keep my anxiety under control, you can to!",1677958386.0

The doors to both of their rooms are open and I walk past them, seeing them empty. I get to my room and I sit down and just let it sink in. This idea that I’m alone now. That they’re dead and I’m alive. I want nothing more than to take their place. I feel so scared and empty, like I’ve lost a piece of my soul. That’s about when I wake up.

Even on nights when I don’t have that nightmare, I wake up thinking about them and feeling so scared. I see them everyday and I know they’re doing just fine. But I can’t shake that fear that something awful is going to happen to them.

145,"Nurse Practitioner Prescribed Buspirone to Take ""As Needed"" for Panic and Anxiety",1,11i9jyt,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11i9jyt/nurse_practitioner_prescribed_buspirone_to_take/,1,"Hi everyone, first time posting here. (TLDR below if you don't want to read) I suddenly developed debilitating anxiety and depression after going off hormonal birth control about a month ago. I haven't been able to go to class or work (I'm a grad student) and i've even had minor suicidal ideation (not thoughts of suicide, just empty thoughts due to how hopeless i've felt.) It's the worst thing I've ever felt and It's been a living hell for the past week since these feelings started. Ive had multiple panic attacks a day and have to sleep with my mom at night or I feel intense fear for no reason.

I saw a doctor (a nurse practitioner, my regular GP wasn't available but i was desperate) and we came up with a plan to go back on birth control and take an anxiety pill in the meantime, until the hormones kick in. She prescribed me 5mg of Buspirone to take 3x daily ""as needed,"" and the label says I can increase to 15mg at a time if needed. She told me it's ""fast acting"" and that it will help in the moment when I'm having a panic attack. I asked her if they were like Hydroxyzine (which I found out don't work for me as I'd had to borrow a few from my brother who also has anxiety) and she said they're similar drugs in how they act. 

However, I've been reading up on this drug and all of the sources I've read say that Buspirone doesn't work that way, and that it takes weeks to start working. I've been taking them as if they were Xanax, whenever I felt like an anxiety spiral was beginning. I'm now skeptical about whether they're even working or I'm just experiencing placebo. I'm not distrustful of doctors, but not one source has matched with what she said. Does anyone have any advice? Should I be taking them 3x daily even if i'm not actively feeling anxious? Won't that make it hard to wean off when I don't need them anymore?

TL;DR: Doctor prescribed Buspirone as if it were Xanax for panic and anxiety attacks, even though most sources say Buspirone won't take affect for weeks.",1677955383.0

It made me feel so good about myself; I’m always far too tired to do my makeup, and therefore I feel miserable about myself. 

Getting my lashes done quite literally made me a different person- more confident, less anxious. I knew I looked good, which made me feel good. 

Last time I got my lashes done was in September of 2022. I laid down and suddenly couldn’t breathe. As my lash tech taped my eyes closed my panic set in. I played it off as coughing until I could catch my breath. I became hyper aware of my breathing and every 5 minutes my Apple Watch would vibrate, detecting a high heart rate. I was shaking and fidgeting but trying to remain still. I had visions of my heart giving out, ripping the tape from my eyes and running out. Finally I told her I had to go use the bathroom. 

I left and ran my hands under cold water and saw my heart rate was 160bpm. I meditated, I tried deep breathing. I knew I was acting strange to my lash tech which made things worse. When I went back to the room, no calmer than I was when I left, I admitted that I was having panic attacks and asked if she could do my lashes sitting up. She laughed as if I was joking and when she realized I was serious, she said “I don’t think I can, I’ve never tried it… but I’ll be quick.”

She finished my right eye in 20 minutes and after I left I was still panicked, humiliated. I never went back after that. I’ve tried strip lashes, but again, I’m too tired to do them myself.

160,How does mindfulness help with physical anxiety?,1,11i8pxu,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11i8pxu/how_does_mindfulness_help_with_physical_anxiety/,1,"Most of what I’ve read about mindfulness describes a process of becoming more aware of the unconscious thoughts that you would otherwise overlook. Over time, the new awareness of these thoughts, you would now have the ability to modify your perception of these thoughts and choose which are worthy of your energy/consideration, thereby slowly changing the unconscious response that may often present as anxiety/depression…at least that’s my current understanding.

What I don’t seem to understand is how to leverage this technique to address anxiety or other mental presentations that do not seem to stem from thought…rather lack of thought. I’ve always seemed to be the type of person that was happiest constantly being engaged in work or a hobby. Lately, it seems like if I’m not fully invested in an activity that completely holds my attention, I start to experience severe physical symptoms of anxiety.

At the time this starts, it seems as if the physical sensations start before any negative thoughts occur. I’ll be working on something and feel fine, but as soon as my attention returns to the present moment, I start to get anxious for no reason. 

From what I’ve read, it seems like this may be a presentation of ADHD…getting incredibly physically uncomfortable with lack of stimulation. Even if this is the case, how can I leverage mindfulness to reverse this response? I can’t spend the rest of my life constantly chasing stimulation at all times…I’d like to be able to go for a hike and let my brain wander without it ruining my mood. 

FWIW this is fairly new…I used to be able to go for a hike or enjoy quiet time without this happening, even if i happened to be bored. This new response has started to get worse over the last 6 months.",1677953437.0

I really enjoy my job, I find the flow suitable for me and it's repetitive which is nice. I also get to meet lots of neat people!

But it's hard to like your job when you feel like you're being singled out by your coworkers and worried about losing your job.

I constantly wonder if I'm too chatty or if I force my way into conversations too much. Worried that I don't work hard enough and that I messed something up and will be ""spoken to"" by a supervisor. I just really want to be friendly and involved with my coworkers and be able to do my job well. But lately it's felt like no one wants to be around me. I feel like they talk to each other and not me. I recently got denied a promotion and it feels like the people who got it just look down on me now. I didn't get the promotion due to my attendance (leaving early with permission from my direct supervisor, and calling in not extremely often, but more often than they'd like) but I always make sure to try to find someone to cover me if I call out, if no one can I come in. I have severe anxiety as well as a multitude of other health issues that they know about. I fear losing my job over this so I'm trying to find more coping mechanisms for work and I've been staying longer, trying to do more. It just all feels worthless. The anxiety won't go away.

I spoke to one of my bosses today, and let's be honest, I cried to her about it. She told me to never worry about being too much, and that I'm not responsible for anyone thinking I'm too much for just being me and that she can see my improvement even if other people can't. It was the same boss that told me she was rooting for me to get the promotion in the future when my health and home life can be more balanced with my work like. 

She then later tagged me in a Facebook about being amazing, beautiful, smart, etc. (That's made me cry too)

I want to clarify that I'm not upset about not getting the promotion. I'm a little jealous of the status, but not mad. I found out if I got it it's only a $0.50 raise and I lose all say over my availability which I really don't need right now.

I have been sleep-deprived because of me hearing and seeing things at night that I don't know are real. I have also had sleep paralysis for a while now, and that isn't helping me sleep either.

At night, I start seeing shadows around my room and halls, hearing shuffling on the walls and floor. My heart starts to palpitate, and I start getting pain throughout the left side of my body.

It usually starts in my chest and/or back, then goes into my upper arm and neck. Not as often, but the pain also reaches up to my chin and jaw, down my arm and all the way into my palm, down my side, down my leg into my ankle, and more rarely on the right side of my chest.

This doesn't only happen at night, too. It happens , also, when i am just sitting down and relaxing. I have social anxiety, and a fear of people silently hating me, and I feel like when people laugh near me, they are laughing at me. So, I also get pain in my chest while I'm just sitting in class, lunch, or walking around school.

It just feels like an achy pain, though there are also feeling of sharp pain that come with it, and numbness when things, like my shirt or my hand, touch/rub against it, too. I get tremors in my arm, chest, and hand a lot, too. These symptoms can last for a single hour to many hours.

I just want to know it will get better and that I will not always be in this state. I know I will probably have such thoughts occur again I just want them to be periodic at least and not permanent.

Miserable chest pain, asphyxia, psudo dysphagia, full limb numbness and daily panic attacks. For the most part I would distract myself by playing games or studying constantly so I wouldn't give my brain room to spiral. 

The last month and a bit though I noticed on top of anxiety my love for everything disappeared. I used to love drawing and playing games and programming but I can't do any of it for more than 5-30 minutes. I have no energy and no will to do anything other than read and watch tv. I've missed about half the classes of my last semester cause I can't bring myself to do anything.

Two weeks ago I started on cipralex and 3 days in I stopped having daily panic attacks. Since then my anxiety is just passive. I still get pain but I won't spiral and I won't randomly cry over nothing. But now that the constant presence of anxiety is gone it only leaves the depression left over. Ive been speaking to a therapist about it but after 6 sessions all that she's been able to tell me is that I probably have depression. I feel pathetic every day I don't go to school and I feel miserable only going outside to walk while literally only watching tv all day.

I feel a massive gap now that my anxiety isn't a constant presence in my life. Even though every day was grueling and painful it wasn't empty. I had things that I could sink myself into temporarily only to spiral into a panic attack for an hour over taking my pills. Every day something happened and now it's completely empty. I'm really lost for what to do and I'm not finding a lot of progress with my therapist. I just want to be able to have something to make me want to get out of bed but there's nothing that interests me anymore. Please advise or encouragement would be nice",1677928740.0

The latest one was silly.. I haven't done much physical activity in a long time. I take the elevator up and down (18 floors) and just walk to the supermarket nearby. 

One day it was taking ages to get the elevator to my floor, so I decided to take the stairs down.

Next day my calves started hurting a lot. It continued to the second day when I started worrying. Maybe I'm diabetic and this is how I lose my legs? [insert other insane theories why you will lose your legs].

The 3rd was the worst. It was really difficult to even walk around in my apartment. I was panicking a lot, applying pain gel, taking a hot bath etc. Still very much afraid. I couldn't really sleep much.

I was afraid to Google muscle pain and find out I'm dying or something... 

Happy to announce that now on the 4th day the pain has started to subside. The muscles are still painful and sore, but it's much easier to move around. I'm guessing it was just a case of _sore muscles_ and not Dying Flesh Diabetic Shock Death. 🙄

I used to always take the stairs down instead of the elevator so I guess my calves were in good condition. I stopped doing that coz I had an unrelated toe injury a few months back which made walking a bit painful.

I guess this whole thing was a reminder for me to actually take care of my body and do some exercise or at least move around a bit more.

In the last two weeks, I've had 3 panic attacks about headphones, once bc I lost the pair I like most, and had recently replaced a crap pair to replace a pair I had also lost. Again when the new replacement pair was thought lost, and later the same day when a headset I had fixed broke again.   
In the right mind, I can tell the reactions are unwarranted, which makes even less sense, because why did I freak out despite?   
For reference, panic attacks consist of in addition to common symptoms kicking, punching myself, and almost crying.  
I recently turned 24 and have been having issues with headphones breaking or being lost since high school. I general this has upset me for some time, but never caused this kind of reaction. Mentally I'm still kinda fucked bc of the events of the last 3 years. 

I'm supposed to study a highly technical university degree, but digital troubleshooting, online studies in any capacity, any bureaucracy and video calls make me feel sick at the least. I struggle to even get my mental health care rebates, and loss of money of this is scaring me.

I'm terrified, I am supposed to be healing, I'm on medication, seeing a great psyche who specialise with YA on the spectrum. But I am still getting worse mental, whilst objectively everything is getting better though.

Well, this may be long and jumbled but I will try my best to explain everything. I'd love have someone read this but I understand if it's too long. So, I've struggled with depression, anxiety, and OCD since I was 8 years old. I was diagnosed with all three early on in life. I am currently 24 and was diagnosed with PTSD 3 years ago from a lot of stressful events that happened around 5 years ago and some stuff in between. I'm a very sensitive person. I feel everything. My senses get overloaded easily. Etc. I've had sleep issues ever since I was 13. They seem to be getting weirder and more stressful as I get older and more stressed. So around December I got covid. It triggered an OCD spiral that I couldn't get out of and essentially it created a lot of associations and flashbacks of things that happened 5 years ago. I haven't had emotions tied to my trauma ever. Until recently in December. It hit me suddenly and I began to spiral with flashbacks, panic attacks, losing weight, shaking everyday, not sleeping, etc etc. I was a complete wreck. I would shake all day long. Get no sleep. Cry all day. Get flashbacks non stop. Panic all day. Etc. once this started consistently going on all day everyday, my derealization/depersonalization kicked in really badly. My depression got insanely bad to the point I felt ready to k!ll myself. I gasped for air before falling asleep everynight, I have nightmares, bad dreams, wake up every hour confused and disoriented. I'll wake up feeling so dark and depressed like my world is crashing. Like a huge dark cloud is over me. Everything feels distant and fake and dark. Even thinking about my parents or sister or my house, it all feels dark and fake and I don't know why. I have racing thoughts before falling asleep. These thoughts are jumbled and don't make sense or have any correlation to reality. I fall asleep and within an hour I'm tossing and turning and half awake half asleep. While I wake up these times throughout the night I wake up feeling disoriented and saying and thinking random shit that seems like an alternate reality. I keep feeling the same feeling as it happens like every night now. How my night of sleep goes, bleeds into my day. Throughout the day I'll remember what it was like to feel confused and disoriented thinking weird thoughts that make no sense. It takes me back to how I felt in those moments and it freaks me out and makes me really depressed. I know a lot of these weird symptoms happen only surrounding sleep but it feels like psychosis or something during those times at night bc it's so confusing and disorienting. I hate feeling out of control. I have a fear of going crazy. During the day, my senses are heightened and pick up on everything. I feel groggy all day. Sleep deprived. Not thinking straight. Depressed as hell. Everything feels dark. All the symptoms of DR/DP. I have a hard time eating. I panic non stop. I had to stop my life lately (I can't work, go to the gym, hang with friends, drive, leave the house, etc). I've been to two psych inpatient units bc of how out of control I felt. I lost 12 pounds from my stress. I am already light weight so it's detrimental. 110lbs down to 97/98. Was able to bring it back up a little bit but it's a battle. I don't have an eating disorder. Anxiety just hits me in my stomach. All day long I suffer ocd intrusive thoughts and have rituals and compulsions. I feel crazy and alone. I over analyze everything I feel or think bc of my fear of losing touch with reality. I am nervous I have irreversible brain damage from all the stress. I know writing this doesn't capture what really has been going on and I understand that. I just want to know if anyone has every felt so stressed that every second of the day and night, they are bombarded by mental issues?

I guess I am going to start to get scared of my own self from now on.,1,11hsk0c,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11hsk0c/6th_sense_or_anxiety_i_guess_i_am_going_to_start/,0,"Lol is anxiety even good? I don't know. I am scared of it right now. Occasionally I would get anxious for no reason but my mind would fixate on something and tell me that something is wrong. I would try to brush it off but my mind would insist that there is something. 

Anyways, I just woke up from a dream that a certain animal predator was attacking me. I woke up in fear. Something in my head was telling me to turn on the light. I was trying to ignore it and telling myself that the dream I had was just a dream but my anxiety was insisting that I had to look around me and that there certainly must be something. I kept on feeling anxious and I ended up giving in to my fear and looking around and found a big spider right next to me on the wall. 

It's possible that it crawled on me while asleep and my head detected it despite me being in a deep sleep and not conscious. I hope not 😭. Eww I am scared. 

2 years and never had a spider in my room let alone a big one. Well it's not a huge predator like the one I had in my dream but yeah.

Lol it's not the first time something like that happens to me and now I am more scared of myself. Anxiety can be good sometimes. Only sometimes, when we detect real threats earlier than everyone else. 

But now how can I get rid of the damn spider. I don't want to kill it yet I am scared of it and there is nothing else I can do.",1677913498.0

I was out to buy some lunch and when I was stepping in the shop a little boy called me. He couldn't have been more than 10-12 years old, and accompanied with another younger boy.

He was asking for $3. Boys his age usually spend money on toys around this area so I asked him for what? And he said to buy food. His answer didn't register at first because looking at him, he looked otherwise healthy, a bit plump, with clean clothes and wasn't shy about asking money. I only had $2 in my wallet because ewallets, so I gave it to him.

And then he asked if I give him this money do I still have money to buy food. At that moment my brain finally started to process the whole thing. I still kept calm and gave him and told him I have so its ok and I went in the shop.

But while I was picking out my food I kept thinking ""What if they're really hungry and have no food at home?"" I kept looking around for the shopkeepers/cashiers because I have good rapport with them because I want to ask/tell them about that hungry boy outside. I started to freak out on the inside and completely shut down and go autopilot mode and picked my food calmly. I could see the cashier guy but I couldn't actually speak about the boys.

But then I kept thinking what if they're just kids who wants to get some money for other stuff. Or what if they're part of some small hustlers and were marking people. What if once I start helping them they'll keep coming at me every time they see me or maybe they'll follow me home and keep asking for money and they know where I live. But what if they're actually hungry and maybe their parents aren't home a lot and nobody's home to make food. Or they're very poor and couldn't feed the whole family so they have to eat in shifts like some family members eat only lunches while the others eat dinners. 

I know all these thoughts are wrong and they just paralyzed me from actually helping them, but I could actually continue buying lunch and then I went to another shop to look at power cord extensions. Why can I do \*these\* things and not \*that\* thing? All the while I kept thinking about those two boys and whether they are going to eat but I cannot move myself to go to them or maybe just buy some extra food and pass those to them its the very least I could do but I didn't.

250,"If you’re wondering whether adverse childhood experiences are negatively impacting you as an adult, you probably already know the answer.",8,11hbvqm,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11hbvqm/if_youre_wondering_whether_adverse_childhood/,4,"In my work as a hypnotherapist most of my clients are mature adults experiencing issues rooted in anger, anxiety, depression - or a mixture of these. Often, they are wondering if their present issues are linked to their childhood experiences. More often than not, the answer is yes. 

Research carried out since the end of the last century has led to a greater understanding of how adverse childhood experiences impact on long term wellbeing – both physical and psychological. The key findings are:

· Childhood trauma is very common: even in so-called well-to-do areas.

· There is a direct link between childhood trauma and chronic disease in adulthood.

· The more types of trauma a child experiences, the greater the risk of them of experiencing social and emotional problems as adults.

· Those who experience childhood trauma often experience more than one type of trauma.

You can calculate your own ACEs score by responding to the following questions. Give yourself 1 point for each question where you experienced that category of trauma before your eighteenth birthday. 

1. Emotional abuse: Did a parent or other adult often or very often insult, demean, belittle, humiliate, verbally assault, or threaten to physically assault You? 

2. Physical abuse: Did a parent or other adult often or very often grab, slap, push, or hit You? 

3. Sexual abuse: Did a parent, adult, or someone at least five years older than you ever touch your body in a sexual way or attempt or have oral, anal, or vaginal intercourse with You? 

4. Emotional neglect: Did You often or very often feel that no one in your family loved you or thought you were important; or your family did not look out for each other, feel close to each other, and support each other? 

5. Physical neglect: Did You often not have enough to eat, had to wear dirty clothes, had no one to attend to your medical and dental needs, or had no one to protect you? 

6. Loss of parent: Were your parents separated or divorced, or did you lose a parent for any reason? 

7. Domestic violence: Did You often or very often witness or hear violence between your parents or other adults where someone was being grabbed, shoved, slapped, hit, kicked, had something thrown a them, sexually attacked, or threatened with a weapon? 

8. Family member with addiction: Did You live with anyone who was a problem drinker or alcoholic, who used illicit drugs, or who was addicted to any other substances? 

9. Family member with depression/mental illness: Did you live with anyone who was depressed or mentally ill, attempted or committed self-harm and/or suicide, or hospitalized for mental illness? 

10. Family member incarcerated: Did you live with anyone who went to prison? 

ACES Score (0-10) = 

As ACE scores increase, so does the risk of disease, social and emotional problems. With an ACE score of four or more, things start getting serious. While studies in different locations return slightly different results, the figures suggest around 11% of the population have experienced four or more adverse childhood experiences.  

Fortunately, brains and lives are somewhat plastic. Resilience research shows that the appropriate integration of resilience factors — such as asking for help, developing trusting relationships, forming a positive attitude, listening to feelings — can help people improve their lives. Research in to post traumatic growth has identified five broad areas of growth:

· greater appreciation of life, 

· closer relationships with others, 

· increased personal strength, 

· new possibilities in life, and 

· spiritual “development

Which correlate very closely with the dimensions of wellbeing psychology:

· Positive emotions

· Positive engagement

· Positive relationships

· Positive meaning

· Positive accomplishments

· Positive health",1677870625.0
251,Major anxiety regarding money,3,11hk5be,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11hk5be/major_anxiety_regarding_money/,2,"For context: I have a history of depression/anxiety, though I’m mostly recovered due to being heavily medicated for years. However, I do live with a mood disorder + PMDD that I doubt is ever going to go away. 

I’m not sure if this behavior stemmed from how I was raised, but I am constantly so anxious and stressed about money. This has especially become prevalent due to the cost of living and inflation. 

Then, it got even worse. The saddest thing happened: I got into my number 1 grad program, and I was on top of the world, but then, I became so low, depressed, and anxious when I realized that I don’t know how I’m going to pay for tuition + rent. 

I’ve never rented before, and this whole process is eating me up. How am I supposed to find a decent place and decent people to live with for less than or equal to $1000 a room? How will I know that they will accept me and my senior cat? How will I make my TA stipends fund my living costs? 

I make spreadsheet after spreadsheet trying to predict costs and funding. This is all eating me up, and I’m barely getting any sleep. I feel like I’m constantly doing math in my head and looking at rental listings. 

All this anxiety makes me just want to give up, but I know I’ve gotten so far already. It’s just so sad, because I’m focusing on all this, but I need to be focusing on the program. I’m worried that I will be distracted from school in September, because I can’t support myself.",1677889755.0

I have made a mistake of my life yesterday while being extremely drunk.

I had PROTECTED vaginal sex with prostitute for some 20 mins maybe. She put the condom with bare hands, it stayed on during the whole act, and then at the end she took it off, and while it was still on, it slipped off very easily. I didn't come. After this she wiped my dick with wet towel, it being clean, I don't know. Then she gave me a hand job, no protection with this and lube used, I don't know how clean her hands were.

While she took off the condom, my dick toucher her hand or skin or something very briefly like 0,2sec. I can't remember what it touched. 

I have severe anxiety. I'm not a guy who is interested in doing things like this, I take my health extra cautiously, and I can't stop thinking about what if scenarios.

I would kindly appreciate a proper answer why/why not am I under a risk of contracting hiv.

She asked at least three times to remove the condom, I always refused. 

I can't fucking wait for few months to get the results. It's really driving me crazy.

And to all of you: I know transimmion even without condom is quite rare. I know it's kind of difficult to get HIV in the first place, but with bad luck it can also happen during just 1 second intercourse. 

I am seeking assurance that I am safe, to get rid of my anxiety. Please be informal, and honest.

I’ve been suffering from anxiety and depression my whole life but I’ve felt terrible lately.  I’ve been trying to work as a kennel tech for the past year with no luck since I’m always nervous and worry during work time which I know it might sound as “I don’t know what I’m doing” and of course people don’t trust me. I got fired from my previous job since I kept doubting what I was doing and I kept overthinking every single thing I made. I am thinking on quitting this career since I haven’t been able to move forward since my mind doesn’t shut up. I keep thinking “I am not enough” “I don’t know what I am doing” “I need to recheck what I am doing”. When I got fired from my previous job the reason they gave me was that “I am a slow learner” and they needed someone who could learn faster.

I don’t want to give up but at the same time I don’t know what to do since I know it’s not me it’s my mind that keeps me worried all day (even on my days off)

To the point where we do not even go in those rooms, because it is impossible, I do not remember when was the last time I was there. Due to this my 12 year old brother has never had his own room and still lives with my parents(I think that is very very disrespectful against my brother), and I live in a very tiny room and barely have any floor space.

318,Anxiety advice/long story,1,11hhr2r,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11hhr2r/anxiety_advicelong_story/,3,"So I’ve been experiencing really bad anxiety due to my dogs health declining, watching her have more than 10 seizures (we could only take her to an on call vet because they were closed during the weekend), and then waking up to my parents telling me that she passed away in the early morning. Seeing her laying in her little dog bed unmoving and not breathing really broke me. Ever since then I had a fear that my other old dog was going to die, that I was going to die because I couldn’t live without her, or that my grandparents are going to die soon. 

I first experienced anxiety a couple of years ago when I had chest pain and was constantly worrying that I was having heart problems. It was so bad one time that my heart felt like it slammed against my chest and I had to do some breathing exercises to calm myself down. Came to find out it was inflammation in my chest wall because it hurt when I pressed down on my chest. After that I was prescribed citalopram for the anxiety. I do believe I have anxiety due to genetics because my dad has it and his dad has it. 

I had taken the anxiety meds for a few months and gradually stopped taking them because I thought I was fine. Fast forward to now and I have started taking them again because my anxiety got really bad. I forgot that the citalopram had caused me to have a panic attack before because after taking it again for a few days I had one again. I was fast asleep until my body jolted itself awake, I felt like I had pins and needles on my head, my vision became a little blurry, my heart started pounding, and I became really hot. I calmed down for a bit but every time I would try to go back to sleep my body would jolt itself awake. Getting up and moving around would help but I was so alert and tired at the same time I could not sleep. I only got one hour of sleep that whole night. 

I feel like the past few days my anxiety just gradually keeps getting worse and then will get better after a while. Yesterday was the worst I’ve ever felt. The left side of my chest and heart felt like they were burning so bad, my left arm was in pain at some points, I felt cold, I had an upset stomach, and I felt shaky and light headed at times. The burning kept going on for about half of the day and just kept getting worse if I was sitting or laying down or thinking about it. I took 4 tums because I thought it was bad heartburn and that my anxiety was aggravating it, but I felt like the burning was still there after taking them. That night I was so tired I wanted to collapse and sleep. I was surprised that I actually fell asleep because the pain in my chest was so bad. I woke up in the middle of the night and the burning was gone and I felt like a rag doll, like my body was limp and I no longer felt jittery. I was so happy because I felt at peace and I could breathe again.

Today I feel a little better but I feel pain in my left arm and sometimes burning in my chest even when I’m calm. I’m thinking it’s just like my body is still having lingering effects from the trauma that it’s been through but will slowly get better. This is only my second time ever having anxiety and it hasn’t been this bad before. I’ve been having anxiety for about 4 days on and off now. Does it ever build up over time, come to a peak, then starts to decline and finally releases you? I know that everyone is different with recovery but I want this to go away so bad and have my life back again.

Does this sound like psychosis or bipolar?
So I've had some sort of paranoid delusions since I was 11, but only recently realized they started then…no delusions nowadays nas far as I know.

I was diagnosed (in quotes; because it's a symptom, not a disorder) with psychosis NOS by a psychiatrist who specializes in adolescent psychiatry (I'm 18)

Anyway, I'm very impulsive (spend all the money on crap whenever I have the chance, aggressive sometimes, etc.), I feel empty / bored, mood swings

Another psychiatrist has suggested that I have something like mania/bipolar, but I really don't believe that.
My aunt once thought I looked similar to my schizo/bipolar cousin who was about 28 at the time (I was 13) when I had a ""meltdown/episode"" of sorts (I had a really weird situation, I hurt others and almost got hit by a car, others threatened to put me in the psych ward/ call the police, etc.)",1677859931.0

I am an extravert. I like that every discussion is pleasant. I even have a best friend who lives far away who remains a constant weather we talk for 2 hours or 2 seconds. I think I'm going to opt out of pursuing closeness with anybody new until my anxiety is cured or treated.

I also have a supportive family all over. I got codependent on my bf (m36) for my GAD and exhausted him by telling him all my worries. Usually about small things. An assignment I still have weeks to do, worrying about how to wash my dishes without waking up my roommate, worrying that I somehow am a bad person for various really small mistakes. And then me tiring him out makes me feel like a worse person.

It SHOULD be easy to just not tell him that stuff but it isn't. I feel like I'm lying to him by not informing him how immoral a person I am for forgetting to take out the trash or eating unhealthy that day.

That's why with friends I keep my distance. Telling them the bare minimum seems so much healthier. I would be burdening them if they didn't think I was ""happy"" all the time. I know when I'm too close to somebody I worry at them and that is toxic. I had 2 best friends two months ago but with midterms it was easier to not respond to them than risk telling them my thoughts. When I got less stressed and reached out it's like they dropped off the face of the world.

I know it's my fault I lost my friends by avoiding them. I know it's my fault my boyfriend wants to leave me. But I am so good at my career and have such a good LD friendship and I have such a good job. I also have great social skills with strangers and network like a boss. All I have trouble with is oversharing or under-attending those I really care about. I think I want to save up money for my own apartment and a cat and that might be all the love I need for life. I bet if I stopped having people I was scared of losing, I'd have less anxiety. I can get lonely sometimes but it is better than constantly wondering where I stand with people.

Is giving up on close relationships okay? Like can I do that and be a healthier person? Frankly I'd rather risk feeling horrible than keep making others feel that way by telling them what I think about. I see isolating as a potential experiment and maybe I can protect others or even me. I am NOT an introvert, wondering if my friends secretly hate me is just too exhausting and I like strangers' company more.",1677870428.0

I have kept a worry workbook in google sheets since 2012. Each time I have a worry I use it to challenge and put the worry into perspective. It helps me let the worry go. There are nearly 600 entries to date a lot of them repeat and are the same worry. 
Disclaimer: Im not a healthcare professional this is just what I made up with the help of healthcare professionals and counselors over the years. I even used to print it off and take it to sessions.

How to make your own worry workbook.

Make several column headings:

* Date

* What is my worrisome thought

* What am I predicting / what is the belief?

* What is the evidence that this thought is true?

* What is the evidence that this thought is false?

* Whats the probability that what im scared of will actually happen (low / medium / high)

* is there a more positive way of looking at the situation?

* how will worrying about it help me

* what would I say to a friend who had this worry?

* outcome

so let me share a recent worry as an example:

* Date *2023-03-02*

* What is my worrisome thought *My dad wont be ok with his CT scan he will pass out or panic*

* What am I predicting / what is the belief? *My dad is not well he wont be able to do it*

* What is the evidence that this thought is true? *Last time my dad had a CT scan he had a panic attack and didnt cope well.*

* What is the evidence that this thought is false? *He has had plenty of scans in the past he will be fine.*

* Whats the probability that what im scared of will actually happen (low / medium / high) *medium - feels real*

* is there a more positive way of looking at the situation? *He has to have this scan so they can work out of there is any more cancer. he will be in the hospital its the best place for him and they help people though scans all the time.*

* How will worrying about it help me *Worry won't help me but I can be there to support him.*

* what would I say to a friend who had this worry? *Just be there for your dad it's a stressful time, you can't take it away. Offer help and put him at ease.*

* outcome *he was fine and just awaiting results.*

Or maybe I'm just looking for a place to vent. I don't know honestly.

So here is the story of my cancelled trip to Istanbul: in January I booked a flight for my father and me to travel to Istanbul for a weekend. We have family there.

We wanted to visit them and Istanbul is basically my favorite city in the world. 

Our main goal though was to watch a soccer match there.

I was so excited to go. But then the earthquakes happened.

They're miles and miles away from Istanbul but they triggered my anxiety in a way I didn't know was possible. I can't possibly imagine how the people feel that lost multiple family members.

Our family is fine but I thought about cancelling our trip. The football match was no more and my anxiety went through the roof. I told my father that I'm struggling psychologically and that I'm looking for professional help.

But I still tried to go and my father really wanted me to join him. About a week before departure I wasn't able to function properly. I could hardly work or concentrate, I was crying a lot and felt like shit.

The day before the flight I've told my father that I decided against the trip. I didn't feel like I could take the leap and fight through my anxiety. I was having diarrhea. The challenge felt too big. 

My dad was, understandably, very disappointed. Now I feel like cancelling the trip was a bad idea because I let my dad travel to Istanbul alone, because Ive spent money needlessly and I feel like going there could have eased my anxiety. Healing is outside of your comfort zone as they say.

I honestly feel a lot of shame and guilt right now.

- My dad is medicated but doesn’t seem to help him at all.
- I’m secretly in therapy. 

When someone is starting to act anxious, the rest of us also become very anxious and hyper sensitive, always end up in stressful & unnecessary arguments.

&#x200B;

I should probably preface this with the fact I'm emetophobic (throwing up petrifies me). I've always had a fear in particular since I was a kid, of waking up at night and throwing up. No idea why. I think that might have something to do with what's happening here.

So about 4 weeks ago I threw up randomly at like 2am for some unknown reason. I think it was from bad food but idk for sure.

Not only that but my life has been thrown into turmoil as I have a very sick family member in the hospital, I have relationship problems, and also my dog might have cancer... so everything is stressful as hell at the moment.

Ever since that night where I was sick, I've been suffering with night time panic attacks (at least 1 or 2 a week) that always happen a couple hours after I fall asleep. I wake up, feel ok for like 3 seconds and then suddenly my throat feels tight, I get insanely hot and I start sweating. I get INSANE nausea that feels like I'm about to start throwing up and the only way to stop it is to breathe through it. I haven't actually been sick from these panic attacks yet because I fight it with every ounce of my being (due to my phobia). I find that having a window open and breathing cold night air helps a little. Eventually my heart rate calms down and I stop sweating, but the nausea and trembling sticks around for 20-30 minutes and comes in waves until eventually I manage to relax enough to fall back to sleep.

Then I'm fine, until it happens again.

It's probably a mix of the phobia and the stress of life right now. I have no clue how to handle it at all though, and it's leaving me exhausted the day after it happens. :( I'm already on SSRI's (Fluoxetine, which I've been on for a loooong time) and I've tried therapy multiple times which has helped a little but I'm still struggling.

Anyone got any tips on how to stop them or deal with these panic attacks? They're horrendous.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Waking up and having horrible panic attacks during the night 1 or 2 times a week for the last month or so that come with extreme nausea, sweating, high heart rate and trembling. Any advice to help would be appreciated. ♥",1677853608.0

My anxiety only happens at work I’ve noticed, and I recently just got a promotion and will be moving to another station with a pay raise. Thing is, I’m SUPER anxious about it and I really just want to relax. I’m not looking for something that’s long term, only something to take while I’m at work to provide instant relief and that’s it. I know benzodiazepines are super addictive and dangerous, so I’m not sure if I would want to try that first. Before anyone mentions CBD or marijuana, I’ve tried taking CBD at work and it only helps for about an hour or two and doesn’t completely do the trick. I only stick to THC at night since I don’t want to risk more anxiety at work. I’m currently in the process of finding a doctor, I just want some other peoples advice to give me an idea.

[ MY JOURNEY],3,11gv8ym,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11gv8ym/its_been_6_months_guys_here_my_story_of_my_severe/,0,"Last  year in August, I had a severe panic attack that was triggered by a  sudden pain in my left calf. Despite my parents' reassurances to calm  down, I became increasingly anxious after my friend suggested that it  could be a blood clot.

Upon  searching online, I found that blood clot was a possible cause of the  pain, which terrified me.(google is do crap sometimes..dont ever search  health related things cuz it will get worse)

I started overthinking about it and became more fearful day by day, thinking that I might die from it.(at the age of 25?)

The  panic attack began with tingling sensations in my hands and legs, along  with severe back pain and tightening of the upper back. At the time, I  was unaware that it was a panic attack and believed that I was going to  die.

I lost focus on my job and  everything else in my life, and I cried every day. I secretly met with  two doctors, but they also advised me to calm down and suggested seeing a  psychiatrist.

Fortunately, I  found a YouTube video that explained my symptoms and identified it as  anxiety. I didn't initially believe it, but I asked questions in an  online group and received helpful support.

I started medication, and although the symptoms persisted for 3-4 months, I focused on my life instead of my health.

\* and the best thing is that the calf pain disappeared after about 7-8 days, and it turned out to be just a muscle cramp. LOL

My  psychiatrist helped me alot. Suddenly,  the severe pain in my upper  back disappeared, and the tingling sensations in my hands and legs  decreased.(It happened on a single night..when i woke up)

After  six months, I am now in good mental health, although some symptoms  still persist, such as occasional palpitations in my heart.

However,  my doctor assured me that it would go away with time. I learned that  our minds can do a lot of things we never thought possible, and  medication can be helpful. Feel free to ask me anything, and I'll do my  best to help.",1677831109.0

I still feel like a terrible person. I can't go out and enjoy myself alone. I have my partner stressed out sometimes from worrying about me. She is afraid to do things she might need to do or enjoy such as going on a work trip. Because I will be scared to both be alone and if something bad happened too.  


I hate myself and this illness more than anything. I feel like the ultimate burden. I know there are things that help and I am slowly working on them at a pace that is good for me. But it still is taking time. Right now I just do what I can and I try to remind myself that I am only doing my best really.  


There are days when I wish I would go to sleep and never wake up. Not really though because my partner and others would be devastated. I know in the long term that it would help them not having someone freak out in worry so often. It is the easy way out. I am trying the harder one. And damn.  


I'm not sure what posting here would do. I might get good advice. Or judgmental responses. Whatever though. I just want to say all this and hope there can be any words of help. I hate how restricted I feel and I make others feel. I had my partner saying she hopes to travel more on work trips  and I want that for her too while I do more to help her.

I know some might question why I am in a relationship. It is what it is. It just happened. If anything too: without her in my life. I would be in a far worse place than I am now.

I also find it hard to do it with a full-time job, a wife, and a son that needs looking after. 
I suffer from anxiety and depression and also struggle with making conversation, which is why I thought I'd try CBT again, but I am honestly not sure if it's working.

I have never spoken to a girl romantically, I dropped out of high school yr 12 because of missing exams. I was scared to walk in late - I would always be a bit late because of ADHD. I would miss presentations because I was too scared to speak in public, I'm too scared to go to community college because I'm afraid people will judge me and think I'm stupid.

Recently in the last few years it got even worse. I have panic attacks constantly, worry about meaningless things, attempted suicide.

I got addicted to street benzos and had to do a taper, but still need them.

I'm agoraphobic. I have only had one low-level job. I of course took Xanax on the job. On days I didn't have Xanax  i panicked and tried to get by. I missed work because of anxiety at least 5 times and was fired in 2 months. 

I have no money, cant leave my house, or get a job, I need benzos. I have been off and on Lexapro and Prozac my entire life and it has never, ever done ANYTHING. No side effects, nothing.

I am paranoid. Extremely so. Sometimes carrying weapons which is illegal where I am.

Even when I was exercising it wouldnt go away - but got A LOT better. My shins got severe splints, but I still ran because if I didn't I would get panic attacks. I ran a 18km per day, no restdays .

It’s not always been crippling, but there have been moments where it’s been a struggle to function because of it. For the most part, it’s been situational, and I’m thankful that I can say that it’s been manageable for the last 5 years. 

Back in December, I faced the most horrible experience with anxiety to date. I lost my appetite, my stomach was always in knots, I had diarrhea ever time I went to the bathroom, racing heartbeat that would wake me up in the middle of the night, and of course the constant feeling of dread at all moments of the day. Everything in my life is fine, so I couldn’t understand why this time it was unmanageable.

To assess all my options before medication (I’m already in therapy), I went to a functional doctor on January 6th. He suggested that my magnesium levels might be low, which can cause your nervous system to malfunction. 

So for the next month, I took 3 supplements a day of Magnesium Gycinate along with vitamin D. My anxiety isn’t gone, but it’s night and day compared to how I felt in December. My stomach healed, my sleep improved, and I no longer felt the existential dread that consumed me. I didn’t change anything else about my lifestyle except my diet. I ate very bland because it was all I could handle.

I just wanted to share this because it helped me and I hope it can help one of you. The current research on its affects on anxiety are poor, but it may be worth a shot. It helps me sleep too, so I suggest taking it before bed.",1677815583.0

She and her boyfriend chalked it down to stress but she hasn't mentioned to me lately that she's been this stressed to make herself sick. I know she has been waiting for her period to come for a bit now and that to my knowledge hasn't had it yet. She's also taken at least two test that were negative but I saw a wrapper for another one in the garbage but I didn't see the actual test this time. 

I don't want to keep asking questions to them at least when she's feeling sick bc I don't want to be an asshole but I really just want clarity. 

I'm thinking in my head that she's likely to be pregnant but I'm also not trying to put that energy into the universe. But I also don't want it to be the stomach virus. I'm crossing my fingers that it's just stress but can someone please just help me get through my anxiety. 

I have already cleaned all the surfaces that everyone usually touches and I've cleaned my phone and all of that. Please send guidance.

I am studying Electrical and Computer Engineering in Greece and I am having trouble with persistent thoughts. Two semesters ago I had to pick a track(specialization), the one i picked was ""Electronics and Computer systems"", which consists of electronics courses, computer engineering courses and courses on Signals and Robotics. Back then I really liked Electronics and the design of Electronic Systems. But after two semesters in which I completed some of the computer engineering courses and some Computer Science courses(Machine Learning, Human Computer Interaction and Neural Nets), I realised that I really like coding courses and that I should have picked up the software track(which consists of the aformentioned computer engineering courses+Signals Robotics+ Computer software(7 CS courses)). The thing is that now( I only have 1.5 semester to finish school and is not worth it to change tracks due to the extra load I will have. It should be obvious to me that there is no wrong in finishing up the track as it is due to the fact that I have done CS courses anyway and the difference is not that important (5 courses that I will miss out in Software). But I have persistent and intrusive thoughts that I am wrong and I should weighted my interests better. It keeps disrupting my mood and my academic performance, I really do not know how to handle the persistent thoughts, they destroy my self confidence.

My friends love to go to our school’s football games and I used to love them during my freshman year. 

(For reference, COVID cut my freshman year short and now I am a senior) 

When we went to the first game of the season, I was so excited to get back into the swing of things and I wasn’t expecting for anything to happen. After standing up in the student section with people jostling me around, screams coming from every which way, the bright lights of the stadium, and the unbearable heat making my shirt cling to my skin, I was VERY overwhelmed and I ended up dissociating for a good while. One of my friends came up and grabbed my waist from behind, in a lighthearted manner, but she didn’t realize how stressed out I was. It scared me due to past experiences and that was the last straw. I began to have a panic attack. With another friend’s help, I was able to leave the stadium and calm down. 

I had never had a panic attack from being overstimulated so I didn’t really understand what to do. I thought that it could have been a fluke due to the heat so the next time we went to a football game, I tried dressing cooler and made sure to take breaks if I needed to. 

The same thing happened. I was overstimulated and I ended up having a panic attack.

It’s been a while since then and I have talked to my therapist about it. I have begun to use foam earplugs when I know it’s going to be loud somewhere and I avoid a lot of social situations where I know it will be too much for me. Now here is the part that I need advice on:

I recently got tickets to see Ghost, a rock band that I love, and I know that it’s going to be loud and crazy. Taking my story into account, I know that there is a good chance that it will be too much for me to handle. I wanted to know what you guys think will be helpful in order to prepare. I really want to go to this concert and I am hoping that I will be able to handle it. I believe that with the correct preparation I will be able to get through the concert and even enjoy myself.

I have looked into buying noise cancelling or reducing headphones. Wearing cooler clothing under a zip up hoodie would be a good idea. 

Please let me know what you guys think. I really want to have a good time and just enjoy the concert without having to worry about a panic attack.",1677816359.0

hello all.
So basically i’m looking for some answers after a couple of panic attacks that i had in October last year, and if i can attribute my current state to anxiety.

I’m a 22 year old male with a history of body dysmorpia/low self esteem in my adolescence, and a sort of hyper fixation style mindset in which i feel like i can’t really function without there being something wrong in my life. Despite this, i’ve never really thought i had anxiety/depression, with my mental state apart from this generally being fine, like no racing thoughts or social anxiety. 5 months ago I had a panic attack for the first time ever, literally over nothing. I went to the ER because i have mild asthma and i thought it was that, but realised in hindsight it was definitely panic attack. i had another one a week later, probably about 75% severity, and since then i’ve had a couple of mini ones but nothing like the first two. 

Basically, since then, my health has taken a downturn. I’ve developed IBS symptoms (normally about 5 days constipation followed by two days diarrhoea), and GERD symptoms (acid reflux, nausea, excess salvia, shortness of breath). The thing is, I don’t feel anxious in my day to day life. I’ve read through this forum a little bit trying to work out what’s wrong, and some of the awful mental things you guys go through (keep going by the way you all are amazing) i don’t have. I do wonder if part of my potential anxiety is convincing myself i’m not anxious or i don’t have an anxiety problem, which in turn makes me more anxious about my physical symptoms because i don’t have anything to attribute them to (i don’t have health anxiety as such but often find myself over googling my symptoms and feeling shitty about it). 

My doctor prescribed me sertraline a couple months ago which i have not yet taken, as he was really bad i told him about my anxiety attacks and they just prescribed me zoloft without really caring about the other stuff i’ve detailed here. As someone who doesn’t really know/see themselves as having an MH disorder, is zoloft a bad idea? Could anyone help me better understand the link between panic attacks and the digestive issues i’ve outlined? is this even possible or was it just a rubbish coincidence?

any help would be so so appreciated!! thanks guys",1677769409.0

 I am a medical student and I have my final exam of second year upcoming in less than 1 month and also not very confident about my preparation. 
I had visited a psychologist for the first time 3/4 weeks back as I was feeling so much hopeless.I get contact details from a batchmate of my med clg. 
My therapist told me to come every week but having my final exam ahead I didn't want to change my coping mechanism rn. My therapist had also given me a bunch of homework for changing my situation which was I think necessary for me but I wanted to fresh start after my final exam. At our first and last visit I tried to told her that I want to continue the session after my exam but she denied it.
I cannot do any of homework which was also pressuring me not to contact her for arranging our next session.Earlier  My plan was to contact her after my exam as I didn't have any bad feeling about my session.But 
Yesterday she called me and humiliated me for not contacting her for next session and saying things like "" tell your friend not to give my contact anyone or contact theft. If anyone want to visit her he / she should contact her from the clinic where she is practicing "".It is here to mention that  I get her number from my batchmate and called her for and appointment and visit her. Also taunt me saying things like "" Yes, it's your personal choice if you want to continue or not, have good preparation for your exam  etc "" in a teasing tone. 
It should be also mentioned that the distance between her chamber and my home is a 2.5h+2.5h bus journey , I didn't want to invest so much time on this rn. I told this too during my first session when she told to visit every week but don't pursue As she denied.
(Her chamber is near our clg and we are having exam leave so are currently at home town.)

Hey everyone, 44yr old male here. Long time general and health anxiety sufferer.

I have been dealing with anxiety for too many years to recall of which has caused numerous health scares from constant stress hyperstimulation (being in fight/flight all the time) including long duration bouts of muscle aches, headaches, IBS, heart PVCs, tinnitus, high blood pressure etc. etc. My newest concerning symptoms are the constant urge to pee!

For the last 2 months on at least every other day i have this reoccurring need to urinate. Some days I go 15-20 times and others i go the normal 6-8. The days when it really flares up are so discomforting and i will pee then right away i start to get the nervy fleeing in the grin then need to pee again 30min later.

I've seen my doc and had blood tests, urine tests and the prostate checked and all came back fine. I workout lots and am in very good health. I just cut out coffee and liquor (not happy about it) in hopes it may help.

The smart me thinks this is another cause of chronic stress and anxiety however the anxious me cant stop worrying about it being this being some other horrible disease google is telling me about that's causing the Overactive Bladder symptoms.

Does this sound like psychosis or bipolar?
So I've had some sort of paranoid delusions since I was 11, but only recently realized they started then…no delusions nowadays nas far as I know.

I was diagnosed (in quotes; because it's a symptom, not a disorder) with psychosis NOS by a psychiatrist who specializes in adolescent psychiatry (I'm 18)

Anyway, I'm very impulsive (spend all the money on crap whenever I have the chance, aggressive sometimes, etc.), I feel empty / bored, mood swings

Another psychiatrist has suggested that I have something like mania/bipolar, but I really don't believe that.
My aunt once thought I looked similar to my schizo/bipolar cousin who was about 28 at the time (I was 13) when I had a ""meltdown/episode"" of sorts (I had a really weird situation, I hurt others and almost got hit by a car, others threatened to put me in the psych ward/ call the police, etc.)",1677777143.0

I just came from a neurologist appointment due to having found that I have something called Chiari I malformation. I started asking him about issues that I’ve seen can be symptoms of this condition. This post is specific to the issues with memory and  problems speaking, in addition to just talking myself in circles with every doctor appointment.
The result of the appointment was that some of my physical pain could be related, but that the issues with memory and speaking (I have a hard time finding the right word a lot, and sometimes speak my sentences out of order) are probably just my anxiety.
I left feeling very silly. Like I’m just imagining everything and making a big deal out of nothing.
Is anxiety literally to blame for all this? I’m also considered obese by BMI standards. Maybe there’s a chicken and the egg situation here where I know if I take better care of my diet and physical health that the anxiety will get better, but I’ve struggled to lose weight for so long.

Of course this is very bad, and I’m hoping not to be judged, I just need to talk about this. 

I’ve tried brushing my teeth more in the last few years (I’m 17 now), but that isn’t helping because I already had multiple cavities. Last time I went to a dentist was I think 3 years ago now, for a cleaning, and my teeth weren’t this bad; one tooth has a hole in the back of it (which is my reason for posting this specifically, because it just chipped a bit bigger), another has a chip in it and is also probably a cavity, I have one that isn’t quite visible, that has been extremely sensitive to temperature lately, so I’m sure it’s a cavity as well, and another is a molar and I cannot chew on that side of my mouth at all because of it. 

Not to mention my wisdom teeth, which stopped hurting somehow, I went to an oral surgeon to check on them and he said they were growing in wrong, and needed to be taken out but the cavity next to them had to be fixed first. And unfortunately my family isn’t well off with money and this hasn’t been possible yet. 

I’m not sure when I’m be able to go to a dentist, so I have anxiety about my teeth breaking a bunch and falling out and needing dentures before I’m even 30, and I’m also anxious about actually going to a dentist, especially because I’m worried they’ll secretly bd judging how bad my dental hygiene has been. 

I keep working myself up thinking about the fact that my cavities will break more, and that eventually I’m not going to be able to even eat solid food. Even now I stay away from harder foods and stick to things that are soft or dissolve in your mouth. 

I have no idea what to do about any of this. It isn’t my parents fault. And I am just so incredibly anxious about this stuff, I get so close to tears thinking about how bad my teeth are and feeling the hole in the back of my tooth gives me even more anxiety about it.

Today was the day I was going to push myself to do it. Made the call. Asked about nitro gas and they hung up. I know if could have been a dropped call BUT I heard the click of the phone and was honestly confused and thought they put me on hold mid sentence but then I noticed I was no longer on the phone with them.

I’m not sure why me mentioning the nitro would upset them. Another office I called recommended them when I talked about my anxiety and asked about nitro gas but didn’t have it. 

But now I’m stuck on not wanting to call back. Either way I feel awkward about and more anxious about the appointment.

I think I need to somehow prepare myself for that moment, but it seems like even thinking about it gets me ramped up.

My hands would cramp and bend, my heart would get super tight, I'd spend the time until the hot water ran out siting it out in the shower rocking in pain and fear. They got to the point I couldn't hold down a job. Now it's these odd four five day stretches of me clicking my fingernails, not able to sleep AT ALL or eat AT ALL. I can't pay attention to anything or enjoy anything I used to. Going to Walmart has gotten so overwhelming that I can't leave the house sometimes. Shit, playing FO76 will overwhelm me and I end up just staring at my C.A.M.P on the television wishing I could go play in that Nuke zone. I'm incredibly forgetful because I try to keep up with my thoughts, and I can't so I lose track. Then there's this idea in my head to just start over, and maybe next time I'll get it right. It's so difficult to explain. The best way I can put it is if a dog was chasing a cat but the creature was Catdog (Google it.) It's so exhausting. The tight chest and knotted up stomach. The feeling of drowning and you can't catch your breath or get enough oxygen. Shooting sharp pains in both arms, chest, and all my muscles stay tensed up even if I try to relax it. I constantly pick and click at my fingernails and pull hair from my hairline. I get this horrible sun burn feeling everywhere when I haven't been in the sun, my hands and face will get bright red and hurt. It's unbelievable how much I don't know who I am anymore. I don't know this person and I want to know wtf is happening to me. I'm angry all the time, at everything never used to be. I'm frustrated because it's getting harder and harder to cope. Not to even mention since I cant hold a job, I'm financially fucked and feel tho I'm a burden. I can't even get the help I need in one of the wealthiest countries in the world. I'm just tired of all this. The pain, intrusive thoughts, irrational fears and panic. How all my thoughts are all tangled up so tightly wounded together.

I recently had the worst anxiety I've ever felt in my entire life, and I'm still struggling to shake it. This event has been a very stark eye opener to me, letting me know that I have severe anxiety. It has even prompted me to seek professional help. 

I separated from my wife in July 2022. She moved out in August. At the beginning of February I decided to experiment with Tinder, and possibly dating again. I met someone and we had unprotected sex. I'm a male btw.

The morning after, I had myself convinced I was going to get hiv. I went straight to urgent care with the idea of going on medication to prevent it. I ended up not following through with that. A week later, after many panic attacks I started having diarrhea. And of course I looked up symptoms of initial hiv exposure and this was one of them. It did not help!

FF another week, I messaged the girl and asked her if she had any concerns, and that I was feeling very anxious about our encounter. She tells me that she tested clean recently. My panic was for nothing. Though I'm still not anxiety free. I still have some stomach issues.

So I have the following symptoms :

1. Unable to take a deep satisfying breath most of the time. Maybe 1 deep breath in 5 feels satisfying, the others feel like I'm short about 10%.

2. No1 leads to occasional yawning throughout the day, sometimes unsuccessful.

3. Acid reflux which I'm taking omeprazole for.

4. Sore legs, the kind of feeling most people get when looking over a high wall to a big drop below.

5. Jumpy legs in the evening, like there's an excess of sugars in the leg muscles.

I'm not aware of feeling anxious about anything, I've got a settled home life, steady job, money in the bank, no other health worries, so no obvious triggers. 

The breathing thing has come and gone since I was a teenager, no apparent correlation with anything in my life. It's been back now for about a month, the longest it's hung around for. 

I'm hopefully going to see my GP tomorrow, not sure what they'll suggest or offer. I'm open to taking tablets if they will help. 

Can anyone identify with any of the symptoms I've listed?

When she’s crying during a panic attack she becomes inconsolable. She often gets angry and blames me for not making enough money so that she can quit work. What can I say during these that can help her calm down?

I’ve tried to schedule mental health appointments. But of course, the knowledge that she will have to talk about herself and her anxiety leads to weeks of panic attacks leading up to it and usually she cancels. I took a day off work to make sure she would do her virtual psychiatry appointment (I left and gave her privacy during the session) and she was too anxious to share what was really going on. She was prescribed an antidepressant and sleeping pill but now is so anxious about the side effects and refuses to take them.

I reached my breaking point and bought her Xanax. It actually is a miracle drug. But my source is obviously not as reliable as a pharmacy, and I’m so worried about her getting addicted. 

I’m sorry that this turned into more of a venting post than anything else, but I don’t have anyone to go to for advice on this. I know there’s no magical way to deal with this but any advice would be so helpful.

To give some context, I suffer from depression, Anxiety, and OCD. This has been a part of my life for the last five years. I am on medication and have sort professional assistance in the past that has helped. Over those last five years, my stomach has been kind of hit-and-miss. I didn't really realise it was due to my anxiety until recently. However, over the last few months, it has gotten really bad. I am getting stomach flare-ups every few weeks and I am not sure why. These flare-ups make me bloated, feel sick, and stop me from eating. In the past, this hasn't been as big of an issue but the recent flare-ups have made my anxiety and depression go through the roof. As soon as my belly feels bad I start to get anxious that something horrible is going to happen. I then feel really down and get really stressed over the smallest things that didn't affect me a few months ago (even with my anxiety).

Sorry for the ramble but I wanted to know if anyone else had experienced this? If so, is there anything to help with it? I am on a waiting list to talk to my doctor, get CBT, and talk to a nutritionist. I hope they can give me assistance. However, being in the UK, I can be on these waiting lists for a few months. In the immediate future, I just want to know if there are any small things that can assist. And if anyone has suffered from this, what helped it?

Edit: I should add that when the flare-up goes, I am no longer as anxious about the things I worried about during the flare-up.",1677772067.0
553,How I healed my anxiety,8,11fsne1,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11fsne1/how_i_healed_my_anxiety/,4,"Hi, 

I just wanted to share my journey on here as I have been battling depression, anxiety, OCD thoughts and food issues for 25 years.

A little background, I grew up in an abusive home as my dad was a raging alcoholic. He was abusive in every sense to my mother, sister and I. Once my parents split things got a lot better but there was all of the residual, stored, and generational trauma that was causing some shit in my being to not be well.

I would go through these cycles of complete and utter bliss only to be followed by months of destructive patterns, anxiety, disassociation,  and depression that was so sever I couldn't leave my room half of the time.

About 3 years ago I decided to really get my shit together and get help. I am 28 years old now and up until that point I had seen several therapists that I feel didn't really work. because of the method of therapy.

Long story short- I have completed a solid 3 years of therapy in the modalities of plant medicine journeys, generational trauma release, EMDR, Lens, ketamine assisted therapy, nervous system therapy, breathwork, meditation, tantra and now I am onto micro-dosing iboga.

For the last several months I have been micro-dosing iboga and it has been a really amazing, heart opening and trauma dissolving experience. I feel that this plant has given me so much creativity, happiness and love. I never knew that once you fix all the triggers/trauma, what the other side feels like as I have never been on this side. I am waking up every single day consistently happy, not as triggered and soooooo much calmer. 

I just wanted to share this as it takes time to get your mental health in a good place. It takes a lot of work, years and a lot of support. Please don't get discouraged and know that you are not alone in this fight. Experiment with different modalities of healing, just because talk therapy worked for someone, doesn't mean it's the best for you or your situation. 

Also remember that sometimes when you feel a certain feeling doesn't necessarily mean it's YOURS. If our parents and their parents didn't clear up their trauma, unfortunately the gets passed down to us and stores in our body. So if we don't resolve that, we keep passing it down and continuing the cycle. 

I hope this sheds some light in sometimes a very very dark place. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions or to share your story. There is a lot of power in community!

Much Love",1677730669.0

I don't have my license and there are no interesting job opportunities here, so I feel stuck working at fast food restaurants. I can't even go out with friends because I have a panic attack just thinking about it.

 To make things worse, it's been two years since I've seen any of my friends since we graduated. I know it wasn't just one person's fault, but I really miss having someone to talk to and hang out with. I feel really lonely and lost. The friends I did have all moved on with their lives, and I can't blame them. Like I said, I couldn't hang out with them, so it was only natural for us to drift apart. It didn't help that they never reached out, so I felt like I was bothering them every time I managed to work up the courage to text them and ask how where they doing.  I was vocal about my anxiety and told them about the panic attacks and me struggling to talk to them. They were supportive in the moment, but they still never reached out. 

The only thing that's been keeping me occupied is writing a book that's almost done, but I don't have the drive to finish the last draft. I feel like I'm just going through the motions I enjoy writing but I cant work on it.

I dealt with anxiety and panic (in various severe forms from GAD to panic, agoraphobia, health anxiety and more) for 27+ years — and while it took one hell of a journey to finally learn how to properly deal with it, I can now say that it’s not only possible but VERY do-able and, at least in my case, without SSRIs or a laundry list of supplements — nor years of ”therapy” (which completely failed for me). 

I’m considering creating some how-to videos and/or a book or online course of some sort to share what I’ve learned, but first want to validate that this would indeed be the most helpful path for people — versus other options. The learnings & tactics (all mental and arguably within the broader ”CBT” realm as they are all learned techniques) take some time to explain and require really thinking through the resulting learnings, applying and testing and applying again — so feels like a video series might be best for conveying all of this…but would love your thoughts. I’d also love to speak live with a handful of people dealing with anxiety and panic issues (across a range of symptoms) to even better understand how applicable my approach would be to helping the range of anxiety & panic and related issues out there -- so if interested in a call, please chat me and let me know and I’m happy to talk. 

Finally, I have no other motive here than to share what I’ve learned to help people as I’ve been shocked and frustrated at how poor, misguided and over complicated the established anxiety-related treatments and approaches are (particularly from the medical community but also from the incredbily expensive ”therapy” providers which can mislead people into thinking that they require years and years and tens of thousands of dollars of “therapy”). 

Hope to hear from some of you. And for those dealing with anxiety, panic, agoraphobia etc. – there IS hope, you are NOT crazy nor somehow sick, and it’s 100% possible to feel truly normal again even after decades—- and with just your own mind and some learning & application.",1677745384.0

I was expanding my safe zone, going on vacations, eating ice cream in public(I suffer with food anxiety and ibs linked to anxiety) etc. These were all things I could have never imagined myself doing and I was doing these things comfortably. Due to certain circumstances, after the summer ended I was not going out as often. I did not think much of it, and thought that I would be able to pick up where I left of in terms of my anxiety and going out. 5 months passed and I had to go on a short trip for Christmas. I also started anti-anxiety medication (buspirone) in November durning this 5 month hiatus. I thought  “it’s not going to be that hard, I was fine durning the summer”. I was wrong. I had  experienced overwhelming anxiety on Christmas Day and almost did not make it to my family’s house for Christmas.

I've been on 50mg Zoloft (sertraline) for anxiety and TMJ for about 8 weeks now. It seems to be working ok with few side effects, so all in all I'm happy with the treatment. The only side effect that is incredibly annoying is the sexual dysfunction. From day one of taking Zoloft I've found it incredibly difficult to climax, which was already an issue before due to my anxiety. My GP told me that this often gets better as the medication starts working, but so far the medication only seems to have compounded the issue.

I spoke with my GP about this and they suggested switching to Prozac (fluoxetine) instead. I'm a bit skeptical of this as I've generally tolerated Zoloft well and am wary of the uncertainty regarding a new medication and possible withdrawal symptoms from Zoloft. I would much prefer an add-on medication such as Wellbutrin (bupropion), which seems to be recommended for sexual side effects of SSRIs. However, bupropion is more strictly regulated in the UK which is why I believe my GP wanted to try switching medications instead.

I'm not diagnosed but it's apparent that it's GAD based on the symptoms that I've read. I'd say it started in 2021 and slowly became worse overtime. I'm in a constant state of worry and fear as if something bad is going to happen. My brain convinces me that everyone is out to get me in every situation and that the worst possible outcome is going to happen. I also feel like im always being watched/heard. The worrying won't go away unless I have hard proof that theres nothing to be worried about. When people tell me not to worry or try to comfort me in any way, it doesnt work. Trying to comfort every bad thought in my head is exhausting. I've tried going to therapy a few times but i stopped last year when I started feeling better which was a huge mistake. Things became 10x worse and now I go days without sleeping or eating properly. I've completely lost my appetite and I never have a second of peace. The only way to take my mind off it is to spend time with family and friends but when im alone, all of the thoughts resurface and the feeling never changes or lessens. My physical symptoms are: fast heartbeat, fidgeting, looking around the room, lack of attention/focus, fast breathing/ disassociation. It's getting in the way of my life and friends and I dont feel like I was the same person 3 years ago which makes me sad. I feel like I don't trust anyone because of the things I've experienced and I want to be able to trust again. I'm going to start going to therapy and get a diagnosis to understand why this is happening. Does anyone else experience this?

It's been weeks since I last came in, doing all the work at home as my A-levels approach, and I've finally come in. I haven't slept in two days and have only just got in yet I'm shaking, sweating all over, and can't breath in a stupid toilet cubicle like usual. I haven't attended a lesson since Christmas, and while I'm not falling behind in terms of understanding, being able to avoid school in any manner has turned coming in into the worst thing possible.

Sure, I've been diagnosed with anxiety for years, but it just seems to have ramped up so much alongside my depression and lack of motivation, and it's feeling impossible to do my final exams soon. It's not even school work that's causing this!!!

I started fluoxetine about 4 months ago and while I felt great for about a month after it settled, I just feel like I've slowly gotten worse and worse. I don't know what to do - I've chickened out of continuing CBT because of this stupid illness, I have no social life, and I've been taking so much time off work when before money was genuinely the only thing that could push me to keep going and getting on with life.

I don't even know how to explain it to any teachers I might come across today - ""oh yeah sorry I've been plagued with wanting to not be alive at any thought and even being outside my own room is distressing, but like here's a little amigurumi octopus let's hope I don't feel as bad with mocks next week and actually showcase my abilities!""

Coping mechanisms don't exactly help when I've never found anything non-self-destructive or disruptive that works.

I've not been eating well (not new, always happens on these peaks), not been sleeping well, have had no motivation or will to move, my only point of contact outside the family I live with is an online friend from Canada who even then I go long periods without talking to, and I have no desire or will to try and change anything when it all just makes me feel awful and sends me into panic attacks.

Do I ask for an increase in my meds (which yay I just finished my last one yesterday so I have to try and will myself into picking up the next lot)? What the hell am I meant to say to explain myself? I'm just not seeing solutions and I hate it so much.

I'm 22. Never had a childhood or teen years. Wasted a lot of time sleeping or doing nothing due to abuse. I ruined my own life. I feel old even though logically ik I'm not. But I fear in a few years the way I act (tism and ocd make me worried abt stuff) isn't gonna be okay.  Like, social media has led me to believe in the real world (online a LOT too) people see you as old and expired at 25+. I don't wanna be seen as immature and odd for liking clothes, shows, fandoms, cosplay, makeup, etc..that I do in a few years yk :/ I feel like my life is over and I'm afraid.

I feel like my life is over. Idk why. I feel 67. But like a kid, too. It worries me. I'm sick to my stomach every day over feeling like time ran out, or will run out too fast. I'm afraid to even go do stuff because I'm distracted by the fear the whole time. It sent me into a manic depressive episode.

Do you think by the time I'm 30+ people will be more and more accepting of all ages enjoying that stuff? like cute clothing, cosplay, collecting star wars/marvel/DC, or childish stuff...? I don't want to be judged. If this seems dramatic, like I said I have OCD and the tism..keeps me from being able to let shit go or ignore what people think, yk.

People say I'm a kid to older people and still so ''young and free'' but I don't feel like it and know in a short time they won't see me as that young anymore :/ I'm also disabled and can't work/live with family. So I feel like a huge POS daily. 



It's hard. Idk. My mom is 50 and seen as young, and looks it. Has a better fashion sense than me and social life. It's the case more and more..like people staying young longer.. but I fear a lot of people don't see it that way.



Could I please have some reassurance :/

I hate myself alot right now. Like deeply. So please be kind and don't call me stupid or something. I know it's stupid. I just wanted to post here because all of this triggers tf out of my panic and anxiety disorder. So I thought someone might understand. I have been in a severe bipolar depression episode over this for like 3 years now. At one point I didn't even leave the house and slept so much I lost like, 2 of those years to sleeping.. It hurts and I feel stupid bc I keep doing it now. I just can't even enjoy shit bc my ocd brain reminds me that I'll be old one day so what's the point

My first panic attack, like pretty much everyone else's, felt like a heart attack.  Of course even then I knew it wasn't a heart attack and was able to tell right away what it really was but that didn't help it go away any faster.  Weirdly enough drinking Powerade along with the usual breathing exercises helped.  Once I decided that I didn't want to go to college it took off all the pressure and I made it though the rest of high school without incident.

Fast forward 10 years and now my anxiety as back.  This time I'm not entirely sure what is causing it but I have a hunch it's due to my fear of death.  Not death itself but of just ceasing to exist.  whenever I think about it I get anxious and try desperately to push it out of my mind.  A few months ago I had costochondritis.  Which can also mimic the symptoms of a heart attack.  I mostly just had chest pain but no trouble breathing but the pain was more of a tightness in the left breast area so that made me start panicking thinking I was having some kind of heart problem.  Not necessarily a heart attack but something.  The costochondritis healed up in a little over a month and I was able to keep myself distracted enough to keep the anxiety away for a while.  Last weekend my last remaining grandmother passed away and I feel selfish for feeling this way but I felt more scared for myself than sad for her.  I really feel sad for my mom though because I know it hit her really hard.  But that got me thinking about death again and got me spiraling again and brought back the chest pain. 

At first the worries of a heart condition came back into my mind which made me feel worse.  Then I caught on to the fact that it only started feeling worse physically when I started feeling worse mentally.  When I'd calm myself down I felt much better.  Then I made the huge mistake of Googling my symptoms.  DO NOT DO THIS.  That is the worst thing you can do if you have anxiety.  I learned that the hard way.  Almost every result was about heart attacks or other heart conditions.  it wasn't until I narrowed my search to ""anxiety chest pain reddit"" that I found people who had the exact symptoms as me with them going away when they were able to calm themselves down.

This post serves to help anyone who may be having the same or similar problems as me to know they are not alone as well as it is helping me by just getting it out of my own head.  Basically what I was feeling was a tightness in the left side of my chest where I had always assumed the heart was (turns out it's really in the center of your chest) that would sometimes move up closer to my left armpit.  My left arm would even start to feel tingly whenever i'd think about it too much.  kinda like when it falls asleep but not quite to that level.  I have never had shortness of breath though or jaw pain or even a sharp stabbing pain.  just some tightness.  Typing all this out has already helped me feel better and I hope it an help anyone who reads it to feel better as well.",1677714983.0

&#x200B;

Not a care in the world, just jokes and fun and all that's great in life. 

&#x200B;

several days later, I woke up in the middle of the night and ended up in A&E: couldn't breathe, heart palpitations, sweating bullets etc... It was the start of a life altering protracted withdrawal from psychiatric medication (was tapering from an antidepressant back then). At first I thought it was a life threatening illness: physical exams ruled that out, and then I felt reassured, as surely, withdrawal would only last a few months max. A few months later things were worse, so I reinstated the medication, and it didn't work. By that point I had loads of crippling symptoms, including neurological disorders (pain, tinnitus, brain zaps) and autonomic issues (heart palpitations, sleep, digestion all fucked), 

&#x200B;

I was at my worse in May-June 2021, and then it was the windows and waves patterns since then. 

&#x200B;

two years have passed, and overall things have improved drastically since then. most symptoms have gone away, and almost all have improved. But I'm still left with autonomic issues that may be permanent. Tomorrow, it will be my own leaving do, as I now move to another country for work. I was pondering on this and realised that, actually, I just don't want to go. Leaving dos are supposed to be celebrations of a milestone. In my case, I've just had the worse two years of my life, this year isn't going to be good either, and I'm not looking forward to living somewhere new (only going because my company made me). I can't drink and every time I eat at the restaurant, I risk a month of digestive issues after. 

&#x200B;

And then I had the realisation that, actually, the last time I was content was so long ago that the memories almost feel like they were from a different life. I've managed to salvage the career, but outside of that it's mostly gone. Lost 80% of my friends through lack of socialising, don't have any good memories, haven't got with a single girl or gone on a single date, haven't been able to do any sport and just had to watch myself get unfit slowly but surely (exercising was my main hobby). I'm only living for the hope that things will eventually go back to normal, or at least something more appealing. 

&#x200B;

To be honest, I rarely stop to think about it, as my tactic has been to occupy my mind with things I can do and enjoy (hobbies) so that I never have to think about the uncomfortable stuff. But tonight, it felt hard to avoid, like I'm actually forced to confront my own thoughts for the first time in a long, long time, and I'm hating what I'm seeing go through my mind. 

&#x200B;

Well, I tried to remain strong today while taking my kids on an errand. I felt a bit off and almost canceled the appointment, but I pushed thru and got them there. Coming back home, I didn't make it, unfortunately. Ended up having a full-blown panic attack in front of my kids. Had to call 911, and paramedics showed up. They ran a EKG and checked my pulse/blood pressure. Everything checked out fine.

My symptoms started off with just feeling a bit off. That started to trigger some negative thoughts and the feeling of breathlessness. After the appointment on the drive back, I started to feel a tingling sensation down my arms and legs. My vision got a little blurry as well. Faster heart rate and a few palpitations. I immediately pulled over because I didn't want to endanger my children if, by chance, I did pass out or something else. I called 911 and explained my situation, and they arrived pretty quickly. I opted out of not going to the hospital because I have a history of panic attacks, and I've had multiple complete checks up of my heart. It's very frustrating not to know what is causing my panic attacks. I wish it was something that could be detected.

Anyway, I'm currently back at home and still feeling the anxiety, but it's manageable since I'm in a safe place and I can relax a bit. I'm just wish my kids didn't have to see me like that. I feel like I need to be strong for my kids, but today I was weak.",1677712486.0

I’ve tried everything, fucking everything to help this and nothing will help my anxiety other than clonazepam, but that doesn’t help me sleep. Just makes the anxiety bearable. 
I’ve tried antidepressants (Prozac, Zoloft, lexapro, Wellbutrin, amitriptyline, Nortriptyline) 
Half destroyed my sex drive and the other half almost did. None of them really helped anything, though. 
I’ve tried antipsychotics/mood stabilisers 
(Seroquel, Lurasidone)
Seroquel made me into a zombie and Lurasidone had me take off all my clothes and hover over the toilet bowl for a great deal of time. Worst nausea I’ve ever had.
And I’ve tried a few other ones… 
Temazepam worked, but I got taken off it when I went on clonazepam. 
Promethazine makes me so drowsy the next day and just doesn’t really work.
So what now? 
I’m currently taking vyvanse 50mg daily for my adhd (happy with that, I’ve been on it for about 2yrs) and clonazepam which I take as needed for my anxiety. It works great but for bad nights, it’s just not enough and doesn’t help me sleep. 

I’ve been prescribed Abilify (10mg) and I’m honestly terrified to take it because of what I’ve read about it. I just don’t know what to do anymore.

All week I’ve been worrying about it and I get really nauseous when I think about going, and I’m starting tomorrow so it’s freaking me out worse now.

I have really bad social anxiety and I have difficulties making friends and talking to people. People always say I come off as rude because I can’t maintain eye contact because it makes me violently uncomfortable, and my voice always sounds monotone so I always sound fucking angry. 

I don’t know how to change that, I’ve always been that way and I tried forcing myself to maintain eye contact today with my counselor while making my schedule and I almost started crying because I got so nervous.

I really don’t want to make the wrong first impression because you can’t redo a first impression and I don’t want to come off wrong but I can’t help being this way. 

I got a tour around the school by this girl and she kept making fun of me when I would get nervous. 

I have a tendency to grab onto my jacket sleeves or hide my face when I get nervous and every time I did it she would say “why do you keep doing that” and when I would say sorry she would sound offended. It was embarrassing and I sped through that tour and fast as possible because I was so embarrassed.

Also another thing that I’m honestly embarrassed to talk about, but is the main thing I’m stressing about. I’m trans and I’ve been out for around 4-5 years, all the schools I’ve been to I’ve had tel my teachers my name because I don’t have it legally changed.

It’s one of the most stressful parts of going to a new school for me, because a lot of teachers literally don’t care and will misgender me or deadname me anyways. I’m scared this will happen this year, especially because I don’t like people knowing this about me.

On my tour of the school the girl who have it to me immediately turned to me and said “Do you got strictly by he/him?” My heart dropped because who says that to someone who passes as cis? I might be overthinking it but it made me feel really anxious and I’ve been thinking about it all day since.

I’ve been trying to calm down and reassure myself it will be fine but it’s really difficult.",1677723123.0

I went to two school therapists for months on end during college and was always curious about getting a diagnosis. I finally got around to asking my second therapist at the time how the process would go and she said that they try to steer away from giving diagnoses and recommended some places I could go to. At the time, my insurance was kinda shitty and I was really confused on how to go about the process so I never looked into it. Fast forward to after college, I finally got better insurance and decided to reach out to a psychotherapist first to try to actually improve my mental health. She stated early on that she might have an idea into the diagnosis but she usually tries to not give one until necessary. She noted that if I were to need one she'd let me know if it got to that point so I paused on finding a psychiatrist. I told her all my symptioms early on and continued to seek therapy. Early on, I didn't feel like we clicked but I gave it a couple months and still felt kinda stagnant. For most sessions, I would talk for a large portion (I'm bad at telling short, concise stories) and she would give minimal commentary here and there but it didn't feel like I was going anywhere in each session. I told her about how I felt multiple times and she said we'd try different directions but I'm not sure much changed session to session. At one point months in, she mentioned that she thinks I don't need to see a psychiatrist yet which was coincidentally around the time I stopped waiting for her to recommend one and just go to one. The most she's mentioned was when I said that i hear all these life changing ""remedies"" or ""hacks"" about how to be more optimistic/active/less anxious over the internet but they feel almost impossible for me to actually implement since its hard for me to actually CHANGE or even stick to habits, and she noted that of course its not as simple since I have anxiety or I'm anxious (honestly can't remember which one). I only went to one psychiatrist session and they stated it could be anxiety or adhd but needed more information and medical records. I felt discouraged a bit though that I went without discussing with my psychotherapist. I've just been feeling like if I actually had something then she would've mentioned by now to get diagnosed and sometimes I'm not sure if I'm just trying to give myself an excuse/reason as to why I am the way I am. I've just been feeling stuck in progressing in my mental health even when I know all the things I'm ""supposed"" to be doing to be better.",1677721542.0
610,"Thinking of giving up on my therapist and psychiatrist due to lack of results, bad medication side effects, and terrible office staff. Not sure where to go from here, is there any hope?",2,11fp4hb,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11fp4hb/thinking_of_giving_up_on_my_therapist_and/,0,"31F diagnosed with OCD and PTSD by my therapist, diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder by my psychiatrist and the local hospital (although I consider those to be an outgrowth of the PTSD). I have a lot of symptoms including severe concentration and motivation issues, self-esteem issues, pretty bad intrusive thoughts, health anxiety, panic attacks, DP/DR, sleep problems, etc. I have been seeing my therapist for about a year and a half and I really like her, we get along well, she understands and accepts me. We do a combination of talk therapy, trauma therapy, and CBT. I've only been seeing my psychiatrist for a few weeks, before I had a different psychiatrist but I had to stop seeing him when I changed insurance (plus he was chronically overbooked so I could only see him for 15 minutes once every 2-3 months and he would be trying to get me out the door in under 5 minutes every time).

So the first problem is that the treatment is not working. I like my therapist and I feel like I have more insight into where my various symptoms come from, but there hasn't been any improvement in my productivity, confidence, intrusive thoughts, etc. My anxiety actually got way worse last summer to the point I was hospitalized for panic attacks and DP/DR, and I think therapy partially contributed to that (there were other factors like sleep deprivation) but now I've gone back to roughly the level I was at before I started therapy, so there's been no net improvement. She tells me to be patient and that it takes time to recover from severe PTSD, but how long is it going to take?

As for my psychiatrist(s), most of the medication I've tried has not worked out. I started Lexapro 5mg in the hospital last summer and, while it helped my DP/DR at first, it stopped working after a few weeks and now I'm tapering off it and there's no difference. My psychiatrist increased it to 10mg briefly and that made me extremely depressed and irritable almost immediately and I had to go back down to 5mg. Then she added buspirone 5mg and that made me projectile vomit everything I ate and feel nauseous for a week after I stopped taking it, which apparently is not even a symptom that anyone else has when they take it, because I can't find any other accounts of that happening. She said she didn't even know why that happened.

Now she wants me to get off Lexapro and try Cymbalta instead but I'm scared to try anything new after these bad side effects. She also mentioned Seroquel which really concerned me because I told her the first time I saw her that I don't want to take antipsychotics due to the side effects (I have PCOS and type 2 diabetes runs in my family, even non-overweight members of my family have gotten it). The one thing she gave me that did work properly was hydroxyzine which has helped with my sleep and also seems to help with panic attacks, so I guess that's a plus. I also have Ativan which I take rarely if I get a really bad panic attack but she wants me to get off that entirely for some reason.

When I first started seeing my psychiatrist she seemed very optimistic and said that she thought I would recover from my anxiety disorder and be able to get off all medications within a year. But, as every medication has not worked out, she seems to be getting more and more frustrated.

Both my therapist and psychiatrist are part of the same office. This is where the second problem comes in: even though both of them are great, the office staff is absolutely terrible. Since I started going to this office the office staff have: made me travel an hour round trip to drop off paperwork because the entire email for the whole office wasn't working for several days, cancelled my regular weekly appointment without telling me because they got me confused with another patient, told me the wrong appointment time, told me that they had no insurance information on file for me which caused me to have a panic attack which also turned out to be a message intended for another patient, and yesterday booked an appointment with my psychiatrist during a time when she wasn't even in the office so I showed up to the appointment and she wasn't there, and I had to call every extension in the office for 20 minutes straight to get an actual person on the phone to find out what happened. This isn't the first time I've had problems with offices for mental health. Other offices for other providers I've gone to have: chronically not answered the phone or returned messages, made me get an appointment every week by responding to a text message whenever an appointment was available but if you didn't respond immediately someone else would take the appointment so basically they expected you to sit by the phone at all times I guess, charged me $70 for an appointment I cancelled but they just never bothered to cancel it, then when I told them I didn't want to go to that provider anymore and to cancel all upcoming appointments, charged me $70 again for the same reason. I don't know why mental health provider's offices have these issues, because no other doctor's offices I've been to have had issues anywhere near this bad. I guess they think because we're mental patients they can treat us like garbage or something. But I also don't know how I can get treatment under these circumstances when I don't even know if the appointment I booked is going to happen or not.

If it wasn't for the office staff I would stick it out, but every time they treat me like garbage it makes me feel extremely upset and like I don't deserve to get better. I cried for hours after the appointment issue yesterday because it made me feel hopeless about ever finding successful treatment. My therapist has said she thinks the office staff are extremely unprofessional and a lot of her patients have had issues with them. But it doesn't seem the providers have much authority to do anything about the office staff situation.

Anyway, my question is where do I go from here? Is there any hope for successful treatment, or should I just accept that I'm never going to be able to have a normal happy life? Also, what is the deal with the office staff? Is this a common problem, do you guys have similar problems with your office staff, why do they get away with treating patients this way? What next steps would you recommend?",1677721463.0

Second was the worst and scariest thing I've ever experienced. Just hell, extreme terror and panic. I thought I was going to die and since then I haven't really been the same.

I feel as though I'm very different from everyone else and nobody else has this problem so I'm not sure if anyone would know how to help which scares me quite a bit. Even praying has been associated with this fear. It's slight but affects me in a bizarre and scary way. Some of the fear arises from just feeling hopeless. Scared that praying won't work, hot tea, sweet aromas. I fear nothing will help or calm me down so my brain gets really scared and associates fear with these things.

I KNOW I AM THO. I have so many passions and interests to share with people… but I just feel awkward now. Conversation doesn’t flow like it used to. For the first time in my life I’m incredibly anxious meeting people or talking on the phone because I know I’ll get the question “so what do you do?” or “tell me about yourself” and being honest about my situation (and lack of trajectory) makes me feel like a lump of shit. And talking about cool stuff I’ve done or trying to gas myself up makes me feel like I’m lying to them and like they can see right through me. 

I know other people are in the same situation, but unfortunately knowing that doesn’t make me feel better, it makes me like I’m just part of an even bigger group of losers. (I know we’re not and it’s just negative self talk, but I can’t help the feeling.)

I do have spinal issues and had a fusion of three vertebrae in my neck 10 years ago and the numbness has been present since before the surgery.  

I had a drs appointment yesterday and asked for a head/neck mri to rule out neurological issues.  She was quite reluctant to do this and basically suggested that my anxiety was making me a hypochondriac.  I agreed that this was a possibility but I told her that an MRI would be reassuring for me (assuming it’s clear).  She reluctantly agreed to order it but really made me feel like I was crazy.

anyway I was put on Zoloft straight away 50-70-100mg which destroyed my libido and made me feel numb I was then switched to effexor 75-112.5-150mg for the last six years till I couldn’t tolerate the side effects anymore (weight gain, loss of libido, sweats etc) I was then put on brintellix 10mg in august this year ended up in a&e because I tried to do something stupid and I was put back on Zoloft only this time it’s not working at all.

I just can’t beat this I’m tired and I just want to give up but I have a daughter and need to wait, I’ve spoke to therapists psychologists etc and told them my plans that when my daughter turns 18 I’ll have a talk with her and let her know that I feel this world isn’t for me and hopefully she understands.

Like you're living a lie, in denial about the monster you were and still are. Just running from the inevitable. This is how I feel on a near constant basis, its to the point I can barley be alone with out downward spiraling. Used to, Id cope with these deep seeded fears with drugs, parties, that sort of thing. But now I'm on probation, and having to relive through it all again. Its agonizing sometimes, the voices I hear tell me some of the most awful things about myself. I know it isnt right to believe them, they're hallucinations afterall, but they just know exactly what to say to hurt me. I used to be very.. messed up, had a bit of a rough childhood. As a kid I took it out on others, did some very cruel things. As I grew, I really tried to mature, tried to be better, more empathetic. But empathy never really came easy to me if im being honest. 

Its really all the research I did into psychology that even helped me learn how to be cognitively empathetic. But it all feels like a ruse. It feels like no matter how many people I help, how many friends I save, I'm still that same kid. That this persona I've built is nothing but I lie I constructed to feel like a good person. That deep down, Im one of the worst. I know I have the ability to be. Manipulation has always come easy to me, I only try to use it on toxic people or other manipulators to teach them to respect people. But at the same time, I cant help but feel like I'm subtlety manipulating everyone around me, without even wanting to or trying. I've been stuck in this identity crisis for a while, the very duality of my thought process drives me up the walls and I toss and turn at night thinking about what I might do if someday I just snap and go back to how I once was.

Being psychotic even makes this fear worse since I can't even imagine the way I'd act after. All I want to be is a good person. But it seems I can't get away from my past, and the impact it had on me. I'm too scared to be honest with anyone ik about this fear since I feel like if I'm not exactly how people want me to be, they won't accept me. But my ego just digs and digs in the back of my brain.


I guess the TL:DR is just, Im only really good at being bad. But I dont want to be bad, but I feel like I'll never change and that toxic part will always be apart of me. I just wish I could be more normal. I live in fear of hurting the ones I care about, because I guess I've always felt like a monster hiding in plain sight.

Multiple illnesses.  

It might help to read the following while picturing a person standing at the bottom of a pit asking, “Excuse me, is anyone up there?  I’m kind of stuck here.”

I am in the middle of a bad reaction to Lamictal. I broke down and decided to try it again after talking with my Med Psych., Monday night. I took just 25 mg. Tuesday, yesterday, was absolute hell and I am only feeling marginally better now, Wednesday morning.

This happened to me a couple months ago, after having taken 12.5 mg of Topamax, another drug I’d done well with in the past.

I don't know how to explain the bad reactions I have to medications other than it feels much like anxiety attacks in that I feel like I'm being low level electrocuted, system wide. There are other symptoms, but that is the main and most constant.

I've taken Lamictal twice before over the last five years. Both times it worked well for me ( until it died out, as they do.). This time I had an immediate and very bad reaction like with the Topamax; before that varying bad reactions to: Prednisone, Buspirone, Clonidine, Diazepam, Lyrica, Haldol, Lithium, (though that one took longer), and myriad others.

Some of these drugs I’ve been on successfully before and others don’t work on the first try.  The point is that I can’t seem to take anything, even OTC meds, at this point, e.g. PPI’s, H2Blockers, Lipid Inhibitors, etc.

This is happening even with Klonopin, which I currently take 1 mg of every night, but if I try to take any more than that I will have a bad reaction the same as above. I think I am reacting badly to that as well and only skating-by because I take it before bed.  But I do really feel I need to get off the last mg of Klonopin as it’s doing me no good at this point.

Sometimes, my initial reaction is so bad, I mean I'm feeling so bad that I become extremely agitated and reality gets a little fuzzy such that in some cases I end up screaming and/or banging my head against the wall on the first day. Then it's just miserable for a couple of days after that. That doesn't happen with every drug I try, sometimes it's just a very bad reaction that I manage, but it (the screaming in agony thing) has happened enough, with the Topamax, with the Lamictal, with coming down on Klonopin, etc.

This seems to be getting worse as time goes by and the problem is no one, not my medical psychiatric practitioner, my general practitioner, rheumatologist, neurologist, endocrinologist, etc, knows why this is happening to me.

I'm going to see an allergist in the first week of March but I'm not holding out much hope. I'm going to a different rheumatologist soon, I haven't made the appointment yet, but I'm not holding out a lot of hope for that either.

No one knows. The most solid advice I've been given recently is when the endocrinologist told me to stop trying new medications as I'm obviously having some kind of problem, which, I know, duh, but when you are suffering it's difficult not to try things in desperation.

The problem is I have illnesses for which I need help and for which I cannot be medicated.

I can't be the only person in the world this is happening to. Am I?

I've debated posting this (I'm a lurker and don't really post) but I have tried searching here and on google for this and even though I've found similar posts, I feel like my situation is slightly different. It's at the point where I don't know what to do (I plan on bringing it up in therapy) but I just feel the situation behind the fear is so embarrassing. Showers used to be my happy place and now I am just terrified at times most likely because of a few situations during the last few years: 

* Panic attacks in the shower. The first one happened when I was caring for my aunt who was undergoing breast cancer treatment. It happened the day she had her surgery and even though everything went well, I panicked so much I had to run out of he shower still all soapy. Since then I've had a few other panic attacks in the shower for really no reason. 
* This is where it gets... embarrassing, and why I am having a hard time bringing it up in therapy. Two years ago I had a situation where I vomited in the shower; I don't even know how it happened but the feeling came out of nowhere and it just happened. 
* A few months ago I had an... accident in the shower (I am going to the doctor in a few weeks to discuss IBS/bowel issues). It hasn't happened since, but I've had a few close calls and again would have to hop out of the shower, go to the bathroom, then go back in. I don't know if it is something with the water or movement? 

I just don't know what to do and how to help it. Lately it's just becoming harder and harder to shower, and I HATE being unclean. I have klonopin for panic attacks but if I shower at night, I can't take it because I also take Zyprexa for bipolar disorder and since they're both sedatives, they cannot be taken together.

I’m (30M) looking to settle down and start a family with someone. My only issue is that I severely struggle with anxiety, and more specifically, a massive fear of flying which I developed years ago. 

It’s something that’s caused me a great deal of depression in the past, and was essentially a big part in my previous long term relationship ending. I was unable to work through the fear and this was not compatible with the person I was with. 

I have tried working through this and have managed to do really short flights recently and seeking psychologist help, however I’m unsure if I can manage to keep going as my stress levels go through the roof for each flight and before/after also.

My question is - how should I approach dating? I have been using dating apps and it seems like everyone and their mother likes to travel these days. The one somewhat mitigating factor I have is that I work 100% remotely and can essentially work anywhere, even if it takes me longer to travel to the destination itself via train/car/bus/ferry etc. 

I have been bringing up this topic very early with people I have recently dated so as to not waste their time, however unfortunately it is a dealbreaker a lot of the time.

She informs me that I have been approved on Tuesday. I call today to ask a question about the next step to move in and when can I expect to receive paperwork. 

She gets a bit defensive and I apologize if I came off rude. I merely asked because I knew I had to also get my cats vaccinations before I moved in and wanted to plan accordingly. 

She gives me a bunch of numbers regarding the move in fees and the process with a hint of irritation. I feel my face warm up from embarrassment and I am having a hard time concentrating. I try to write the math and I know I am visual so all of this is just going over my head. I ask for clarification, she sounds more annoyed. 

She tells me that the security deposit is first months rent. I say of course and then ask ""Why am I giving you a check without seeing the lease first."" She kinda snaps at me and states that if she sent the lease today I would be required to bring in the check on Friday. I work about 35 minutes away and the office would be closed by the time I got there. So I asked to bring it Saturday. 

We get off the phone and my face is red and I am shaking from the embarrassment. The problem is I don't remember who to write the check to. I get worked up and can't remember right in moments like those.

Literally a small inconvenience like my ceiling fan is broken or I lost a shoe in a river. A Facebook friend commented ""then just... Open your window?"" Like belittling me or letting me know to stop complaining it's not that serious. 

Another time I was expressing concern at work and a co worker came at me to stop complaining if I don't do anything about it besides complain. 

So I eventually stopped complaining and kept it to myself, but then I decided to be helpful and speak for a group that I didn't lead, I was just a member and I was told that it's not my place and to keep quiet unless I'm leading. So I can't be helpful either. 

I don't know how to talk anymore, I don't know how to express concern or be helpful anymore. I'm too afraid someone will tell me to shut up or tell me it's not important so be quiet.

I'm having all of the symptoms, even lumps in the neck. It's been causing alot of cardiac symptoms like tachycardia episodes and it's triggering my anxiety badly which then worsens it. Since all of this, my anxiety is at an all time high. I would label it severe.

I know that I desperately need medical attention. I've already canceled 2 appointments. I'm absolutely mortified to go, but I'm aware I really need to and my fear is holding me back. 

The best way I can try to describe it - I don't like the thought of bringing attention to it. Kind of like ... well it's not real if no one pays attention to it. I'm scared of losing control. When I'm in my comfortable home I can calm myself down eventually. Out in public I'm scared of not being able to. I also have general anxiety surrounding medical attention - white coat syndrome if you will. I know anxiety causes you to think irrationally. 

I've tried to approach it several different ways like casual, aggressive, non chalant, etc. And since I can't drive, I've asked my closest most trusted friends to take me which hasn't been successful but I still don't feel like I can go anyway.

One night I couldn’t sleep and I started watching videos of Harry Styles and One Direction. I was a 1D fan back in the days although I never got to see them in a concert (unfortunately). 

My obsession started. I have been obsessed with celebrities before in my teenage years but it didn’t last long or eventually faded as I grew up. This time with Harry is different and really worries me. 

I cannot stop thinking about him. I watch videos and follow updates about him all day. He is perfect in every way to me and I love everything about him. Obviously he is beyond handsome, I love his voice, his charisma, kindness and confidence but love that he is so humble at the same time.

I know that I don’t know him personally and that what we see is different from who he is as a person but at the same time my brain feels like I know him. He feels accessible even though I know he is not. I also live not that far from him and it makes me feel like meeting him is very possible, and it is. I know where he goes to the gym for exemple. I don’t want to be a stalker, it is unlike me, but my obsession has made me consider it. Again, it’s so close to where I live and so tempting. It’s just not who I want to be. 

The main issue and what is making me suffer the most is that my obsession is making me question my feelings for my husband and my whole relationship (and my life). I have never doubted my husband before. My husband really is a great man, very loving and supportive (I have anxiety and depression) and although we have minor issues like every relationship has, it is nothing that has made me question my love for him and whether or not we should be together: I know how lucky I am to have him. He loves me very much. 

I find myself comparing my husband to Harry. I feel weird and unnatural being in his arms and saying “I love you” back, and there’s no words to express the shame and guilt I feel. I am questioning my values, if I was actually made for marriage and if I settled too quick. I feel like the spark of our relationship is gone. I know love is a choice but I can’t imagine not feeling “in love” with my husband and being happy. I did not feel like that before my obsession started. 

I can’t see myself ending my marriage because I am obsessed with a celebrity. I just don’t want to feel that way anymore. But I’m also not sure I can just stop watching content about HS. 

I feel extremely anxious and depressed, ashamed and lost. I cannot function or do anything. I did not expect to go through that. But I cannot control how I feel and cannot get Harry Styles out of my head. 

I know a lot of women (and probably men) are also obsessed with him so I know I’m not alone. If you’re also in a relationship, married or not, and are going through the same thing, I’d love to talk with you. I am doing therapy but I feel like I need to talk about this with people who are going through the same thing. It is not an easy thing to talk about and I’m sure it’s very easy to judge me. I judge myself. 

So I am please asking that you do not judge me or lecture me, this is the last thing I need. I am not a bad person, I’m just going through something that seems ridiculous but that is actually really hard and painful and I need help.

I didn’t think too much about it and thought I probably pulled a muscle at the gym. The pain got worse and worse overtime and started interfering with sleep. I was getting 3 hours of sleep due to the excruciating pain. So decided to go to the doctor.

He ordered several bloods tests and the results shook him and me. He told me he suspects blood cancer. That news put me in severe depression. As a 24 year old, I lost all the motivation I had for my dreams and aspirations overnight. was all alone during lockdown and decided not to give the news to my family just to avoid them from worrying about it. I thought let me first confirm if the diagnosis is accurate.

Over 4 months, the results came back normal and the possibility of blood cancer was dismissed. However by now, I developed chronic sleep problems. I could never sleep for longer than 3 hours. I spent my day with extreme headache, foggy brain and occasional fever. My cognitive levels went down to that of a 5 year old and my work at grad school was getting compromised. 

I decided to extend my graduation since I couldn’t handle it anymore. For the next 2 years, I tried several antidepressants, gabapentin, Hydroxyzine and nothing worked. By this time, my memory was nothing but mush, my motivation had died, and I could see all my friends getting jobs, getting married and having children. At the same time, I have lost my own self respect because I lost my scholarship and am once again dependent on my dad financially at 26. 

Even though he has never stopped supporting me, I can sense the worry he has for me. I hate making him feel this way. Deep down I know it’s really bothering him and given that he already has hypertension I really want to take the load away from him. I’m so glad my mother is there to take care of him. 

Anyway, I was finally prescribed clonazepam yesterday. I took 1 mg and oh god what can I say. I feel like a baby again. No more headaches or anxiety. My brain fog is still there but hopefully the exercises and meditation will solve that completely.

I am aware of all the risks benzos possess. However, I only wish some doctors weren’t this strict about it for the fear of destroying a person’s life. Well guess what, not prescribing sooner destroyed 3 years of my life. I hope more people understand the benefits of benzos and not suspect every patient to be someone who’s only  seeking drugs to abuse them.

Anyway, I only hope the worst is behind me and I can now focus on making up for my lost time.

I have dealt with bad anxiety since I was a pre-teen. I’ve noticed I tend to go through periods of intense anxiety and depression, followed by periods of feeling just fine. 

I don’t handle stress or change well, and I think it’s what often triggers it. But it’s worse than ever now. I recently made a career change, leaving the family restaurant I have been managing and got a job in radio ad sales. I thought it’s what I wanted, but the panic attacks are so bad in the mornings I get physically sick. I wake up shaking and hyperventilating and sometimes I have to vomit. 

I feel as if I have no direction in life. I have a hard time setting goals for myself, making decisions and planning for the future. I’m getting married in April and I fear if I get worse in the future, it will drive her away. 

I’m trying therapy for the first time in several years in an attempt to improve myself, I can’t tell if it’s helping yet. My therapist seems to think I have ADHD, but I’m not so sure. I’ve had suicidal tendencies in the past. Im not quite there yet, but I always worry about getting back to that point some day.

I keep telling myself if I chill myself out for long enough to make myself some new friends I wouldn’t be anxious anymore but I just can’t bring myself to that point. W33d’s always an option but I’m not gonna get high before school everyday at a reach that it’ll maybe make me confident.

The hypochondria can completely dominate my life at times and take away all joy from good moments. I have been able to manage it with myself lately with a combination of sertraline and an acceptance that I myself am doomed to die soon. My wife and I got pregnant this year and around the 3rd trimester I started to feel worries about the fetus creep up. Ever scan, check, heart beat, led me to jump to conclusions that our baby was going to be sick or disabled.

We just welcomed our baby boy into the world last week. So far he is healthy. I can barely even write that sentence without fear of jinxing it. I am once again fully convinced that every bump, weird sound, test that they run will confirm my deep down feeling that there is something wrong with him. It is sucking the joy out of this incredible time in my life. I just can never accept that me, my wife, and my baby are healthy. It feels wrong.

Of course my family has told me things like ""how does worrying help?"" ""Try to enjoy each moment one at a time."" And that being a parent there will always be another worry. 

I understand how selfish it is to be obsessively worried, I am a worse husband and father and it is not fair to my family.

Im 25M and my relationship with anxiety began around age 17-18, first it was a stage fright and then sexual performance anxiety.

It screwed me up in dates, job interviews and basically every place I felt like being judged.

Lately it got much worse, it all began when family relatives I didn't saw long time came to visit us amd I was in my room, I heard them on the living room and was about to tell them hello when suddenly I felt my anxiety creep again and I didn't thought a lot about it and went out and the second I saw them I got sort of panic attack out of the blue and quickly went away so they will not see me all shivering and shacking with racing heart and dry mouth when I barely could speak.


A few days went by and I thought about it a lot and today I got back to college and it happened again !
I have friends group and the moment I saw them I got another panic attack and then quickly went away, later that day I was just with 2 friends I'm more connect with and was able to act normally but from the inside I was about to explode from the stress and the anxiety I've felt.


It never ever happened to me in this kind of situations and I'm terrified it will keep happen because if it will, it will ruin my social life.

The thing that frustrating me the most is that I do have high self esteem and I do very social person of you put the anxiety away, but I feel like the anxiety it's like a physical disease - think about a talented football player that lost his legs - he has the ability but can't perform properly.

Anyway, I do tried all along the years to really beat my anxiety and failed again and again, I do tried to read in front of an audience or go to job interviews, but it all resulted in me getting panic attack and just make me more afraid to do it next time.

I took propranolol a while ago and it felt AMAZING, I was able to speak in front of people and just saying whatever I want with no problem and I've felt super confident. At first I was a bit nervous and prepared for the upcoming panic attack, but when I realized I'm just nervous but nothing happens, oh wow it was the best feeling in the world, I've felt like myself in situations I didn't felt like myself in years.

Anyway, I thought on doing some CBT program with exposure therapy, but while taking propranolol and slowly I will be able to wean off until I will feel comfortable in those situations with no drugs, how does it sounds ? Do you think it possible ?",1677707800.0

I just struggle a lot with accepting the fact that I want to go. I keep thinking something bad is going to happen either before going or when I have left. I haven’t slept well this past month especially because of this. My mom has always said that she wants me to do whatever I want, but every time I bring up me leaving she just “acts” sad and the conversation doesn’t last long. It’s really bothering me. 

I don’t know. I just can’t stop thinking about it. She also said that my grandma told her she’s going to lose me when I move, but it’s not like I won’t need her anymore?

My heart is beating out of my chest. On the way home from lunch today I was trying to pull into my neighborhood. This car who was already at my neighborhood entrance was sitting there waiting to get out. The road to get into my neighborhood isn't very wide so there's only 2 lanes to get in and out. My neighborhood consists of one road basically and only has about 15 houses on the road. 
I was trying to go into the street to get into my neighborhood and the car waiting to get out was on the wrong side of the road. It was on the side I needed to get on to enter the neighborhood. I had my blinker on and was gonna wait for the person who was on the wrong side of the road to pull out but cars started coming in behind me so I freaked out and just turned into my neighborhood. Went around the car that was waiting to get out and proceeded to go home. Parked my car, inspected my car.. no damage at all. Then went inside. 30 min to an hour later,  BOOM my anxiety hit and I worried if I had side swiped or hit that car earlier so I got back into my car and went back up the street to the entrance. There weren't any debris or Cops up there when I went back to the entrance. But the car that I went around to get into my neighborhood was parked at a business near by, atleast it looked like the car atleast. There's a business about half a mile down the street from the entrance to my neighborhood. It looked similar to the car I went around. But I'm not sure. 
But my anxiety is killing me and causing me to panic. I dont want to be charged with a hit and run. I domt want to go to jail. I didn't hear or feel anything when I went around that car at all. And there's no damage to my car at all. I've checked twice. 
Would I have felt or heard it if I hit that car or hit anything while going around the car to get into my neighborhood ? Am I gonna go to jail for a hit and run if I did hit anything or that car. I have insurance and have no reason to do a hit and run and I never would. If I knew I hit something I would've stopped immediately. Help.? I'm panicking",1677699487.0

I have scheduled an appointment with my GP to see if I can get referred to a psychiatrist. I had my first panic attack about four months ago and I completely changed. I was never an anxious person or ever even had a full-blown panic attack without a reason before this happened. Well, after my first experience, I have gone to the ER three times due to panic attacks & not being able to bring my heart rate down. I couldn't even exercise. I have improved since then. I am still trying to add more intensity to my work outs as I still get anxious. It's pretty much my heart rate that messes me up. The thing is, I could go outside my house and run my errands, go out and eat with friends. This only works if I am driving though. I am still working on trying to walk around my block which is a problem for now. The issue is the distance. Every time, I imagine myself going to the airport, flying or driving for a long distance, I get anxious. Like I would get a panic attack. My panic attacks last a very long time. I'm talking about hours and hours with a heart rate of 130-150BPM. There are a couple of triggers to my anxiety, and I am usually able to calm myself down.

Personally idk how people do it working especially in an office when your going through personal issues. like I have to pretend to be happy and honestly deep down I am not. And everyone is so fake sometimes I just hate this world.

Somehow my anxiety then broadened into abit of social anxiety, driving anxiety and then panic attacks. 

I felt like I’d never return back to my “normal” self. 

My doctors recommended anxiety medication about 4 years ago but I was always to anxious to start. 

Before Christmas my anxiety was so bad I would have a panic attack everywhere- I couldn’t drive , I couldn’t order food , I couldn’t go to the supermarket. 

I started Zoloft and after a week I felt defeated because I wasn’t “cured” 

I came on reddit which seems to be full of comments about people at their peak of anxiety and not coping - but not many comments to give you hope. 

After 2 weeks I felt an improvement and now after 3 months I’d say I’m better than ever. 

I’m on 50mg of sertraline/Zoloft currently and it definitely wasn’t an overnight result but if anyone is hesitant they should give it a go because I know feel stupid that I waited so long to get the relief I needed.",1677668424.0

I explained how I used delta 8 in the past and it would bring a calm to me like I've never had. She agrees it's not the high that does it it's just because it's naturally calming. Had I have not mentioned it should would have wrote it off as normal anxiety however seeing as I only had about 4 panic attacks for noticable reasons before hand its not a severe case of anxiety as it seems. It's more of a manic depression than became more unstable after exposer to the delta 8. I failed to mention that the compound I used when i suffered a massive panic attack was delta 8,10 and THC-O which was formulated for hyper focus to which it made me hyper focus on my panic attack.

(Read the post below),0,11f3n9t,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11f3n9t/do_you_guys_ever_experience_this_with_your/,0,"So basically I guess I have always been suffering from some sort of anxiety disorder for different kinds of stuff (health, school life, being in public etc.) and actually therapy worked very well for it. At some points in my life I had anxiety attacks lasting for weeks which put me in a pretty crippling position. 

At really rare instances what I feared the most (what gave me anxiety) happened and I got really sad afterwards. 

Currently, I am suffering from  severe health anxiety attack which has been affecting my daily life in the worst way possible  (to see what it is, you can go one or two posts back in my profile and have an idea of it). And what I basically do is comparing my current anxiety attacks with the previous ones so that I can anticipate whether the concern causing me anxiety will occur or not. 

For instance, back in 2016, I thought I had brain tumour and became depressive af for more than 2 weeks until I got the results learning that I actually did not have it. So for me this is an anxiety that didn't turn out to be true and I compare my current anxiety with this situation to have an idea of if my concerns are gonna come through.

It was really hard trying to put these thoughts in the word but I hope some people can get me and help me out with that. Suffering from anxiety attacks is bad enough and these comparisons doesn't help me at all. If I can't find enough similarities with two stories I just start to think that my concern will turn out to be true no matter what are the odds are.",1677676918.0

I got Co2 detectors for my rooms, and make sure they are working every night. I check my blood oxygen levels often to make sure they’re normal and always ask my partner if they feel okay too, no headaches or sick feelings.

I started a new job last year and the work culture has been rather harsh.

I dread going to work every morning. My team throws each other under the bus in an attempt to escape being reprimanded. Team members rarely help one another or provide any proper guidance to new recruits.

my supervisor accuses me in front of clients and stakeholders when i am holding a meeting with them for a solution. I am treated with little respect and asked to write emails word for word as my supervisor dictates. If i question a sentence she gets angry. There is often a lot of angry words directed at me if i ask for clarification or any alterations. My supervisor often asks me to give up my work or return my tasks if i can't do them like she says. If i ask her to do anything on my behest she threatens to  eliminate me from the team.

I graduated with my master's degree last year and joined this company. The job market wasn't too good and it was a reputed company so I joined.

I tried to talk to my boss about the harsh criticism and they said this is the corporate culture and i need to adapt. 

I have been questioning my self worth. What if it's the same in all companies.
Is it me? Am I too sensitive? The others in my team don't seem as bothered as me, though they agree the environment is harsh.

I can't quit as the economy is bad here and I have loans to pay. But I am so scared. Is it me who is the problem?

I keep breaking down in tears and there doesn't seem to be an end in sight. I don't have a support system beyond my parents who are retired and have limited savings. They give me hugs and say honey please quit if it hurts but I can't with all these bills to pay.",1677661378.0

Fast forward to now, in my late 20’s and I still struggle. When I ask people to take pictures of me 99.9% of the time it’s to see if I look fat in the photo. I feel anxious when I don’t workout and I have never worked out to only feel good. It’s mostly about keeping my body a certain way. I also count my calories everyday. I don’t even plug them in an app, I just know what every food I eat amounts to. I get mad if I’m over 2000 Cals.
However, if you met me, you wouldn’t know I struggle. I am more on the thinner side but definitely average. So it’s a very confusing issue. Always wanting to lose weight and never fully accepting how you are. How do I start recovering from this anxiety?",1677668084.0

For 2 years I've been having a burning, red and swollen foot and my doctors couldn't figure out what it was. In January I had an appointment for a different issue and the doctor looked at my foot and told me I had athlete's foot, because I had flaky, scaly stuff on my toes. I started using antifungal for about 4 weeks and while the flakes went away my foot was turning a darker shade of red. I came to Reddit to ask if what I was experiencing was athlete's foot and posted pictures. I was prompted to go to urgent care because people were concerned that something more serious was happening. The doctor at urgent care was reassuring that it didn't look like athlete's foot, that my 2 year long symptoms sounded like an autoimmune or arthritic issue and she gave me antibiotics in case I'm dealing with an infection (cellulitis). I was relieved that I was finally getting some help and some answers. But since Friday I've been experiencing an increase of what might be circulation issues (my mind is automatically thinking that my feet are dying). My toes turn blue/purple on and off. It seems like the only position that doesn't trigger the blue toes is lying in bed. I tried taking a shower right now and my toes were turning very blue and it scared me so badly that I called my healthcare provider's nurse advice number. I've made an appointment for later but in the meantime I'm so scared of what might be happening to me. I don't know how to turn my anxiety off in this situation. It's hard to stay calm when it looks like my feet are dying. And in my current situation I am not able to go to the hospital right now so I'm waiting until my appointment later today.

This is a serious question  and i need anyone who has experineced this or suffers from the same problem to respond.  Ever sense i was young i would feel like i couldn't breathe at times and i would go to the hospital.  They would always tell me I was having an anxiety attack.  So one day as I got a little older, someone gave me a xanax 2mg.  I took it and I didn't get sleepy or anything like everyone else who was passed out on the floor.  I felt normal! For once in my life.   Fast forward to future.  I was getting 15 2mg a month.  I asked Mt Dr if he could everyday.  I don't plan on taking them everyday but I end up doing it anyway got to the point I have to take 2 a day and I run out 2 weeks early.  I will not buy off the street because someone sold me one and it made me have to go to the emergency room and I had just the most horrible experience of my life I can't really explain.  So basically whatever it was wasn't xanax.  Anyway.  I do notice now that I take it more i have more anxiety.  When I run out I can't sleep I already have insomnia but it makes it worse.  I feel like I can't breathe.  I feel like my brain is not right like I'm detached and losing my mind.  Sometimes I will go to the hospital, not to try to get anything, but simply because I am scared.  I can not fill them for 2 weeks and the thought if feeling like that again terrifies me.  It's 330 in the morning and I have to be up at 600 to go to work.  I thought having a job would help but guess not.  I try to go to those places that say they will help you but they basically just treat you like you are there for suicide watch and send you home in 5 days.

English is not my first language, so I apologize if there's a mistake in my grammar.

**I'm a man in my 30s, and I come from a poor family of six. I'm a scrawny 5'1"" guy that was bullied for my appearance.** Because I was bullied, I became socially anxious. I was also given an ADHD diagnosis, along with heart issues. My dad worked as a driver for a public vehicle since he only finished 4th grade and my mom despite having a degree decided to be a housewife. My other siblings and I were only 1 year apart.

I keep thinking that we could have a better life if mom worked instead of my dad. When I asked her one time on why she decided to not get a job, she just blamed me, saying she needed to take care of me when I was a child, along with my other siblings. Like it was our fault that they decided to have 4 kids in a row.

My mom always treats me like a child despite me being an adult. She won't even let me carry a bag of groceries thinking that I won't be able to carry it. She always tells me what I need to do and get her approval whenever I leave the house. She is controlling my life and I hate it. **And when I talked back to her, she and my dad will get mad and tell me that I'm an ungrateful son.**

She even chose the college where I studied and told me what course to take, even though I did not like it, just to save money. I'd like to leave the house, but I'm worried she won't let me. Also, since my mom has my debit card from work and constantly seized the money I am earning, I might not be able to support myself. She only gives me a daily allowance that's enough for my transportation and one meal. If I tried to ask for more so I could save to buy a phone or a laptop that I could use for work, she'd get mad and tell me I did not need such luxury.

It's even hard for me to get another job and keep it because of my social anxiety and physical appearance. **I have no social life, no friends, no love life, no savings, and no freedom. I feel useless. I feel miserable.** I only excel in math and logic thinking. I actually wanted to be an engineer or a mathematician when I was a kid but it is now impossible since it'll be hard for me to earn so I can study again without my mom interfering.

I sometimes wonder why I needed to be born and live like this. **Poor. Short. Skinny. Social Anxious. Controlling Parents.** Why can't I at least be tall or rich or have supportive parents? I wish my life could be better someday.",1677646077.0

Hi all! I (28 F) came to the realization tonight that my attitude around certain things is costing me my health, happiness, and the quality of my relationship with my partner (25 M).

I grew up with instability and housing/food insecurity. As an adult, I threw myself into college and building a career. When I got sidetracked by an abusive boyfriend, I eventually got out of that relationship and earned my master’s.

I teach part time at a local university, and 6 months ago I started a new job with a Fortune 100 company. I worked my butt off to show what I am capable of, and my boss was ecstatic with me, but when I asked about what a track to promotion would look like, I got the corporate run around. What did I do? I went from working 50 to 60 hours each week, of course!

Well, tonight after a tearful call with my wonderful bf (I’m currently in a hotel for a work trip)I realized that I’m miserable. I’ve stopped exercising and I eat non stop now, so I’ve put on 10 lbs. I don’t sleep enough, I cry daily, and I’m stressed 24/7. I’m not being the best partner I can be for my bf.

When I was a kid I dreamed of living a life where I didn’t sleep in a car or wonder where my next meal would come from. Now I make 6 figures and have security, so what am I doing? Trying to have a stroke by 30?
 
I love teaching and my students, so I plan to keep that as is. Starting tonight, I will keep my hours for my regular job to 40/week. I am also going to prioritize getting consistent sleep and exercise. Lastly, I am going to limit time on my phone and spend more of it sitting around with books and coffee. 

I am marking tonight as a next chapter. If anyone would be kind enough to share advice on self improvement or quality of life in general for a recovering workaholic, I would be so thankful.",1677644198.0

I see many posts here of people that are concerned with their hearts - a very common symptom of our little affliction known as anxiety.

I've had anxiety on & of for a couple of decades. For a few years, I felt pretty normal, but about 1 year ago, anxiety decided it was time to 'duke it out with me' once again....

I went through the usual symptoms: chest pains, heart pounding, feeling faint, feeling weird... you know the rest. In this span of time, I received the following tests: stress EKG, echocardiogram, and a coronary CT.

All these tests showed that my heart was healthy, that whatever symptoms were bothering me was not my heart. (Not a big surprise to me) So, an SSRI was prescribed, and I went to therapy. The SSRIs were a nightmare, so I dropped that, did my therapy, and I started feeling normal again after 7 months.

Now to last night.... had an 'off day', feeling slightly jittery, but I managed. At night, I distracted myself by fixing my couch. At bedtime, I crawled into bed....and that's when it hit me. My heart was going a mile-a-minute. I looked at my smartwatch, and it read 110 bpm! (My normal is 50-60)

I figured that maybe my BP was low and my heart was trying to raise it....nope, 145/110!

Holy crap! And the fear kicked in....

However, I had the realization that recent tests stated that my heart was OK.  It's time to settle down and think things through. Then, I realized that I barely drank liquids throughout the day - I was probably dehydrated!  Drank 2 glasses of water, did some breathing exercises, and finally settled down, and BP and HR started to go down.

I slept all night, and I'm proud to say, ""I didn't die.""

My BP is slightly high today, but my HR is back to 'somewhat normal'.

Remember that anxiety is a freakin' powerful thing, but we can get through those tough times. It's important to believe in those normal results you get from the doctor (I re-read the results to myself to calm me down). I could have had a full-blown panic attack, but this time, I told myself 'no'...I'm glad I did.

Hang in there,guys.....

This fucking disorder has fucked up my life in so many obvious and not so obvious ways.

I lost my virginity at 23 but ruined it by having bad anxiety and barely getting it up and that caused all sorts of problems.

Started having panic attacks at 25 and thought I was going insane and started drinking heavily. 

Started developing anxiety induced ED at 26 but thought it was physiological at first. Took ED meds starting at the ripe age of 26. fml

Eventually my anxiety/panic/OCD/ alcohol use became worse and eventually in late 2020 I became agoraphobic and have mostly been since...2.5 years. I quite literally cant ever see myself being functional again god forbid ever travelling or getting on a plane. It feels like I was practically disabled overnight and a certain chapter of my life is forever closed or at the very least curtailed heavily.   

Started taking an SSRI in May 2021 which helped somewhat but unfortunately I still struggle with the agoraphobia and the anxiety. Additionally the SSRI has had some sexual side effects; numbness in genitals, loss of pleasure during sex, loss of pleasure during orgasm, and now lowered libido. I cant really come off the medication and it feels like I will unfortunately be on these meds indefinitely.

So if you've seen me posting often, you may have picked up on the fact I've been having panic attacks consistently for about a week now. It's great. It's lovely. It's hell, who am I kidding?

Well, after alot of peer support, my wonderful and compassionate SO helping me through every single one of them, and constant research, I found out a scientific approach to calm me down.

It isn't one that may work. It's one that does because it's scientifically based-and to a very practical scientific person it was like striking gold.

It is a breathing technique, but not 4-4-4. Inhale in whatever way, exhale in whatever way LONGER than your inhale and don't stop for 5 minutes. Why is this scientifically supported?

Yes, our brains make us anxious with thoughts that trigger our fight-flight-freeze. But the flight-fight-freeze makes us incapable of rational thought. So first you must calm the body before the mind. And the way to do this is to flood your system with oxygen, to get rid of the adrenaline and all those other chemical reactions that happen with the fight-flight-freeze response. Plus it stops hyperventilation 

I don't know if it'll help anybody, but it helps me so I thought I would share.",1677618768.0

Two weeks ago I had my first real panic attack (just the hypochondria feeling built up and finally released) and went to the er thinking I was gonna have a heart attack, they did my blood, ekg, and x-rays everything came back perfect and they sent me on my way with some hydroxyzine to manage it.

So now two weeks later I’m managing a little bit better but still have those worries all the time I just can’t convince myself I’m fine, and I’m 5 days in of taking 5mg of lexapro, I’ve taken it before and it didn’t help the anxiety as much as I’d hoped, I was originally on it for generalized depression and anxiety, but I don’t wanna have to rely on medication to keep me “stable”.

Sometimes I feel I’m the only one fighting Anxiety and Depression. But when I saw that there was over a half a million people on here, it really makes me feel a light. So thank you for being brave and allowing this platform to exist. 
   I have an issue. The issue is even when I deal with whatever is giving the anxiety in the first place, the anxiety is still pressing it’s foot on my chest after it’s over for the rest of the day or even multiple days even though it’s in the past.      It seems the only way it comes off my chest is by sleeping, taking a nap, or if I am having an attack… breathing. I know it’s not normal. I have tried taking Valium but I took it for so long it started to reverse its effects making my anxiety worse. So now I take it as needed. 
    I am in the middle of a move, and there was no snow leading up to the move for about a month. Then the day I move Vancouver gets the most snow for that day in 40 years (ball park). Then I took one day off moving to get my strength back and it was beautiful out so I thought it was over. Yesterday comes along and one hour before I get back to the move and it starts snowing and it hasn’t stopped since then. Today is the last day. Almost done. I pray that even though I will be done with it, my anxiety will go down even if just a bit. I do not wish this on my worst enemy. I have even gone as far as to apply for MAID for mental illness that’s how dark the anxiety can go.

Here we go.

It goes without saying to follow a doctor's instructions and I'm not a doctor, so my experience can only speak to my unique circumstance.

I took 25 mg for six weeks and felt some relief, but was still expediting a bit of an anxiety edge. I went to my doctor and he increased me to 50 mg, saying that usually the normal starting dose for Zoloft but because I've had so many SSRIs and SNRIs in the past, he wanted to start me slowly.

I've now been on 50 MG for about 6 weeks and I feel the difference. It's helped me level out and take most of the edge off.

Interestingly, the last week has been stressful (been on a new job for six weeks and planning for a conference in Toronto and some lobbying in Ottawa) and I'm starting to feel jittery and on edge. I've been a little crankier and anxious, tense, and feeling like I can't sit still.

I don't know if these are situational episodes or if perhaps I need to up my dose again, but I'm going to wait a bit. I've also noticed my heart palpitations have increased this week, so I think it's all actress related.

Incidentally, if anyone has tips on how to manage during a stressful time, I'd appreciate it (not thing to hijack, just feeling that I've written this out and hope folks won't mind). Meditation, ASMR, and distraction with music aren't helping (I also have tinnitus in my right ear from multiple tubes in my ears due to a cleft lip and palate and rocking out WAY too hard when I was a musician in my 20s). Sleep has always been tough but I'm restless this week.

Stopped taking my medication sometime last year because my anxiety had seemed to improve and my therapist agreed that it didn’t seem like I needed it anymore. 

About a month ago I got a cyst on my tailbone and it completely threw me off and now I’m back to being overly anxious. It’s definately not as bad as when I was first diagnosed but it defiantly does get overwhelming at times. One way I’ve really helped my anxiety was having a feeling of being in control, but with this cyst, and the drainage process, and the potential surgery I may need I’ve just felt so hopeless and so out of control that I’ve been getting worried about it. 

I have a real fear of pain that’s caused me a lot of problems. I have developed a lot of avoidant tendencies in regards to anything potentially involving pain. I don’t like going to the doctor out of fear of having to be in pain without having ample time to mentally prepare for it. I know I need to go to the doctor and I know it’s all in my head but some days I wish I can just pop a Xanax to take off some of the edge so I can calm down and sort things out in my mind.

I’m not really fond of relying on Xanax as a solution out of fear or addiction. Has anyone had any success with anything else like THC or Henp or something else? And if I do opt for Xanex how would I approach asking my doctor for it?

I wake up every morning with dread and no motivation, and then start feeling nauseous and dry heaving. The dry heaving eventually becomes actual vomiting. This morning I vomited 4 times before work and even then, I still felt nauseous and can barely eat. 

I'm losing my mind at this point. I started therapy a few weeks ago, so I haven't made much progress yet. I take a beta blocker as needed for anxiety, but it doesn't help with nausea. I also started Zoloft a week ago and I think it might be making the nausea worse. Tried pepto bismol and it stopped me from throwing up for awhile, but I still felt nauseous and it was painful. 

I also have some sort of gastrointestinal issue (likely IBS), but I'm waiting for an official diagnosis at an upcoming appointment. This might also contribute to the nausea. :(

I'll start out with saying I've always had anxiety and I still do but for the past 2 years it has been insanely bad. Severe health anxiety, constant panick attacks. I though it was triggered by covid (and it probably did play a big part) but I deleted Tiktok 2 weeks ago and I'm starting to feel like who I was before anxiety took over.
Idk what it is. My TikTok fyp wasn't even that bad - animals, funny videos, normal people, but I guess the videos the algorithm threw at me every now and then affected me more than I thought they did. you know, the ones you don't really pay that much attention to or don't care about at all but still watch because they're only 20sec long.
I though I would miss out if I didn't have Tiktok but I'm fine. I still use every other social media outlet so I know about most things that go viral and still can participate in conversations about them with my friends (if they ever come up 😁) 
Anyone else here who has noticed their mental health improving after deleting Tiktok? I assume it could be something else but I don't think I've recently changed any other habits in my life.",1677573975.0

I have anxiety that was diagnosed really recently. I hit my head in a car crash 5 days ago and have been dealing with heightened anxiety since. I’ve been cleared by CTs twice now showing no brain damage (one after the accident and one 72 hours later), but anxiety never uses logic. 

Well today at work I began to have a panic attack that was short. Felt short of breath and heavy chest but some focused breathing helped me get through that. 10 minutes later I got hit by another one that lasted an hour. Started with heavy chest followed by hyperventilating. Legs wouldn’t stop moving and arms were holding on to everything around me to ground myself. Since I was at work I had everyone and their mama watching me and that made it 100x worse. My HR director kept saying if I didn’t start to calm down they were calling the ambulance to come pick me up, which made it worse. Finally after going to a different room I finally began to come back to and calm down. My feet still move like crazy but I’ve dealt with this restless leg syndrome for a while when anxious.

Before going to sleep on the 9th of February 9 I felt my heart begin to palpitate unusually fast and  I felt light headed. I honestly thought I was going to have a heart attack. That night I could not go to sleep. The next day wasn’t any better. I decided to go to the doc and ask for results in regard to an Ekg exam and a physical. Both came out fine. Nothing out of the norm in regards to my heart according to the doc. Fast forward to today I’ll be receiving my blood and urine samples this Thursday. I believe they’ll come out just fine. However, what I keep coming back to is why now, out of nowhere i was fine and the next thing I know my heart feels likes it’s pacing, sweaty palms and feet. There’s this ted talk where the speaker noted that most anxious people he spoke to feel anxious simply because they constantly thought about how anxious they felt. That really stood out to me. I become more anxious simply because I think about how anxious I am. These intrusive thoughts I try to control make no sense to me since I’ve never been anxious till now or think that it’s anxiety. At the moment I began writing and while driving back from work i would drive with no audio in the car and literally talk to myself and assure myself what is it that I want in life. I’ve set this financial goals that I think are part of what’s causing my anxiety and the fact that I also don’t know whether accounting is my long term goal/career. All I want is to help others and be able to be a good person and feel like I belong .

 Ps I do enjoy finance and accounting. I just don’t see myself being stuck at an office my whole life.

852,Duloxetine withdrawal- I want to kill God.,7,11ee8lo,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11ee8lo/duloxetine_withdrawal_i_want_to_kill_god/,6,"Hello, first time posting here. I've been struggling with (diagnosed) anxiety for about 3 years. I've found a good neuropsychiatrist who worked with me through it. 
My medication history involved 

Venlafaxine
Benzodiazepam
Risperidone

*Started lactating on Risperidone and my doc said nope, we don't want that so we switched to 
Olanzapine

-I gained weight exponentially. Switched from a size S to a size XL but hey anything to feel better, right?

Then there was a Venlafaxine shortage, the manufacturer was not making it for a period of time. I emailed them and they said they'll bring it to the market in about 6 months. Okay, yeah. Do we have any other manufacturers for Venlafaxine? No? Oh shit.
By this time I knew that if I skip even one dose I get horrible brain zaps so I did the only thing I could at that point- stock up. I know, hoarding medicine is not a good thing to do but it's not an essential medicine and people won't die without it. I didn't want to get worse so I bought every box pharmacies had in my town- which wasn't a lot, it would end up lasting me for the next 4 months. When I got to the last box I talked to my doctor about it and what to do now. There were no meds anywhere. She suggested to drive across the border and get it from another country but that was too much of a hassle, so I requested to switch meds. 
So now I'm taking

✨Duloxetine✨
60mg twice a day. 
After the agony of living in an 80s video game for weeks because of the sudden switch, it started to get better. Duloxetine did in 6 months what Venlafaxine couldn't in 2 years. Anxiety? I don't know her. 

Doc took me off olanzapine and my weight started to get back to normal.

Last 3 months- Duloxetine 60mg only once a day.
2 weeks ago- no more meds. 

And that's when all the fun started- brain zaps, sudden increase of noises, I'm thinking every thought ever at the same time. I can't sleep. I close my eyes and I see light flashing. I'm nauseous. I can't brush my teeth without gagging, every smell is too strong. I'm angry all the time. Everything annoys me, I don't have the patience to talk to anyone because everyone seems so obnoxious. Also my libido is on steroids.
 About to start my first period without meds- subjectively  feeling the anger of the universe. You ever been so angry that you feel the need to invent a new curse word that captures the essence of your rage? And man, my mother language has some nasty words and it's still not enough. 

Also been feeling very squeamish. I'm a medical worker- I've seen (and smelled) my fair share of revolting bodily secretions. Now I can't clean the shower drain without gagging. My cat threw up this morning- considered selling the house. 
Of course I talked to my doctor about it but she says I shouldn't be feeling nauseous, it's not the meds (or the lack thereof ) but then I'm like what do you know? As living without crippling anxiety has made me very cocky.  

The problem is that I have no one else to talk to about this- I have friends/colleagues from med school but they've never been through this, they can't give me advice or rationalize my feelings. It would be highly appreciated if someone who went through something similar could just help reassure me that this is okay. And if you did go through it-  when did the silly goofy mood of homicidal ideation on a global level stop?",1677604801.0

What I mean by uneasy is feeling like your anxiety isn’t as bad as others or isn’t as bad as it used to be/ is more manageable now, so I ‘should’ just buck up and handle things without medication.

For context I was on antidepressants for about 7 months due to OCD last year, I eventually felt much less anxious and the medication was getting expensive so I came off of it with my doctor’s permission. Recently last month I had a bad anxiety flare up and significant low mood, so after a couple weeks of restarting therapy, I saw my doctor again today and he prescribed me SSRI’s again.

But now I’m skeptical about actually taking the medication because in my head I could be doing so much worse. The irony of being anxious about taking anti-anxiety meds!

2020, I with many people, developed severe anxiety. Shortness of breath, excessive blinking, fear of swallowing, hands seizing up, etc. I had some major family issues happening during that time along with being stuck at home.

It only happens every now and then, but enough that it stresses me out, especially when I’m feeling high levels of tension.

862,Anxiety over giving a man a second chance,1,11esmev,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11esmev/anxiety_over_giving_a_man_a_second_chance/,11,"A few weeks ago I (F24) went out on a couple of dates with this guy (33). We had insane amounts of chemistry, and share quite a few interests and values. We ended up becoming intimate quite quickly, and this is where things got rocky. He wanted to do certain things in bed that I am not comfortable with right off the bat of dating.

He ended up breaking things off with me over this issue, and we went our separate ways. He was very manipulative in his attempts to get me to do these things in bed, so I was not very heartbroken over seeing him go, although a lot of my anxiety over abandonment came up as he was drifting away. What did hurt was two weeks later when we ran into each other and he tried to flirt with me again. We ended up getting into a huge argument, during which he said some very hurtful things.

That brings us to this week. He approached me and apologised for his behaviour. He has had a lot of difficulty in his past, and this has lead him to sometimes have difficulty regulating his angry/defensive reactions during arguments. I think that this might be a result of PTSD in his case. He also apologised for pushing for certain sexual things so early on. He eventually asked for another chance to take me out on a date, and I accepted, mainly because I really do like him outside of these bad behaviours. 

Now that we have gone on this date I am just extremely anxious. I know that I have put myself in a vulnerable position by giving him a second chance, and I am nervous that he will either become manipulative again or not ask me out for another date. I really do just like him so much that I am willing to try, but the anxiety from not knowing is eating me up inside, and I don’t really have anyone that I can share this with. I am also aware that the wisest thing would have been to turn him down, but we are past that point now, so I just want any advice on how to deal with this anxiety. He was very well behaved on the date, which is a good start. My anxiety is peaking because I feel like I am just waiting for him to ask me out again, even though we only just went out last night.

I (26F) have had terrible anxiety all of my life, including health anxiety. I am really terrified I’ve got colon cancer or something terminal because for over a year I’ve had intermittent bleeding whenever I poop. I was diagnosed with IBS back in my teens so I thought it was just hemorrhoids or fissures. Sometimes I’ll have blood back to back and then sometimes none. Sometimes it hurts and sometimes it doesn’t. Most of the time it’s bright red but other times it’s kind of darker. I’m freaking out so bad that it’s colon cancer and I’ve waited too late for treatment. I just got married and I’m about to graduate nursing school and I’m panicking that I won’t get to grow old with my spouse and become a nurse. 

I made the mistake of looking on the colon cancer subreddit and it’s made my anxiety so much worse because everyone has had the same symptoms as me. I also keep seeing that young people like me are getting colon cancer and dying and I don’t know what to do. I’m so scared of treatment and not being able to afford it or be able to work. I’m terrified to see my parents and family grieve me because of the cancer. 

I’ve got an appointment with a GI doctor in two weeks and I’m gonna be a mess until then. I’m spiraling and I don’t know what else to do. It’s all my fault for waiting so long to make an appointment in the first place.",1677619444.0

880,"I feel like a failure who will never get a good job, and job search makes me anxious",5,11ec6pe,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11ec6pe/i_feel_like_a_failure_who_will_never_get_a_good/,3,"A bit of a background: I live in London and graduated with a maths degree in 2020, spent the pandemic (2020 - 2021) working as a customer advisor in a shop, and finally got 2 months experience as a BI analyst in a company back in my home country. The job gave me so much anxiety I was loosing sleep and feeling awful and dreading every work day so I left (main reason was that instead of the 6 months training and working with a colleague in projects like they told me in an interview, I was handed over 2 projects from a senior analyst and had barely no training and too many unrealistic expectations put on me within the first months, despite no training being given). 

Now it's been 9 months. I am unemployed and only now have I started applying - but with much difficulty. Looking at job post makes me anxious and even the thought of clicking ""apply"" or worse ""interviews"" drains me. 

I am trying to start a career in data, since I graduated in maths and enjoy coding in SQL and working with numbers, and technology is such a large industry that maybe I can find new roles within that interest me, but I can't help but overthink everything. I always feel I will never be able to succeed in a role, I keep telling myself there is no point applying for certain jobs since I don't understand the business side of it or because I don't have the qualifications.

It took me ages before I finally applied for a graduate data engineering program. I have an interview tomorrow for it but honestly I am not too keen on it, I keep reading stuff saying this is a scam program cause after they train you they might not connect you with clients for months, and its paid below market levels and you are stuck with them for 2 years otherwise you have to pay back hefty amounts for the training - but then again guess it could be a last resort to gain experience and then find something better. I also applied for teacher training which I regretted immediately when they called me for an interview cause I have no desire to get further into student debt to get the PGCE and though I can apply for bursaries during training, it's not guaranteed and there no salaried route. 

I have no idea what I'm doing with my life. I keep trying to look for more entry level/graduate roles in data but everything I look at does not interest me or I just think of 100 ways it could go wrong.

I never thought I would be unemployed, still dependent on others, and lacking so much self-confidence at 24 years old. 

I feel like a huge failure and have no idea how to get out of this slump and simply give jobs a chance by applying. I don't have experience so obviously I wouldn't know how certain businesses operate or understand everything about finance, but I keep searching for this unrealistic ""perfect"" position, as if I need to know 100% about everything to have a chance..

I sometimes think of just going back to working on the shop floor, but I put so much of my energy throughout my life just studying, I want to achieve something better, or at least try and not give up. I was that straight-A, nerd girl with no friends always alone. All I knew was study, so it feels unfair to myself to give up without at least trying.

But I don't know how to get out of this mindset...

just need some general advice and support. 

been at my new job for about a month and came down with the flu/vomiting so i called in sick. this was already hard because of my anxiety but i managed to pick my phone up and do it. 

next thing i know a family member contacts me to say my grandma is not looking good and i should come and say my goodbyes. cue meltdown. my granny was my best friend and she was first “big” passing in my family. 

now because of my anxiety and grief with my granny i have completely stopped everything. i have ignored calls from work and my friends to grieve. i could not for the life of me get out of bed and go to work with the anxiety knowing i’d missed calls and the thoughts of my nan on her death bed. 

now i have a disciplinary meeting which has caused an anxiety attack. luckily my partner was here to help and calm me down but i know i can’t stick my head in the sand and just not go, i have every right to explain my granny’s passing but i know they will be furious that i ignored calls. i deal with this a lot, my anxiety takes over and i’d rather ignore it and let it all fade away but i can’t. if i lose my job i’ll have no money, i’ll feel like a failure as i’ve been looking for a job for a very long time. everything just seems to fall down when i’m up.",1677630976.0

He's now become the biggest trigger for my anxiety.

He wakes up late for work every morning (because alarms give him anxiety), then goes into a panic spiral when he does get up. I work from home, so he talks at me when he's spiraling. He says he doesn't know what to do but can't listen to my advice. This is how we begin most days.

He goes to work, but when something triggers him, he starts to text me. He'll text me 1, 2, 5 times in a row, all statements about how much his life sucks and how everything is unfair. He texted me 30 times today. I was at work, but that obviously isn't a big concern for him.

After a while, I'm completely overwhelmed, so I stop responding or only give one word replies. Then he calls me. He talks at me about his problems and doesn't even notice I'm not saying anything on the other line. He wants someone to fix things for him; I don't think it matters that I'm the person on the other line.

He comes home from work and immediately launches into further reasons why his day was terrible, why his life is terrible, and how he has no help. Meanwhile, I've been alone and working literally all day. I've had no human contact except his anxiety spirals in the morning and upon his return from work.

At night, he drinks beer and smokes and plays video games to unwind. He doesn't prep stuff for work the next day or really do anything to take care of himself other than shower. The next day, he'll complain that he never has any time to take care of himself.

I love my partner, and I want to be there for him, but it's unfair that he treats me like his on-call therapist, sometimes. He unloads everything onto me, and it's the same content over and over every day. I'm burnt out.

It's not just the volume of calls, it's that a lot of the people who call are angry, upset, many have mental health issues, etc. I've had several calls that really shook me up since I started, and now I have anxiety around answering the phones at all.

For a few years now I've suffered with mental health. Started going downhill after I broke up with my ex boyfriend. Then the pandemic happened. Got so isolated. Anyway, I basically noticed from this whole experience that I live in my head constantly. It's like I'm not even attached to reality. It's like I'm living inside my head, trapped in my head, like I'm not even in this world. My head constantly feels foggy, tight, and just wired, like I'm thinking all the time and almost as if I'm thinking up my experience, thinking up my reality than actually taking reality for what it is. I don't know how to describe the experience. It's as if no matter what I do, no matter what I'm doing, I'm thinking. Like I work on the computer all day, having to figure out stuff for customers, but it's as if I'm able to do all this but at the same time part of me is just watching me do it all. Scared. Commentating on everything. Thinking about something completely different. 

In addition I often have thoughts playing in the background, conversations, and very commonly just have songs running through my mind all day. Not as if I can actually hear them, it's not a hallucination, but just like as if I'm thinking the songs through and they're playing over and over again. It's always songs I've been listening to. 

I just feel very disconnected from reality. I'm on medication (snri). I have been on 3 different SSRIs in the past 3 years. None have seemed to work. Has anyone had this experience and can anyone help me? I want to live in the physical world again and not in my made up reality",1677619875.0

First off, I have severe social and generalized anxiety. Add adhd, depression and dermatophagia (skin picking disorder) on top of that and you’ll get me.  
I’ve been on a new combo of meds that have been really helping me lately, but it felt like during this appointment that all went out the window. 
First off, when they took my vitals the nurse mentioned I have white coat syndrome. I couldn’t control how fast my heart rate and blood pressure were and my readings were high to the point of concern. They read them twice, once at the beginning and another at the end. Both times went poorly. 
The reason I went to the doctor was very specific. My immune system has been very poor lately and I’ve been getting sick back to back for months now. I also have a complicated medical history that takes effort to communicate. I have been chronically tired as well and was hoping for advice regarding tests to run to check levels of things like b12 and iron.
When I met my doctor for the first time they were nice, but so intimidating and kept up with the most insanely intense eye contact. I was so thrown off and out of my element that I don’t know what I said, and I pretended to hear what she said subconsciously and after the appointment I forgot everything immediately. 
She also looked skeptical of me and I couldn’t tell why. I have a hard time reading faces and I couldn’t help but assume she didn’t like me or was put off my terrible presentation, lack of confidence, nervousness etc. 
My brain was telling me she thought I was on drugs because of how bad I was acting (for the record, I stay away from all of those besides my prescriptions these days because they cause me anxiety). I can’t help but feel like she thought I was lying to her about what I get up to, when in general I’m pretty boring and keep to myself. 
She also noticed my hands and asked to see them, which is an uncomfortable boundary for me. I pick at my fingers a lot and they look really bad to people who aren’t familiar with that sort of thing.
Overall, I just felt consumed by self hatred afterwards and I almost regret going. I don’t know how I’m supposed to go through life like this. It feels so impossible to act normal when everything in my brain is screaming at me and saying I’m NOT ok in these moments.  

All said, I think I’m supposed to return for some blood testing but I don’t know how I’ll be able to get myself back there now. It feels like whenever I’m making progress I inevitably move several steps back. I also forgot to mention anything about how sick I’ve been lately, which was one of the main purposes of my visitation.

TLDR: I had a doctors appointment with a new doctor and my anxiety was so bad I think I left a really bad impression. I worry that they assumed I am a bad person and/or making bad decisions and lying as a result. I also forgot everything communicated to me in the appt.

926,Panic and trouble sleeping - psych prescribed sleeping pills and diazepam but I feel taking either will make me panic,2,11edke1,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11edke1/panic_and_trouble_sleeping_psych_prescribed/,0,"I've had issues with anxiety and panic for around 7 years now.  I feel anxious almost every evening/night, usually when I'm alone and I've had intense panic attacks around 7 times I would say in these 7 years, and some other panic episodes which I wouldn't classify as attacks. These panic attacks have really scarred me mentally and I am scared shitless of them. The first panic attack I  had was connected with trying a psychoactive drug. It wasn't the drug which caused me to panic, but my own thought process. I was waiting for something to happen, a change of my perception of reality or something. As I would think about it, the more I wanted nothing to happen at all, and then I started panicking because I thought my perception of reality was out of my control now.

Anyway, lately I've been having a lot of issues with sleeping. It is a bit hard to fall asleep initially, but then I would wake up 5-6 times during the night, every night. If I realize I woke up between midnight and 3 am, I am most likely to start panicking a bit. At those times I just try to calm myself so as to not have an actual panic attack. If I were to have a panic attack I would start calling people just to have someone to talk to, presence of another person helps me. Nights are hard because I am alone, and I know everyone is asleep, and they probably won't wake up and answer if I call them (which only worsens the panic). This phase started because I woke up at 3 am and had a panic attack, and so the fear woke up again, and this is how it is now.

I was always very against taking any medicine (like diazepam). Psychiatrist would always offer it to me, I would always decline because I feel I would start panicking after ingesting the medicine (and also because I just generally didn't want to depend on medicine and maybe get addicted). Even though it's supposed to calm me down, I am still in fear. But since this phase has started I am so done, and I am so so tired, not only from the lack of quality sleep, but also tired from fighting anxiety and panic for such long time. 

I decided to accept the medicine. I got sleeping pills and diazepam. And now I am scared of taking either of those. They are sitting on my shelf, looking at me. I like the thought of having diazepam for a worst case scenario where I wouldn't be able to stop the panic and I feel in that moment I might harm myself real bad just to make the panic stop. But then again, maybe even then I would feel to scared to take it.

What I would like, is to maybe have someone share their insight on this. Maybe someone has a similar fear as me, and can give me some helpful advice on how to take these medicines and not start to panic.

I am diagnosed with GAD and used to have a therapist (work paid, I no longer work there). One of the key breakthroughs we had was around procrastination, basically I procrastinate as an anxiety response. This obviously leads me to have less time to spend on tasks which then makes me even more anxious and the cycle perpetuates.

I’ve vastly improved with this in the last two years (recognising when I’m starting to procrastinate on a task and stopping it) but something I still struggle with is getting out of bed in the morning. I will set an alarm giving me an hour to get ready for work, or two hours to workout then get ready for work. I know that getting up, dressed, having a nice breakfast, going for a run etc all make me feel a million miles more refreshed and dopamine-y for the day. Yet still. Even though I wake up to the alarm just fine, if my first call of the day is at 9:30, I’m leaving bed at 09:25.

I’m not even having a nice time lying in bed. I don’t look at my phone in the morning (this has also helped with GAD) so I’m not watching YouTube or chatting with friends or anything, just literally looking at the ceiling either worrying about work/life or, bizarrely, running through made up scenarios in my head like a movie?

I feel like I’ve come so far with healthy habits to deal with my GAD - better sleep, better diet, more exercise, less alcohol - but this one I just cannot shake. It also manifests in other ways (basically if I need to leave the house at 7pm I start getting ready at 6:50pm and am then really late, again, also very anxiety inducing).

This is really impacting my life/career so I was wondering if anyone has any tips, either a way to combat it or insight into the underlying issue? It’s not (just) social media my phone is literally on the other side of the room and I’m staring into space when it’s happening. It’s not oversleeping, I wake up to the alarm then do nothing for 1hr.

I'm just worried I'm going to end up falling into my practice of finding something simple and miss out on good local food.

934,Understanding Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,0,11ei0mh,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11ei0mh/understanding_obsessive_compulsive_disorder/,0,"OCD is an anxiety disorder and considered to be a neurotic condition but is was less considered disabling than a psychotic illness 

Other anxiety disorders include phobias, panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. They all share anxiety as a fundamental function and there is an overlap of symptoms among them. 

OCD has to do with obsessive and compulsive thoughts which are persistent. The sufferer tries to get rid of them in a daily battle with this disorder. 

Obsessions are psychological while Compulsions are motor actions. However this is not always the case. You can have mental psychological compulsions. A feature of compulsions that need to be worried here is that an obsession is actively brought by the patient: he is not happy about doing it, but it is essentially his voluntary action, performed because of his compulsive desire, and not an automated behavior. It is different from tics and muscle spams that are typically found in some people which are basically uncontrolled motor responses. 

What we mean by compulsion here is different from the everyday language of using that word. Compulsions are acts which are the result of a desire that the person normally tries to resist, and which are carried out unwillingly. They are viewed as basically illogical or ridiculous, and give no satisfaction or fulfillment. Forms of conduct like compulsive betting, compulsive lying, and compulsive eating do not show these features although they’re issues in their own right, they aren’t part of obsessive-compulsive disorder. 

At times, the term ‘compulsive’ is used for behavior like recurrent nail-biting, thumb sucking, and hair pulling. Those are routines, and the persons generally participates in them, at least part of the time, without being aware of the,. They lack the characteristic features of the compulsion in obsessive-compulsive disorder. True compulsions are carried out to achieve some aim; conduct like nail-biting, hair pulling, and so on is not. Nor do they provoke a feeling of resistance. Those types of behavior are best viewed as habits rather than true compulsions, as their resemblance to the latter is superficial.",1677613858.0

***Connecting to your breath*** is one of the simplest and surest ways to regulate your nervous system and become calm in moments of heightened anxiety. The breath is the most direct route to accessing the *power of the present moment*, which in itself is the healing agent. 

It doesn't have to be complicated, and you don't have to use a fancy technique. Simply take a few *deep, conscious breaths* when you feel the anxiety coming on. Inhale deeply for at least 5 seconds, pause for a moment and then exhale for slightly longer than you inhaled for. It's so simple a child can do it, and you can do it *anywhere, anytime*. 

While it may sound too simple, it's really not. The act of doing something *mindfully, intentionally and with presence* is the key in any modality that aims to reduce anxiety. So, you have an inbuilt tool to regulate your system, and you should *use it!* 

Try it for at least 10 deep, slow breaths when you are feeling anxious and let me know if you experience any relief :)",1677591825.0

My boyfriend pays rent to help, and pays car insurance for the car he shares with his mom. Ever since me and my boyfriend have been dating, his mom has been very invasive. Her personality is just nosy, and she wants to be a part of everything. She always comes in my boyfriends room while I’m there in and out all the time because she always just wants to know what we’re doing. She is always nosy and she thinks because she is the mother of the house she is in control of everything and can do anything. My parents are very chill we’re I live, and they let me sleep with my boyfriend in my room, but his parents do not allow me and him to sleep together and I have to sleep on the couch when I do stay the night. I have a hard time accepting rules because I hate feeling controlled. Me and my boyfriend for the past couple of months have been arguing and fighting over and over about him putting more effort into our relationship, and he agreed to change, but I also brought up one thing about his mom, and how I want her to stop being nosy, and invasive and I want her to allow us to sleep together and have more freedom there since I’ve been with him for 3 years. My boyfriend agreed to talk to his mom and dad and his mom got offended and angry that I was trying to change there house rules and because she is the mother she can make up all the rules and control what goes on in her house, my boyfriend didint end up going to work because he wanted to take me out to Breakfest one morning and his mom got very pissed off and sent him a nasty text message about how he should be at work and that she is his mother and he needs to stop telling his mother that he can make his own decisions on when to miss work and stuff, and she said he needs to have more respect for him and that she’s his mother, she also said if I’m gonna not come over to his house anymore he won’t be coming to my house anymore (SHE SAID THIS AND MY BF IS 20 YEARS OLD) blah blah blah, and I got upset that she said all this, so I sent her a text message this is what the text message said to her 
Text message: “I’m sorry you feel the way you do but he is an adult and can make his decisions and I would appreciate it if you stop involving yourself in our relationship. And if you won’t give us the tiniest space in your own, then I won’t be coming over! It’s very simple it’s called privacy and respect. And he can choose when to come to my house or not sorry you can’t control that part, as much as you’d like too.” 
This is what I sent to his mom… in the moment I was angry and heated upset and frustrated that his mom can’t just leave us alone and treat us like adults. Anyways I have realized it is wrong and apologized to his dad for the message and how I tried to change there rules. and his mom blocked me but I want to fix our relationship again because the tension is so bad and I wish I could have just kept my mouth quite.

Long story short, I have a friend who I've been friends with since we were 12 (I'm now a year out of college). For as long as I remember, we've relied heavily on each other for support, and there isn't a single thing about me that she doesn't know, and vice versa. Our relationship is the type where we ""trauma dump"" on each other multiple times a week with no filter and we basically are each other's therapists. I've done my best to listen, tell her that I'll always be here for her, not impose on issues that I don't personally relate to, but make sure that she knows that she's got me. But honestly, I'm worried that's not enough sometimes. Recently, I've hit a wall with how much support and help I feel I can offer her because there are issues that she brings up that I don't think I have the expertise to provide her solid advice on. I tend to take on others' issues as if they're my own, and I also feel myself building an emotional barrier, which I hate because I want to be there for her to my fullest capacity. We've always had pretty weak boundaries because we've assumed that the other can take on what we're about to tell them, but especially now, I don't think I have the expertise and capacity to help her in the way that a professional can.

We've been friends since we were kids and I can tell that her mental health has been severely declining, especially over the course of college and post-grad, and I don't know what to do. I'm worried because I also know that I'm the only one she talks to about these things. I don't want to lose a friend just because I didn't have the necessary skills to support her. I can tell that she's resistant to seeking professional help. I completely understand that finding a therapist and speaking with a doctor is a decision that's very personal, so I don't want to force it. I've had a therapist myself, and I was lucky to have had a good experience with it, so I know how much it could potentially help.

Hi

This is a long post, just fair warning. 

I (22f) still live with my parents on the account that I’m a college kid with a net worth of about four dollars and an expired Jimmy Johns coupon. 

For some background: when I was a kid (like between the ages of 7-9) both of my parents had life-threatening experiences that I think traumatized me pretty good. First was my dad. He’d suffered from SEVEN actively bleeding stomach ulcer and vomited buckets of blood. I will never forget watching him get taken away in an ambulance as everyone else around me was falling apart. And then my mom had an incident a year or so later in which she had mistakenly mixed a prescribed medication with alcohol. She’d taken the medication before going to an after-work party where she had a drink or two. My dad and I waited and waited for her to come home or to get a phone call. At about 1am, we finally did get a phone call. From the hospital. We rushed over to find her a completely disoriented mess, vomiting all over herself and screaming out in pain. 

Long story short, they’re both fine now. But both experiences rattled my little squishy baby brain. 

Now, to be perfectly clear, I’ve always been a bit of an emetophobe. Literally ever since I can remember. My first memory of it was when I was about 3/4 years old and having a complete panicked meltdown because I watched my mom throwing up in a toilet from a bad sandwich or something. I even remember yelling “you’re dying!!!” when my mom came over to comfort me lmao. I’d have brief panic attacks whenever I heard either parent actively vomiting; but they would be short-lived. I also would cover my ears and close my eyes whenever there was vomiting (even cartoon vomiting) on TV. 

But all that said, both of those experiences with my folks took that initial anxiety and ramped it up by about a thousand. Every time I heard one of them vomiting after those incidents, I would have a severe panic attack that would not ease off for over an hour. I would avoid whatever bathroom it happened in for weeks. I’d sob whenever I remembered the sounds. One time, my dad was vomiting so loudly I ran away and could hear it outside of the house so I ran and ran until a neighbor found me and took me back home. 

My mom also suffers from migraines. She’s got the right mix of medications now, but when I was a kid, she would have to go to the ER a few times a year for them. While she regrets it now, there were times when my dad would be away for work and she would need to go the hospital. No matter how much I pleaded and cried for her to call someone to take her to the ER, her pride interfered and she would drive me and herself to the ER in which she would vomit A LOT. This, I imagine, also didn’t help my parental emetophobia. 

On top of that, I’ve been diagnosed with Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder. I was genetically predisposed to it plus some other traumatizing experiences also contributed to their development I’m sure. I do not currently medicate for either condition for personal reasons. 

Now for why I’m here. 

As I said earlier, I’m now a grown college kid. My brain has matured and I’ve learned coping techniques to help me manage my anxiety. Ironically, I’m even currently taking an abnormal psychology course which has all the more helped me understand why my brain gets a little silly sometimes. And as a college kid, I party from time to time in which I see MANY people vomit on a semi-frequent basis. I myself will occasionally overindulge in some of the devil’s nectar and find myself hunched over a bush as the sun rises over a beautiful day to be hungover. This exposure therapy of sorts has calloused me a bit to my emetophobia. Or at least, made it far less severe. I still feel a flicker of anxiety whenever someone is a particularly violent puker. It only really gets bad if the vomiting is happening within close proximity to me or if it occurs without warning. 

I thought I was over the worst of it. 

Oh, how wrong I was. 

Last night, my dad got snagged in a nasty stomach bug. I was a little anxious after he told me he was nauseous, but I just put on my headphones and went about my business. I was perfectly fine up until I heard him vomiting. The moment I heard the first retch, my body flew into fight or flight, and I was completely helpless to it. It was the most raw, animalistic terror I’ve felt in a long time. 

Did I try and tough it out? Was I a big girl grown up badass who spit in the face of my fear? 

Absolutely not. I booked it out of there as fast as possible. Grabbed my book bag and bolted. Once I stopped trembling I drove over to my partner’s place. Took me almost two hours to remotely calm down. 

Don’t get me wrong, I tried to use my soothing techniques but that panic I felt was having none of it. It felt like my organs were trying to leap out of my body. I’ve been to therapy a few times, and have probably learned just about every trick in the book as well as inventing my own. (Albeit, the emetophobia thing has never come up because I’m embarrassed by it) 

Mind you, it’s been awhile since I’ve heard either of my parents throw up. Probably coming up on a decade now. I was thinking my new found toughness against my fears would apply to them too. 

But I guess not. 

Now I feel extremely embarrassed and upset. I know it’s an irrational fear, and I know I am not in real danger. But something got triggered so violently and suddenly, I’m struggling to recover. I didn’t sleep last night because the anxiety just lingered and lingered in my gut and kept me awake. I’m home now, alone with my poor old man. Currently holed up in my room with headphones in fetal position because I’m so terrified. 

So, Reddit, how can I kick this thing’s ass so I don’t run for the hills again? He’s still very sick and I’m getting a bit annoyed with my goofy subconscious head. I can’t be a badass when big gag makes me pee my pants and cry. 

Tl;dr: dad’s loud cough and stomach stew transforms me into a shrieking prey animal plz help

Side note: I don’t know for sure, but I’ve theorized that my parents specifically becoming ill triggers me because those two events were as absolutely terrifying as they were. I was relatively “alone” when they happened. As in, while one parent was suffering the other was focused on the situation of their spouse while I was a bystander. No other relatives were around for either incident, and I remember feeling incredibly alone and insecure. The same feelings came whenever my mom would drive both of us to the hospital. I didn’t feel safe around her. I probably wasn’t safe. I feel awful about all of this. I should be able to take care of my parents, no matter the circumstance. But I fear that this little quirk of mine physically restrains me from doing so.",1677595468.0

Just wanted to vent a little bit. I'm 21 and I have the hardest time being yelled at or scolded, even for little things. Even when I know it's not personal, like maybe the person is having a bad day, I just shut down. Logically I know it's no big deal, but my body just reacts. I start shaking, crying, and if it's really bad I even get nauseous or feel as if I'm about to pass out (cold, ears ringing, vision going dark). Then I end up thinking about every little thing I've said or done that resulted in me getting scolded. I still think about things that happened when I was a child. It consumes my free time and peace of mind. It's so embarrassing and frustrating feeling like I have no control over it, and it makes bad situations even worse. I think it may be related to having a severely alcoholic (angry, verbally abusive, occasionally physically abusive) mother and an apathetic father, but it continues to impact my relationships, education, and work.

Skip to the last chunk if you just want to see the question.

Preface this saying currently in a very low point anxiety wise, past four months have been hell on the mental health, but it has been looking up the past month, specifically the past few weeks in general.

I’ve had severe anxiety for years and am aware of my triggers and of my usual symptoms, being primarily shortness of breath and persistent derealization when it’s really bad. I am also un-medicated because I am frankly scared of the effects of new medicine usually and have gotten through this before without it.

Not going to go into too much detail but recently had a medical issue that has been causing me strife daily and in my trying to figure that out I have gone to multiple doctors to see what the root of the issue could be, one being a heart doctor. Wore a heart monitor for thirty days, had an afib scare (was proved artifact) yada yada of course everything came back clean even after an ultrasound of my heart and aorta. Has helped the worry about the heart, haven’t been thinking about it too much as of about twenty minutes ago.

I was just sitting in my chair when I started to feel this wave feeling kind of running down my chest, I’ve felt it before and have summed it up to be adrenaline, sometimes it feels like butterflies and others it feels more akin to my stomach dropping or something. I wasn’t too worried until brain took over and decided it was time to check our heartbeat on our wrist, when I felt my heartbeat it felt like normal sinus rhythm until randomly middle of the beat it paused randomly for like 2 seconds give or take. Sent me into overdrive and all the while I’ve been feeling my heartbeat in my wrist and it feels weaker. So again kind of freaking out, should I be concerned, does anyone else experience this? Should I just shut up, lay it on me straight. Thank you.

(35 Male) So after over 5 years of not working due to anxiety and panic attacks I finally was forced more or less to get back out there and start working. I chose Housekeeping at a local Casino, a place filled with loud noises and lots of people, the exact environment I typically have issues with. I got on 3rd shift from midnight till 8 am and it had many perks that I personally enjoyed and feel the need to point out: they did not drug test for marijuana, something I am a daily user of. I also am on an antidepressant and was on a prescribed controlled narcotic at the time of hiring, we'll get to that in a minute.

2 weeks into doing the simple job of emptying ashtrays, cleaning up bathrooms and wiping down slot machines, I walked into my supervisors office and handed in my badge, saying I couldn't do it, the noise was to much, the people too many; an excuse I had convinced myself to be more true than it really was. Hours later I'm at my parents house and I'm just so ashamed of what I've done, given up so easily. My phone rings, its my job! Its my big boss, and they want to know what happened and if I'd be willing to come back. Absolutely I would I'm so stupid for quitting I'll be there tomorrow. A discussion was made of transferring me to a day shift schedule where the patrons where older and less drunk, and less busy overall.

A month goes by. I keep asking about the transfer to 1st shift. I keep getting vague answers. I hand in my badge on my lunch break and go home. Again, my big boss, calls me and says wtf, you are going to day shift in 2 weeks! Again in the 3-4 hours since I quit, I was relieved to be given yet another chance to redeem myself. I gutted out the 2 weeks, I got transferred to day shift, and...it was great! I actually did much better in the day environment. But I also wanted to escape from Housekeeping, as the high school drama was what led to me accumulating 6 absence points (12 allowed) in a 3 month period. Around this time I was informed my Doctor was no longer prescribing any narcotics and I had to go cold turkey off my Chlonazepam.

I put in for transfer to Count Room Attendant, dealing with millions of dollars on the daily. And because I had the reputation of being a damn good worker by anyone you asked, I was allowed to transfer despite my very rocky start with the company. The fact I still had a job at this point and only 6 discipline points out of 12 after quitting 2 times is astounding and not lost on me. My first day of doing count room I am extremely nervous, but everyone says I learned quick, I was a star in the making, and I was gonna do great. I left that 1st day feeling on cloud nine. Oh and I only worked 4 hours but got paid for 8. Dream job material.

My 2nd day...I called in. Actually I didn't call in I no called. Why? I convinced myself I was going to screw things up in my new position, everyone hyped it up as a super stressful job and I fed into it even though I actually was rather stress free dealing with the money. I enjoyed being locked in a room away from the noise and patrons. My new boss called me, asking what happened. I had such a great first day and such great feedback, did I just forget that I was scheduled? And I told her what happened. And for a THIRD time now in a 4 month period, this place let me come back after basically quitting and continue my job the next day. I was now at 10.5 points out of 12. My points will not fall off until early December at the earliest. At this rate, I'm not going to last. This is what I convince myself.

I work the job for 6-7 days. I love every minute of it, I found my dream job but I have this nagging anxiety of being 1 point away from termination. Friday I woke up with a headache, fever, vomiting, and I texted my boss that I was sick and not going to be in. This was the first day out of my 10.5 points that I was calling because I was truly sick. And this set me to 11.5 points because I didn't call in 2 hours before my shift, even though I went to bed feeling fine and didn't know I was sick until my alarm 1 hour before work (my fault, not placing blame). I spent all day Friday sleeping and taking medication. I was supposed to inform my boss if I would be in the next day even though I had talked to her on the phone that day and told her I felt a flu coming on. I overslept and by the time I had awoken I had a voicemail and text informing me of my termination.

Now, Tuesday Morning, I sit here and obviously I look at the chances I was given, multiple, and how I still let it all slip away. I keep trying to find ways to blame the job, that they didn't cater to this need or they didn't understand this aspect of my mental health. I'm trying to focus on the positive things that I accomplished like, no matter the ups and downs during the journey, I held a job for over 4 months for the first time in 5 years.

My next job will not be as forgiving of my issues. My next job will not be ok with me smoking pot. I genuinely loved the Casino job, but the over-analyst in me feels how could I have truly loved it so much if I was willing to continuously throw it away and sabotage it.

 Now I'm stuck in this rut where I have to get another job, and I don't know how to stop self-sabotaging myself when I do. I know a lot of people call off because they hate their job but I had myself convinced I loved mine, yet it lasted 4 months by my own habits.",1677567923.0

I have the best friends and family, and feel very blessed. However, I have struggled with anxiety for so many years, and did not seek out treatment until this past year, as my anxiety did not become extremely unbearable until then. 

I am very much a perfectionist; I always got good grades in college and felt very in control of my life (i was even born on my due date - how classic). However, when I started my new accounting job as an auditor post grad, all I could think about was what if I did this wrong what is this I did that wrong, and so on and so forth. I would become comfortable with how I completed a task, only to then find myself thinking about it days later after it was done, worrying about what if I did something wrong or I missed something.

It literally got to the point where I had a panic attack, and I would wake up every morning with my heart racing. Every waking moment of my day was spent worrying over a mistake that I had made, that nothing could be done about. Once i decided to seek treatment, I really thought that I had everything handled, as I started to take Lexapro and felt better, and also sought out a therapist.

However, as I begin my busy season again, which seems to be the trigger for me, I can’t help but fall into the old ways of spiraling in worry. It’s so easy to talk to my therapist about how silly my anxiety and thoughts are, and why I shouldn’t worry, but then when a situation happens, I feel so out of control. I truly wish I had anybody else’s brain other than mine. It makes life so hard to enjoy and I often feel as if I am missing out on experiencing happiness. I truly find myself jealous of friends and family who are able to live their life without debilitating anxiety. Rant over.",1677543688.0
982,Is it possible high blood pressure can cause anxiety?,1,11e4m43,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11e4m43/is_it_possible_high_blood_pressure_can_cause/,0,"I’ve researched this to some extent and it seems like there is a scientific consensus that anxiety can cause high blood pressure. But I’ve been wondering if it also works the other way around?

My anxiety really went off the rails a few years ago when I had a number of panic attacks where I thought I was having heart attacks because of the heavy heart beating I was feeling during the panic attacks. Eventually, these panic attacks stopped but I continued to experience a great degree of generalized anxiety which I coped with through escapism.

After I recently went to the doctor and got diagnosed with high blood pressure and subsequently confirmed the results on a home blood pressure monitor, I’ve been starting to wonder if my high blood pressure caused my anxiety and not the other way around.

The reason for this thought is that my anxiety typically gets triggered by my heart beating faster - once my heart starts going, my anxiety gets worse and then my heart beats even faster in a horrible cycle. I would think it needs to beat often because the high blood pressure halts the effectiveness of each beat.

I feel like, fixing the high blood pressure may fix the anxiety as it would make my heart calmer but I can’t seem to find any scientific backing of this idea. Do you think I’ve got something here or am I totally off?",1677586589.0
983,A new friend invited me over to her house today,35,11dheo7,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11dheo7/a_new_friend_invited_me_over_to_her_house_today/,35,"It’ll be my first time driving to her house by myself and staying there. I just realized that when I get there I’m gonna have to make my presence known somehow to be let inside, and now it’s giving me terrible anxiety. 

What do I do? Should I just knock on their door? Or ring the doorbell if they have one? Or just text her and let her know I’m there? Should I knock first and then ring the doorbell if they don’t answer?

With my close friends, I’ve always texted to let them know I’m there, but this is a new friend. I’m afraid texting her will just make me look stupid. But I’m afraid knocking will make me look weird. And if I knock while they have a doorbell, that might make me look stupid too. 

Ugh. This is so stupid to fuss over. Thanks anxiety lol.",1677518836.0

985,Sertraline,1,11e4e49,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11e4e49/sertraline/,1,Hey everyone! I was wondering how many mg your doctor started you with if you take Sertraline and what you’re taking now? My brother in law only takes 25 mg and has had it for months but mine just prescribed me 100 mg. Did you have any immediate side effects that went away shortly after your body got used to it?,1677585886.0

I can't switch off my brain, it's like I'm constantly walking on eggshells, even in my own head. I have to carry it around with me every day. It's exhausting. I understand that everyone gets anxious from time to time, but to me, anxiety is like a chronic illness, one that I can't escape from. It. Never. Stops. I wish I could just find some peace and relief from it, if only for a few moments. I just need to know it gets better. I can't STAND hearing ""just breathe"" anymore. 20 years of therapy and all I hear is just breathe.",1677554344.0
987,"friend acting slighly different, how do i ride this out?",2,11e0dfd,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11e0dfd/friend_acting_slighly_different_how_do_i_ride/,1,"hi!! i have really bad anxiety and recently, about a month or two ago, said something to a very close friend that upset them a little. they said it wasn't that bad though. (note that this person also has mental health struggles as i do). coincidentally they've been acting a little odd for the past month and ive just been panicking and crying on and off that its all my fault. ive asked them plenty of times if i did something, they said no.

but they're still acting strangely off and even if they said i haven't done anything wrong i still feel like this behavior is my fault. how do i ride this out? do i just keep going even if im unsure? its really hard because now im hyper-aware of it and over-analyzing every slightly ""off"" action and im so so convinced its all my fault. i constantly freak out and cry because im so scared of having permanently damaged such a long-term friendship. and i just dont want to hurt anybody :( its my worst fear

its been a month of being so anxious and im tired. deep down im so afraid of hurting people and being a bad person. i slip up a lot because im anxious and a big people-pleaser. whenever i tell myself its not my fault i just feel like im making excuses for myself :(

i feel so alone in this struggle. it feels so scary and there's nobody to tell me it'll be ok and  that nothing is wrong- and even if they did, my anxiety would make me not believe them. god im tired. any advice is appreciated.",1677570820.0
