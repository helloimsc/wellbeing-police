0,Welcome to BipolarReddit! A Message from the Community,294,kr9uh4,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/kr9uh4/welcome_to_bipolarreddit_a_message_from_the/,0,"Welcome! This is a community focused on supporting people diagnosed with bipolar disorder. If you are bipolar, we‚Äôre glad you‚Äôre here. We are a judgement-free community that wants to see all people diagnosed with bipolar disorder achieve enduring health and balance. 

As you explore the discussions, here is a primer on how this community works.

* Most people who post and comment on r/BipolarReddit have already received a medical diagnosis, including bipolar type 1, type 2, schizoaffective or cyclothymia. If you have not yet sought a diagnosis, we encourage you to meet with a doctor, discuss your concerns and solicit their diagnosis. However, you are welcome to read and ask general questions in your pursuit of health.  
* A medical diagnosis can only be given by a medical professional. If you are concerned enough about your mental health to ask if you are bipolar, that is sufficient reason for you to seek a medical opinion. None of us participate here in a medical capacity, and no one here can or will tell you if you are bipolar. Those kinds of questions are not for this subreddit.
* We like to be precise. Terms like mania, hypomania and major depression have specific definitions, and we ask you to familiarize yourself with the medical terminology. We have created a wiki for (and authored by) people with bipolar disorder, based on the DSM-V. Please [review the definitions](https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/wiki/index/definitions). **Important Note:** The terms mania and hypomania are often conflated, inaccurately. Please be exact in your use of these terms when posting and commenting because it helps the community understand the severity of what you are experiencing, which helps us give you the best support. Mania is a medical emergency that typically requires hospitalization. We understand that it can be hard to know exactly what is going on in the moment. Just do your best so we can better understand you. 
* We invite you to [explore the rest of our subreddit‚Äôs wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/wiki/index), which has valuable information and resources this community has compiled. There are some common questions for people with bipolar disorder. Before posting a question, please look through the wiki to see if your question has already been answered.  
* Harassment is not tolerated, and this subreddit is actively moderated. Do not post anything that is hateful or hurtful to others‚Äô path to health. Robust discussion and strong opinions are most welcome, but keep it kind. If you see harassment, report the post or comment and use the ‚ÄúMessage the Mods‚Äù button with any background information, if you have it. Please do not engage. We will get to it as quickly as we can. 
* If you are not bipolar, you may want to visit r/BipolarSOs or related subreddits. This is not a place to discuss bipolar on behalf of someone else or seek opinions on whether someone else is bipolar. The one exception is if you have an urgent help question and need a fast answer (e.g., ‚ÄúMy SO is diagnosed bipolar and is currently psychotic, what do I do?‚Äù). 
* We don‚Äôt do memes, art or other popular media. Such posts will be removed. We are purely focused on support through discussion.",1609886701.0

I am now advocating for myself and contacting psychiatrists and therapists to maybe figure out if this is bipolar, but deep down because of the denial and responses I've received about my mental health, it has really made me disregard getting diagnosed and receiving proper help. I was wondering if there was anyone I could talk to about my symptoms and the many things I've been through so the experience of actually reaching out, isn't so scary as someone who's never been able to go through it ‚Äî as I have a deep fear of getting diagnosed due to my parents not approving, or not wanting me put on medication.

Just to specify, I have a psychiatric meeting on April 4th, so I want advice so I'm not utterly disregarded.

Been having lots of health issues and my only change was iron infusions which are done but made me feel very sick at the time. My pdoc said it shouldn‚Äôt be that.

So I am on quite a bit of medication 
Cymbalta 
Wellbutrin 
Kolonpin 
Lamictal 
Lithium
but we are going to start tapering  me off cymbalta and now I‚Äôm scared. She knows of my mixed states and hopes maybe it helps. Also does not think it‚Äôs the iron.


It has also been ever since I had Covid in October. My pdoc did say there have been many studies on Covid ramping up mania in bipolar patients again.

Every few weeks, now the last 3 days I feel like I‚Äôm withdrawing from my medication. I keep binge eating and sleeping because that is how I cope when I‚Äôve missed my meds for a day by accident.

I have my meds in holders extremely precise a month ahead of time to make sure my schedule is not off. I have been taking all the right meds, right times, but I feel they are not working and I‚Äôm in like a panic survival withdrawal state of food and exhaustion. I feel so out off it at work and talking with people and it‚Äôs scary. But I‚Äôm taking them! 

My doctor is so supportive but there‚Äôs like nothing I can do right now. It happens from time to time with me. 

I feel like I‚Äôm trying to do the right thing and take my meds, try and do what has to be done, but I feel in survival mode. Like my body is trying to find something yo fix it.

Shaking, sweating, trembling, sleeping, overeating. I‚Äôm anxiously trapped and idk when I will get back.

Has this happened to anyone? Has getting Covid affected anyones bipolar? Med withdrawal and mixed states at random but still on meds?

Hello everyone,

I am writing to you because I really need some help.

Please excuse me first of all because English is not my first language.

I am desperate, I am destroyed.

I am bipolar and borderline.

I am in a relationship with someone who was perfect for me at first and has since neglected me, disrespected me, ignored me, and blamed me for everything because of my disorder.

Before I met him, I had managed to rebuild myself, to go back to work after a 2.5 year break (I was diagnosed in 2019).

Since then, I have been living in hell.

He lived far away from me (950km/690miles) and we tried life together but that's when my disorder revealed itself.

He was constantly on the computer, talking down to me, having horrible outbursts and insulting me.

He even threatened to kill himself and jump off my balcony and I tried to hold him back and that's when I had my first ""boderline"" crisis where I started screaming in pain and wanting to end my life.

I called his parents to warn them of his actions and when they called, my boyfriend said everything was fine while I was crying in the back and they could hear me.

A lot of things happened and I asked him to go home (he lives with his parents).

Since then, it's been hot and cold between us.

One day I'm ""his Queen"", the next day he barely pays attention to me and when I criticize him for not even asking if I'm okay, he says ""because you think I'm your knight in shining armor?"" when for me it's the minimum for any social contact.

You should know that from the beginning of our relationship, I was threatened with a knife by one of his family members and insulted and had to have my throat cut while we were abroad in a remote place I didn't know.

His family consults a lot of medieums, psychics, card readers and all of them say that I am the devil and not made for their son while I have never shown anything but goodness, kindness and compassion despite what they made me go through (recently, I learned that they would be persuaded that I raped their son and that my first goal is to cut his throat while I have never raised my hand on someone).They even told me while her sister wanted to cut my thoart that it was ok because ""the devil is INSIDE HER' and so it means that it's not her fault and they didn't event ask if I was fine once ?!

Last week was the worst of all, I hurt myself, I hit my head multiple times during his present and I tore my face off + hit myself with an alter because I heard his parents on the phone saying again that I was going to cut his throat and he did nothing to stop it and instead he left when I could have killed myself.

I am stuck in this relationship, I don't know how to get out of it.

I feel like I can't see any way out because I feel like no one will want me because I'm ""crazy"" and I don't want to live with someone like him, nor do I want to start a family with him because of the principles he may have and his family (I can't tell you everything, but the story of the knife already tells you a lot)

I need help, my caregivers don't tell me anything, they listen to me and that's it.

No one understands me.

The more I talked to him about my illness and how to help me if I was neglected, the more he did nothing.

When we lived together and he insulted me, I took it upon myself at first and went to him with a big smile and hugged him as he pushed me hard and said ""YOU DISGUST ME!"" to then tell me ""sorry, I love you more than anything, you can't even imagine, I will never leave you alone again, I will do the work for both of us as you have done for the past 7 months, everything it's over I'm not going to abandon you anymore, it's up to me to make sure that you become again the one you were before my family and I broke you"" then suddenly it's ""you're responsible for everything, it's is because you are hypersensitive""

His family hates me because I'm ""too pretty, too nice, too cuddly to be true"" when I'm just me!

I can't take it anymore, yesterday and this morning I wanted to end it, I can't tell myself that I'm going to get out of this, I can't tell myself that I'm going to manage to escape of him because I'm hooked in spite of myself and I don't know why because we no longer live together and it's a daily suffering.

He's h24 on his computer, he just plays, he has nothing to talk about, we don't share anything anymore (he was different at first, it was amazing then he showed his face when he moved in with me).

I just asked him again if we could call because I need help because I'm in pain, I'm taking xanax for the first time in my life in addition to my usual treatments when I've always managed to do without (and even with that, it doesn't work)

I'm begging you, help me, advise me, I don't know, but I need help from people who understand me.Thank you very much",1679173576.0
15,When to go to hospital?,16,11ufddv,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/11ufddv/when_to_go_to_hospital/,20,"Anyone? I don‚Äôt know about this flair but I‚Äôm also not sure when to go to the hospital either and it‚Äôs been a few rough days. (Fuck it, really rough.) 

Backstory: In our late 20s, my very dear friend (later diagnosed bipolar) tried to kill one of our friends in a mania before being hospitalized. We saw him every day in the ward, packed up his possessions (with his permission) and moved him to an apartment nearby (by his request and of his choice). Six months later he self-deleted. It was devastating 

Less devastating (but distressing) is my own new bipolar diagnosis - 20 years later. I see myself in pain and cycling and hiding all the sharp things but I can‚Äôt gauge for myself and I can‚Äôt ask any one either. Also diagnosed with a major depressive order and in the midst of firestorm of bullies and assholes.

16,"i ruined my fucking life and i can't recover from it, i'm begging for advice because nothing's helped (tw; suicidal thought mention)",17,11uc73p,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/11uc73p/i_ruined_my_fucking_life_and_i_cant_recover_from/,19,"I am so sorry for even coming here with this. I feel so stuck and nothing I've tried to fix this problem has helped so I thought I'd go to people who may feel the same.

&#x200B;

I had a friend through high school and into adulthood that was my other half. Her and I did everything together and made it through some tough shit. I actually introduced her to her now-husband. She always kept crazy shit from me, but I'd find out and we'd discuss and all would be fine. She had mental health issues but nothing as wild as my bipolar and we supported each other well, or so I thought.

&#x200B;

Two years ago I had a really bad manic episode. I was paranoid everyone was out to get me, ran away from home, and ended up in a crisis unit for a week. During this time my friend was having a small dinner for her birthday with a few friends. I cancelled last minute but told her I'd come over to do something special with her when I was more mentally together. She said okay, all seemed well, and then the next day she left the group chat we were in together, and I never heard from her again. Another friend went for coffee with this friend about 8 months after this happened and got on the topic of how I'm doing. The friend that ghosted me said that I was too ""high maintenance"" and she didn't know how to bring it up to me. Okay, this is fine. I know I'm a lot to deal with, I get it.

&#x200B;

The problem I'm having is that I can't fucking move past this!! I've spent hours talking to my counsellor and my husband about this. I've done radical acceptance. I've journaled. I've written angry letters I don't send. I've poured my hurt into becoming a better person, and I know I am much more stable now. Nothing makes me feel better because I know I am the sole reason for this. It's affected all of my other relationships now, too. I can't make new friends or talk to my old ones because I panic and shut down, because everyone is going to find out about my bipolar. It'll be the same shit. I was a social person before this and now I want to fucking kill myself because I can't talk to anyone besides my husband without having a panic attack. I'm so hurt by the actions of someone else and nobody can fucking help me anymore and I can't do this I can't do this I can't do this

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thanks so much everyone. I read all of these messages and I've realized that it's thoroughly a ""me"" issue with how I see myself, not anything to do with the loss of the friendship. I carry a lot of self-hatred but cover it up well and I think this wounded my confidence, opening back up that tiny bit of self-hate I had into a big problem. It's hard to make new relationships when I can't even get the person closest to me (myself) to like me. I've connected with my therapist about it from this perspective and I hope it helps a bit. y'all are fantastic and I'm so grateful to be a part of this community. <3",1679107252.0

21,Discrimination by doctors: A shocking experience of a friend with Bipolar disorder,56,11toub4,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/11toub4/discrimination_by_doctors_a_shocking_experience/,67,"Hey, everyone. I wanted to share a story with you all that's been weighing heavily on me. My close friend, who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, has been living with me for over a year now, unable to work or take care of himself due to a host of physical symptoms. As his caretaker, I've been driving him to countless doctor appointments, but the response we've received has been nothing short of shocking.

Every time we've raised concerns about his physical symptoms like gastrointestinal pain, constipation, trouble breathing, dizziness, memory loss, dental issues, low testosterone, high cholesterol, erratic blood pressure, and more, we've been met with dismissive responses. Some doctors have even gone so far as to tell my friend that they can't help ""people like him"" and have attributed all his symptoms to his bipolar diagnosis.

It's been disheartening and frustrating, to say the least. I've written multiple complaints to the doctors, but they refuse to acknowledge their mistake. 

Finally, after a long and arduous process, they've started to find some things wrong with him, such as a fungal infection, gastritis, colitis, nerve damage, and more. But it's taken a toll on my friend's life and financial situation. He's lost his job, has at least 50 open medical bills, and is even getting sued by the doctors who refused to treat him.

I'm at a loss for words and incredibly angry about this whole situation. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Can bipolar disorder really be the cause of all my friend's physical symptoms? And is there anything we can do about this discrimination? I'd love to hold those doctors accountable for their actions. Is there any legal way to do that?

Update: I want to thank everyone for your well thought out responses, your advice and for sharing your own stories. It's disheartening to see how many people have been through similar experiences.

There‚Äôs so much more to my friend's story, and the last year has been an absolute nightmare for both of us.
About a year ago, I took my friend to see a neurologist hoping that he would take his symptoms seriously and refer him to a hospital to have everything thoroughly checked out. Although the neurologist wasn't the best choice, he was the only doctor who knew the full story. Prior to this, I had also made an appointment with my friend's family doctor, but unfortunately, he never showed up, and a nurse informed us that he couldn't give him a referral.

The neurologist sent my friend to a mental hospital, claiming that he was making up his symptoms. Unfortunately, nothing was done to help him in the following three months, and his symptoms worsened. Other doctors immediately dismissed him after seeing the psychiatry papers. After countless appointments, emergency room visits, and ambulance calls, I was finally able to find a physician who took my friend's symptoms seriously and was able to help with some of his health problems. 

The doctor also suspects that my friend might have a heavy metal poisoning from his work which would explain a lot. He even thinks that the bipolar disorder might‚Äôve been a misdiagnosis all together. We‚Äôre waiting for test results right now. However, at this point, my friend has lost his job and will probably never be able to work again. He is depressed, in debt, and being sued by medical professionals. It breaks my heart to see him like this, and I want to seek justice.

I wasn't planning on sharing this, but I started a GoFundMe page for my friend. If you're interested in contributing or sharing it, please PM me for the link. I'm struggling to provide my friend with the financial support he needs, and I can't do it alone.
I'm also determined to find a good lawyer to hold the doctors accountable for their actions. Although I know it won't be easy, I've documented everything that happened, and I believe I have a good case. As someone who isn't well-connected to the mental health advocacy community, I'm not sure who to turn to for help, so any advice or assistance would be appreciated. 

Both my friend and I are private people, and we don't really care for the story going viral, but we do want to raise awareness of the reality of what's happening.

Thank you for reading. I've provided more details in the comments section. However, there is too much to fit into one Reddit post.",1679053797.0

This is really just a rant since I have no one to talk to and I'm tired of emotion dumping on the couple friends i have left.

My mom let's me use her extra car that she told me she'd give me but changes her mind every other week or when shes angry. Shes let me live with her and help out with the house for some years not but shes tired of me and how I cant ever finish what I start. Or how I hyperfixate on things but haven't made any money.  She gets verbally and emotionally abusive towards me and in the past when this happens I leave but now I have no where to. This week I've been taking the car and doing everything I can to make some progress. I even made an appointment with a new therapist and filled out job applications.

Before that it was either really depressed and a bit of mixed and latest major hypomanic episode in summer 2021. 

So it had been a while and the thing is, I'm still very slow and sleep a lot, but compared to before when I slept 10-12 hours a night every 24h now I still sleep 10-12h but  I stay awake 24h+ multiple times a week.

Last friday I went to my psychiatrist and he asked me if I had any hints of impulsivity that could indicate hypomania, specifically spznding, sex and substance abuse (ya know the usual menu).
And I thought about it for a moment (in retrospect I was making up excuses that would make things logical) and then said no, just spending but for necessary stuff.

And here I am exactly a week later, wearing one of my two new wigs that arrived from aliexpress yesterday (I had only bought one super cheap one before), been smoking weed since monday and unpacking my new dildo in my newly fairyland garden themed decorated kitchen. Oh also received 150 bucks worth of beauty products (I've never done skincare before in my life except sheet masks and face creams from aldi).
For clarification I bought it all before seeing my psychiatrist and smoking again.

How could I not see it???

I have bipolar and BPD and have noticed something coming up that I'm not sure how to approach. Running long distances has always been my medicine/highlight of my day but for the past year or so it seems to be having the opposite effect.

When I start running daily, the runs turn on my fight or flight and seem to trigger my mental illness. During my run I get in this thought spiral of pure rage. I text people things I shouldn't text and start aggressively running and lashing out at people who run too close to me or are in my way. I come to conclusions on my run that the only thing to help my irritability is relapsing on drugs or suicide.

There are a lot of things that come with bipolar disorder. But hypersexuality is One of the more taboo issues that people with bipolar disorder deal with.

When it comes to bipolar, we are all different. No one person has any answer that will make it better or give someone who does not struggle with the illness an understanding of the why. All I can do is talk about what happens with me, hoping that others can relate and feel less alone.

Okay, I know for many people that sex can be a majorly taboo subject, but I am going to talk about it anyway. I am going to try to discuss my own experience as my bipolar has taken a hyper-sexual swing these past few days.

It‚Äôs really hard to describe what it‚Äôs like to be hypersexual to people who haven‚Äôt experienced it. In my experience, it‚Äôs the sensual feeling that envelops me and causes me to put my make up on. Wear underwear I feel sexy in. Take more time doing my hair, Wear My perfume until just my smell entices others. but it‚Äôs not about the end result that causes my bipolar mind to self-indulge and my mania to rise. It‚Äôs the extreme need to be desired. It‚Äôs my sexual fantasies that swirl round my head the excitement within and the enticing need to be attracted is the high that keeps giving.

You see when I‚Äôm hypersexual, it‚Äôs fun at the start. My sexual senses are heightened so intensely that just a touch can make every hair on my body stand on end. When in the presence of someone I find attractive is enough to make my groin stir and give me sexual flutters. When I do indulge in sex its euphoric. My sensitivity makes each climax so intense, powerful and electrifying my whole body trembles and shakes it takes my breath away.

But then comes the other part of my
hypersexuality. The worst part about my hypersexuality is I‚Äôm never satisfied. I have to actively resist the overwhelming urge and resist the temptation to go look for sex to satisfy my craving. I fight hard to stay in control as the thoughts take over my entire brain. Consuming me I cant think of anything else.

Imagine you have an itch on your back you can‚Äôt quite reach. But the itch is so bad its impossible to ignore. You try to reach to satisfy this itch but you can‚Äôt quite get to it. When you eventually get to scratch, it feels better right? But a few moments later that itch is back. Frustrating isn‚Äôt it? That‚Äôs how hypersexuality is for me. No matter how many times I satisfy my urge no matter how many times I reach orgasm, moments later my hypersexuality itch is back.

All the feelings I first enjoyed now consume me, frustrate me and I will them to go away. The feeling of my groin stirring is now a physical ache pulsating so overpowering it is hard to ignore. The sexual fantasies that swirled round my head taken over with thoughts of how I can get my next fix. The euphoric feeling of orgasm gone replaced with sexual frustration as no matter how good the sex i just can‚Äôt satisfy my cravings enough to take the ache away. The more orgasms I have the more lost I become in needing them, an addiction I need to feed.

I know it will pass eventually. For me hypersexuality is not one of my symptoms that I suffer with frequently. I don‚Äôt know why the symptom suddenly appears out of nowhere. I have no trigger no warning it‚Äôs just there. All I can do is keep reminding myself, reassuring myself this is not me. This is my bipolar.",1679007054.0

I‚Äôve spent a good chunk of my adult life as a pretty highly educated/sought after mental health professional. I don‚Äôt say that because I think I‚Äôm special, but because right now it‚Äôs a big part of my negative thought process about all this. ‚ÄúI should have known,‚Äù etc. I fight stigma in my work daily and have spent years moving so far away from the medical model in my work. 

I‚Äôve had other diagnoses that were easier to brush off as slight extremes of normal human stuff (MDD, ADHD, anxiety, and so on). 

Now I‚Äôm living This. Serious Mental Illness. 

The doc was so kind (vs the dozen or so others I‚Äôve seen before‚Äîshe spent over 45min with me and I told it All, for the first time‚ÄîAll of it.) She asked me to look at info about lamictal and lithium then come back when I‚Äôm ready. I can‚Äôt even read the pubmed articles through tears most of the time. 

Most shocking is that while coworkers might be surprised by this diagnosis, as I feel I‚Äôve ‚Äúmasked‚Äù (not coped) ok till the last few - years? ‚Ä¶my immediate family is like ‚ÄúOh ya, that sounds right.‚Äù  They thought this the whole time?!!!!

I‚Äôm so afraid. I know firsthand the stigma that doctors and therapists and certainly the public *can* have. I‚Äôve read allll the books (for patients), I know a lot on the academic front, but all that is out the window right now. I know it‚Äôs hypocritical.

I was expecting maybe cyclothymia or just another MDD diagnosis. 

I‚Äôm just so floored. 

I‚Äôve put my spouse through so much. I want to stop the inter generational trauma cycle for my young kids. 

All I can find and am hearing are these awful stories about bipolar moms hitting their kids. Not being able to work. Financial ruin. Loss of the good parts that come with that mania and Hypomania. 

I feel like I can‚Äôt breathe when I think about my future. 

I know all the things I‚Äôm supposed to say‚Ä¶to Other People. 

I don‚Äôt know what this means for my life at all. It all seems so bleak. The divorce rate, the way I grew up being repeated for my kids, whom I of course adore. The ‚Äúanswer‚Äù being meds that cause horrendous side effects. 

I‚Äôm so fucking scared. I feel I can‚Äôt tell anyone but my family. I know this doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense I just need to tell someone.

I received a bipolar II diagnosis on Monday from my psychiatrist as well as a prescription for Geodon (ziprasidone). This diagnosis came out of thin air for me. I experienced a jarring hypomanic episode a few weeks ago, which served as the ultimate means for my diagnosis. I am, frankly, very scared about this entire thing.

I've had MDD since I was a child (diagnosed at 6) as well as a general anxiety (diagnosed at 14). These have been my normal for so long. I didn't try to, but I think part of my identity has been formed around being sad and neurotic. This is who I am, who I always have been. And suddenly, it's not anymore. Now I have this other disorder that's somehow so much more severe and stigmatized, even in my own mind. Everywhere in my life - family, friends, acquaintances - people around me see and treat people with bipolar disorder as crazy and unstable. I know this is untrue. I just don't know where to turn.

I know this is not my first hypomanic episode. I can pinpoint times in the past five years where I've been completely out of control for weeks on end, only to stop and spiral back into horrible depressive episodes. But I was never happy and hypomanic at the same time, so it wasn't enough for me to realize something was up. It was only when my mood was elevated as well that I realized something was wrong, likely due to the time spend living with depression. 

There is one thing that's been ripping me apart with all this - the medication. For background, when I was put on my first antidepressant at 14 (citalopram), it triggered some kind of episode, something I hesitate to give a label to because it was so devastating. I was depressed and highly suicidal when I began the medication, but over the course of the few months I took it, my moods became irregular and intense, my appetite completely disappeared (I was eating around 600 calories a day, rapidly losing weight, could only stomach Clif bars), and I lashed out against my friends and family on a daily basis. The doctor raised my dosage, and everything got worse. I was hospitalized days before I could enact a suicide plan and was taken off the medication immediately. 

I have been on three different antidepressants since then, and am still on one because it seems to be working well for me. The only adverse reaction I've had to a medication since then has been dissociation and overall spaciness, but that was comparatively very manageable. I've seen multiple therapists over the years, unpacked this incident with almost all of them, and yet, as soon as I took my first dose of Geodon last night, I had a panic attack. 

I don't know what this new medication will do to me. There's a good chance I will only see improvements, but I am still very scared. And it's not just the medication that's freaking me out - having ""bipolar"" attached to my identity is going to take a lot of getting used to. I have a horrible, sinking feeling that I'm getting worse somehow, that this diagnosis only came about because my depression is worsening. But I've likely always been bipolar. That thought scares me, too.

I am just scared and nobody around me seems to know anything about the disorder. I like to think I'm fairly educated on it, but I feel like I don't have anyone to reach out to or discuss it with in depth.

He interviewed me, I was transparent about my family‚Äôs concerns and went in depth about my history and anything that may be an indication. (2 abortions within a year, toxic relationships- one man being twice my age. He concluded that I was fine and did not need a formal evaluation- stated I am young (22) and naive and have been in college and graduated during Covid. Everyone makes mistakes/live and learn. 
The second person is also a professional and spoke with me and concluded the same after our conversation- again, i was very transparent. However, she actually performed testing and a psychological evaluation. It shows that I am ‚Äúindeed bipolar 2 and have ptsd‚Äù. She said everything in the report indicates that I definitely am bipolar 2.  
The last person, I psychologist prescribed me with Lexapro (SSRI) but concluded that she does not believe I am bipolar. She believes it may be depression and anxiety. She said that the medication would have pushed me into a manic episode if I were bipolar. 
I decided to start meds and ‚Äúprioritize my Kendal health‚Äù. I made it up to 20 mg and was on that dosage for about 3 weeks. I stopped taking the medication. While on it, I did seem (according to my family and boyfriend) more ‚Äústable‚Äù, less bothered, less irritable, calmed, able to shrug things off more easily, more in control of my emotions, etc. Since coming off of them, I have felt fine and good. I have admittedly been more up and down and emotional than when I was taking the medication. 
I‚Äôve been spending more money lately, been more social, and more creatively inspired. However, I don‚Äôt consider this to be part of an ‚Äúepisode‚Äù. I genuinely feel that my life is going very well at the moment and I am just happy.

This facility doesn't prescribe controlled substances.

I've relied on anti-psychotics to work for both mood and insomnia. Right now I'm taking 100 mg thorazine/remeron 15mg. I have been at the same dose for three years and last November my sleep has been declining. I asked my psych nurse if she could increase my thorazine and she told me that I risk getting  tardive dyskinesia if we do. Her suggestion was to get me off the antipsychotic and put me back on trazadone. I told her that stuff worked over 20 years ago. A week being off my anti-psychotic made me want to commit a felony and I put myself back on it and stopped the trazadone.

My psych nurse left the company and the new nurse that took my case looked at my meds and then decided to take me off the remeron and said let's decrease your thorazine, but if you still have trouble sleeping take your reg dose. All my meds were fine except my sleep and still nothing was given to me. I do not see her for another three months.

The last week has been so bad that I went to the ER. The ER prescribed hydroxizine 100 mg. Went home and took the recommended dose and it didn't do anything so I went back to the ER and he said take 200 mgs. That didn't do anything except make me dizzy, drowzy (but cannot close my eyes) and gave me one hell of a headache. 

Today I was able to see my primary and I asked her about something for sleep. She told me about melatonin (lmao) She said that since I am taking so many mental health meds that whatever she prescribes will interfere with my meds and to talk to their psych. WTF??

When I saw my therapist last week she didn't think it was a big deal that I haven't been sleeping. In fact it seems no one seems to think it's worrisome. 

If this keeps up for another week, I have no other choice but to check myself in. 

Any suggestions for a non controlled substance?",1679000751.0
68,bipolar is weird sometimes,74,11sfx7w,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/11sfx7w/bipolar_is_weird_sometimes/,26,"Bipolar is weird, sometimes you cry waterfalls literally all the time, sometimes you can‚Äôt ever remember feeling sad.

Sometimes you can‚Äôt stop talking and sometimes you don‚Äôt get out of bed for two months and can‚Äôt even face another human, let alone talk to one.
Sometimes you spend loads of money online, run 10k then clean your whole house in the middle of the night; while reading two books, doing an online course and speaking to 4 friends at once.

Then sometimes you dramatically and suddenly run out of energy, positivity and the will to live and you legit cry for 20 minutes on the kitchen floor because you ran out of washing powder and can‚Äôt even do that right.
You regularly entertain the fleeting thought, for just a moment, that you should give up and end it all over minor disruptions and conflict. You‚Äôve probably tried to end it all at least once.
Music gives you goosebumps, the views on a walk/drive make you cry. Other peoples pain makes your soul hurt while disapproval from others leaves you physically ill and broken up inside.

Sex with you is intense and frequent, other people can‚Äôt keep up. Your heart wants to burst when you see someone that you love and you have friends coming out of your ears because you overshare and people find you exciting when you‚Äôre manic.

Adventure is your middle name and experiencing beauty is your mission.

You‚Äôve written poems, made art, written diaries, played instruments, taken drugs; anything to express and explain the insurmountable overflow of pure feeling that you experience on a daily basis.

You‚Äôre never sure what the right choice is, you struggle with boundaries. You live in fear of psychosis, of depression, of mania. Waiting irritates you, boring people irritate you, routine irritates you, rudeness irritates you. You have periods of intense activity and suddenly periods of sleeping .All of The. Time.

The whole time this is going on some people run away from your behaviour some people just avoid the whole diagnosis not many people understand it. You dont understand it. Everybody has their opinion on why you are like you are, what you should do about it and when you should do it. Or they patronise your disease as if it is a recurring cold that might pop up from time to time; not a daily struggle against a severe strain of influenza of the mind, behaviour and personality.

You have to talk to people that you don‚Äôt know a million times over about what‚Äôs in your head, if you‚Äôre even lucky enough to get counselling, and everybody in your life knows how weird you are because they‚Äôve probably all seen you do some odd shit or be totally broken at some point in your life.

You can‚Äôt work full time even though you want to because you can‚Äôt regulate yourself long enough to get anywhere with a career, a relationship, a hobby. You‚Äôre on a constant rollercoaster of ups and downs that come out of nowhere.

Sometimes you get these weird five minutes, usually when you‚Äôre tired, where you feel like you might not even exist and nothing is real and you dont know if you‚Äôre crazy or not and it unsettles you for ages.
Then some days you feel like you made it all up and there‚Äôs absoloutly nothing wrong with you at all and never has been.


You‚Äôre trying to be a functioning adult, pay bills and maintain social relationships. All the time knowing that it is never going to get better and one day the medication might not work anymore. Said medication that works probably took you ten years and countless other trials to find; years of side effects, weight gain, sleepless nights, sexual dysfunction, hand tremors, dry mouth.

You‚Äôve probably been hospitalised at some point and felt how it feels to very publicly lose your dignity, your independence, your freedom and your mind.

You want to give up sometimes but you don‚Äôt, you won‚Äôt, or maybe you have and it didn‚Äôt work.

Sometimes you hate this irrational disease of disregulation and sometimes you embrace the terror and unpredictability because of the pure beauty and magic it makes you feel in your soul, like a secret that only a few others are in on.

Recently I started vaping and stopped smoking, mostly because vape tastes like candy and I just liked that, but also because I got a lot of pressure from my bf. 

The thing is, I quit 8 days ago, and can‚Äôt smoke cigarettes anymore. I can‚Äôt stand the taste or the feel it gives me. Now, we are talking about something I used to LOVE, even though it wasn‚Äôt good for me. No one understands when I say I‚Äôm grieving hard for the loss of ‚Äúa friend‚Äù and I‚Äôm thinking it must me part of bipolar or BPD.

There were almost 100 responses!!!  Definitely many repeats, but far more examples than what I see on similar questions for Bipolar disorder.  It is interesting to contemplate what Hollywood finds more alluring in a character with BPD versus Bipolar.  They are both such disabling disorders, but I think *accurate* and *positive* portrayals can do a lot of good.  Even if they don't officially own the label, just having someone for the community to point to when we are trying to describe our experiences can be so helpful.

Over all, it‚Äôs worked wonders, however, I‚Äôve had mini episodes while on it occasionally through the years. And it‚Äôs happening again‚Ä¶..

Before I get started, I‚Äôm going to try and do my best not to ramble, which is REALLY difficult when manic. I thank whoever in advance who reads this or responds.

A few days ago, I woke up early (for me anyway) and felt happy, inspired, chatty and motivated. 

I cleaned the garbage from my car, which I consider a feat since I haven‚Äôt cleaned it out since the fall of last year.

Then, I began running all over town to get cool local postcards for my friends and family (I moved recently). I felt this longing for connection and to express appreciation and love.

It was towards the end of the night that I noticed (and was also pointed out to me) that I was talking really fast, and I felt I was unfocused and scattered.

I realized I was at the very least, hypomanic.

I have varying doses of Abilify handy, so I added 5MGS to my 20MGS.

The following day or so, I felt less hyper and caught up on sleep. I thought I was in the clear. 

Until today. I woke up early again, and after running an errand, was driving home and was for no reason, in a rage. Everything was irritating me. 

I was really on the fence about calling my psychiatrist, for a number of reasons:

1. Even for an emergency, it can take at least a week to get an appointment.

2. I don‚Äôt have insurance right now and am paying out of pocket and was debating if this was worth it. I can barely afford the every 3 month appointments.

3. In the past, when I‚Äôve become hypomanic/manic while on Abilify, my psychiatrist tends to panic. After my Grandmothers death a while back, I was in a bad place and she prescribed Lithium, which scares the hell out of me. I never took it, but yeah, I‚Äôm scared she may throw out something really bizarre or mess with the regimen that overall, seems to work. 

I called a mental health hotline and kept getting redirected, which just frustrated me even more. 

I did this because I am scared, I don‚Äôt want to completely lose control like I have before Abilify. I also tend to annoy people with my problems and behavior when manic. I felt like talking to a stranger would be better.

After getting nowhere with the hotlines, I finally decided to bite the bullet and called my clinic. Miraculously, I got an emergency appointment for this Friday, not what I was expecting.

I have 30MGS (the maximum dosage) of Abilify and feel like I should take it tonight, so I can come down a bit and hopefully avoid being hospitalized or doing something destructive. I can tell my behavior is bizarre, and I feel so embarrassed üòû

I only have ‚Äúquick flashes‚Äù of hypomania/depression. Makes me question my diagnosis when my better judgement tells me that I do have this disorder. Should I be worried?

I was officially diagnosed with bipolar disorder in December 2021. Leading up to/since the diagnosis I have had several periods of depression, severe depression, and hypomania & two manic episodes.

I was prescribed Depakote in 2021 in addition to  the Risperdal and Lexapro I had already been taking. I took it from 12/2021 to 4/2022, when I started taking Adderall. I felt great and the Adderall helped motivate me to go to the gym and stop eating (allowing me to lose the ~30lbs I had put on because of the Depakote). What I did not know is that I was hypomanic on the Adderall. I was taking summer classes.

The hypomania lasted from about April ‚Äò22 to July ‚Äò22, when I became SUPER depressed for the entire month and stopped taking it. I had also started smoking weed during the summer (after ~6 months of sobriety) and quickly became a 24/7 stoner. I started taking it again in August ‚Äò22 and had my most severe psychotic manic episode in October. It really scared my parents. I still feel bad about it.

I stopped the Lexapro, started taking my bipolar meds again, and my pdoc took me off of Adderall. We tried Wellbutrin which did absolutely nothing. I also gained about 20lbs.

I tried Focalin in January and it went well but my pdoc switched to Vyvanse because it was stronger than Focalin but weaker than Adderall. It has been a God send.

What I‚Äôm worried about, though, is this:

I haven‚Äôt taken my Depakote or Risperdal since early January and have only been on Vyvanse. No one else (my family, my pdoc)knows this. I do not ‚Äúfeel‚Äù hypomanic but every once in a while I will catch myself talking out loud to myself again, being obsessive (i.e. checking to see if I locked my bedroom door a million times, sometimes walking a good distance back to make sure), and being highly suspicious. This is all worse when I drink coffee when the Vyvanse is active in my system.

I also have intermittent depression. I have been able to pull myself out of it but I‚Äôll be damned if it doesn‚Äôt feel like a flashback to the days when I would cry, stay in bed all day, and berate myself 24/7.

I feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù otherwise. My parents have always and continue to disagree with my diagnosis as well as ask, ‚ÄúSo how much longer are you gonna be on those medications?‚Äù but my pdoc, as well as another pdoc I went to in January 2022, have both told me I have bipolar disorder. 

Honestly that diagnosis makes sense to me but in times like this, when I haven‚Äôt taken my bipolar meds in months and have not fully gone off the deep end, I wonder. I really don‚Äôt like my bipolar medications because they make me gain weight. I have tried Latuda, Seroquel, and one other one, and Depakote is the only one that doesn‚Äôt have any intense side effects.

Should I be worried?",1678857506.0

I was prescribed by my psychiatrist Geodon (40mg to take at night). I‚Äôve been on it for about a week so I‚Äôm not sure if it is fully in my system. 

This past Sunday, I was walking down the hallway of my apartment complex and all of a sudden I got very dizzy, tunnel vision, my jaw clenched, and my heart racing (what felt like 180-200 but I couldn‚Äôt tell in the moment).

I almost passed out and got help. I took an ativan to calm down, but ended up vomiting for 2-3 hours while my heart was just fluctuating up to what seemed like unsafe levels. I would get ice cold, except in my chest. It took me about 2-3 hours to come down off this episode.

This felt very different than any other panic attack I‚Äôve had. It definitely didn‚Äôt ‚Äúfeel‚Äù like a panic episode, although I was definitely panicked about feeling like I was going to die.

Has anyone had experience with this on Geodon? I know that‚Äôs a broad question. After calling my psychiatrist the day after, he was very dismissive and told me stop taking it, see a cardiologist, and just basically hung up on me. I‚Äôm trying to get into my primary care doctor soon, but reaching out this community for some moral support.

I have so much more backstory to this but ultimately, I just needed to vent or whatever. I thought I had a support system (kind of) and I had friends before I got married and had kids, now my friends are all digital, pretend or gone. 

I contacted an agency yesterday and asked what resources are covered under my insurance but my address was not updated so I have a whole new step to overcome before I can get help. They said they‚Äôd assign me a care coordinator.

I am 29 now.
End of 2021 I lost my job to bipolar, it was traumatic, embarrassing, and devastating. Had to move from a beautiful place I loved (the redwoods) and lived for 8 years‚Ä¶ back in with my parents.
2022 New Year‚Äôs Day I had another attempt. A friend reacted badly to it which ended in a terrible fallout. The year was horrible. I tried to work but would be panicking or sweating too much (thanks Wellbutrin) and overwhelmed. 
I was rapid cycling the entire year. Crashed my car. Called suicide hotline many times. Days were slow and excruciating.
It all came to a head September 2022. A manic episode ended me feeling suicidal so then came a traumatizing hospital stay of 14 days. I felt unsafe bc a man who would play with himself in front of us came into my room at 3am, I awoke to him standing over me.
The hospital gave me Lithium and Geodon. I was extremely fatigued which led to me diagnosed with Hypothyroid.
I was bedridden for months. I gained weight from antipsychotics over the years, then hypothyroidism made it worse. I‚Äôm 214 pounds and I hate myself. I used to be gorgeous and had constant attention. Now I‚Äôm frumpy and ugly. 

Anyways, finally  I felt better. Meanwhile, I grew close with a guy I met online. We became boyfriend/girlfriend and He came and visited me . We made it official. My moods were stable, I had hope. 
Long story short we decided to move together from California to Eastern Pennsylvania. We had a free place to stay and I thought I needed a change. 
We drove cross country with my animals and did it.
Stability is fleeting.
I am very depressed. Not so bad that I‚Äôm sobbing in pain and suicidal constantly, but still had. Constant anxiety. I can‚Äôt work. Also turned out I have a mass inside my body and need surgery next week. My mom is coming out to help. I will sob when she is gone. 
It‚Äôs very ugly here, trash everywhere. The pretty woodland trails are 30min away and sometimes I‚Äôm too depressed and short on gas to go.
My boyfriend and I are good but we argue sometimes. I miss him when he‚Äôs working and love him. But I feel so depressed I look at him sometimes and feel nothing. Idk if it‚Äôs him or me.
I can‚Äôt go back now. No friends but I have an aunt and cousin an hour away. They are busy though.

I work in a very demanding, very complex job and due to recent events it's become more stressful the last 3 or so months. I get paid well enough, but we have some debt I'm slowly trying to pay off (surprisingly no fault of mine). My wife works part time so that helps, and we have 4 kids and things are usually good. Lately, due to added work stress and just having Bipolar disorder I've fallen into depression and had to recently take a week off FMLA.

My sister, who has a great relationship with my wife, recently received a rather large tax return of over 10 grand. They've decided to take it to California for a week and take their 5 kids to all the theme parks. I figure they'll spend most if not all, but to each their own.

They invited us, which was nice, but I politely declined. My kids were told of the trip so I'm a bad guy right now. I told my wife we don't have the money and are trying to pay off debt and not create more. Next, my wife came to me with an idea that my sister came up with that just my wife and the kids would go. I politely explained they're missing the point. Then my sister said she would take my 2 oldest daughters because they can help with her smaller kids. I said that's fine if you want to pay for it. 

I love my sister. She can be a bit manipulative sometimes. I was just about ready to get off an extra stressful day of work today and my wife came into our office and says that my sister asked if we can pay for the theme parks for my 2 daughters. My girls are very excited, but it's a lot of money still. I'm an even bigger bad guy now because I said no.

A few minutes ago, my wife came in and asked if I would ever consider getting a 2nd job. I'm depressed, stressed due to my current job, I'm the worst Dad ever, or so I'm told by 2 preteens, and I'm fucking Bipolar 1. Do I sound like the guy who needs a 2nd job right now?

I didn't raise my voice and kept all the profanity to the voices in my head. I just asked her how I would do working 2 jobs and how she thought that would work out. She knows that I'm depressive and about my job.

So I've had two distinct episodes since I developed bipolar disorder at age 15. I'm now 19. 
The first one, was unlike anything I've ever experienced. Colors were more vivid, music was so beautiful, and profound.
I remember feeling so euphoric, and I remember appreciating the beauty of nature. The cold, morning air on my skin.  The beauty of the country side, and I remember feeling pure bliss. As the episode progressed, I felt like I was having profound experiences, just from daily occurrences.
Music spoke to me, and everything made sense, in a way that allowed me to see past my own experiences. My mind was working in overdrive to try and make sense or whatever that feeling of profoundness was, so I saw patterns in everything.
I was analyzing everything, a cup of coffee wasn't a cup of coffee, it was me waking up and staring the day, it had significance because I felt more alert, more *alive*. Almost as if the coffee itself, were breathing fresh air into me itself. 
As you can tell, that was a rather bizarre way of thinking.  It still left an impact on me.

After 4 days with little sleep, I remember drinking a cup of coffee, I remember listening to music while laying down, and relaxing. The song I was listening to resonated with me,it was so beautiful that I started crying. I rolled over, looked at the ceiling fan, and saw something. It looked like letters, from the page of a book, repeating in sequence. I didn't know what it meant, and I knew it was because I was sick.

I thought about *why* it happened, not just in the terms of being sick or not sick, but something about it just made sense.

Every since then, I have had a more serious appreciation for music, and take self reflection more seriously. I was 17 then. I then had the most severe depression I've ever had, for about 5 weeks afterwards.
I was essentially a vegetable,  could barely formulate a sentence, and couldn't understand my own thoughts.

I can express myself better, simply because I know what it's like to relate two things together, to *understand* why they happen. I did x, because y affects my in z ways.

As for the second one, it was manic episode I had last year.
It lasted roughly months , it was nasty. Nearly costed me my life.  When I was released from the hospital, I really wasn't better, I was just more aware of how sick I was. I tried to use religion to cope, and went from wanting to incorporate the principles of Buddhism into my life, to thinking I was the antichrist , and taming squirrels because the devil was giving me a sign.

I now have a newfound appreciation for the idea of faith, and incorporate it into my patterns of thought, so I can allow myself to not stress about things that are beyond my control. Albeit, I'm an atheist still. It's more of the idea of placing my worries into a place that allows me to not allow them to affect me. It allows for me to not stress over everything, and allows me to learn from my mistakes, rather than catastrophizing over them.




Overall, these episodes give me perspective, and have made a huge impact on my road to recovery.

I'm talking doing EVERYTHING to get them, changing your whole personality and things you do to get them to like you, and thinking the whole day of how you're gonna get that person. 
I was thinking these obsessive crushes could be part of of the extreme goal oriented behaviour: the crushes would have been there without the hypomania but you wouldn't have done or changed as many things to get that person without the episode. I know it's normal to to a certain extent change things to get your crush to like you, but I'm talking about a dysfunctional level of this behaviour. 
I remember getting annoyed when I had to think about anyone else but this guy, changing my looks, music taste,  interests all to try and get him.

This includes hygiene, sleep schedule. I'm worried not having a set routine will ruin my physical let alone mental health, and I don't want to end up with problems (bad heart disease or diabetes, or major dental problems) down the road. I'm in my 30s now, so I want to take action before it's too late.

During the height of the pandemic I lived with my parents, which was low stress for me, and I got my life together a lot. That also included applying to PhD programs and I got into one, and am there now. I had posted earlier about keeping a non-negotiable routine while here, so I can have some regularity to my mornings and nights, and get good sleep. But now I find that my stress levels are high in general being in this program, and it's hard for me. I want to stick with it, and I have 5 more years to go, but I want to put my well-being first too.

So my question is: how do some of you hold yourselves accountable daily to doing your routine for the sake of your stability, but also have some room for flexibility so you're not locked in all day? What kind of boundaries do you set with others? I'm a music PhD and sometimes do/attend shows that end close to my bedtime, and people will ask me to mingle or hang afterward.

The problem is, it‚Äôs really hard to treat. Considering that ADHD treatment runs counter to bipolar treatment.

Some docs are ok to use stims with bipolar but it‚Äôs rare and only happens if you have a longish working relationship. In Canada a regular psychiatrist is a lot harder to find. Instead they do one time consults and have GPs manage long term.

While I‚Äôm on modafinil.

I have been told to careful when going for any sort of inpatient consults or one time consults for bipolar. As any doc who does this will likely be required to recommend the ceasing of stims due to manic potential.

If your being treated by a GP, the GP will be required to follow this and remove them.

My longest hospitalization was definitely for a mixed episode.  After months of stablity, I woke up one morning and thought, ""I would rather kms than get ready for work."".  It was just a thought, but within three days it was all I could think about.  I booked in an appt with my psychiatrist and my psychologist, but since I had been stable for so long, they didn't rush me in and the apps weren't for a week.  I stopped my medication because I knew that it made it harder to wake up in the morning, so I thought if I just stopped it for a few days I would be able to wake up easier.  Then, the morning of my appt with my therapist, I attempted to kms, but I stopped.  I wasn't at all depressed, not even a bit, but I felt like I had to die.  When my therapist asked if I was safe, I was all, ""Yup!"" and then told them how I stopped myself from kms mid-attempt that morning, because to me, that was proof that I wasn't truly going to go through with anything, although I wanted to do so.  My therapist disagreed, and badaboom, badabing, I was in the hospital for the next couple of months.  


The ER doctors kept disagreeing with me about being depressed.  They kept thinking I must have been depressed since I was planning on kms, but I was like, ""Uh Nope, feeling good, just need to die.""  Once I was admitted and was medicated, I crashed into depression.  It was awful because I felt like I went into the hospital feeling good, and then they made me sick. It made it hard to trust anyone.

That led me to get diagnosed. After a rather intense love triangle blew up in my face I spiraled into a mixed episode that shifted into a depressive episode as I got meds figured out. I am now pretty much stable (still dealing with distractibility and obsessive thinking, but mood is good). When I was hypomanic, I also had a really high sex drive. I was nearly always in the mood, increased stamina, kinky, and everything just felt very intense and rewarding. 

Anyways I kind of came to the realization the other day that my sex drive has been nonexistent since I got medicated. I can still enjoy stimulation, but there's no anticipation or arousal, I don't last nearly as long, and the whole experience is pretty underwhelming. At first I wondered it was a side effect of the meds, but after further thought I've realized this is probably pretty close to my pre-episode baseline. 

All that to say I'm pretty upset by this. I really enjoyed the heightened sexuality and I'm thinking about how this will impact my future relationships (never been in one btw).

I say fairly new because I've been here 1 and a half years, but everyone from the top down says it's such a complex job I'll be the new guy for 4-5 years. 

So I'm working on a project and my coach is helping me. It's something neither of us have done because it's a new system and my project is the first time using it so nobody on the team has experience with it. My coach thinks she's figured it out and says now just input all the numbers and leaves me to it. She was wrong, and I spent 2 days on it and it was all wrong. So my manager reviews it and calls me in to tell me it's all wrong and how we're going to have to move the due date and go over the hours allotted to the assignment. Plus, my coach did one spreadsheet while I was watching and apparently left out 2 whole sections that made me look like an idiot. I could have thrown my coach under the bus, but I'm better than that.

Now they feel like I need more one on one help so instead of telecommuting all but one day a week I now have to come in 3 days a week. It messes with getting my kids to school, basketball and soccer practice, and so on.

I'm medicated, and it controls the intensity of my moods - no severe can't hardly move depression, no lots of unrealistic plans hypomania.

I'm not ok. I'm somewhat functional - I can exercise and eat ok, but basic self-care and care of my immediate environment is lacking (especially the latter).

My main unhealthy coping mechanism is to imagine not being alive. After conversations with my psychiatrists over the years, I'm comfortable with thinking about this as an escape fantasy.

I could imagine the possibility of me coping ok in the future and things being ok. I know I go through periods of time of coping, moments of happiness.

For the adhd, I have been taking strattera (non stimulant) because adderall caused me to have a manic episode. I was on 20 mg of the strattera, and now started 40 mg strattera. I don't feel too concentrated and still feel scatterbrained. Like I don't feel the effects after an hour like I used to w/ the stimulants. I know that it takes time to build in the system. 

But yeah was wondering if anyone has found strattera to help w/ concentration? If not, what other concentration meds have you tried that helps, and did not trigger a hypomanic/manic episode?

251,How are your experiences with 100% telehealth psychiatry providers?,1,11mvo3e,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/11mvo3e/how_are_your_experiences_with_100_telehealth/,13,"Man! Did I have a wild and crazy experience!

My psychiatrist of 23 years retired suddenly and did not have anyone he felt comfortable referring me to. Luckily for me, I've been in dbt therapy for seven consecutive years and my therapist had some pointers. 

She said to use Psychology Today's ""Find a Psychiatrist"" feature. Apparently, the magazine ""verifies"" certain psychiatrists and they're a cut above the rest or supposed to be. 

I kept having to reassure myself that this would be a ""numbers game"" and there would be doctors who'd be flakey about responding or just blow me off, but some of the doctors worked for big telehealth companies that provide them infrastructure, make their appointments, get prior auths, that kind of thing. 

Anyway, I used a search filter for Bipolar and ADHD and the results were mixed. The Talkiatry experience was the most puzzling. I looked them up afterwards and saw that they're only a 2-year-old company, but the customer reps that kept calling me, and their assessment form that bounced me when I typed in bipolar disorder made me do a double take. This is my essay on what happened and why I think it might've happened. 

Bottom line: I think some people (nurse practitioners and psychiatrists) are hesitant to  take us on. Especially someone like me who has Tardive Dyskinesia, even if it's well-maintained. 

So you ever feel like you're ""Too Complicated"" as a patient? This is what I struggle with. I'm curious if you do too. Feel free to tell me if I'm full of it or if you relate. In the meantime, this is my unscripted video essay of my 2022-2023 search for a new shrink. And mind you, I'm in good shape clinically speaking but emotionally, I found it uber challenging.

Because of this, i created a coping mechanism where i am able to seem okay to the outside world. I am still able to work most times when i am hearing voices or seeing things that arent there. I do this by being completely unreactive to anything, I cant always tell what is real so i kind of treat everythng like its not, for example, one time I was in a car and saw a person in the road, I didn't say anything to the driver and it turned out not to be real. Another time, I was on a bus and it stopped really hard, literally throwing people forward and I didn't flinch but judging by others reactions, that was real. 

I say all this because for the past 2ish years, this has worked for me, being completely unreactive almost catatonic in my emotions but i feel like it is starting ti catch up with me. I kept myself so busy with various activities and meetups that I didnt have to think about my mental health but now its slowly creeping back in. 

The problem is, ive set this standard, I'm the person thats always there, that always says yes. My days are filled to the brim and i can bearly sleep due to the anxiety of what I have to do the next day. The crazy part is that everything i do, i do it very well so i even convinced myself that im doing the right thing. But slowly im saying ""no"" more and skipping out on certin things. Ive stopped taking drugs and im starting to value sleep more, I no longer take on 1000 things per day and i thought that slowing down would be the answer but now i just feel like im letting everyone down. 

Like I feel like there is a limit in peoples minds about what it means to be mentally ill. You can take a few days off work but not too many, you can say no to some outings but be careful not to offend. I don't know how to balance this and im afraid ill end up alone.",1678302875.0

Day 1 impression about 6 hours after 100mg (option for 200mg) dose is that it has helped. I am not sure how to describe the feeling other than I feel more peaceful and calm. I don't even feel amazing, I just feel quite normal or relieved.

In 2019, i was diagnosed and put on Lexapro, Abilify, and Trazodone after a hospital stay (48 hour hold + 4 days in a mental & behavioral hospital). They worked okay for me - at that point i would‚Äôve taken anything because i was coming down from a 5 day trip of LSD + Psilocybin. (Somewhere around this time i also believe i developed HPPD (Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder) I lasted maybe 2 months before i stopped them to start taking psychedelics, smoking weed and drinking heavily again. I also stopped seeing my psychiatrist bc i felt like it was a dehumanizing experience. 
3-4 months ago, i started having intense mood swings and becoming very irritable with my boyfriend (now fianc√©) and i couldn‚Äôt help the major depressive episodes and erratic behavior. 
Almost 3 1/2 weeks ago, i started seeing a psychiatrist again and she is great. After we got talking about how i used/use dissociation to protect me from my childhood & my current trauma, she believed that starting lamotrigine would help with being able to understand my dissociation while not feeling so many highs and lows. 
The first night that i took it, within 15-20 minutes i felt almost drunk.. but better.. like i took a happy pill and i loved it. Went to bed and woke up still feeling great at work- I wasn‚Äôt hallucinating and i could calmly focus on the conversation at hand, my thoughts didn‚Äôt feel like i was going into overdrive and i could differentiate when i was dissociating. This all felt like i was being rescued from drowning (except the dry mouth, but that‚Äôs fixable with water). 
Here is why i am sharing and where i hope someone can relate: 
5 days later and i feel like the effects are dying down- I know that it might be normal bc i am still getting used to the meds. I was put on 25mg and she would like to work me up to 150-200mg -which I‚Äôve read on here that a dose of that size works very well for some people. I am aware that i have an addictive personality and i can feel myself craving a larger dose sooner than later just bc i want to feel that happy numbness again. I know it is not safe or recommended to take more than prescribed. I will not. I guess i just want to know if someone else relates to this craving. I feel very alone & like i cannot really talk to anyone about this.",1678241134.0

Just gonna go through my history quickly:

* 2010-2015: I had a bunch of bfs from 2010-2013. When the last one ended, I went on appps and slept with a bunch of people over two years, trying to figure out what would get me a relationship again.
* 2015-2016: I met someone and we started a monogamous relationship, and I had two more boyfriends back to back after that, the last on ending summer 2016.
* 2016-2017: After that, I had a few casual encounters, then started dating someone at the end of 2016, and I had one boyfriend for half the year and another for the other half.
* 2018-2022: I avoided dating, maybe had a casual encounter or two (I can't remember) then dated four boyfriends from 2019-2022 with maybe one casual encounter in between (also can't remember).
2022: After the 2022 relationship ended, I became manic. During that time, I slept with two people - one in my city and one in NYC. After that I maintained three fwb for six months in 2022.
* 2023: two months of seeing someone monogamously, we ended it because we want different things but still have sex.

Just wondering if this kind of sexual activity makes marriage impossible and I should stick with the 2023 guy and not have sex with anyone else after it ends unless it's going to become a serious relationship?

Today I am struggling to have the integrity to apply for all the jobs and just show up prepared for the interviews. I feel like hating myself and love to hate myself.

Lost all money, am without a job, struggled through the best grad school i could have gone through and turned a once in a lifetime opportunity into a huge loan. And everyday I am coasting through life - just surviving on friends couches. 

I know i have to come out of it. But I have ADHD like procrastination. Things like my divorce paperwork is pending years, taxes, reimbursements, finances. I do not know if I should hope for myself or not. I am medicated recently it has been about 2+ months. Initially there was a kicker and now I see myself falling back into the same traps and feel hardly motivated. I feel scared about being by myself.  

The good thing is that now I am able to bath and brush daily which I struggled last year. I am somehow getting meals for which I do not have to struggle for. 

Thank you for coming to my Muddy Talks! There is pain in my life and yet i sit on the painful nail to continue having the pain and then crying out loud.

The issue is I actually haven't told my therapist about having a bipolar dx. 

I have been going to a public psychiatric clinic that thinks I have bipolar 2 and I'm still receiving medication from them. However, since I'm medicine compliant, I haven't actually felt like I've been in a depressive/manic slump in the past few months. I even had depression/bipolar questionnaires being done. And she thinks I don't have it (thanks in part to my med compliance) 

I still struggle with other aspects of my life though. Mood-wise, I have been feeling fine, but being medicated for bipolar symptoms only solved 1/4 of my issues, which is why I think the rest is because of my possible undiagnosed ADHD/OCD. 

I _will_ tell this to the new psychiatrist about my existing bipolar dx, but will it complicate anything? I'm worried if the new psychiatrist thinks my current issues is because of my bipolar if I tell him. Like, I'm worried if the bias of me not telling the clinical psych about my bipolar 2 history might make the new psychiatrist think my issues is because of being bipolar. 

I know I've been fine mood-wise but my functioning in general has genuinely been debilitating towards my life. And in a way I feel like meeting this new doctor/getting a second opinion because I feel like my bipolar dx could be a misdiagnosis (it could be because of the seroquel though.

364,Invalidating Experience with Psychiatrist,1,11izeyc,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/11izeyc/invalidating_experience_with_psychiatrist/,4,"TLDR: private psychiatrist says my symptoms are not bipolar, just neurodevelopmental (autism), refuses to even give a depression diagnosis. 

I had a mental breakdown last summer that I am still recovering from. I think it was a combination of burnout caused by undiagnosed autism and ADHD, and some past unresolved trauma. I won't go into too much detail about the cause of the burnout but it put me into a deep depression. I was suicidal, self harming and stopped eating. I lost quite a bit of weight in a short time. Was prescribed various anti depressants which made me feel worse and had horrible side effects. I then tried self medicating with cannabis but had a bad experience with a strain that was too strong which has put me off. I have recently started buspirone for anxiety which is helping a bit.

I asked my GP for a referral for a psychiatric assessment but unfortunately this is not easily available on the NHS. I was, however, referred for some DBT. During my initial sessions we've been looking intensely at my history and there seems to be a pattern where I'll have periods of feeling super confident/outgoing/ambitious and overstretch myself or do things I later regret, followed my periods of depression. This recent depression was the worst it's been since I was a teenager and lasted over 5 months. I'm in a semi stable state right now but still have low mood quite a bit.

Anyway, I asked my DBT therapist if it would be worth having a psychiatric assessment (privately) and mentioned that I thought I may have bipolar or cyclothymia. She thought that was a good idea so I went ahead and booked it, then a few weeks later had my assessment. At the triage appointment I mentioned I was awaiting an autism and ADHD assessment elsewhere, as these are done separately. I said I wanted to be assessed for bipolar or another mood disorder.

During my assessment the psychiatrist asked me lots of questions about my childhood and teenage years. I answered honestly and mentioned the times I'd been depressed in the past as well as my experiences during times I was, in my opinion, hypomanic. I explained I tend to be very all or nothing, but that I am always anxious even when I am not depressed.

She finally asked me what my opinion was and I said I thought I either had major depressive disorder or bipolar, but felt it was more likely to be the latter due to 'high' periods. She immediately shut me down and said that she didn't think my symptoms aligned with bipolar and that in her opinion it was all due to neurodevelopmental issues. She said it was a shame I didn't have this assessment after I'd had my autism/ADHD assessments. 

I asked if there was something else underlying, and whether she'd dismiss another diagnosis if she hadn't known I was looking into autism. She said she would have picked up on it likely being autism as she has some experience working with autistic patients. I said that I didn't feel autism or ADHD could explain my mood fluctuations- said I often overspend during my 'highs' which is unlike me as I'm very cautious with money usually. She asked if I was spending on things I needed and I said that yes I suppose so. I thought I needed the things at the time, but I have had lots of varied (creative/art based) interests that I've spent lots of money on and never returned to. She said that because I needed to buy those things and it wasn't some random/out of character thing that I'd never shown an interest in it didn't count as a bipolar symptom.

I also mentioned that I'd been very sexually promiscuous at points in my youth and did lots of risky things that I regret. However since meeting my husband I am no longer promiscuous/engage in risky behaviour (though I do fluctuate between having no interest in sex to the other extreme which correlates with my mood), I've never cheated though. She didn't respond to this and I felt like I'd overshared.

When I got my written report back the outcome/diagnosis was that I have anxiety, and a recommendation to be assessed for neurodevelopmental conditions. I feel like the psychiatrist has refused to consider any other diagnosis and is putting everything down to autism, even though my mood symptoms would usually warrant a separate diagnosis- neurodevelopmental conditions are different to mental illnesses although often there are comorbidities. I didn't even get a depression diagnosis. 

I asked for an amendment to at least mention depression as I strongly felt I fit the criteria but the psychiatrist has refused to do this. She said she doesn't feel I fit the criteria for depression- I'm guessing this is because I said I was no longer suicidal or self harming, however I did say I have little to no motivation most days and feel very low for no reason two or more days every couple of weeks. I explained I have also completely pared back my life to remove any stresses and don't see anyone; any kind of deviation from this or unexpected stressors cause my mood to plummet again. She didn't ask further questions about my mood so I didn't get a chance to talk further but I feel that what I said was enough to warrant at least a depression diagnosis.

I just feel so dismissed and unheard but also maybe like I'm just being unreasonable as she is the professional after all. Maybe I really don't have anything else and it is all autism and anxiety. I have to say I feel like this just doesn't explain a lot of my experiences though. I can't afford to pay for a second opinion as this was all my savings otherwise I would. I'm also confused because my DBT therapist said what I explained to her sounds a lot like bipolar, and I agree, but unfortunately she cannot diagnose this. She is going to see if the team who referred me to her can get me a second opinion but this may not be possible as it's the NHS. I just want some answers.",1678029277.0

I've been to a psychiatrist recently and they informed me I have a unidentified mood disorder, when in reality I know it is bipolar, I have all the symptoms but when she went over the symptoms I lied to her, so now I'm in a mess. My father was a known bipolar,  who also was Manic Depressive, which leads me to believe the increased chance that I am bipolar. Here is what I'm going through right now
Anger, not just like a tiny bit but like terrible terrible episodes (that's what I think they are) this is the description of a normal episode for Me- screaming, crying, swearing, hitting anything I can, hurting myself hurting anything around me (mostly inanimate objects) I don't feel in control, anything I want to say just comes out, I have no filter and control is lost. 
Irresponsible behaviors (keep in mind I am 15)- I have started smoking marijuana, sneaking out, drinking alcohol, honestly doing anything I can do without the thought of risk in mind.
Unusual appetite - idk if that's a symptom- but I usually eat very little during the day and binge at night
Unable to show emotions when I want too - the only time I can cry is during a episode other than that I can't cry and I'm starting to not be able to feel happy either, something happy happens and I smile but something inside of me like a rock in my stomach reminds me that I'm still sad and mentally unstable
I can't go a day without having an episode and recently they are getting worse, I've had increased drive of (TW: SH MENTIONS) self harm which I told my parents and psychiatrist, neither took concern.
I am on medication: Seroquel

Have any of you found it helpful? Have you had to forgo having a sex life?

I have this thing where when I‚Äôm driving I get a lot of anxiety in certain kinds of locations. Basically places that are really dense and slow and chaotic  like shopping centers, college campuses, and downtown areas. 

Navigation software typically makes this problem worse for me  because when I am traveling in an unfamiliar area  I will have to rely on the GPS to find me things like stores and restaurants, and I have no warning typically until I get to the place of what kind of place it‚Äôs going to be. And there have been more than a few times when my GPS took me to a very uncomfortable location in search of a cup of coffee or something and before I even got there I was bugging out enough that I no longer wanted to even get there and just needed to get out of the dense area, but there‚Äôs no way to do that Because the GPS doesn‚Äôt have a mode for avoid dense areas. So I try to tell the GPS to take me somewhere, anywhere, but half the time it just takes feet deeper into the dense area because it thinks that‚Äôs a more efficient route then backtracking to the highway or whatever. 

I tried talking to a few friends and posted on Facebook about this, and the reply was really just people making fun of me because what the fuck is wrong with me that I can‚Äôt handle being in a shopping center or university campus and just suck it up that‚Äôs normal life and you‚Äôre being such a stupid little snowflake. 

Personally I hope to believe that people are allowed to have their own needs and anxieties  end it would be really nice if the people around us could acknowledge our concerns and help support us rather than just telling us that we‚Äôre weird and shouldn‚Äôt care about that thing. 

But, I really don‚Äôt know why it is that I care about this. Is it a bipolar thing? Is it just something related to my own personal trauma? Really, I guess the reason it matters to me at this point is that this problem has been so persistent and so frustrating for me and so completely ignored by the service providers out there but I am starting to really think about saving up some cash and paying a programmer to write me a bug out app. 

I want a piece of navigation software that does one thing and one thing only: gets me out of the dense area  that I am in, and onto the nearest highway pointing outward from the area of high population density.

I really don‚Äôt think this should be a difficult algorithm at all, considering that most navigation algorithms already have awareness of the different sizes of roads out there. It would really only need to find the quickest route to the nearest road with a higher speed limit than the one I am on, and then from there again to the next largest road. There are probably open source Lego pieces that can be put together to do this pretty quickly, but even a basic phone app is still multiple thousands of dollars at the cheapest. I could probably get someone in India or Mexico to do it for a couple thousand dollars, but I don‚Äôt want to invest if it‚Äôs really truly something that I alone care about. In my work as a disability attorney, I have from time to time at Clients report to me but they also had anxiety in certain driving situations, but among my clients  the usual response is simply to work on driving less rather than trying to find a way to make it more tolerable. I fear that the combination of this symptom combined with the lifestyle habit of traveling frequently might be too small of a Venn diagram for there to be any interest at all.

Background: I have definitely experienced multiple episodes of what I guess you'd call acute psychosis, full on delusion/hallucination with a big fancy story to it like I'm a liberating alien goddess and lasting a week or two or less. Aside form that, my life pattern fits BP2 on the more depressive end of the spectrum and with several brief hypomanic periods a year mostly characterized by reckless behavior, megalomania and increased paranoia but no actual delusions. Unless it would be those psychosis episodes, I've never had mania, clearly only hypo. So I don't think I'm misdiagnosed BP1.

Does this make sense or sound familiar to anyone?

I forget about it all the time but along with CPTSD they also said I have DPDR and possibly OSDD (?? lol yeah I know that's a big bomb to drop I jsut don't know anything about it and it was talked about a whole bunch but last I saw my paperwork it wasn't on there idk) and I know I dissociated and maladaptive daydreamed a lot during my child trauma which seems to lean in to the idea of my psychosis not being bipolar- having an external cause/being the result of conditioning if that makes sense but I know the way I'm looking at it may not be right.

I've been taking the same meds and stable to depressive for the last 2 years, I haven't had a psychosis episode for 4 years and that was triggered by a personal tragedy and lasted only 4 days until I was put in inpatient and meds cleared it up quickly. Looking back at how most of my psychosis happened during a period of regular abuse I don't know if I've ever had an epiode that didn't have a direct trigger in my life, they don't just happen. To my understanding that is another distinction from much, although not all, BP1 mania.

So the concept of BP2 with psychosis makes sense for my specific situation, it just doesn't seem to be a credible diagnosis and I'm just confused.

A little background, for many years now I‚Äôve been dealing with depression and anxiety, found little success on the depression side of things. But after being diagnosed with ADHD I started looking into the condition more and saw a lot about the comorbidity between ADHD and bipolar disorder. And after reading about bipolar 2 and a lot of anecdotal posts/stories on Reddit and other sites, it makes sense to me that I would have it as well, given how many things I can relate to and that my father is schizo affective, it seems likely that I might have it.

My therapist seems hesitant to talk about the condition, I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs doing her due diligence and making sure it‚Äôs not something else first. But I did talk with my DR and he agreed to let me try Abilify both to see if it does something for the depression but also I suppose to appease me because it‚Äôs also used in bipolar treatments and that‚Äôs something I told him I wanted to try, that way I could help to figure out what my problems are and find the right treatment.

This might seem like a weird post just wondering if anyone else has issues dealing with the same. I have been diagnosed with a mood disorder some years ago. I have since a teen used alcohol as a medication to deal with trauma and feelings and its has progressed into adulthood.

Every so often I will get my lifestyle habits etc in order and quit alcohol, get exercise and dietary changes, it will last for days to weeks and I will start to feel energetic and alive again. The weird thing is i find feeling like this **harder to deal** with, the excess energy, hyper mood and normality becomes too much and then I will start the old habits again go back into my shell where I feel normal.

&#x200B;

I have normalised feeling like shit and somewhat feel safe there, its the feeling good and energetic that overwhelms me and I can deal with it. It nearly feels like self sabotage and I always reset and relapse. Also to add, that emotions, trauma and memories become way to hard to deal with when I don't have alcohol to block out.

&#x200B;

Just wondering if anyone has experienced this or what they may have done to stay on track.

Then I gained weight bc of antipsychotics and hypothyroidism. No I am 214 pounds. My eyes are sunken in. My once thick hair thin and gone thanks to medication and hypothyroid. My outsides reflect my insides. Dead, devoid of life.
Some days are ok. I try to go to hikes. But not like I used to. 
I met a boyfriend and made a decision to move across country with him. I went to gorgeous redwoods of California to a grey, dirty city full of trash. Besides my boyfriend and adopting my animals, my decisions are mostly always bad. Hiking is 25 or more minutes away and I‚Äôm scared to go alone, because that‚Äôs who I am now, full of constant panic and worry. 
I can‚Äôt walk up stairs without panicking thinking I‚Äôll fall backwards and break my neck and die. Ironically, I pray for death almost daily. 
I‚Äôm isolated from friends and family. I have an aunt and cousin here but they are an hour away and busy.

Imagine my mindset now, and then add horrible pain from my anal cavity , having to soak my ass in warm water 7 times a day, not being able walk or go anywhere, and eating a liquid diet or not eating at all bc bowel movements will be nightmares.
I‚Äôm afraid during this surgery my mental health will reach dark places I‚Äôve never been to before.

Today I got in an argument with my boyfriend. It went on for hours. I truly cannot take it. I‚Äôm already depressed and suicidal, I can‚Äôt handle having a horrible fight with someone I love.

Thank God, I‚Äôm finally off the Seroquel. This past year has been one of the most difficult years of my life because of my mental health. I was in two hospitals, and finally had to go to Mayo clinic to get a second opinion. They had some really good advice actually!

Anyway, last hospital visit I was there two weeks until finally. I was on 800 mg of Seroquel and 20 mg of Haldol. I have no idea how I was even awake or walking around but that‚Äôs what it took to make me stable. Of course I started sleeping a ton and I gained a lot of weight. Also lost motivation for things like exercising, reading, etc. 

After being stable for a while, my psychiatrist started cutting back my Seroquel. Finally don‚Äôt feel like eating constantly and I‚Äôm not as tired and lowly motivated. Only on 2 mg of Haldol! Thinking about going back to work part time and starting to exercise again!

Anyway, there is someone who is very significant in my life who doesn‚Äôt understand how hungry Seroquel makes you and how these meds can fuck you up. If you feel comfortable sharing, I would really appreciate you commenting and saying what Seraquel and/or Haldol did to you in terms of making you, hungry, sleepy, and lowly motivated.  Please no advice about how I should cut this person out of my life.  They drove me all the way to Mayo and are there for me in many, many ways. I hope that this post can be about education.

480,My Bipolar Journey So Far,5,11f0dvl,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/11f0dvl/my_bipolar_journey_so_far/,1,"Hey everyone! Thanks in advance to all those who might eventually read this....I just wanted to say thanks to you all! This community seems really supportive of each other, and I'm really grateful for that. Not many spaces like that are left on the internet these days. Anyhow, I wanted to share my story just a little bit and maybe get some extra opinions. I had always knew I had pretty bad social anxiety. Growing up, especially when I was younger( it's gotten progressively worse) I always got extremely nervous around other people. You know the classic symptoms: going to great lengths to avoid social events, making up the same old tired excuses to not attend parties, etc. I couldn't stand large crowds and I always got the idea that others were somehow ""watching"" me when I was out in public..even in places like the grocery store. I always thought they were judging me or silently making fun of me, etc. 

I've been working since I was 15 years old, trying to help provide for my family because we grew up pretty poor. My first job was at a McDonalds as a teen, and I worked there through high school up until I had a falling out with my family, and I moved out and lived with my grandparents. I quit that job, and had a period of time I was unemployed for about 5 months. Got another job at the local dollar store by my grandparents home, and quit there after two weeks. I moved back in with my family, and we reconciled our differences. I got a job at the local Wendy's as a closer for the restaurant. I worked there for a year, and it was at this job that I guess looking back my symptoms sorta started developing. I was chronically late, and I mean super late. Idk why, just I couldn't bring myself to actually be there on time. Some days I just felt too tired to get outta bed to be there at my scheduled time, others I was on top of the world and thought I was too good and didn't care. I would call out of work for weeks at a time even! Just making up excuses so I wouldn't have to go in, etc. Looking back on all this, I'm ashamed really. I quit Wendy's after a year, and got a job as a pharmacy technician. I became convinced over time that my boss was out to get me and wanted me gone. Maybe she did. I was a crappy employee at first. It was extremely hard to concentrate at work, hard to focus, and I felt ""clumsy"" and would forget very basic instructions. Not to mention having to deal with customers and patients and phone calls and stuff triggered my anxiety greatly. After having a blowout argument with my boss, I quit that good paying job at the pharmacy to be a freaking meat cutter at my local grocery store. That lasted about a month, before I landed a job at the local hospital as a switchboard operator. This is where things get interesting....

I began working at the hospital during the very beginning of the COVID pandemic. The stress levels there were unimaginable....I was having to deal with phone calls from ""Karens"", people would call and cuss me out, yell at me, scream at me, etc. I also occasionally had to work the actual service desk in the hospital, and had to confront people who refused to wear a mask and such. I've nearly gotten assaulted over that dozens of times. This all culminated in a panic attack that was so severe I ended up throwing up in the bathroom, and being sent home. I went to the doctor, and they diagnosed me as a having anxiety and gave me lexapro. I've been on it for about three years now. I didn't know I was bipolar at the time, and so apparently lexapro and bipolar disorder definitely don't mix well. At first, lexapro seemed to make me feel okay and definitely helped with my anxiety. Then, about a year and a half or so later, I ended up getting into a huge argument with my boss because I was convinced she'd treated me unfairly. I left in the middle of the night and quit....no notice, nothing. At this same time, I was going thru what I now know as my first major manic episode that I can recall. I quit my job that night because I felt the Holy Spirit told me too...you read that right. During this manic episode, I'd converted to Mormonism and fell into it extremely....like zealously. Before that, I was an atheist hardcore. Ultimately, my fiance helped me get out of the church....and it was like a moment of clarity...I couldn't believe what I'd just done lol. During that time, my whole personality changed....politics and all. I was like a totally different person. After I snapped out of it, I couldn't believe the things I said and did during that time. How strict with the religion I was, how zealous I was, etc. I ended up getting a job at my other local dollar store, before quitting three weeks into it because I needed jaw surgery. After surgery was over, I got a job at a local nursing home as a patient sitter. I lasted two shifts there before I quit. I later tried to get my job back, because I regretted quitting, I got it back, and I worked one more shift before I quit again. I left there to go to McDonalds again. I worked one shift there before I quit there as well!! Now, I've finally landed a really good paying job at my local Walmart and I really don't wanna mess it up. Reading so many other mania stories has finally helped me realize there really is something wrong with me, I'm not lazy, and I need to seek help for this....this does sound like bipolar disorder, doesn't it? I mean it seems I tick every box there is. Thanks for reading this much everyone!",1677666618.0

491,Any other BP people with substance abuse issues feel like they don't fit in at AA? Anyone successfully find moderation with substance possible after getting the bipolar under control?,6,11erlfa,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/11erlfa/any_other_bp_people_with_substance_abuse_issues/,14,"TL:DR read the title of the post, but for background :

I am BPI diagnosed for 15 years ago, stable and out of hospital for 8. In my last manic episode 8 years ago I was drinking heavily and after a stay at the mental hospital I attended a dual diagnosis outpatient rehab program. I really threw myself into it, got into 12 step work in AA etc. I'd had my butt kicked so I decided to do what I was told for once. My life improved dramacally during this time. I found good meds and doctors, got back in shape, moved to a cooler city, changed careers into a cooler career, met and married my wife etc.

But I gradually soured on AA. AA dogma holds that I must believe that before everything I am an alcoholic, my alcoholism comes first. I wanted to be on board, but I couldn't genuinely agree with that conception of reality. The farther I've gone along in my recovery the more I have come to personally believe that the primary issue is bipolar disorder and the substance abuse is secondary and more symptomatic of not having enough good tools to deal with the BP.

Another thing that doesn't really line up for me is the whole idea of needing a ""spiritual experience"" in AA. Genuinely, not being flippant here- I have had spiritual experiences many times, they were usually when I was manic or high on hallucinogens or both. (I still am a spiritual person, but not anywhere nearly as fervent when I'm not manic).

Finally, AA has a weird relationship with psychotropic meds.  It's getting better but there are still a lot of old timers who don't understand how antidepressants or mood stableizers work and will tell you you aren't sober if you're taking pills.  My last AA sponsor told me to pray more when I was depressed.  I ignored him, talked to my psych and got on antidepressants and the depression lifted.  When I look around the rooms at AA I see a lot of people who would really benefit from real therapy and antidepressants.

My attendance at AA faded out gradually until I stopped going.  I am now experimenting with moderation.  Over the past two years I've been using low doses of marijuana on occasion, and every so often I'll have a cocktail and a beer or two at dinner by myself. One or two times I've gone past that amount but hated the hangover a def didn't fall into a pattern or downward spiral. Despite what AA dogma says about if you relapse you will ""pick up where you left off"" and be as bad as you were at your worst in no time, I have as yet had no negative repercussions with this moderate amount of substance use.  

&#x200B;

I have no desire to go on a bender.  I continue to do everything in my treatment plan for BPI and my moods continue to be mild and manageable.

Does anyone else in the bipolar community with substance abuse history relate to feeling a disconnect in 12 step programs and what your personal recovery plan looks like? ",1677637574.0

We all know what we need to avoid bipolar depression:
. Proper meds
. Therapy
.Good diet

BUT despite all this many of us including me fall into the pithole of Depression and once we fall in it I usually stay there for weeks or even months.During depression the only things I can do is binging mobile , ordering fast food (I only eat once in a day because I don't get much appetite and secondly I don't get much money for ordering daily and about the food which is cooked in my home my maid doesn't know shit how to cook it properly)and smoking. I honestly don't enjoy any activity mentioned above apart from playing football in my colony ground(which can only be done for 2 hours in a day ).And I believe that if one has something that they really enjoy  the depreession can go away.Which brings me to the main title.When Im about to hit Depression there's nothing I can think of which I enjoy.I used to enjoy video gaming , anime , making memes etc before BP but even though they seem like a small task , it feels like a burden even though I used to enjoy them before BP so I don't see anyway of preventing myself from the Depression bomb that hits me.",1677627607.0

I'm coming out of a mixed episode and have made plans to visit a friend up north, tacking it on to a trip back home to see my mom and my psychiatrist. I made my travel arrangements with the points I was given when a flight was canceled in Southwest's whole ordeal over the winter holidays. So these plans are not setting me back financially except that I'm staying in a hotel. This is a friend I've known for five years, we talk on the phone a lot and have video called and whatnot. Because we are interested in each other romantically, my parents are ripping me to shreds about ""this is so random why are you doing this right now you need to call your doctor."" They never seem to care about me when I am manic other than to mention how annoying I am. Any time I do ANYTHING fun or for my happiness, they tell me I'm manic. This is not even random, we've had plans to try to link up several times but the timing was never right for me. I am finally ready for a relationship and am thrilled to just go spend time with someone I've been friends with for years, regardless of what happens with us romantically and my family is telling me how I'm going off the rails. 

I get so frustrated with this (it happens often) and my parents refuse to educate themselves. I recently took care of my sister's cats while she drove three hours away (she's chronically ill and is usually unable to drive the 45 minutes to our dad's house, so this was risky for her) to meet a guy she had met previously that week on facebook. Nobody said she was crazy! He ended up standing her up and it was oh poor her we just were excited that she was getting back out there (she's very dependent on always having a partner). It's so unfair that I'm accused of being in a manic episode any time I do something for myself. This happened when I went to visit a college friend too!

Any tips on how to not get so viscerally angry at this would be appreciated. Does anyone else deal with this too? I know it comes from a place of caring but when they refuse to hear me out on my own experiences it does not feel that way.",1677453446.0

It is important no medication changes happen without connecting with a health professional**

But for the sake of discussion I have been thinking about this and experimenting with it a little bit. I have a diagnoses of BP2 and have tried using weed sometimes to help. The problem with me is it seems a lot of medications take away hypomania for me, but generally make me not want to get out of bed. I am from a state where weed is legalized for purchase for 21+. 

I always felt like in my prior experience I would just smoke or ingest any kind of THC and it would be hit or miss; sometimes it seemed like it was the only thing that somewhat helped but other times it felt like it worsened my symptoms. Obviously I understand there are mixed episodes, etc., but I was curious if anyone else has tried tapering specific strains to specific episodes. For example, the main two strains of weed are sativa and indica. For manic and depressive episodes, one would think that it might work to use these as sativa is uplifting (for depressive episodes) and indica is more sedating (for manic episodes). I haven‚Äôt tried this for a super extended amount of time, but there are times where sativa is the only thing to get me out of bed and actually doing chores, etc. 

Is this an idea any of you have thought about or put into action? I am curious as to what your opinions are on this because the reaction I have received from health professionals have been very mixed; some have told me that if smoking weed works for me to keep doing it, some have told me its a drug which makes me an addict in addition to my other diagnoses.

treating ADD can improve the PMS supposedly and possibly my bipolar too? so it's possible my behaviour/mood is dependent on my hormonal fluctuations. [recent bloods confirm i am healthy no concerns.


I cross referenced my period tracker against my calendar of activities and mood tracking. I fit the pattern pretty much perfectly.

I'm currently euthymic and on maintenance therapy (Buspirone, Depakote DR, Wellbutrin SR |morning dose| Levothyroxine, Liothyronine)

Again, I know that I'm the one having the issue. I've tried some earplugs, sleeping with white noise via earbuds, tiring myself out before bed. Because he doesn't deserve to be blamed for something he can't control.

Not even sure why I'm posting I just feel lost and invisible and wanted to feel seen. As a quote from one of my favorite bands ""This island has become an ocean and my boat's too small, the waves are crashing in and I can't save this sinking ship"". I don't even know where to begin with my thoughts I'm sorry for ranting on here I just need to vent it out. I've talked to my therapists and we will start the process over as usual, I've told my wife she's here to support me but I still feel so alone. I'm afraid of myself in this state and I have to be strong for my wife and my son. I hate drowning while feeling an obligation to have to keep it all together. *Trigger warning self harm* cooking dinner the past two nights has been torture, I have no control when that knife is in my hand my voices just want me to add to my collection of scars. So far I've fought it to just a slight drag against the skin to get the sensation but I need to keep fighting. My demons are all breaking out of their cages and it's been so long since my last battle my last war, my swords are dull and my shields are broken. I'm sorry to everyone for this being so long and if it upset anyone. I wish you all the best and thank you for giving me a safe space.",1677379603.0

Thankfully with the manufacturer coupon and my good insurance, paying hasn't been a huge issue, but it definitely limited my interest in taking jobs with worse insurance options. I'd heard that it was going generic soon but hadn't seen any hard evidence of that.

I looked today and it appears that several manufacturers have rolled out generic lurasidone in the past week. Goodrx is showing it at $50/month at some local pharmacies with their coupon. It's supposed to take another few months before it fully rolls out to every pharmacy, but it's happening!

585,What helped me the most,12,11br8j6,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/11br8j6/what_helped_me_the_most/,7,"Over the thirty five years of being in treatment for bipolar, I've had alot of antidepressant ""poop outs"" where the depression lasted as long as three years before I got another med that worked for me. 

Then, something changed. I did something that changed the course of my bipolar illness. 

Mindfulness-based Dialectical Behavioral Therapy. 

I fought the idea of Mindfulness for the longest time. Especially since the word was weaponized against me by doctors when I was struggling with Tardive Dyskinesia. I was told I was a ""walking ambulance"" and that I was 'a bull in a china closet' and needed to work on Mindfulness. 

Finally, I found a Trauma program and the curriculum was Marsha Linehan's Dialectical Behavioral Therapy. I go to a University that offers it on a sliding scale, the only downside is that my therapists are students and graduate every one to two years. But at 8 bucks a week, the price is right and I've been in it for seven years. 

What I notice is when death thoughts come up, instead of catastrophizing that it's another depression phase that's going to last a year or more, I tell myself that ""I'm feeling depressed today"" and I do things to make myself feel better, like exercise, music, and also am allowed by my doctor to take an extra one of my fast acting antidepressants. I don't know if I'm allowed to mention the name of an antidepressant, but it's a new one, it's a new type of SSRI and though expensive, for me, it acts quickly.

This ""Short"" explains how I now manage what I call the ""symptoms"" of bipolar-related depression. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CLbtgyopSo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CLbtgyopSo)",1677347973.0

Hellooo fellow bipolar Reddit users 

I am 20 years old and recently started taking medication again for the first time in 2 years, I‚Äôm bp2. I spent the majority of my mid to late adolescence in treatment centers so I‚Äôve taken like every anti depressant anti psychotic ssri you could think of. When I turned 18 and finally had autonomy over my body, I stopped meds. 

Obviously that didn‚Äôt work so after two years of that I reached out to one of my old doctors and he prescribed me latuda since it‚Äôs newer and something I haven‚Äôt taken before. I‚Äôve been taking it on and off for a few months. I finally got on a 3 week streak of taking it!! But here is where my issue and question come in. 
 
I‚Äôve been diagnosed with anorexia since I was 14. Although it‚Äôs better now I‚Äôm still not perfect. About 80% of my stomach is completely wrecked from that and some medicine I got prescribed for pneumonia when I was a kid. Taking pills in general is really harsh on my stomach. I struggle with acid reflex and throwing up because of my weak stomach. 

Usually I eat one full meal at the end of the day, then take my latuda. Two days ago I fell asleep early and woke up early. I didn‚Äôt eat the previous day and was having acid reflex so I made 5 vegan nuggies and took my latuda. 

Holy shit did I yak up a storm. It was one of those ones Where you literally can taste the pill coming up every time you heave. Ever since that I have been incredibly nauseous, dehydrated , having cold&hot flashes and headaches. Every time I‚Äôve eaten since (I‚Äôve made effort to eat greens proteins as well as chug pedialyte) I‚Äôve had to sit and do deep breathing for like 20 min to keep my food down which isn‚Äôt normal for me. 

I haven‚Äôt taken my latuda since so I‚Äôm not sure if these are withdrawals or sickness from throwing it up. Any advice about latuda or anything I mentioned would be greatly appreciated!! Thank you in advance my bipolar warriors üòé <3",1677357376.0

lamictals been working really well for hypomanic episodes and for the depressive episodes for the most part but there‚Äôd be some breakthrough depressive symptoms but nothing that couldn‚Äôt be managed tbh. i think i might have to change meds completely tho which SUCKS because i love lamictal. i really need something to help with both hypomanic and depressive episodes and SSRI‚Äôs have never helped so i can‚Äôt go down that route. 

anyone have any ideas of good meds? i‚Äôve read so many good things about lithium but i don‚Äôt have insurance to go do regular blood tests but i was interested in bringing it up to my psych in a couple of weeks. i don‚Äôt want to take more than 2 meds and would love to just take one if possible.

I woke up one morning feeling good. I had therapy, but didn‚Äôt have much to talk about. I stayed in a good mood for three days. The next morning, my emotions were gone. My chest was light with nothing and my mind was swirling with racing thoughts.

-‚ÄúI should restart life again. Get rid of these friends since they mean nothing to me.‚Äù
-‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt be in a relationship. I‚Äôm not cut out for them anyway.‚Äù

She keeps me afloat and always has the most patience and understanding with my bipolar. We talked and I apologized and said I would get better.

I don‚Äôt get the god complex or physical impulsivity or the pure eurphoria. I get irritable, irrational, mean, heartless, and I go way too fast.

I find it extremely difficult to pass time throughout the day due to me not being able to enjoy anything I try to do, and time seems to move relatively slowly for me because of this.

I've been on quite a bunch of different medications (antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, antidepressants, sleep aids) since being diagnosed with bipolar I at the beginning of 2022 with all of them being unsuccessful so far. I am currently on Vraylar 1.5mg, Effexor XR 75mg, and Valium 10mg (for sleep).

I was wondering if anyone else experiences something similar, and I'm curious to know what others do to cope with this.

EDIT:  

Thank you to everyone who has taken time to respond to my post. I appreciate you all for giving me more hope and motivation to continue trucking on this journey to recovery.

I forgot to mention that despite being unable to experience pleasure from things that I used to enjoy, I don't let the anhedonia stop me from trying things again. I still make an effort to do my old hobbies and spend time with loved ones. At times it does seem a little hopeless or even pointless to even continue, but I believe that healing is a process and that there is hope at the end of the tunnel. Despite the many setbacks I've faced in changes in psychiatrists, therapists, or medications, I haven't lost hope that one day I'll be able to enjoy life again.

I'm glad I found this community, and I hope we all get to where we want to be in life. No matter what challenges face us in our battle with mental health, I wish everyone the best of luck.",1677277125.0

I‚Äôm in therapy and now I finally found a good one ! 
I‚Äôm 24 female and have these symptoms since I was 13 or 14. 

My question is : how long did it take your therapist to get you diagnosed ? And is it possible that it also might be BPD ? 
But I really want to be alone when depressed most of the time so I guess that wouldn‚Äôt fit for a Borderline Diagnosis? 

And another thing is : Does weather also influence your mood and what kind of medication is needed / help for delusional periods? Should I ask my therapist bc she doesn‚Äôt know how severe my paranoid thoughts can be.

I have no idea what to do besides send my psych provider a message and I‚Äôm concerned. 

Before I was diagnosed I was just labeled as being impulsive, moody, irritable, touchy, flighty‚Ä¶you know the usual descriptors.

Once I was diagnosed I could see the patterns looking back and it was pretty obvious. About a year after diagnosis I went into a severe manic episode. Had to drop out of school kind of episode. I wasn‚Äôt able to identify it as one until I was out of it and did a lot of damage during that time. 

Lately, I‚Äôve had to work with my provider on making changes to my meds because of some serious side effects. I haven‚Äôt had a really bad manic episode for a bit but now I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at/just starting. 

I‚Äôve been decreasing my depakote for awhile. Essentially I‚Äôm just on lamictal now and seroquel. Full honesty, I kind of suck at taking the seroquel because it makes me really groggy the next day plus the whole eating everything in the house at 3am problem. The plan is to transition to a different med to replace the seroquel after I‚Äôm off the depakote. I was warned to watch for any mania. For awhile it was ok, no big ups/downs. Then this past few weeks things have been going downhill (or uphill?) and I don‚Äôt like it. 

The impulsive urges are harder to stop. I‚Äôm extremely defensive/irritable when I usually wouldn‚Äôt be. I was convinced I was going to write & self publish a very successful children‚Äôs book. Im still talking myself down from that one, but I‚Äôve got a list of great ideas a mile long. I‚Äôm super anxious and pushing the line on being paranoid. 

I am trying really, really, really hard to fight it but it‚Äôs exhausting.

My department moved locations back in November. I was at the office this morning - I'm usually not there as I work at multiple locations during the day, so I don't know everyone in the building very well. We had professional development scheduled today so I headed to the office this morning. We use the copier of another department housed across the hall, so I went over there to make some copies. There are only two people in that office, one is super nice and friendly and the other can be kind of an entitled bitch. 

When I got over there, the friendly one was there but the other one was not. I started chatting with her a bit, and the topic of the other lady came up. I asked if she knew about an email she had sent my team where she was accusing us of taking the forks and spoons from the kitchen area and not returning them. We had a little laugh about it, and the friendly one said it's hard working with her because her moods are unpredictable. she then said ""I mean, bipolar is probably the better word for it, she's nice one day and irritable the next."" And she had a good laugh.

I was kind of taken aback, to the point I couldn't really react. I wanted to say something like, bipolar isn't a word you should just throw around like that, it's a real illness with real implications. But I didn't.

I can delete this later if its not. 100 mg lamictal a day. This illness runs in my family on my father's side for several generations. I only found out this vital genetic information /after/ having children and digging deeper into it. My great grandmother died in a gutter because of this illness. She had been officially diagnosed and treated, for what its worth. In and out of state facilities. One of her children inherited it, then passed it onto my father, who passed it onto me.

I am an adult, and the expectation is that an adult should have greater self control than children. Right? I try my best to teach my 3 year old how to manage her emotions, like labeling them, taking a moment to breathe, and talking about it when we're done being emotional about it. All the coping skills I learned, in therapy, I try to teach her. She's 3 and sometimes she manages herself better than I do myself. She's going to leave me in the dust in the next decade and I'll still be... bipolar.

I try as hard as I can to manage what's going on inside my mind but it feels like its not enough, and I'll never get to my end goal, which is I guess an unrealistic vision of being 'cured' and not having to constantly fight my own thoughts and then, when I fumble, not be devastatingly embarrassed and ashamed of myself. Why? I had a little outburst last night in front of my partner and I wish I could take it back. I still have that annoying nagging feeling like telling myself ""that's not a proper way to behave!"" Why is it that I can see it happening like a third person, but I can't always stop myself? Why am I still paranoid that I'm driving my partner away and this will all end in divorce? Years and years of assurance that it won't happen, that they accept my diagnosis and they'll stick this through with me, and I still don't believe it? And then, when I don't believe it, I instantly feel like I'm hurting them with my distrust? wouldn't you be hurt, too, if several years of love still keeps getting questioned?

I am an adult, I have 2 kids, a homestead and livestock, a job and a degree I've been /slowly/ trying to finish, I can't keep behaving this way. But I still do. And I am so angry at myself. So angry that I have dark thoughts about self harm today. That I know are completely ridiculously unreasonably inappropriate and I should not do that. Somehow being able to label what I'm feeling makes me feel worse, because now I'm more aware of how ridiculous I'm being. ""I don't have time to be feeling this or fighting this. Spring is coming and I have so much work to do to prepare for and then go through the growing season, and I'm several weeks behind on my coursework."" That's what I tell myself to try to snap myself back to reality. It never works.

As I've gotten older I've noticed little moments of hallucinations just out of the corner of my eye, more lately than when I was in high school. I think back then I almost never had anything like that happening. Maybe just once or twice, fleeting. Nowadays its a weekly thing. Noises, like the kids crying and wailing after they've gone to bed, or visuals, like 'shadow people' at the top of the stairs or in my workplace as someone walking past. Yesterday I swore I saw a kid in a jacket run past the living room window. My partner went outside in the snow to check, and told me it must've been a turkey or some other animal. Last week I dropped a tool on another mechanics foot because I thought something stared back at me from behind some barrels. Good thing they were wearing steel toe. Is increased hallucinations a side effect from lamictal? My doctor doesn't think so, but I can't help but feel its more than a coincidence. I feel like a paranoid tin-foil-hat kind of person more often now.

6 months ago I re-started treatment after yet another suicide attempt and instant regret about how a parent should never behave that way. I wanted to take as little medication as I can get away with (less medicine=less side effects?). I don't want to be on multiple things and/or high dosages. I barely want to have to be on anything at all. But my love for our children and my spouse trumps that last sentence. Should I ask for a higher dose? Should I take the doctors offer on adding an anxiety medication? At the last appointment the doctor mentioned that the hallucinations might be anxiety based, since a lot of it involves worrying about the kids safety or the presence of strangers (I am not a people person). besides that, I am constantly terrified of how my behavior affects my family.  I had this conversation with my spouse last week. They said they're happy with how the medication has helped, that it has made a difference (I don't think so, I still feel like a terrible spouse and parent), and that they don't need me to take a higher dose. Like the joke about the woman at the 'husband store' asking for better, and better, and better, until in the end you lose the entire thing and can't go back. That was their analogy.

There is one bright spot to this post. Rabbits have a surprisingly good grasp on reality. I knew dogs could sometimes tell and be helpful, but I never thought a rabbit could. My daughter's rabbit picked me as his person. He reliably and consistently wakes me up from nightmares, and tries to get my attention when I'm hallucinating or having an outburst or cowering in another room with terrible thoughts. Whether he climbs my leg or jumps in my lap or licks my face or brings me some of his hay. In return I spoil him by keeping stock of every single kind of hay available for purchase and having a hay rack at each litter box in every room with said hay varieties, and every flower, herb, veggie, or fruit a rabbit could ever want, and chew toys in every room in weird locations as 'hide and seek' games for him to enjoy while I'm at work. How the hell can a tiny, domesticated pet rabbit tell when a human is having a nightmare or suicidal thoughts or seeing things that aren't there?

The rabbit interrupted me this morning from harming myself, so I included a piece of thawed mango in his lunch salad. 

&#x200B;

TLDR; still haven't fully accepted this illness being permanent and mostly out of my control. Still wish I had something curable. Still feel immense shame about the thoughts and behaviors I can't control. Might harm myself out of shame. Then also feel ashamed about that too. Thanks for reading.

I *plan* on using THE VIRTUAL BRAIN, and similar neurocomputational software to help me study what I plan on studying.

Well, I have to first get hardware( a computer/laptop that isn't slow) capable of importing data from said super computer, and running TVB on its servers.

I also have to gather some relevant patient MRI/ EEG  data, and lastly, I have to learn to effectively use TVB, and generate computational models.


This is a HUGE opportunity, and an even bigger one for a 19 year old layman(for the most part, but I'm a neuro nerd for sure).

Well, I also have college coming up in a few months.

So I have to learn all this stuff before college starts.

I've been about 4-5 months on Paxil, it worked for anxiety, but it killed my libido and motivation. My doc prescribed me Cymbalta (I asked about this drug, because I didn't try it). I'm on Lamotrigine 100 by the way.
So it's about 6 day of Cymbalta 30 mg. I was scared about nausea/GI issues, but thankfully I hadn't it yet. But I have heavy mood swings. 3 days ago I've been talking with my teacher and started to cry in front of him. 2 days ago I've fallen in full blown hysterics: I've been crying very hard, blaming myself and had self harm thoughts. I feel irritated too.

Sometimes it's just a spiraling depression and no ""boost"" in mood, but always agitation/irritability.

I'm typically pretty reserved but I do occasionally get very confident and drop my socially anxious ""mask"". 
For example, I introduced myself to a group chat of strangers that I'm hoping to meet up with soon by telling a self deprecating joke. Normally I'd never actually tell a joke unless feeling an extra boost of confidence and optimism in life. Is this a form of hypomania? 

Does hypomania include a mix of the following?:

-racing thoughts
-ruminating and anxiety filled thoughts -insomnia (although still very tired)

as expected, my sleep got worse but i started being able to function again. a few days ago, i actually quit the lithium as i was starting to plan my suicide and the adderall clearly hadn't helped with the suicidality at all. so back to the drawing board on fixing the depression issue. my psych said i could try the adderall alone to see what it does, with the stipulation that i quit immediately or resume the lithium if it starts making me manic. i figured it was worth at least seeing how it worked without the lithium so i'd have an idea of it for future med combos. 

and i immediately started getting 8+ hours of sleep a night again. which seems to suggest it was either something about the combo, or about the \*lithium\* that was making me lose sleep. obviously i am still mood tracking, but the whole situation seems very odd. the two meds seem to be interacting with me in ways they really should not. adderall is helping me feel more relaxed and get more sleep, where lithium made me more suicidal and restless. i've had lithium before in the past--it always makes me violently suicidal, which people have told me is the opposite of what it should be doing. and now i get adderall making me sleep more, which again seems like the opposite of what should be happening. i discontinued lithium and went from 5-6 hours of sleep per night to wanting to sleep for 10 hours like. IMMEDIATELY. with just adderall.

i can't possibly have \*only\* ADHD, since i've had psychosis in the past both in reaction to antidepressants and independently of them. my mania tracks too well with symptoms of mania to be a mistaken symptom. but now i'm wondering if a comorbidity of ADHD could mean that meds are reacting very oddly with me. i am overall med-sensitive, as well, but i would figure that would make meds react too strongly, rather than the opposite action of what they're supposed to do.

so i'm kind of at a loss. i'm going to give the adderall a few more days to see if it's just a fluke, or if i'm resting better bc the suicidal urges have gone, but i'll be definitely reaching out to talk to my psych about this because we both expected that discontinuing the lithium would mean having to quit the adderall due to stimulant-induced mania. this seems really weird.

I'm diagnosed Bp 1 w/ psychotic fx, but the mania and psychosis hasn't been a problem at all for years, save for one brief mixed episode due to med adjustments. I've just been stuck in this depressive pit that doesn't cease for what seems like two years now, no remission of symptoms or breaks in between, it's like I'm just constantly depressed without any more cycling. I do nothing but cry in bed all day unable to do anything, and I've had three very serious attempts in the past year and a half. Dunno how tf I'm supposed to consistently engage in therapy when I can barely manage to eat every day or not cry, it seems I just wake up wanting to die without any situations/circumstances or irrational cognitions that I need to correct, like it just seems so chemical.

The only time I've had stability since diagnosis was on Symbyax, which lasted about a year, but I couldn't believe how magical it felt to finally be myself again. But it suddenly pooped out and I went straight back to the depression without any warning, and re-introducing it two future times to 15mg/80mg did nothing.  Lamictal 300mg didn't help, Seroquel XR 400mg didn't help, Vraylar 4.5mg didn't help and gave me horrible akathisia, Lithium fucked my thyroid and gave me horrible acne which worsened my BDD, and Latuda 40mg actually seemed to help but the akathisia+sense of panic it gave me at night was so horrible I couldn't whiteknuckle through it anymore (I gave it about a month but I was banging my head and running around screaming). 20mg had tolerable akathisia but absolutely no effect on me. And Caplyta is $900 for 15 days with Medicaid. I just feel absolutely fucked. But ofc there's a million fucking anti-manic meds produced, and while the Depakote keeps that in check for me how tf is it that a condition where the majority of patients spend more time depressed than manic only have like 5 bipolar depression meds developed? Are we merely an inconvenience, a rabid genetic deformity that needs to be put down with anti-manics to keep us from getting too high to cause trouble for the normal ppl? Meanwhile if we wanna kill ourselves we can go fuck right off, it's our problem?

I'm thinking of retrying some of my old shit and just whiteknuckling through side effects (even the Lithium acne if I can get my OCD/BDD in check through ERP therapy), but if that doesn't work it seems all I got left is going back to ECT, or trying TMS and esketamine.

I don't want to be on either of them. I take them intermittently because the side effects of lamotrigine fuck me up (stutter is back!). My dose is also very small - 25mg, meant to be twice a day but I forget so tend to just take it once.  I never tapered up, as I moved doctors and then they just seemingly never gave me the right information. When I asked about it, I got told to keep doing what I was doing. I said I was on a very low dose and they just ignored it. I also went off the sertraline because I grind my teeth on it and my dentist said I need to stop doing it, plus I am not depressed.

I'm effectively unmedicated. Thing is, my doctor doesn't know about this because well, I can't tell them. I don't have a psychiatrist and I only see a GP once a year who weighs me, tells me to lose a stone, and tells me to cope with side effects. Not seen a psychiatrist since 2017 (not for want of trying). I had a medication review and I said I hated the side effects but was told to just deal with it, which wasn't useful. I would like to discuss this with a doctor but it's very hard to get appointments.

I suppose: how can I tell my GP I'm unmedicated? They don't seem to actually care about my health. I know I can taper myself up on lamotrigine slowly and carefully, but I don't want to (lol) because I hate it so much. I cannot think of words. I stutter. My brain is slow. I feel stupid and stulted.

Wondering if I even need medication at all? I've been doing this for about 3 years and only had one hypomanic episode and it was fine once I took some of my old quetiapine. I haven't been on quetiapine for about 5 years but I hung onto it to take it PRN if my mood lurches. I know this isn't sensible, really. But the doctors won't listen to me. I am trying.

Edit: I tried to make the point to them, that even my FULL prescribed dose is not therapeutic, and they said ‚Äúthe prescribing doctor told you what to do‚Äù. I said well, I was manic, and that was several years ago, so can it be reassessed? Because I obviously never titrated up to a therapeutic dose! And now I don‚Äôt know how to. 

And they said no lol

I found out 3 years in too that lamotrigine can make the contraceptive pill less effective and nobody told me. Luckily I didn‚Äôt get pregnant but only found out when a pharmacist asked me if I was aware of the side effect! And no I was not!",1676983120.0

Yet the moment so-called healthy people are facing legal troubles all of a sudden they have Bipolar 1 or 2 and need care.

I am so fed up with society raiding the mental health services for terms and resources when they want them, to be misused and misinterpreted to win an argument or worse snidely using"" You need therapy!""  as a trump card or misdirection, while those of us living with them are always scrambling for insurance and the right care!

I've been dealing with Bi-polar disorder since I was a teenager, and I am perpetually angry over how terms and skills specifically designed for treatment and therapy for mental health  are taken out of context by others to win arguments!

This is why no one is willing  to Go To Therapy, not to heal themselves, or save a relationship or face trauma because society has wrenched therapy from its actual tenants and purpose.

What Therapy is Not:

A place to win arguments.

A system designed for you to abuse or misuse another person for being mentally ill.

Using a persons' health issue as a stepping stone.

People will not engage in therapy with another person if they believe they will not get a fair evaluation or honest feedback.

Also, no ethical therapist can evaluate and diagnosis  any person with a medical disorder or condition If They Have Never  Ever Met, the person and treated them professionally either in private practice or group therapy or know them personally.

&#x200B;

If you've read books and studies or articles on mental illness it does not mean you are now qualified to diagnosis other people with medical skill and acuity even if you are convinced  someone else has a disorder, because of how they act,  that does not mean they have it.

I have had a lot of people bring up the idea of Big Pharma when having discussions about medication for mental illness.

I‚Äôve recently been diagnosed with bipolar and psychosis and started taking Abilify 3-4 weeks ago. I felt restlessness but thought it was nothing, but suddenly out of nowhere about four to five days ago my heart started racing out of nowhere, and I had horrible horrible anxiety. I feel now that I can‚Äôt even trust myself driving, and I‚Äôve never felt like this before. But then I get behind the wheel and do fine, but the mere thought of it drives me insane. Also my cat has gotten out of dental surgery, and he‚Äôs on a different schedule, and needs to stay in my room/ under my supervision all the time, so that‚Äôs also driving me up a wall.  My heart races all the time and I wake up at three am every day. I only am able to get to sleep cause of melatonin and cbd. I quit weed because it was giving me panic attacks. I think my psych put me on the wrong med. I called her about it and she told me to stop. So I went 5 mg one day 2.5 the next and today is 0.

I still feel rather wired today, but I'm wondering if I can bring myself down if I can manage to get a full night's sleep every night. 

It's impossible to get into my psychiatrist right now (I went hypo earlier this year and was put on a cancellation list at the beginning of September and have yet to receive a call), but last time I went hypo my doctor adjusted my medications and it brought me down to earth. I'm wondering if I should call my doctor again, but I'd really like to try to bring myself down. Is that even possible?

744,Fitness and weight loss through video games. Plus reviews,1,117i193,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/117i193/fitness_and_weight_loss_through_video_games_plus/,2,"I'm back playing my video games to lose weight. I managed to lose it all before but I gained it all back and more. Its so hard with the meds, depression and so much junk food around with the holidays.

Anyway I'm back using Ringfit Adventure and Knockout Home Fitness on switch to lose the weight and get fitter, along with dieting of course.

Video games are the only way I can exercise because they're really engaging and give you much more motivation than if you're trying to do it all by yourself and cant afford a gym membership. I found I lost a lot of weight and really got in shape the first time round when I stuck with it for a good few months

I'll do a quick review of each in case anyone else is interested and I find these games to be great motivators for weight loss

Ringfit Adventure (Nintendo Switch): This is my number one favourite ever, it includes a leg strap and a resistance ring thing (idk what they're called) that you will use for a lot of the workouts. Its very accessible, it takes your weight and age into account and recommends a difficulty for you and you can set it to easier or harder with a very large range of difficulty from 1-28 I believe and it has assistance modes for if you have trouble with your joints and a silent running mode which is also useful for some people with difficulties. It covers all aspects of fitness from aerobic, balance, muscle training etc. It can be a really tough workout or you can set it to be a nice workout. My mom, husband and myself all play it and think its really great. Also forgot to mention the gameplay is like playing and rpg but using your body and exercise to beat the monsters. 




Knockout Home Fitness (Switch) : I really like this one, you have a personal trainer that gives you a different routine daily and then there's the 3 minute workouts. It's a mix of boxing, kickboxing and fighting workouts but of course you are hitting and kicking the air. I find it to be fun and it's like a nice quick session you can do daily. The trainer is very motivating and positive unlike other fitness games (which I will mention next). For this game though you really need coordination with your body and to be able to keep up and follow the actions which I find to be really hard sometimes with my brain and I have difficulty in general with direction and order of things and choreography type things but I still try to do it and get a workout done. I like it but I can see people getting frustrated with it if they have difficulty keeping up with it but the motivational and positive trainer does help. I think it's great as a quick workout since so far the personal training sessions I've had on it have been 12 minutes long and burning approximately 70 calories which isn't that bad at all and paired with some 3 minute workouts is really great 


Fitness boxing 2 (switch): I believe this is made by the same people that made knockout home fitness but the vibe is different. I only played the demo for it but I didn't like it at all. I didn't like it even though it is almost the same as knockout home fitness because I swear the feedback is so negative when you are struggling when knockout is so positive and encouraging. It really shows how a negative vs positive feedback effects your motivation, just like how we use positive reinforcement with children and animals. It has a demo so that's good if anyone would like to try it


Beatsaber (meta quest, PlayStation vr, pc, etc):  I thought I'd throw this one in as a little mention since I have tried it for moving my body and getting fit. I find it's really good for getting your body moving if you move your whole body while playing and dancing to the music and not mostly flicking your wrist. If you want a bit of workout from it you'd want to play on expert difficulty. Anyway I think it's a good game to get your body moving especially if you might be a bit out of shape and own a vr device. I still have yet to try any of the fitness games on vr since a lot of them require a subscription and I don't like the amount of heat the headset puts on my face and the weight of it.

Well that's my review, I hope it helps people. I will try more like just dance and I'll see what else I can try. If you mention a game on switch I could try it and review it next time since I have access to a lot of switch games. The next one I'm going to try is Let's get Fit on switch",1676921264.0

It was a long drawn-out definition of OLD (obsessive love disorder) sent to me in text format from another number. Just the definitions were sent and nothing else. My instinct is telling me I know who is sending me these messages, but I‚Äôm trying to be graceful about it, and I‚Äôm trying to not let it affect me.

I am looking to get an assessment soon for what I‚Äôm sure is Bipolar disorder. I am curious of what others went through that made them realize they are bipolar.

some back story, I (20f) have just celebrated sobriety for a year on November 17th. I had to quit because I went through what I feel was a manic-psychotic episode. I was hallucinating, hyper sexual, had persecutory delusions. Leading up to this I went through a breakup. I have not been diagnosed but looking back on my behaviour from age 17-18 I suspect something was wrong. I feel as though I had these episodes more than once. I also have major depression. In my last year of high school I would sleep at school for days and just not move this would last for a few months. 

~At one point I wanted to start an only fans and do porn/become hyper sexual (I am self admittedly a prude and this is out of character for how I feel about sec)
~constantly breakup with my ex-boyfriend and have explosive episodes of anger at him. 
~become paranoid and thought friends were plotting against me
~hallucinated
~I thought I was just the most gorgeous thing and took all these photos- looking back the photos are literally just normal photos I don‚Äôt look as good as I felt. 
~at one point thought my dad did something horrible to me (he did not)
~convinced myself I was a sociopath and that my friends would find out and leave
~had tones of spiritual based delusions and thought I was psychic and just knew things.

During those 3 years I was addicted to pot, I also can report every-time I did psychedelics I went into some psychotic mania, I thought I knew the answers to the universe and would just get super weird. After not smoking and getting on meds I have been stable (for the year).

And it always splits,

But I hate myself just as much,

So I‚Äôm left cycling with these thoughts,

I am more than sure I‚Äôd qualify for having bipolar. I think therapist recommendations suffice, but if not, I‚Äôm sure my psychiatrist could confirm my condition as I‚Äôve been with her a while & she‚Äôs seen manic episodes, depressive episodes,
etc.

My question is. I have a friend with a chronic illness who is allotted one day off a week when she needs to use it (not sure the limit on how many days per year - not concerned) very rarely do I need extended leaves. I manage well enough even in manic / depressive episodes but sometimes all it takes is one day of being over tired / overworked to send me over the edge & it would be a tremendous help to have that option if I need it. 

So my question is. I see a lot of talk here about extended leaves or manic episodes and such. Does anyone have a FMLA set up that‚Äôs more in line with what I‚Äôm talking about?

I have a great half-time job that I've been at 1.5 years. When I first started, my boss wanted to pay me under the table for the first three months to make sure I was a good fit before adding me to payroll. However, I barely survive living paycheck to paycheck and that extra $100-$200 in taxes is actually needed to make sure my bills are paid so I have asked him to keep me under the table and he has no problem with that. He sends me some kind of legal form each year that I'm supposed to use once I file my taxes.

Anyway - there is a medical/dental/behavioral clinic and pharmacy here that goes on a sliding scale for patients with no health insurance. I just started using them about 5 months ago and I have been telling them I'm unemployed so I can be on the sliding scale where my 6 monthly medications are around $70 instead of $300 and doctor appointments are only $25. I know this is not right and I always feel really bad about it and I've been thinking about showing them the document my boss sends me each year to prove my wages but I'm so scared I won't be able to afford my medications or counseling appointments.

Here's my pickle: The main thing I want/need counseling/therapy for is my fucking boss (yes it's an online company and I work from home and have never met him but holy fuck lol).

Hi! I suspect I might have atypical bipolar although I've been diagnosed with GAD, panic disorder and agitated depression. My psychiatrist seems to think that I don't meet the criteria of true hypomania because I'm ""self-aware"" when these episodes happen.

What I experience (usually triggered by stress or overstimulation):

- Extreme anxiety with panic attacks 
- High energy with constant adrenaline 
- High productivity
- Insomnia
- Racing thoughts 
- Feelings of distress and like I'm ""losing it""
- Burning sensations in my skin (arms, legs and back)
- Metallic taste in my mouth


When this happens, I know it's not ""normal"" to feel this way; I absolutely hate it and I'm desperate for sleep (so I rely on benzodiazepines and sleeping tablets until it resolves). I don't feel a decreased _desire_ for sleep, but my body really fights to keep me awake. If these episodes last longer than two weeks, I completely unravel into a crying mess. I've had to take time off work many times over the last few years because of these ""burnouts"".

I have also experienced the ""euphoric"" version of this before (but less commonly). Same symptoms as above except (initially) with excitement, pressured speech and mild grandiosity (saying things like ""I'm solving all of my company's problems!""), but this always devolves into the dysphoric and depressed version eventually.  

I've been struggling with this for 8 years, swinging between agitated depression as my baseline with these ""burnouts"" in between (minimum once a year; maximum four times a year, depending on stress levels).

I've been taking the maximum dosage of Sertraline (SSRI) for about eight months, and while it's helped a lot with the depression aspect, the above episodes still happen to me. When I started taking it, I had an extreme episode lasting about five weeks until the medication settled (I survived on clonazepam to get me through).

My question is: Do any of you relate to what I've described above (as potential dysphoric hypomania)? And were you misdiagnosed with things like GAD before the atypical bipolar was identified?

Currently taking:
1. Lamotrigine - for BP II
2. Testosterone cypionate - to treat low hormone levels as a result of a pituitary tumor, but sometimes wish I didn't need this 
3. Alvesco - steroid asthma inhaler
4. (New) Lyrica - as an alcohol alternative for social situations only, as I've always struggled with alcohol use so it's sort the lesser of evils here
5. Ketamine treatment - may stop after winter
6. Cialis (as needed, which is rare now) for ED
7. Levalbuterol (as needed) - asthma rescue inhaler

And a few supplements:
1. Vitamin D3 - I live in the northeast, enough said lol
2. Magnesium citrate - has helped dramatically with anxiety
3. Iron - trouble keeping levels up in recent years

Last year I had an casual relationship with this guy, both of us wanted casual and he was respectful, nice to talk and the sex was great. So after months he ghosted me and when I asked why, the answer was that I had gained weight and he wasn't attracted anymore. I actually accept that and he has the right to kick me for the reason he wants, no one has the obligation, even the motivation being really ridiculous. 
The problem is that after sometime and I couldn't stop thinking about him, everyday a lot of times for no apparent reason, I started to dream with him a lot and sometimes I just have the urge to stalk him... Yesterday I had this urge and I was trying to find him on Reddit, but it is a impossible mission without the nickname and I was searching for topics he would interact and of course I couldn't find him, so I had another dream with him and when I wake up I just felt so fucked up, because when I enter in the obsessed mode I don't know how to stop and it continues for days thinking just about him... I don't want nothing with him, don't want to talk to him, don't want to date or whatever and I don't care if him would want anything that I know he doesn't because he said that.

It‚Äôs gone in my favor so far for the most part but that all changed around this time last year.

Last year, I was in a great company where I was a junior analyst but I kept getting more and more opportunities for my personality, ideas and people that believed in me. All of the sudden, it all got to my head when my boss two levels above started doing things that took the limelight away and started talking condescendingly to me saying I‚Äôm just getting started. 

This felt like a personal battle and I went into full destruction mode where I was saying the weirdest shit to my senior leadership team (some very important people) and also sent emails to the CEO and CFO. Mind you these people have their own wikipedias. 

In my head, I thought I would get rewarded for the courage but slowly everyone in the company started distancing themselves from me. I mean everyone. It was almost like I went from a rising star to delusional. 

That made me look for another job which I did end up getting and am still doing well for myself but all this made me cringe and regret everything I did and extremely sad at my downfall at the previous company.

I slipped in my sobriety and was slightly experimenting to see if I could have alcohol. I was sober for 7 months and thought I‚Äôd be okay to have a couple of drinks out to dinner. It of course increased over a two month time span to having a couple of glasses of wine or drinks a night, until last Friday was my planned last day of drinking. (I could tell my slippery slope was in full swing). It was my grandfathers funeral and I let myself get really drunk. The next day was horrible. I was sick and depressed and the anxiety was awful. Same thing the day after and the day after. I pulled it together yesterday and today with getting back to my routine and exercise. I felt semi better. But, not today, I am snapping at everything, I‚Äôm acting like I have in my hypomania moments, yelling, vicious, slamming doors, throwing things. I am EXHAUSTED. It was hard to fall asleep last night. But, I‚Äôm literally already in bed today at 8pm. So i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just the alcohol withdrawal? Or is it also creeping into hypomania? Can that happen when withdrawing from alcohol? 

I‚Äôm also semi glad I had a slip up because I realized I can‚Äôt just casually drink and I realized how awful it feels to come off a substance again. I quit weed in September and went into a mixed episode a week or so later. 

I‚Äôm very glad to be on the sober train again. But, I am not loving how I‚Äôm feeling now. Anyone been here? Thanks.",1676596642.0
870,"request for tips, and a bit of my history...",2,1140xsh,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1140xsh/request_for_tips_and_a_bit_of_my_history/,1,"Some background on me: my father is diagnosed bipolar, sibling too. I had difficulties all through childhood and into college, ended up dropping out because of them, but found my footing in a good job. I had my first diagnosed episode in 2006 in my early 30s but had been in therapy for a couple of years by then. Classic case of a shrink prescribing Paxil and having a weird reaction (started crying and couldn't stop once I got up to therapeutic dose). Doc had me quit cold turkey and I became manic and completely unable to function. Had to use all my vacation time to take two weeks off from work to come back to earth and when I did my brain was permanently changed. 

I had been in a management position and was due for a promotion with lots of extra duties and travel, but I was barely able to respond timely and coherently to email. I had always been a little shy, but suddenly I was having full-blown panic attacks every single day. Got demoted but stayed with the company because I had been so good at my job before, but I wasn't functioning well. More and more duties were removed from my plate until it didn't make fiscal sense to keep me on (the great contraction of 2007-8) so I was let go. Very reluctantly and with a lot of grief I got on disability. I briefly tried to return to work 9 months later, in a lower-level role in the same industry which turned out to demand much more quick decision making and physical activity than my previous position, and ended up sexually harrassed and overworked and extremely suicidal. I was on a cocktail of the usual meds, which made me very situationally fuzzy. I was stalked and almost mugged a couple of times, which never would have happened before. Embarrassingly I was let go again. 

What followed were a series of therapists and psychiatrists and medications, and many hospitalizations and stints in outpatient programs. I just seemed to get worse and worse. My trauma issues from childhood frequently went untreated because I was told my mood swings were the problem. Meanwhile I became suicidal and borderline psychotic every year like clockwork. That pattern only stopped when I got my most recent p-doc. He listened to me when I expressed concern that the meds I was on were making me worse and agreed to help me get off them and start over from scratch. When we started doing that my hospitalizations became less frequent until they stopped altogether, though I did go to outpatient clinics on and off.

We worked together for about 8 years, until he retired in 2021. At the time of his leaving (yes, it felt like being left because he was the only so-called professional who had a long-term, good relationship with me) I was in a holding pattern, just taking Wellbutrin, Ativan and Ambien with Seroquel as needed (all in tiny amounts that they don't even produce pills for), but I had to quit when my scripts ran out. My primary care physician refused to touch them, and seemed offended that I asked. 

Because of how disability insurance has changed and because so many old school p-docs retired during Covid there are no private practice p-docs who will take my insurance. I was told to contact one of what used to be an emergency med clinic, where you used to go if you lost your pill bottle and needed something until your next scheduled prescription or your doc was unavailable and you needed a quick consultation or you were in crisis. Now they have become who people on disability are to go to. They don't even see people in person, just ask your history and run you through a questionnaire. 

I did call last year and start the ball rolling but when I started to ask questions about being able to choose which meds I was willing to take the doc assigned to me seemed confused and slightly exasperated (I'm not sure because it was all over the phone). I understandably have reservations about taking the wrong meds and ending up all messed up. I have major trust issues and decided to go no further with the clinic.

I am completely isolated at this point, life and friendships passed me by while I was struggling to just live, so if I started to become psychotic there isn't anyone to turn to or to catch me if I fall. I MUST remain in control of my faculties, I cannot afford the hunt-and-peck method of medicating. These days it is extremely easy to lose your apartment and become homeless or simply to get a reputation for being too weird and becoming an outcast... which has already happened because of how stressed out the pandemic made me. I don't even look like myself. 

I'm becoming desperate these days. My therapist (the only doctorate/phd who takes my insurance) is a joke (sorry, but she is. She's ""watched"" me deteriorate for three years and has nothing but her prepared scripts to say... watched in quotations because she hasn't seen my face since the pandemic started). I just got out of a bad involvement with someone who I was hoping she would help me manage, but she does not have any training or knowledge about ptsd or trauma, and I'm afraid that the stress of that whole ordeal physically hurt my brain. I've been afraid to see a doctor about my weird lopsidedness because I don't think I could stand another dismissal of ""maybe you're just depressed"".

I am currently at the end of my rope. I have a couple of choices: call the clinic again and take my chances, or stay on my own and pray for the fortitude to cobble together a management style on my own. Actually, in order to be present enough to navigate the system to be a good advocate for myself and even find the kind of support I need I need to make myself stable on my own. 

Huge ask: what non-med tools do you use to manage your head, what resources have you used to understand what you are going through, and how do you keep your head up?

I'm a Brazilian 42 yo man (he/him and been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder type II at 14. Also was diagnosed with Absence Complex Focal Seizures Epilepsy at 8/9.

About a coupe of years ago, 2018/2019 my diagnostic changed to Cyclothymic Disorder because of my very large bipolar cycle. I clocks at 8 years total, 4 hypomanic and 4 depressive.

Although Cyclothymic Disorder is seen like a minor version of Bipolar Disorder I don't feel like that at all.

I'm hypo now, my depressive cycle ended 2020 after starting in 2016. That was the worst. I lost everything work, M.A. Degree, Friends. And ended institucionalized for 3 months after a suicidal attempt. It was like waking up on a crater with all my life in shambles around me.

To get I worse I got a new diagnosis adding to previous one (Cyclothymic and Epilepsy), Dissociative Amnesia and Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder. Seems like my brain I a wreck, a runaway train.

After that I changed from my academic career to bread baker. Made a lot of courses last year, but now I'm feeling void, longing for a life already destroyed and hearing the clock ticking and counting down time for the next shift (2024).

I'm feeling hopeless and everything seen pointless. I tried to make plans and make time counts, but I know the cycle keeps running and the crippling depression will get me away.

I don't know what to do and some times even if I want do do something. What's the point?
I don't even remember some parts of my life and I question myself because of it and the symbiotic process that I have between every disorder.

Cyclothymic Disorder doesn't feel minor to me. At least with the boosts from all the other disorders I have.

Hello beautiful people. 

First thing I saw when I got up this morning was a message in the mod inbox asking why /r/bipolar was closed. I ventured over there and, sure enough, the subreddit has been set to private.

A comment on a thread on this subreddit indicated that the mod team is working on an internal issue to the sub, but that's all we know. We were not informed of the closing and we have no knowledge of when it might open back up.

For the time being: If you're here for the first time, welcome. Please read the rules and engage respectfully with the community, use the report button or modmail as necessary, and we'll be here to support you.

*Please keep all discussion of /r/bipolar's closing to this thread, to avoid flooding the subreddit. I will be removing other threads relevant to this issue to consolidate discussion.*

Again, we have no knowledge of what caused the closure, but we are here to support you until it reopens, and further on if you choose to stay.

EDIT: A statement has been released by one of the /r/bipolar mods:

""We absolutely hate having to take these actions of privatizing the sub but, it was, unfortunately, necessary as a result of a brigade attempt.

Seroquel makes me binge so many calories before bed and I feel so guilty and horrible.

The whole world feels ""discovered"" to me. I find myself obsessing over the meaning or lack thereof of everything. I am needing to rebuild my whole conception of reality because my brain essentially threw everything in the trash.

But what remains an ongoing mystery to me is my own disorder. I don't even know for sure if it's bipolar or schizoaffective. None of the doctors do. There is no objective way for them to test me, and I don't want to pay for another analysis. I could have a fatal disease of any kind, completely undiscovered. I'm deeply frightened by the unknown.

I'm a hypochondriac AND have bipolar, among other things. I am horrified by the medication side effects or the possibility of more severe effects. I worry about dying every day, or having a severe crash as a result of the medications. I'm also afraid of bipolar itself. The mysteries of mania. The fact that we know so little, and many of the treatments for me are so ineffective.

Every time my muscles twitch or my back hurts I'm afraid that there isn't enough blood flow there, or there's some hidden disease destroying me slowly.

I'm just riddled with fear. Chronic, constant fear. I want to feel secure but I can't be. Both because my mind and the outside world seem so volatile. The only thing that feels safe is sleep or death, and only one version of death, the one where everything stops and I never exist again. That is comforting.

I‚Äôve recently had a week long depressive episode, the lowest and longest in a while (my mood has been up and down for a while, normally 4-7 days relatively functional, then the same severely depressed). I‚Äôve realised that I can‚Äôt really remember much of the week. My memory is patchy, and I don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôs the fact I‚Äôm sleeping so much or something else. But in recent years I‚Äôve remembered less and less of each of my depressive episodes. 

This is the same for panic attacks, however. My last major panic attack I had a huge breakdown and cried for hours after. I had a huge rant too, mostly emotional nonsense about my situation, and after coming out of it, I can‚Äôt remember almost anything I said. I roughly remember who was there, but don‚Äôt know at what points some people showed up, and I only have vague memories of what I spoke about. To the point where I had to ask people if I‚Äôd been rude and what I‚Äôd said because I genuinely couldn‚Äôt remember if in my emotional nonsense if I had offended anyone (someone insinuated I did but I don‚Äôt remember it). 

I see a lot about memory and concentration issues with depression, and I certainly relate, but I haven‚Äôt seen anyone really talk about weeks or months being patchy, or only having vague senses of what I said or did during a panic attack.

It was all very lame, lots of suicide ideation and a few self harm relapses.

Did very poorly in my online college classes and had to take a break, which may lead to dropping out. 

I have no actual dating experience and not much sexual experience, and the day after Halloween, my first/only Friend With Benefits told me he had just started seeing someone and broke it off with me. So on top of my health, bipolar and money issues, I'm also feeling heartbreak for the first time, like a goddamn emo teenager.  

Relationship with my parents have been rocky because I've been so depressed and irratible, and they have their own stuff going on.

So, now here I am, Valentine's Day. I've figured out a medication problem that has now made my mental health marginally better...less SI and Intrusive thoughts....but pretty much everything is shitty.

I'm aware this is all very Woe Is Me, but if I can't be depressed when I'm sick on the worst holiday, when can I be? I'm tired of rolling around near rock bottom and waiting for things to get worse.

Nothing has worked for me, or the side effects have caused episodes of hypomania and/or depression, suicidal thoughts, etc.

I applied for a study in San Francisco to see how Psilocybin affects treatment resistant Bipolar 2. I've watched documentaries and read tons of articles about psychedelics being used to treat mental health problems, so I really thought this was possibly *the* answer. After not hearing back for months, I finally received the rejection (no reason given) and I spiralled.

I had the worst bout of depression I've ever had, felt suicidal all day every day, barely ate anything other than the minimum to make it through a day. I was in bed for weeks. I had panic attacks. It sucked. I'm still not quite out of it, I feel. I'm in a weird limbo in my head. 

I don't know why I put so much hope into the clinical trial being my saviour. I see that it was stupid, but I still believe that psychedelics are a potential answer to my problems that traditional treatment hasn't been able to solve. I've been thinking about taking it into my own hands, but I don't have the first idea of where to get a hold of this ""medicine"" so that's a non-starter.

961,Anger and Bipolar,3,1127vty,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1127vty/anger_and_bipolar/,4,"Do you guys ever get just so angry over the tiniest things? Even if you try not to/realize that the issue isn‚Äôt worth getting angry over? I‚Äôm talking that blood-boiling, heart-racing anger. 

It only happens to me sometimes. It‚Äôs not a typical characteristic of my personality. But evvvvery once in a while, I can‚Äôt seem to control how mad I get/what I get mad over and it‚Äôs incredibly difficult to calm down and think positive/happy thoughts. 

My mother was chronically explosive and angry when I was growing up, and abusive. She isn‚Äôt one to go get help so she was never diagnosed, but I do think she exhibited several traits of bipolar, herself. She‚Äôd suddenly get new expensive hobbies, had an affair, had bouts of impossible energy, and though she acted like depression doesn‚Äôt exist, she would get in what she called ‚Äúa funk.‚Äù 
And of course I was eventually diagnosed with bipolar. (She thought that was ridiculous, as she doesn‚Äôt particularly believe in mental illness - ‚Äúdepression is laziness,‚Äù ‚Äúmania/psychosis is just people making poor choices‚Äù) and I wasn‚Äôt incredibly shocked when I found out that it is often hereditary. 

So is this anger sometimes part of it? With my upbringing, I really try to avoid anger and use mindful thinking and techniques to de-escalate those negative emotions when I get them. But sometimes, man, it feels fucking impossible! Once I‚Äôm over the anger I feel so ashamed and like I failed. 
Or is this anger a nature vs. nurture thing? I was raised by anger and so now it‚Äôs in me whether I want to succumb to it or not? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è or perhaps it‚Äôs both.

I got into therapy a year before lockdown started.

during lockdown we switched from face to face therapy to digital. I wasn't crazy about it but thats how went.

I know she respects my opinion and such. when BLM protest was happening, I refused to partake. not that I don't support the movement but I was scared to be involved. we still didn't know how people could catch COVID. it was a different time really. I was also afraid of the people who were counter protesting it.

we had an argument about me not attending. she told me that it was a time to stand up to people. I was in therapy to stop arguing and fighting with people. it seemed so counter to what I was there for.

we had an argument and I told her that she cared more about being an activist than being a therapist.

we didn't talk for about a month. it was pretty upsetting since it was lockdown and I just didn't have anyone to talk to.

after some time she mailed me a gift (a coffee table book) and a letter saying she was sorry. we didn't really make up but I just had no one else to talk to so I started therapy back with her. 

I convinced my best friend to start therapy and she suggested she could be his therapist too.

after about ten months of talking to both of us, she out of no where told us both she could no longer be our therapist. it was very sudden. I was really hurting at that time too so it was very difficult. 

this was about a year ago. I reflect on it constantly. today I found the book she gifted me and threw it in the trash.

There are several reasons. One is that I spent nearly 2 hours with a social worker talking about my history of trauma and all of my issues, they gave me a preliminary diagnosis of PTSD, anxiety, depression. In my own research, CPTSD best encapsulates what I experience so I was like okay that makes sense to me. Then I was sent to see the psych who diagnosed me with Bipolar in minutes without taking a full history. Something just doesn‚Äôt feel right to me about that. I want a second opinion. 

Another reason is that I just don‚Äôt think my symptoms warrant a Bipolar diagnosis and I haven‚Äôt been able to really identify with anyone‚Äôs stories on here. If anything I resonate more with Cyclothymia than Bipolar 1 or 2.

I will admit I do experience a majority of the time what I believe to be a mixed state of hypomania and depression. I‚Äôll feel like I‚Äôm bubbling with energy, thoughts, ideas, etc. yet I‚Äôm stuck and have no motivation to do anything then it fluctuates daily. It‚Äôs like the pendulum that determines my emotional state swings from one end to the other really fast and so fast I experience both. If I do happen to be in one state for a longer time (several days), it‚Äôs the hypomanic state. It‚Äôs exhausting that I feel this way and which is why I sought treatment. 

My last psychiatrist explained to me that while I don‚Äôt meet the criteria to be diagnosed as Bipolar, she recognized I have a hyperactive component to my mood and prescribed to me Buspirone. She felt that an SSRI over time might increase the level of hyperactivity I experience and the Buspirone wouldn‚Äôt do that. That medication worked wonders for me and I was on the lowest dose possible. It felt like the first time in my life that I had agency over my mood swings like I could experience sadness without sinking into depression or any emotion and just move on after the emotion ran it‚Äôs course. 

I really liked my last psychiatrist and felt like she really listened to me so to hear this new psychiatrist give me a diagnosis so quickly and dismiss my fears about the medications he prescribed‚Ä¶ just feels shitty and I can‚Äôt trust him. 

I‚Äôm open to hearing others opinions on this. Am I in denial? Am I minimizing my own experiences? Is my new psychiatrist being an asshole? I don‚Äôt know.

This really killed all of the trust I had in him. But we were recently married, and I was determined to make it work. I even told him that he may never recover my trust and he should think carefully about whether he wants to be with someone who doesn't trust him. His answer really made me respect him a little less each day that passed. He said that it's not that big of a deal because it's not like he actually slept with any of those women. 

It all came to a breaking point today, when he said that I'm stuck in the past and that's why I can't move on. And I can't help but agree with him, but I also think about how I deserve to be with someone I can trust. And it's not just the lack of trust, but it's a lot of other things that I ignored because I really wanted this to work. This is really embarrassing for me, and TMI for some, but basically he seemed to be scared of touching me or giving me oral. The few times he has given me oral, he actually pauses to spit out in between licks. It's like he's grossed out but he swears he's not. I've had past partners that would treat me like I was the best thing they ever tasted and actually begged me to let them. So his way of doing things made me feel so bad about myself that I eventually asked him to not give me oral again because it was a hit to my ego each time he did that.

I probably seem like I'm rambling right now, but I guess the whole gist of this post is that I wasn't happy in a marriage where I didn't feel like I could trust my partner with my heart or my body. And now I'm wondering if I jumped the gun because of my disorder. I've been taking my meds for about 4 months now and each day that passes I feel like my eyes are opening more, but I don't like what I see.",1676271415.0
987,Just getting through tonight.,1,111ngj5,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/111ngj5/just_getting_through_tonight/,1,"Sorry for so many posts lately, just need to share.

I talk to my doctor at noon tomorrow.  Planning to leave for home in the morning, so I can get checked into the hospital as soon as possible.  Probably should have gone sooner, but the closest behavioral health unit is 4 1/2 hours away, so I might as well take the extra few hours and go home. Because I‚Äôm not letting the cops here drive me all the way to someplace I don‚Äôt know.

I completed the last of my steps for my plan yesterday, I feel like one more bad day and that‚Äôs the end. Planning on telling my doctor that, and telling her that I should have agreed to up my meds at our last appointment.  I hate to up meds before I know that I‚Äôm in an episode, but I‚Äôm learning that I need to adjust at the first sign that I may be slipping.  I know a healthy lifestyle helps, but it‚Äôs hard with work and school.  I know it‚Äôs possible, I had six whole months without an episode a couple years ago and it was amazing.

I don‚Äôt know how school is going to turn out with all of this.  Wishing I had picked a school closer to home and that my dad had let me transfer closer for this semester. I haven‚Äôt done homework in the last week, as all I can think about is my plan. I‚Äôve been to class, but it takes everything I have to focus and my mind still wonders to my plan.

Today I told my sister that I‚Äôm not doing well, and that I might be coming home in the next few days. I haven‚Äôt talked to my parents.  Other than sharing a few days ago that I was having some si. I don‚Äôt want them to worry about me, but at the same time I wish they knew how much I am struggling here.  And at the same time I don‚Äôt want them to know how bad I‚Äôve gotten.  That‚Äôs the part of me that wants to see me go all the way and end it, even though I know it‚Äôs possible to be stable, but it‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve been stable.

My tolerance for episodes is going down, which is good, means I ask for help for less severe symptoms.  But my endurance is also going down and I‚Äôm tired of fighting this.  Also my episodes seem to be progressing faster than they used to, or I‚Äôm just not try as hard anymore. Anyone else notice that happen to them?

I need to find a new therapist, one that doesn‚Äôt make me anxious about telling them the truth. I feel like I‚Äôve lied to my current therapist too much to go back and fix it. But there are not many therapist in this area and I hate tele-health for therapists.

Thank you for reading this. I hope everyone else is doing better.",1676330844.0

989,Soma for anxiety - how much of a stretch is this?,3,111ek5d,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/111ek5d/soma_for_anxiety_how_much_of_a_stretch_is_this/,2,"Two overlapping problems I struggle with - anxiety, and not drinking. While I've enjoyed a great 5 months of not drinking, and I seldom crave it or worry about it, I have explored options for both of these issues with my psych.

He and I have a very good relationship, he knows everything about me, and I'm extremely honest with him. In the past with regards to anxiety and drinking, he suggested a low dose benzo to hit both. Take one instead of drinking, when I want to go out with friends or whatever (not so much to treat panic attacks). I do horribly with benzos, so I passed, and we tried naltrexone instead. Unfortunately that just made me depressed, even if it allowed me to have 1-3 drinks and go home no problem. It was the day or so after that I'd get really really bleak. Plus even then, I don't totally trust even naltrexone to prevent me from caving totally versus having a few drinks once in a while. Not to mention the ill health effects of alcohol and how those offset positive goals in my life like fitness, working out, my career, healthy hobbies, etc.

I was just recently randomly curious about how muscle relaxers even work, and learned plenty including that Soma has anxiolytic and euphoric properties, while (allegedly) not being as addicting as benzos.

I'm considering bringing up the conversation again, as Soma to an alternative to drinking. For all I know it could also set me off into anger like benzos and some other GABAergic drugs, but at times I consider something like this as a lesser of evils. I've made strides over the years, but if history repeats again, eventually I crack under anxiety and have a drink (which then turns into a week long binge if not more).

If this is a totally terrible idea, I'm accepting of that. I'm not a kid just trying to get my rocks off on pharmaceuticals - just want to explore if this would be a ""lesser of evils"" solution. I'd rather someone say this is a horrible idea; I'm not trying to start a hot debate over trying to get high or something. I'm open to alternative ideas as well. But while my psych is even cool with me trying shrooms for depression on my own as long as I tell him, I don't want to jeopardize our relationship by sounded like I'm trying to be irrational with our progress or take advantage of his trust.

Unfortunately, specifically for a night out, pot or even microdoses of shrooms don't hit the spot, and I end up feeling very left out, cranky, and ultimately ruining an adult night out of dancing. Which I also work on in therapy to get a better long term resolution.

Thanks!

**tldr; basically looking for an alcohol alternative just for a night out every month or so (naltrexone didn't work for me), and my psych has been open to this in the past. Is Soma a bad idea, or has anyone else found something? Please assume this is ""lesser of evils"" to help avoid alcohol which is highly destructive to my life - not looking for something new to have fun with.**",1676308862.0
